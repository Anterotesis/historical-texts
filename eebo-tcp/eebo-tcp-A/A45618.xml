            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, SHERIFS, AND COMMON COUNCIL OF LONDON.</head>
                  <p>IT is not better known to you, moſt worthy Magiſtrats, that Government is the preſerving Cauſe of all Societys, than that every Society is in a languiſhing or flouriſhing condition, anſwerable to the particular Conſtitution of its Government: And if the Goodneſs of the Laws in any place be thus diſtinguiſhable by the Happineſs of the People, ſo the Wiſdom of the People is beſt diſcern'd by the Laws they have made, or by which they have choſen to be govern'd. The truth of theſe Obſervations is no where more conſpicuous than in the preſent State of that moſt Antient and Famous Society you have the honor to rule, and which reciprocally injoys the chearful influence of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. 'Tis ſolely to its Government that <hi>London</hi> ows being univerſally acknowleg'd the largeſt, fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, richeſt, and moſt populous City in the World; all which glorious Attributes could have no Foundation in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory or Nature, if it were not likewiſe the moſt free. 'Tis confeſt indeed that it derives infinit Advantages above other
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:49467:4"/>
places from its incomparable Situation, as being an inland City, ſeated in the middle of a Vale no leſs delicious than healthy, and on the Banks of a Noble River, in reſpect of which (if we regard how many ſcore miles it is navigable, the clearneſs and depth of its Channel, or its ſmooth and even Courſe) the <hi>Seine</hi> is but a Brook, and the celebrated <hi>Tyber</hi> it ſelf a Rivulet: Yet all this could never raiſe it to any conſiderable pitch without the ineſtimable Bleſſings of LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY, which has choſen her peculiar Reſidence, and more eminently fixt her Throne in this place. LIBERTY is the true Spring of its prodigious Trade and Commerce with all the known parts of the Univerſe, and is the original Planter of its many fruitful Colonys in <hi>America,</hi> with its numberleſs Factorys in <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa:</hi> hence it is that every Sea is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with our Ships, that the very Air is ſcarce exemted from our Inventions, and that all the Productions of Art or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are imported to this common Storehouſe of Mankind; or rather as if the whole Variety of things wherwith the Earth is ſtockt had bin principally deſign'd for our profit or delight, and no more of 'em allow'd to the reſt of Men, than what they muſt neceſſarily uſe as our Purveyors or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers. As LIBERTY has elevated the native Citizens of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to ſo high a degree of Riches and Politeneſs, that for their ſtately Houſes, fine Equipages, and ſumtuous Tables, they excede the Port of ſom Foren Princes; ſo is it naturally becom every Man's Country, and the happy Refuge of thoſe in all Nations, who prefer the ſecure injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life and Property to the glittering pomp and ſlavery, as well as to the arbitrary luſt and rapine of their ſeveral Tyrants. To the ſame Cauſe is owing the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Magnificence of the public Structures, as Palaces, Temples, Halls, Colleges, Hoſpitals, Schools, Courts of Judicature, and a great many others of all kinds, which, tho ſingly excel'd where the Wealth or State of any Town cannot reach further than one Building, yet, taking them all together, they are to be equal'd no where beſides. The delicat Country Seats, and the large Villages crouded on all hands around it, are manifeſt Indications how happily the Citizens live, and makes a Stranger apt to believe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the City before he approaches it by ſom miles. Nor is it to the felicity of the preſent times that <hi>London</hi> is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted: for in all Ages, and under all Changes, it ever ſhew'd a moſt paſſionat love of LIBERTY, which it has not
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:49467:4"/>
more bravely preſerv'd than wiſely manag'd, infuſing the ſame Genius into all quarters of the Land, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd from hence as the ſeveral parts of the Animal Body are duly ſupply'd with Blood and Nouriſhment from the Heart. Whenever therfore the execrable deſign was hatcht to inſlave the Inhabitants of this Country, the firſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temts were ſtill made on the Government of the City, as there alſo the ſtrongeſt and moſt ſuccesful Efforts were firſt us'd to reſtore Freedom: for we may remember (to name one inſtance for all) when the late King was fled, and every thing in confuſion, that then the chief Nobility and Gentry reſorted to <hi>Guildhall</hi> for protection, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert proper methods for ſettling the Nation hereafter on a Baſis of Liberty never to be ſhaken. But what greater Demonſtration can the World require concerning the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of our National Government, or the particular Power and Freedom of this City, than the BANK of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which, like the Temple of SATURN among the <hi>Romans,</hi> is eſteem'd ſo ſacred a Repoſitory, that even Foreners think their Treaſure more ſafely lodg'd there than with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at home; and this not only don by the Subjects of Abſolute Princes, where there can be no room for any Public Credit, but likewiſe by the Inhabitants of thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths where alone ſuch Banks were hitherto reputed ſecure. I am the more willing to make this Remark, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Conſtitution of our Bank is both preferable to that of all others, and coms the neareſt of any Government to HARRINGTON'S Model. In this reſpect a particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation is due to the City which produc'd ſuch Perſons to whoſe Wiſdom we ow ſo beneficial an Eſtabliſhment: and therfore from my own ſmall obſervation on Men or Things I fear not to propheſy, that, before the term of years be expir'd to which the Bank is now limited, the deſires of all people will gladly concur to have it render'd perpetual. Neither is it one of the laſt things on which you ought to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue your ſelves, moſt worthy Citizens, that there is ſcarce a way of honoring the Deity known any where, but is either already allow'd, or may be ſafely exercis'd among you; Toleration being only deny'd to immoral Practices, and the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men being left as free to them as their Poſſeſſions, excepting only POPERY, and ſuch other Rites and Notions as directly tend to diſturb or diſſolve Society. Beſides the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Advantages of Union, Wealth, and numbers of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:49467:5"/>
which are the certain Conſequents of this impartial Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, 'tis alſo highly congruous to the nature of true Religion; and if any thing on Earth can be imagin'd to ingage the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Heaven, it muſt be ſpecially that which procures it the ſincere and voluntary reſpect of Mankind. I might here diſplay the Renown of the City for Military Glory, and recite thoſe former valiant Atchievments which our Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians carefully record; but I ſhould never finiſh if I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd on thoſe things which I only hint, or if I would men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the extraordinary Privileges which <hi>London</hi> now injoys, and may likely poſſeſs hereafter, for which ſhe well deſerves the name of a <hi>New Rome in the Weſt,</hi> and, like the old one, to becom the Soverain Miſtreſs of the Univerſe.</p>
                  <p>THE Government of the City is ſo wiſely and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely contriv'd, that HARRINGTON made very few Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in it, tho in all the other parts of our National Conſtitution he ſcarce left any thing as he found it. And without queſtion it is a moſt excellent Model. The Lord Mayor, as to the Solemnity of his Election, the Magnificence of his State, or the Extent of his Authority, tho inferior to a <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul (to whom in many reſpects he may be fitly compar'd) yet he far outſhines the figure made by an <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Archon,</hi> or the grandeur of any Magiſtrat preſiding over the beſt Citys now in the World. During a vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Throne he is the chief Perſon in the Nation, and is at all times veſted with a very extraordinary Truſt, which is the reaſon that this Dignity is not often confer'd on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving Perſons; of which we need not go further for an Inſtance than the Right Honorable Sir RICHARD LE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VET, who now ſo worthily fills that eminent Poſt, into which he was not more freely choſen by the Suffrages of his Fellowcitizens, than he continues to diſcharge the Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it with approv'd Moderation and Juſtice. But of the great Caution generally us'd in the choice of Magiſtrats, we may give a true judgment by the preſent Worſhipful She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifs, Sir CHARLES DUNCOMB and Sir JEFFERY JEFFERIES, who are not the Creatures of petty Factions and Cabals, nor (as in the late Reigns) illegally obtruded on the City to ſerve a Turn for the Court, but unanimouſly elected for thoſe good Qualitys which alone ſhould be the proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations to Magiſtracy; that as having the greateſt Stakes to loſe they will be the more concern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d for ſecuring the Property of others, ſo their willingneſs to ſerve their
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:49467:5"/>
Country is known not to be inferior to their Zeal for King WILLIAM; and while they are, for the Credit of the City, generouſly equalling the Expences of the <hi>Roman Praetors,</hi> ſuch at the ſame time is their tender care of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſt, as if to be Overſeers of the Poor were their ſole and immediat Charge. As the Common Council is the Popular Repreſentative, ſo the Court of Aldermen is the Ariſtocratical Senat of the City. To enter on the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Merits of thoſe Names who compoſe this Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aſſembly, as it muſt be own'd by all to be a labor no leſs arduous than extremely nice and invidious, yet to paſs it quite over in ſuch a manner as not to give at leaſt a Specimen of ſo much Worth, would argue a puſillanimity inconſiſtent with LIBERTY, and a diſreſpect to thoſe I wou'd be always underſtood to honor. In regard therfore that the eldeſt Alderman is the ſame at <hi>London</hi> with what the Prince of the Senat was at <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſhall only preſume to mention the Honorable Sir ROBERT CLAYTON as well in that capacity, as by reaſon he univerſally paſſes for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Pattern of a good Citizen. That this Character is not exaggerated will be evident to all thoſe who conſider him, either as raiſing a plentiful Fortune by his Induſtry and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or as diſpoſing his Eſtate with no leſs liberality and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than he got it with honeſty and care: For as to his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and privat Donations, and the proviſion he has made for his Relations or Friends, I will not ſay that he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal'd by any, but that he deſerves to be imitated by all.

The danger of defending the Liberty of the Subject in thoſe calamitous times is not better remember'd than the courage with which he acted, particularly in bringing in the Bill for excluding a Popiſh Succeſſor from the Crown, his brave appearance on the behalf of your Charter, and the general applauſe with which he diſcharg'd his Truſt in all other reſpects; nor ought the Gratitude of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be forgot, who on this occaſion firſt ſtil'd him <hi>the Father of the City,</hi> as CICERO for the like reaſon was the firſt of all <hi>Romans</hi> call'd <hi>the Father of his Country.</hi> That he ſtill aſſiſts in the Government of <hi>London</hi> as eldeſt Alderman, and in that of the whole Nation as a Member of the High Court of Parlament, is not ſo great an honor as that he deſerves it; while the Poſterity of thoſe Familys he ſupports, and the

memory of his other laudable Actions, will be the living and eternal Monuments of his Virtue, when time has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd the moſt durable Braſs or Marble.</p>
                  <p>TO whom therfore ſhou'd I inſcribe a Book containing the Rules of good Polity, but to a Society ſo admirably conſtituted, and producing ſuch Great and Excellent Men? That elſwhere there may be found who underſtand Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment better, diſtribute Juſtice wiſer, or love Liberty more, I could never perſuade my ſelf to imagin: nor can the Perſon wiſh for a nobler Addreſs, or the Subject be made happy in a more ſutable Patronage than THE SENAT AND PEOPLE OF <hi>LONDON;</hi> to whoſe uninterrupted increaſe of Wealth and Dignity, none can be a heartier Welwiſher, than the greateſt admirer of their Conſtitution, and their moſt humble Servant,</p>

                  <p>HOW allowable it is for any man to write the Hiſtory of another, without intitling himſelf to his Opinions, or becoming anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his Actions, I have expreſly treated in the Life of <hi>JOHN MILTON,</hi> and in the juſt defence of the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of <hi>AMYNTOR.</hi> The Reaſons there alleg'd are Excuſe and Authority enough for the Task I have ſince impos'd on my ſelf, which is, to tranſmit to Poſterity the worthy Memory of <hi>JAMES HARRING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON,</hi> a bright Ornament to uſeful Learning, a hearty Lover of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, and a generous Benefactor to the whole World; a Perſon who obſcur'd the falſe Luſtre of our Modern Politicians, and that equal'd (if not exceded) all the Antient Legiſlators.</p>
                  <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T there are ſom People more formidable for their Noiſe than Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and for their Number more conſiderable than their Power, who will not fail with open mouths to proclaim that this is a ſeditious Attemt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the very being of Monarchy, and that there's a pernicious deſign on foot of ſpeedily introducing a Republican Form of Government into the <hi>Britannic</hi> Iſlands; in order to which the Perſon (continue they) whom we have for ſom time diſtinguiſht as a zealous promoter of this Cauſe, has now publiſht the Life and Works of <hi>HARRINGTON,</hi> who was the greateſt Commonwealthſman in the World. This is the ſubſtance of what theſe roaring and hoarſe Trumpeters of Detraction will ſound; for what's likely to be ſaid by men who talk all by rote, is as eaſy to gueſs as to anſwer, tho 'tis commonly ſo ſilly as to deſerve no Animadverſion. Thoſe who in the late Reigns were invidiouſly nicknam'd <hi>Commonwealthſmen,</hi> are by this time ſufficiently clear'd of that Imputation by their Actions, a much better Apology than any Words: for they valiantly reſcu'd our antient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from the devouring Jaws of Arbitrary Power, and did not only unanimouſly concur to fix the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> on the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Head in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, but alſo ſettl'd the Monarchy for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not as if they intended to bring it ſoon to a period, but under ſuch wiſe Regulations as are moſt likely to continue it for ever, conſisting of ſuch excellent Laws as indeed ſet bounds to the Will of the King, but that render him therby the more ſafe, equally binding up his and the Subjects hands from unjuſtly ſeizing one anothers preſcrib'd Rights or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</p>
                  <p>'TIS confeſt, that in every Society there will be always found ſom Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons prepar'd to enterprize any thing (tho never ſo flagitious) grown de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperat by their Villanies, their Profuſeneſs, their Ambition, or the more raging madneſs of Superſtition; and this Evil is not within the compaſs of Art or Nature to remedy. But that a whole People, or any conſiderable number of them, ſhou'd rebel againſt a King that well and wiſely admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters his Government, as it cannot be inſtanc'd out of any Hiſtory, ſo it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a thing in it ſelf impoſſible. An infallible Expedient therfore to exclude a Commonwealth, is for the King to be the Man of his People, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:49467:7"/>
to his preſent Majeſty's glorious Example, to find out the Secret of ſo happily uniting too ſeemingly incompatible things, Principality and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p>'TIS ſtrange that men ſhou'd be cheated by mere Names! yet how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are they ſeen to admire under one denomination, what going under another they wou'd undoubtedly deteſt; which Obſervation made <hi>TACITUS</hi> lay down for a Maxim, That <hi>the ſecret of ſetting up a new State conſiſts in retaining the Image of the old.</hi> Now if a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth be a Government of Laws enacted for the common Good of all the People, not without their own Conſent or Approbation; and that they are not wholly excluded, as in abſolute Monarchy, which is a Government of Men who forcibly rule over others for their own privat Intereſt: Then it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably manifeſt that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government is already a Commonwealth, the moſt free and beſt conſtituted in all the world. This was frankly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleg'd by King <hi>JAMES</hi> the Firſt, who ſtil'd himſelf <hi>the Great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Commonwealth,</hi> It is the Language of our beſt Lawyers, and allow'd by our Author, who only makes it a leſs perfect and more inequal Form than that of his <hi>Oceana,</hi> wherin, he thinks, better proviſion is made againſt external Violence or internal Diſeaſes. Nor dos it at all import by what names either Perſons, or Places, or Things are call'd, ſince the Commonwealthſman finds he injoys Liberty under the ſecurity of equal Laws, and that the reſt of the Subjects are fully ſatisfy'd they live under a Government which is a Monarchy in effect as well as in name. There's not a man alive that excedes my affection to a mixt Form of Government, by the Antients counted the moſt perfect; yet I am not ſo blinded with admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good Conſtitution of our own, but that every day I can diſcern in it many things deficient, ſom things redundant, and others that require e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation or change. And of this the ſupreme Legiſlative Powers are ſo ſenſible, that we ſee nothing more frequent with them than the enacting, abrogating, explaining, and altering of Laws, with regard to the very Form of the Adminiſtration. Nevertheleſs I hope the King and both Houſes of Parlament will not be counted Republicans; or, if they be, I am the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt in the world to run the ſame good or bad Fortune with them in this as well as in all other reſpects.</p>
                  <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T, what <hi>HARRINGTON</hi> was oblig'd to ſay on the like occaſion, I muſt now produce for my ſelf. It was in the time of <hi>ALEXANDER,</hi> the greateſt Prince and Commander of his Age, that <hi>ARISTOTLE</hi> (with ſcarce inferior Applauſe, and equal Fame) wrote that excellent piece of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Cloſet which is call'd his <hi>Politics,</hi> going upon far other Principles than <hi>ALEXANDER</hi>'s Government which it has long outliv'd. The like did <hi>LIVY</hi> without diſturbance in the time of <hi>AUGUSTUS,</hi> Sir <hi>THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS MORE</hi> in that of <hi>HENRY</hi> the Eighth, and <hi>MACCHIAVEL</hi> when <hi>Italy</hi> was under Princes that afforded him not the ear. If theſe and many other celebrated Men wrote not only with honor and ſafety, but even of Commonwealths under Deſpotic or Tyrannical Princes, who can be ſo notoriouſly ſtupid as to wonder that in a free Government, and under a King that is both the reſtorer and ſupporter of the Liberty of <hi>Europe,</hi> I ſhou'd do juſtice to an Author who far outdos all that went before him in his exquiſit knowlege of the Politics?</p>
                  <p>THIS Liberty of writing freely, fully, and impartially, is a part of thoſe Rights which in the laſt Reigns were ſo barbarouſly invaded by ſuch as had no inclination to hear of their own enormous violations of the Laws of God and Man; nor is it undeſerving Obſervation, that ſuch as raiſe
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:49467:7"/>
the loudeſt Clamors againſt it now, are the known Enemys of King <hi>WILLIAM</hi>'s Title and Perſon, being ſure that the Abdicated King <hi>JAMES</hi> can never be reinthron'd ſo long as the Preſs is open for brave and free Spirits to diſplay the Miſchiefs of Tyranny in their true Colors, and to ſhew the inſinit Advantages of Liberty. But not to diſmiſs even ſuch unreaſonable People without perfect ſatisfaction, let 'em know that I don't recommend a Commonwealth, but write the Hiſtory of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthſman, fairly divulging the Principles and Pretences of that Party, and leaving every body to approve or diſlike what he pleaſes, without impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on his Judgment by the deluding Arts of Sophiſtry, Eloquence, or any other ſpecious but unfair methods of perſuaſion. Men, to the beſt of their ability, ought to be ignorant of nothing; and while they talk ſo much for and againſt a Commonwealth, 'tis ſit they ſhou'd at leaſt underſtand the Subject of their Diſcourſe, which is not every body's caſe. Now as <hi>HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINGTON'S Oceana</hi> is, in my Opinion, the moſt perfect Form of Popular Government that ever was: ſo this, with his other Writings, contain the Hiſtory, Reaſons, Nature, and Effects of all ſorts of Government, with ſo much Learning and Perſpicuity, that nothing can be more preferably read on ſuch occaſions.</p>
                  <p>LET not thoſe therfore, who make no oppoſition to the reprinting or reading of <hi>PLATO</hi>'s Heathen Commonwealth, ridiculouſly declaim againſt the better and Chriſtian Model of <hi>HARRINGTON;</hi> but peruſe both of 'em with as little prejudice, paſſion, or concern, as they would a Book of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels into the <hi>Indys</hi> for their improvement and diverſion. Yet ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are the Tempers of many to this equitable diſpoſition, that <hi>DIONYSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>US</hi> the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrant, and ſuch Beaſts of Prey, are the worthy Examples they wou'd recommend to the imitation of our Governors, tho, if they cou'd be able to perſuade 'em, they wou'd ſtill miſs of their fooliſh aim: for it is ever with all Books, as formerly with thoſe of <hi>CREMUTIUS CORDUS,</hi> who was condemn'd by that Monſter <hi>TIBERIUS</hi> for ſpeaking honorably of the immortal Tyrannicides <hi>BRUTUS</hi> and <hi>CASSIUS. TACITUS</hi> records the laſt words of this Hiſtorian, and ſubjoins this judicious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark: <hi>The Senat,</hi> ſays he, <hi>order'd his Books to be burnt by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles; but ſom Copys were conceal'd, and afterwards publiſh'd; whence we may take occaſion to laugh at the ſottiſhneſs of thoſe who imagin that their preſent Power can alſo aboliſh the memory of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding time: for on the contrary, Authors acquire additional Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by their Puniſhment; nor have Foren Kings; and ſuch others as have us'd the like ſeverity, got any thing by it, except to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Diſgrace, and Glory to the Writers.</hi> But the Works of <hi>HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINGTON</hi> were neither ſuppreſt at their firſt publication under the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, nor ever ſince call'd in by lawful Authority, but as ineſtimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures preſerv'd by all that had the happineſs to poſſeſs 'em intire; ſo that what was a precious rarity before, is now becom a Public Good, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary advantages of Correctneſs, Paper, and Print. What I have perform'd in the Hiſtory of his Life, I leave the Readers to judg for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but in that and all my other ſtudys, I conſtantly aim'd as much at leaſt at the benefit of Mankind, and eſpecially of my fellow Citizens, as at my own particular Entertainment or Reputation.</p>
                  <p>THE Politics, no leſs than Arms, are the proper ſtudy of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, tho he ſhou'd conſine himſelf to nothing, but carefully adorn his Mind and Body with all uſeful and becoming Accompliſhments; and not imitat the ſervil drudgery of thoſe mean Spirits, who, for the ſake of
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:49467:8"/>
ſom one Science, neglect the knowlege of all other matters, and in the end are many times neither maſters of what they profeſs, nor vers'd enough in any thing elſe to ſpeak of it agreably or pertinently: which renders 'em un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable in Converſation, as in Diſpute they are opinionative and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, envious of their Fame who eclipſe their littleneſs, and the ſworn Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys of what they do not underſtand.</p>
                  <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T Heaven be duly prais'd, Learning begins to flouriſh again in its proper Soil among our Gentlemen, in imitation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Patricians, who did not love to walk in Leading ſtrings, and to be guided blindfold, nor lazily to abandon the care of their proper Buſineſs to the management of Men having a diſtinct Profeſſion and Intereſt: for the greateſt part of their beſt Authors were Perſons of Conſular Dignity, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Stateſmen, and the moſt gallant Commanders. Wherfore the ampleſt ſatisfaction I can injoy of this ſort will be, to find thoſe delighted with read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Work, for whoſe ſervice it was intended by the Author; and which with the ſtudy of other good Books, but eſpecially a careful peruſal of the <hi>Greec</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians, will make 'em in reality deſerve the Title and Reſpect of Gentlemen, help 'em to make an advantageous Figure in their own time, and perpetuat their illuſtrious Names and ſolid Worth to be admir'd by future Generations.</p>
                  <p>AS for my ſelf, tho no imployment or condition of Life ſhall make me diſreliſh the laſting entertainment which Books afford; yet I have reſolv'd not to write the Life of any modern Perſon again, except that only of one Man ſtill alive, and whom in the ordinary courſe of nature I am like to ſurvive a long while, he being already far advanc'd in his declining time, and I but this preſent day beginning the thirtieth year of my Age.</p>

                  <head>THE LIFE OF James Harrington.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>JAMES HARRINGTON</hi> (who was born in <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 1611) was deſcended of an Antient and Noble Family in <hi>Rutlandſhire,</hi> being Great Grandſon to Sir JAMES HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINGTON; of whom it is obſerv'd by the <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Wright</hi>'s Antiquitys of the County of <hi>Rutland,</hi> p. <hi>52.</hi>
                     </note>Hiſtorian of that County, that there were ſprung in his time eight Dukes, three Marquiſſes, ſeventy Earls, twenty ſeven Viſcounts, and thirty ſix Barons; of which number ſixteen were Knights of the Garter: to confirm which Account, we ſhall annex a Copy of the Inſcription on his Monument and that of his three Sons at <hi>Exton,</hi> with Notes on the ſame by an uncertain hand. As for our Author, he was the eldeſt Son of Sir SAPCOTES HARRINGTON, and JANE the Daughter of Sir WILLIAM SAMUEL of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton</hi> in <hi>Northamtonſhire.</hi> His Father had Children beſides him, WILLIAM a Merchant in <hi>London;</hi> ELIZABETH marry'd to Sir RALPH ASHTON in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> Baronet; ANN marry'd to ARTHUR EVELYN Eſq. And by a ſecond Wife he had JOHN kill'd at Sea; EDWARD a Captain in the Army, yet living; FRANCES marry'd to JOHN BAGSHAW of <hi>Culworth</hi> in <hi>Northamtonſhire</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROTHY marry'd to ALLAN BELLINGHAM of <hi>Levens</hi> in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland</hi> Eſq. This Lady is ſtill alive, and, when ſhe underſtood my Deſign, was pleas'd to put me in poſſeſſion of all the remaining Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and other Manuſcript Papers of her Brother, with the Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Obſervations relating to him, made by his other Siſter the Lady ASHTON, a Woman of very extraordinary Parts and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments. Theſe, with the Account given of him by ANTHONY WOOD in the ſecond Volum of his <hi>Athenae Oxonienſes,</hi> and what I cou'd learn from the Mouths of his ſurviving Acquaintance, are the Materials wherof I compos'd this inſuing Hiſtory of his Life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. IN his very Childhood he gave ſure hopes of his future Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litys, as well by his Inclination and Capacity to learn whatever
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:49467:9"/>
was propos'd to him, as by a kind of natural gravity; whence his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Maſters were wont to ſay, That he rather kept them in aw, than needed their correction: yet when grown a Man, none could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſurpaſs him for quickneſs of Wit, and a moſt facetious Temper. He was enter'd a Gentleman Commoner of <hi>Trinity College</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> in the year 1629, and became a Pupil to that great Maſter of Reaſon Dr. CHILLINGWORTH, who diſcovering the Errors, Impoſtures, and Tyranny of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church (wherof he was for ſom time a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) attackt it with more proper and ſucceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ful Arms than all before, or perhaps any ſince have don. After conſiderably improving his Knowlege in the Univerſity, he was more particularly fitting himſelf for his intended Travels, by learning ſeveral Foren Languages, when his Father dy'd, leaving him under Age. Tho the Court of Wards was ſtill in being, yet by the Soccage Tenure of his Eſtate he was at liberty to chuſe his own Guardian; and accordingly pitcht upon his Grandmother the Lady SAMUEL, a Woman eminent for her Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Virtue. Of her and the reſt of his Governors, he ſoon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a permiſſion to ſatisfy his eager deſire of ſeeing ſom other parts of the World, where he cou'd make ſuch Obſervations on Men and Manners, as might beſt fit him in due time to ſerve and adorn his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. HIS firſt ſtep was into <hi>Holland,</hi> then the principal School of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Diſciplin, and (what toucht him more ſenſibly) a place wonderfully flouriſhing under the influence of their Liberty which they had ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, by breaking the Yoke of a ſevere Maſter, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And here, no doubt, it was that he begun to make Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Subject of his Meditations: for he was often heard to ſay, that, before he left <hi>England,</hi> he knew no more of Monarchy, Anarchy, Ariſtocracy, Democracy, Oligarchy, or the like, than as hard words wherof he learnt the ſignification in his Dictionary. For ſom months he liſted himſelf in my Lord CRAVEN'S Regiment and Sir ROBERT STONE'S; during which time being much at the <hi>Hague,</hi> he had the opportunity of further accompliſhing himſelf in two Courts, namely thoſe of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our K. JAMES I. then a Fugitive in <hi>Holland,</hi> her Husband hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bin abandon'd by his Father in Law, betray'd by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſtript of all his Territorys by the Emperor. This excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Princeſs entertain'd him with extraordinary favor and civility on the account of his Uncle the Lord HARRINGTON, who had bin her Governor; but particularly for the ſake of his own Merit. The Prince Elector alſo courted him into his Service, ingag'd him to attend him in a Journy he made to the Court of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and, after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from travelling, committed the chief management of all his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>England</hi> to his care. Nor were the young Princeſſes leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with his Company, his Converſation being always extremely pleaſant, as well as learn'd and polite; to which good qualitys thoſe unfortunat Ladys were far from being ſtrangers, as appears by the Letters of the great Philoſopher CARTESIUS, and by the other Writers of thoſe times.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. THO he found many Charms inviting his longer ſtay in this place, yet none were ſtrong enough to keep him from purſuing his main deſign of travelling; and therfore he went next thro <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> where having perfected himſelf in the Language, ſeen what
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:49467:9"/>
deſerv'd his curioſity, and made ſuch Remarks on their Government as will beſt appear in his Works, he remov'd thence into <hi>Italy.</hi> It happen'd to be then (as it is now) the Year of <hi>Jubilee.</hi> He always us'd to admire the great dexterity wherwith the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy could maintain their ſevere Government over ſo great a part of the World, and that Men otherwiſe reaſonable enough ſhould be inchanted out of their Senſes, as well as cheated out of their Mony, by theſe ridiculous Tricks of Religious Pageantry. Except the ſmall reſpect he ſhew'd to the Miracles they daily told him were perform'd in their Churches, he did in all other things behave himſelf very prudently and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively. But going on a <hi>Candlemaſs</hi> day with ſeveral other Proteſtants, to ſee the Pope perform the Ceremony of conſecrating Wax Lights; and perceiving that none could obtain any of thoſe Torches, except ſuch as kiſt the Pope's To (which he expos'd to 'em for that purpoſe) tho he had a great mind to one of the Lights, yet he would not accept it on ſo hard a condition. The reſt of his Companions were not ſo ſcrupulous, and after their return complain'd of his ſqueamiſhneſs to the King; who telling him he might have don it only as a reſpect to a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Prince, he preſently reply'd, that ſince he had the honor to kiſs his Majeſty's hand, he thought it beneath him to kiſs any other Prince's foot. The King was pleas'd with his anſwer, and did afterwards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to be one of his Privy Chamber extraordinary, in which qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he attended him in his firſt Expedition againſt the <hi>Scots.</hi>

HE prefer'd <hi>Venice</hi> to all other places in <hi>Italy,</hi> as he did its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to all thoſe of the whole World, it being in his Opinion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable by any external or internal Cauſes, and to finiſh only with Mankind; of which Aſſertion you may find various proofs alleg'd in his Works. Here he furniſh'd himſelf with a Collection of all the valuable Books in the <hi>Italian</hi> Language, eſpecially treating of Politics, and contracted acquaintance with every one of whom he might receive any benefit by inſtruction or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. AFTER having thus ſeen <hi>Italy, France,</hi> the <hi>Low Countrys, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and ſom parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> he return'd home into <hi>England,</hi> to the great joy of all his Friends and Acquaintance. But he was in a ſpecial manner the Darling of his Relations, of whom he acknowleg'd to receive reciprocal ſatisfaction. His Brothers and Siſters were now pretty well grown, which made it his next care ſo to provide for each of 'em as might render 'em independent of others, and eaſy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. His Brother WILLIAM he bred to be a Merchant, in which calling he became a conſiderable Man; he was a good Architect, and was ſo much notic'd for his ingenious Contrivances, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Fellow of the Royal Society. How his other Brothers were diſpos'd, we mention'd in the beginuing of this Diſcourſe. He took all the care of a Parent in the education of his Siſters, and wou'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf make large Diſcourſes to 'em concerning the Reverence that was due to Almighty God; the benevolence they were oblig'd to ſhew all mankind; how they ought to furniſh their minds with knowlege by reading of uſeful Books, and to ſhew the goodneſs of their diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a conſtant practice of Virtue: In a word, he taught 'em the true Rules of humanity and decency, always inculcating to 'em that good Manners did not ſo much conſiſt in a faſhionable carriage (which ought not to be neglected) as in becoming words and actions, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging addreſs, and a modeſt behavior. He treated his Mother in Law

as if ſhe were his own, and made no diſtinction between her Children and the reſt of his Brothers and Siſters; which good Example had ſuch effects on 'em all, that no Family has bin more remarkable for their mutual friendſhip.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. HE was of a very liberal and compaſſionat nature, nor could he indure to ſee a Friend want any thing he might ſpare; and when the Relief that was neceſſary exceded the bounds of his Eſtate, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded his Siſters not only to contribute themſelves, but likewiſe to go about to the reſt of their Relations to complete what was wanting. And if at any time they alleg'd that this Bounty had bin thrown away on ungrateful Perſons, he would anſwer with a ſmile that he ſaw they were mercenary, and that they plainly ſold their Gifts ſince they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſo great a return as Gratitude.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. HIS natural inclinations to ſtudy kept him from ſeeking after any publick Imployments. But in the year 1646, attending out of curioſity the Commiſſioners appointed by Parlament to bring King CHARLES the Firſt from <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> nearer to <hi>London,</hi> he was by ſom of 'em nam'd to wait on his Majeſty, as a Perſon known to him before, and ingag'd to no Party or Faction. The King approv'd the Propoſal, yet our Author would never preſume to com into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence except in public, till he was particularly commanded by the King; and that he, with THOMAS HERBERT (created a Baronet after the Reſtoration of the Monarchy) were made Grooms of the Bedchamber at <hi>Holmby,</hi> together with JAMES MAXWELL and PATRICK MAULE (afterwards Earl of <hi>Penmoore</hi> in <hi>Scotland)</hi> which two only remain'd of his old Servants in that Station.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. HE had the good luck to grow very acceptable to the King, who much convers'd with him about Books and Foren Countrys. In his Siſters Papers I find it expreſt, that at the King's command he tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dr. SANDERSONS Book concerning the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Oaths: but ANTHONY WOOD ſays it was the King's own doing, and that he ſhew'd it at different times to HARRINGTON, HERBERT, Dr. JUXON, Dr. HAMMOND, and Dr. SHELDON for their approbation. However that be, 'tis certain he ſerv'd his Maſter with untainted fidelity, without doing any thing inconſiſtent with the Liberty of his Country; and that he made uſe of his Intereſt with his Friends in Parlament to have Matters accommodated for the ſatisfaction of all Partys. During the Treaty in the <hi>Ile of Wight,</hi> he frequently warn'd the Divines of his acquaintance to take heed how far they preſt the King to inſiſt upon any thing which, however it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd their Dignity, was no eſſential point of Religion; and that ſuch matters driven too far wou'd infallibly ruin all the indeavors us'd for a Peace, which Prophecy was prov'd too true by the Event. <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty lov'd his company,</hi> ſays ANTHONY WOOD, <hi>and, finding him to be an ingenious Man, choſe rather to converſe with him than with others of his Chamber: They had often diſcourſes concerning Government; but when they happen'd to talk of a Commonwealth, the King ſeem'd not to indure it.</hi> Here I know not which moſt to commend, the King for truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man of Republican Principles, or HARRINGTON for owning his Principles while he ſerv'd a King.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. AFTER the King was remov'd out of the <hi>Ile of Wight</hi> to <hi>Hurſtcaſtle</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> HARRINGTON was forcibly turn'd out of ſervice, becauſe he vindicated ſom of his Majeſty's Arguments
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:49467:11"/>
againſt the Parlament Commiſſioners at <hi>Newport,</hi> and thought his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions not ſo unſatisfactory as did ſom others. As they were taking the King to <hi>Windſor,</hi> he beg'd admittance to the Boot of the Coach that he might bid his Maſter farewel; which being granted, and he preparing to kneel, the King took him by the hand, and pull'd him in to him. He was for three or four days permitted to ſtay; but becauſe he would not take an Oath againſt aſſiſting or concealing the King's Eſcape, he was not only diſcharg'd from his Office, but alſo for ſom time detain'd in cuſtody, till Major General IRETON obtain'd his Liberty. He afterwards found means to ſee the King at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and accompany'd him on the Scaffold, where, or a little before, he receiv'd a Token of his Majeſty's Affection.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. AFTER the King's Death he was obſerv'd to keep much in his Library, and more retir'd than uſually, which was by his Friends a long time attributed to Melancholy or Diſcontent. At length when they weary'd him with their importunitys to change this ſort of Life, he thought fit to ſhew 'em at the ſame time their miſtake and a Copy of his <hi>Oceana,</hi> which he was privatly writing all that while: telling 'em withal, that ever ſince he began to examin things ſeriouſly, he had principally addicted himſelf to the ſtudy of Civil Government, as being of the higheſt importance to the Peace and Felicity of mankind; and that he ſucceded at leaſt to his own ſatisfaction, being now convinc'd that no Government is of ſo accidental or arbitrary an Inſtitution as people are wont to imagin, there being in Societys natural cauſes producing their neceſſary effects, as well as in the Earth or the Air. Hence he frequently argu'd that the Troubles of his time were not to be wholly attributed to wilfulneſs or faction, neither to the miſgovernment of the Prince, nor the ſtubborneſs of the People; but to a change in the Balance of Property, which ever ſince HENRY the Seventh's time was daily falling into the Scale of the Commons from that of the King and the Lords, as in his Book he evidently demonſtrats and explains. Not that hereby he approv'd either the Breaches which the King had made on the Laws, or excus'd the Severity which ſom of the Subjects exercis'd on the King; but to ſhew that as long as the Cauſes of theſe Diſorders remain'd, ſo long would the like Effects unavoidably follow: while on the one hand a King would be always indeavoring to govern according to the example of his Predeceſſors when the beſt part of the National Property was in their own hands, and conſequently the greateſt command of Mony and Men, as one of a thouſand pounds a Year can entertain more Servants, or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more Tenants, than another that has but one hundred, out of which he cannot allow one Valet; and on the other hand he ſaid, the People would be ſure to ſtruggle for preſerving the Property wherof they were in poſſeſſion, never failing to obtain more Privileges, and to inlarge the Baſis of their Liberty, as often as they met with any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs (which they generally did) in quarrels of this kind. His chief aim therfore was to find out a method of preventing ſuch Diſtempers, or to apply the beſt Remedys when they happen'd to break out. But as long as the Balance remain'd in this unequal ſtate, he affirm'd that no King whatſoever could keep himſelf eaſy, let him never ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to pleaſe his People; and that tho a good King might manage Affairs tolerably well during his life, yet this did not prove the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be good, ſince under a leſs prudent Prince it would fall to
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:49467:12"/>
pieces again, while the Orders of a well conſtituted State make wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men virtuous, and fools to act wiſely.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. THAT <hi>Empire follows the Balance of Property,</hi> whether lodg'd in one, in a few, or in many hands, he was the firſt that ever made out; and is a noble Diſcovery, wherof the Honor ſolely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him, as much as thoſe of the Circulation of the Blood, of Printing, of Guns, of the Compaſs, or of Optic Glaſſes, to their ſeveral Authors. 'Tis incredible to think what groſs and numberleſs Errors were committed by all the Writers before him, even by the beſt of them, for want of underſtanding this plain Truth, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Politics. He no ſooner diſcours'd publicly of this new Doctrin, being a man of univerſal acquaintance, but it ingag'd all ſorts of people to buſy themſelves about it as they were variouſly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Som, becauſe they underſtood him, deſpis'd it, alleging it was plain to every man's capacity, as if his higheſt merit did not conſiſt in making it ſo. Others, and thoſe in number the feweſt, diſputed with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, merely to be better inform'd; with which he was well pleas'd, as reckoning a pertinent Objection of greater advantage to the diſcovery of Truth (which was his aim) than a complaiſant applauſe or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. But a third ſort, of which there never wants in all places a numerous company, did out of pure envy ſtrive all they could to leſſen or defame him; and one of 'em (ſince they could not find any precedent Writer out of whoſe Works they might make him a Plagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) did indeavor, after a very ſingular manner, to rob him of the Glory of this Invention: for our Author having friendly lent him a part of his Papers, he publiſh'd a ſmall piece to the ſame purpoſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titl'd, <hi>A Letter from an Officer of the Army in</hi> Ireland, &amp;c. Major WILDMAN was then reputed the Author by ſom, and HENRY NEVIL by others; which latter, by reaſon of this thing, and his great intimacy with HARRINGTON, was by his detractors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be the Author of his Works, or that at leaſt he had a principal hand in the compoſing of them. Notwithſtanding which provocations, ſo true was he to the Friendſhip he profeſt to NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIL and WILDMAM, that he avoided all harſh Expreſſions or public Cenſures on this occaſion, contenting himſelf with the Juſtice which the World was ſoon oblig'd to yield to him by reaſon of his other Writings, where no ſuch clubbing of Brains could be reaſonably ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. BUT the publication of his Book met with greater difficultys from the oppoſition of the ſeveral Partys then ſet againſt one another, and all againſt him; but none more than ſom of thoſe who pretended to be for a Commonwealth, which was the ſpecious name under which they cover'd the rankeſt Tyranny of OLIVER CROMWEL, while HARRINGTON, like PAUL at <hi>Athens,</hi> indeavor'd to make known to the People what they ignorantly ador'd. By ſhewing that a Commonwealth was a Government of Laws, and not of the Sword, he could not but detect the violent adminiſtration of the Protector by his Baſhaws, Intendants, or Majors General, which created him no ſmall danger: while the Cavaliers on the other ſide tax'd him with Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the memory of the late King, and prefer'd the Monarchy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of a Uſurper to the beſt order'd Commonwealth. To theſe he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, that it was enough for him to forbear publiſhing his Sentiments
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:49467:12"/>
during that King's life; but the Monarchy being now quite diſſolv'd, and the Nation in a ſtate of Anarchy, or (what was worſe) groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a horrid Uſurpation, he was not only at liberty, but even oblig'd as a good Citizen to offer a helping hand to his Countrymen, and to ſhew 'em ſuch a Model of Government as he thought moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to their Tranquillity, Wealth, and Power: That the Cavaliers ought of all People to be beſt pleas'd with him, ſince if his Model ſucceded, they were ſure to injoy equal Privileges with others, and ſo be deliver'd from their preſent Oppreſſion; for in a well conſtituted Commonwealth there can be no diſtinction of Partys, the paſſage to Preferment is open to Merit in all perſons, and no honeſt man can be uneaſy: but that if the Prince ſhould happen to be reſtor'd, his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of the Balance would be a light to ſhew him what and with whom he had to do, and ſo either to mend or avoid the Miſcarriages of his Father; ſince all that is ſaid of this doctrin may as well be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to a Monarchy regulated by Laws, as to a Democracy or more popular form of a Commonwealth. He us'd to add on ſuch occaſions another reaſon of writing this Model, which was, That if it ſhould ever be the fate of this Nation to be, like <hi>Italy</hi> of old, overrun by any barbarous People, or to have its Government and Records deſtroy'd by the rage of ſom mercileſs Conqueror, they might not be then left to their own Invention in framing a new Government; for few People can be expected to ſuccede ſo happily as the <hi>Venetians</hi> have don in ſuch a caſe.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. IN the mean time it was known to ſom of the Courtiers, that the Book was a printing; wherupon, after hunting it from one Preſs to another, they ſeiz'd their Prey at laſt, and convey'd it to <hi>Whitehall.</hi> All the ſollicitations he could make were not able to retrieve his Papers, till he remember'd that OLIVER'S favorit Daughter, the Lady CLAYPOLE, acted the part of a Princeſs very naturally, obliging all perſons with her civility, and frequently interceding for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. To this Lady, tho an abſolute ſtranger to him, he thought fit to make his application; and being led into her Antichamber, he ſent in his Name, with his humble requeſt that ſhe would admit him to her preſence. While he attended, ſom of her Women coming into the room were follow'd by her little Daughter about three years old, who ſtaid behind them. He entertain'd the Child ſo divertingly, that ſhe ſuffer'd him to take her up in his arms till her Mother came; wherupon he ſtepping towards her, and ſetting the Child down at her feet, ſaid, Madam, 'tis well you are com at this nick of time, or I had certainly ſtollen this pretty little Lady: Stollen her, reply'd the Mother! pray, what to do with her? for ſhe is yet too young to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com your Miſtreſs. Madam, ſaid he, tho her Charms aſſure her of a more conſiderable Conqueſt, yet I muſt confeſs it is not love but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge that promted me to commit this theft. Lord, anſwer'd the Lady again, what injury have I don you that you ſhould ſteal my Child? None at all, reply'd he, but that you might be induc'd to prevail with your Father to do me juſtice, by reſtoring my Child that he has ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len. But ſhe urging it was impoſſible, becauſe her Father had Children enough of his own; he told her at laſt it was the iſſue of his brain which was miſrepreſented to the Protector, and taken out of the Preſs by his order. She immediatly promis'd to procure it for him, if it contain'd nothing prejudicial to her Father's Government; and he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd her it was only a kind of a Political Romance, ſo far from any
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:49467:13"/>
Treaſon againſt her Father, that he hop'd ſhe would acquaint him that he deſign'd to dedicat it to him, and promis'd that ſhe her ſelf ſhould be preſented with one of the firſt Copys. The Lady was ſo well pleas'd with his manner of Addreſs, that he had his Book ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtor'd to him; and he did accordingly inſcribe it to OLIVER CROMWEL, who, after the peruſal of it, ſaid, the Gentleman had like to trapan him out of his Power, but that what he got by the Sword he would not quit for a little paper Shot: adding in his uſual cant, that he approv'd the Government of a ſingle Perſon as little as any of 'em, but that he was forc'd to take upon him the Office of a High Conſtable, to preſerve the Peace among the ſeveral Partys in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince he ſaw that being left to themſelves, they would never agree to any certain form of Government, and would only ſpend their whole Power in defeating the Deſigns, or deſtroying the Perſons of one another.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. BUT nothing in the world could better diſcover CROM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WEL'S Diſſimulation than this Speech, ſince HARRINGTON had demonſtrated in his Book, that no Commonwealth could be ſo eaſily or perfectly eſtabliſh'd as one by a ſole Legiſlator, it being in his power (if he were a man of good Invention himſelf, or had a good Model propos'd to him by others) to ſet up a Government in the whole piece at once, and in perfection; but an Aſſembly, being of better Judgment than Invention, generally make patching work in forming a Government, and are whole Ages about that which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never brought by 'em to any perfection: but is commonly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd by the way, leaving the nobleſt Attemts under reproach, and the Authors of 'em expos'd to the greateſt dangers while they live, and to a certain infamy when dead. Wherfore the wiſeſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblys, in mending or making a Government, have pitch'd upon a ſole Legiſlator, whoſe Model they could rightly approve, tho not ſo well digeſt; as Muſicians can play in conſort, and judg of an Air that is laid before them, tho to invent a part of Muſic they could never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, nor ſuccede ſo happily as one Perſon. If CROMWEL therfore had meant as he ſpoke, no man had ever ſuch an opportunity of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming what was amiſs in the old Government, or ſetting up one wholly new, either according to the Plan of <hi>Oceana,</hi> or any other. This would have made him indeed a <hi>Hero</hi> ſuperior in laſting fame to SOLON, LYCURGUS, ZALEUCUS, and CHARONDAS; and render his Glory far more reſplendent, his Security greater, and his Renoun more durable than all the Pomp of his ill acquir'd Greatneſs could afford: wheras on the contrary he liv'd in continual fears of thoſe he had inſlav'd, dy'd abhor'd as a monſtrous betrayer of thoſe Libertys with which he was intruſted by his Country, and his Poſterity not poſſeſſing a foot of what for their only ſakes he was generally thought to uſurp. But this laſt is a miſtaken Notion, for ſom of the moſt notorious Tyrants liv'd and dy'd without any hopes of Children; which is a good reaſon why no mortal ought to be truſted with too much Power on that ſcore. LYCURGUS and ANDREW DORIA, who, when it was in their power to continue Princes, choſe rather to be the founders of their Countrys Liberty, will be celebrated for their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thro the courſe of all Ages, and their very Names convey the higheſt Ideas of Godlike Generoſity; while JULIUS CAESAR, OLIVER CROMWEL, and ſuch others as at any time inſlav'd
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:49467:13"/>
their fellow Citizens, will be for ever remember'd with deteſtation, and cited as the moſt execrable Examples of the vileſt Treachery and Ingratitude. It is only a refin'd and excellent Genius, a noble Soul ambitious of ſolid Praiſe, a ſincere lover of Virtue and the good of all Mankind, that is capable of executing ſo glorious an Undertaking as making a People free. 'Tis my fix'd opinion, that if the Protector's mind had the leaſt tincture of true greatneſs, he could not be proof againſt the incomparable Rewards propos'd by HARRINGTON in the <hi>Corollary</hi> of his <hi>Oceana;</hi> as no Prince truly generous, whether with or without Heirs, is able to reſiſt their Charms, provided he has an opportunity to advance the happineſs of his People. 'Twas this Diſpoſition that brought the Prince of ORANGE to head us when we lately contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our Liberty; to this we ow thoſe ineſtimable Laws we have obtain'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince out of a grateful confidence we made him our King; and how great things, or after what manner, we may expect from him in time to com, is as hard to be truly conceiv'd as worthily expreſs'd.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. I SHALL, now give ſom account of the Book it ſelf, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tl'd by the Author, <hi>The Commonwealth of Oceana,</hi> a name by which he deſign'd <hi>England,</hi> as being the nobleſt Iland of the <hi>Northern</hi> Ocean. But before I procede further, I muſt explain ſom other words occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in this Book, which is written after the manner of a Romance, in imitation of PLATO'S <hi>Atlantic Story,</hi> and is a method ordinarily follow'd by Lawgivers.</p>

                  <p n="17">17. THE Book conſiſts of <hi>Preliminarys</hi> divided into two parts, and a third Section call'd the <hi>Council of Legiſlators;</hi> then follows the <hi>Model</hi> of the Commonwealth, or the body of the Book; and laſtly coms the <hi>Corollary</hi> or Concluſion. The Preliminary Diſcourſes contain the Principles, Generation, and Effects of all Governments, whether Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical, Ariſtocratical, or Popular, and their ſeveral Corruptions, as
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:49467:14"/>
Tyranny, Oligarchy, and Anarchy, with all the good or bad mixtures that naturally reſult from them. But the firſt part dos in a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner treat of antient Prudence, or that genius of Government which moſt prevail'd in the world till the time of JULIUS CAESAR. None can conſult a more certain Oracle that would conceive the nature of Foren or Domeſtic Empire; the Balance of Land or Mony; Arms or Contracts; Magiſtracy and Judicatures; Agrarian Laws; Elections by the Ballot; Rotation of Officers, with a great many ſuch heads, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the inconveniences and preeminences of each kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the true compariſon of 'em all together. Theſe Subjects have bin generally treated diſtinctly, and every one of them ſeems to require a Volum; yet I am of opinion that in this ſhort Diſcourſe there is a more full and clearer account of them, than can be eaſily found elſwhere: at leaſt I muſt own to have receiv'd greater ſatisfaction here than in all my reading before, and the ſame thing has bin frankly own'd to me by others.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. THE ſecond part of the Preliminarys treats of modern Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or that genius of Government which has moſt obtain'd in the world ſince the expiration of the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty, particularly the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic</hi> Conſtitution, beginning with the inundation of the barbarous Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations over the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. In this Diſcourſe there is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear account of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government under the <hi>Romans, Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> till the foundations of it were cunningly undermin'd by HENRY VII. terribly ſhaken by HENRY VIII. and utterly ruin'd under CHARLES I. Here he muſt read who in a little compaſs would completely underſtand the antient Feuds and Tenures, the original and degrees of our Nobility, with the inferior Orders of the reſt of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: under the <hi>Saxons,</hi> what was meant by Ealdorman, or Earls; King's Thane; middle Thane or. Vavaſors; their Shiremoots, Sherifs, and Viſcounts; their Halymoots, Weidenagemoots, and ſuch others. Here likewiſe one may learn to underſtand the Baronage of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> as the Barons by their Poſſeſſions, by Writ, or by Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; with many other particulars which give an inſight into the 'ſprings and management of the Barons Wars, ſo frequent and famous in our Annals. The reſt of this Diſcourſe is ſpent in ſhewing the natural Cauſes of the diſſolution of the <hi>Norman</hi> Monarchy under CHARLES the Firſt, and the generation of the Commonwealth, or rather the Anarchy that ſucceded.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. NEXT follows the Council of Legiſlators: for HARRING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON being about to give the moſt perfect Model of Government, he made himſelf maſter of all the Antient and Modern Politicians, that he might as well imitat whatever was excellent or practicable in them, as his care was to avoid all things which were impracticable or inconvenient. Theſe were the juſteſt meaſures that could poſſibly be taken by any body, whether he deſign'd to be rightly inform'd, and ſufficiently furniſh'd with the beſt materials; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> whether he would have his Model meet with an eaſy reception: for ſince his own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (tho never ſo true) were ſure to be rejected as privat Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations or impracticable Chimeras, this was the readieſt way to make 'em paſs currently, as both authoriz'd by the wiſeſt men in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as what in all times and places had bin practis'd with ſucceſs. To this end therfore he introduces, under feign'd names, nine Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, who perfectly underſtood the ſeveral Governments they were
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:49467:14"/>
appointed to repreſent. The Province of the firſt was the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that of the ſecond, <hi>Athens;</hi> of the third, <hi>Sparta;</hi> of the fourth, <hi>Carthage;</hi> of the fifth, the <hi>Achaeans, Aetolians,</hi> and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians;</hi> of the ſixth, <hi>Rome;</hi> of the ſeventh, <hi>Venice;</hi> of the eighth, <hi>Switzerland;</hi> and of the ninth, <hi>Holland.</hi> Out of the Excellencys of all theſe, ſupply'd with the Fruits of his own invention, he fram'd the Model of his <hi>Oceana;</hi> and indeed he ſhews himſelf in that work ſo throly vers'd in their ſeveral Hiſtorys and Conſtitutions, that to any man who would rightly underſtand them, I could not eaſily recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a more proper Teacher: for here they are diſſected and laid open to all Capacitys, their Perfections applauded, their Inconveniencys ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and parallels frequently made between 'em no leſs entertaining than uſeful. Nor are the Antient and Modern <hi>Eaſtern</hi> or <hi>European</hi> Monarchys forgot, but exhibited with all their Advantages and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, without the leaſt diſſimulation or partiality.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. AS for the <hi>Model,</hi> I ſhall ſay nothing of it in particular, as well becauſe I would not foreſtal the pleaſure of the Reader, as by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon an Abridgment of it is once or twice made by himſelf, and inſerted among his Works. The method he obſerves is to lay down his Orders or Laws in ſo many poſitive Propoſitions, to each of which he ſubjoins an explanatory Diſcourſe; and if there be occaſion, adds a Speech ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be deliver'd by the Lord ARCHON, or ſom of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Theſe Speeches are extraordinary fine, contain a world of good Learning and Obſervation, and are perpetual Commentarys on his Laws. In the <hi>Corollary,</hi> which is the concluſion of the whole Work, he ſhews how the laſt hand was put to his Commonwealth; which we muſt not imagin to treat only of the Form of the Senat and Aſſemblys of the People, or the manner of waging War and governing in Peace. It contains beſides, the Diſciplin of a National Religion, and the ſecurity of a Liberty of Conſcience; a Form of Government for <hi>Scotland,</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the other Provinces of the Commonwealth; Governments for <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> proportionably to which the other Corporations of the Nation are to be model'd; Directions for the incouraging of Trade; Laws for regulating Academys; and moſt excellent Rules for the Education of our Youth, as well to the Wars or the Sea, to Manufactures or Husbandry, as to Law, Phyſic, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and chiefly to the breeding and true figure of accompliſh'd Gentlemen: There are admirable Orders for reforming the Stage; the number, choice, and buſineſs of the Officers of State and the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, with all ſorts of Officers; and an exact account both of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larys, and the ordinary yearly charge of the whole Commonwealth, which for two rarely conſiſtent things, the grandeur of its State, and the frugal management of its Revenues, excedes all the Governments that ever were. I ought not to omit telling here, that this Model gives a full anſwer to thoſe who imagin that there can be no Diſtinctions or Degrees, neither Nobility nor Gentry in a Democracy, being led into this miſtake, becauſe they ignorantly think all Commonwealths to be conſtituted alike; when, if they were but never ſo little vers'd in Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, they might know that no Order of men now in the world can com near the Figure that was made by the Noblemen and Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> State: nor in this reſpect dos the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> com any thing behind them; for, as HARRINGTON ſays very truly, <hi>an Army may as well conſiſt of Soldiers without Officers, or of
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:49467:15"/>
Officers without Soldiers, as a Commonwealth (eſpecially ſuch a one as is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Greatneſs) conſiſt of a People without a Gentry, or of a Gentry without a People.</hi> So much may ſuffice for underſtanding the ſcope of this Book: I ſhall only add, that none ought to be offended with a few od terms in it, ſuch as the Prime Magnitude, the Pillar of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> the Galaxy, and the Tropic of Magiſtrats, ſince the Author ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains what he means by 'em, and that any other may call 'em by what more ſignificative names he pleaſes; for the things themſelves are abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. NO ſooner did this Treatiſe appear in public, but it was gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily bought up, and becom the ſubject of all mens diſcourſe. The firſt that made exceptions to it was Dr. HENRY FERNE, afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> The Lady ASHTON preſented him with one of the Books, and deſir'd his opinion of it, which he quickly ſent in ſuch a manner as ſhew'd he did not approve of the Doctrin, tho he treated the Perſon and his Learning with due reſpect. To this Letter a reply was made, and ſom Querys ſent along with it by HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINGTON, to every one of which a diſtinct Anſwer was return'd by the Doctor; which being again confuted by HARRINGTON, he publiſh'd the whole in the year 1656, under the title of <hi>Pian Piano, or an Intercourſe between</hi> H. FERNE <hi>Doctor in Divinity, and</hi> JAMES HARRINGTON <hi>
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> upon occaſion of the Doctor's Cenſure of the Commonwealth of</hi> Oceana. 'Tis a Treatiſe of little importance, and contains nothing but what he has much better diſcours'd in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to other Antagoniſts, which is the reaſon that I give the Reader no more trouble about it.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. THE next that wrote againſt <hi>Oceana</hi> was MATTHEW WREN, eldeſt Son to the Biſhop of <hi>Ely.</hi> His Book was intitl'd <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> and reſtrain'd only to the firſt part of the Preliminarys. To this our Author publiſh'd an anſwer in the firſt Book of his <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Popular Government,</hi> where he inlarges, explains, and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats his Aſſertions. How inequal this Combat was, and after what manner he treated his Adverſary, I leave the Reader to judg; only minding him that as WREN was one of the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> who met at Dr. WILKINS'S (the Seminary of the now Royal Society) HARRINGTON jokingly ſaid, That <hi>they had an excellent faculty of magnifying a Louſe, and diminiſhing a Commonwealth.</hi> But the Subjects he handles on this occaſion are very curious, and reduc'd to the twelve following Queſtions.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) WHETHER Prudence (or the Politics) be well diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd into Antient and Modern?</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) WHETHER a Commonwealth be rightly defin'd to be a Government of Laws and not of men; and Monarchy to be a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſom men or a few men, and not of Laws?</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) WHETHER the Balance of Dominion in Land be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſe of Empire?</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) WHETHER the Balance of Empire be well divided into National and Provincial? and whether theſe two, or any Nations that are of a diſtinct Balance, coming to depend on one and the ſame head, ſuch a mixture creates a new Balance?</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) WHETHER there be any common Right or Intereſt of Mankind diſtinct from the Intereſt of the parts taken ſeverally? and how by the orders of a Commonwealth this may beſt be diſtinguiſh'd from privat Intereſt?</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:49467:15"/>
(6.) WHETHER the <hi>Senatuſconſulta,</hi> or Decrees of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senat, had the power of Laws?</p>
                  <p n="7">(7.) WHETHER the Ten Commandments, propos'd by God or MOSES, were voted and paſt into Laws by the People of <hi>Iſrael?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">(8.) WHETHER a Commonwealth, coming up to the perfection of the Kind, coms not up to the perfection of Government, and has no flaw in it? that is, whether the beſt Commonwealth be not the beſt Government?</p>
                  <p n="9">(9.) WHETHER Monarchy, coming up to the perfection of the Kind, coms not ſhort of the perfection of Government, and has not ſom flaw in it? that is, whether the beſt Monarchy be not the worſt Government? Under this head are alſo explain'd the Balance of <hi>France,</hi> the Original of a Landed Clergy, Arms, and their ſeveral kinds.</p>
                  <p n="10">(10.) WHETHER any Commonwealth, that was not firſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or divided by it ſelf, was ever conquer'd by any Monarch? where he ſhews that none ever were, and that the greateſt Monarchys have bin broken by very ſmall Commonwealths.</p>
                  <p n="11">(11.) WHETHER there be not an <hi>Agrarian,</hi> or ſom Law or Laws to ſupply the defects of it, in every Commonwealth? Whether the <hi>Agrarian,</hi> as it is ſtated in <hi>Oceana,</hi> be not equal and ſatisfactory to all Intereſts or Partys?</p>
                  <p n="12">(12.) WHETHER a Rotation, or Courſes and Turns, be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a welorder'd Commonwealth? In which is contain'd the <hi>Parem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole</hi> or Courſes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> before the Captivity, together with an Epitome of the Commonwealth of <hi>Athens,</hi> as alſo another of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. THE ſecond Book of the <hi>Prerogative of Popular Government</hi> chiefly concerns Ordination in the Chriſtian Church, and the Orders of the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> againſt the opinions of Dr. HAMMOND, Dr. SEAMAN, and the Authors they follow. His Diſpute with theſe learned Perſons (the one of the Epiſcopal, and the other of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Communion) is comprehended in five Chapters.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) THE firſt, explaining the words <hi>Chirotonia</hi> and <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> paraphraſtically relates the Story of the Perambulation made by the Apoſtles PAUL and BARNABAS thro the Citys of <hi>Lycaonia, Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) THE ſecond ſhews that thoſe Citys, or moſt of 'em were at the time of this Perambulation under Popular Government; in which is alſo contain'd the whole Adminiſtration of a <hi>Roman</hi> Province.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) THE third ſhews the deduction of the <hi>Chirotonia,</hi> or holding up of hands, from Popular Government, and that the original of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is from this cuſtom: in which is alſo contain'd the Inſtitution of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> or Senat of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by MOSES, and of that of <hi>Rome</hi> by ROMULUS.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) THE fourth ſhews the deduction of the <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> or the laying on of hands, from Monarchical or Ariſtocratical Government, and ſo the ſecond way of Ordination procedes from this cuſtom: here is alſo declar'd how the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtood after the Captivity.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) THE fifth debates whether the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> us'd in the Citys mention'd was (as is pretended by Dr. HAMMOND, Dr. SEAMAN, and the Authors they follow) the ſame with the <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> or a far
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:49467:16"/>
different thing. In which are contain'd the divers kinds of Church Government introduc'd and exercis'd in the age of the Apoſtles. By theſe heads we may perceive that a great deal of uſeful Learning is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in this Book; and queſtionleſs he makes thoſe Subjects more plain and intelligible than any Writer I ever yet conſulted.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. AGAINST <hi>Oceana</hi> chiefly did RICHARD BAXTER write his <hi>Holy Commonwealth,</hi> of which our Author made ſo ſlight that he vouchſaf'd no other anſwer to it but half a ſheet of Cant and Ridicule. It dos not appear that <hi>he rail'd at all the Miniſters as a parcel of Fools and Knaves.</hi> But the reſt of BAXTER'S complaint ſeems bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounded, as that HARRINGTON maintain'd <hi>neither he nor any Miniſters underſtood at all what Polity was, but prated againſt they knew not what, &amp;c. This made him publiſh his Holy Commonwealth in anſwer to</hi> HARRINGTON<hi>'s Heatheniſh Commonwealth; in which,</hi> adds he, <hi>I plead the Cauſe of Monarchy as better than Democracy or Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> an odd way of modelling a Commonwealth. And yet the Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts were ſo far from thinking his Book for their ſervice, that in the year 1683 it was by a Decree of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> condemn'd to be publicly burnt, which Sentence was accordingly executed upon it, in company with ſom of the Books of HOBBES, MILTON, and others; wheras no cenſure paſt on HARRINGTON's <hi>Oceana,</hi> or the reſt of his Works. As for Divines meddling with Politics, he has in the former part of the Preliminarys to <hi>Oceana</hi> deliver'd his Opinion, That <hi>there is ſomthing firſt in the making of a Commonwealth, then in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of it, and laſt of all in the leading of its Armys, which (tho there be great Divines, great Lawyers, great Men in all Profeſſions) ſeems to be peculiar only to the genius of a Gentleman; for it is plain in the univerſal ſeries of ſtory, that if any man founded a Commonwealth, he was firſt a Gentleman;</hi> the truth of which Aſſertion he proves from MOSES downwards.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. BEING much importun'd from all hands to publiſh an Abridgment of his <hi>Oceana,</hi> he conſented at length; and ſo, in the year 1659, was printed his <hi>Art of Lawgiving</hi> (or of Legiſlation) in three Books. The firſt, which treats <hi>of the Foundations and Superſtructures of all kinds of Government,</hi> is an abſtract of his Preliminarys to the <hi>Oceana:</hi> and the third Book, ſhewing <hi>a Model of Popular Government fitted to the preſent State or Balance of this Nation,</hi> is an exact Epitome of his <hi>Oceana,</hi> with ſhort Diſcourſes explaining the Propoſitions. By the way, the Pamphlet called the <hi>Rota</hi> is nothing elſe but theſe Propoſitions without the Diſcourſes, and therfore to avoid a needleſs repetition not printed among his Works. The ſecond Book between theſe two, is a full <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Commonwealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>with all the variations it underwent.</hi> Without this Book it is plainly impoſſible to underſtand that admirable Government concerning which no Author wrote common ſenſe before HARRINGTON, who was perſuaded to complete this Treatiſe by ſuch as obſerv'd his judicious Remarks on the ſame Subject in his other Writings. To <hi>the Art of Lawgiving</hi> is annex'd a ſmall Diſſertation, or <hi>a Word concerning a Houſe of Peers,</hi> which to abridg were to tranſcribe.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. IN the ſame year, 1659, WREN coms out with another Book call'd <hi>Monarchy aſſerted,</hi> in vindication of his <hi>Conſiderations.</hi> If he could not preſs hard on our Author's Reaſonings, he was reſolv'd to overbear him with impertinence and calumny, treating him neither with the reſpect due to a Gentleman, nor the fair dealing becoming an

ingenuous Adverſary, but on the contrary with the utmoſt Chicanery and Inſolence. The leaſt thing to be admir'd is, that he would needs make the Univerſity a Party againſt him, and bring the heavy weight of the Church's diſpleaſure on his ſholders: for as corrupt Miniſters ſtile themſelves the Government, by which Artifice they oblige better men to ſuppreſs their Complaints, for fear of having their Loyalty ſuſpected; ſo every ignorant Pedant that affronts a Gentleman, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently a Learned Univerſity; or if he is but in Deacons Orders, he's forthwith transform'd into the Catholic Church, and it becoms Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to touch him. But as great Bodys no leſs than privat Perſons, grow wiſer by Experience, and com to a clearer diſcernment of their true Intereſt: ſo I believe that neither the Church nor Univerſitys will be now ſo ready to eſpouſe the Quarrels of thoſe, who, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſerving them, ingage in Diſputes they no ways underſtand, wherby all the diſcredit redounds to their Patrons, themſelves being too mean to ſuffer any diminution of Honor. HARRINGTON was not likewiſe leſs blamable in being provok'd to ſuch a degree by this pitiful Libel, as made him forget his natural character of gravity and greatneſs of mind. Were not the beſt of men ſubject to their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar weakneſſes, he had never written ſuch a Farce as his <hi>Politicaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It relates little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Argument, which was not ſo much amiſs, conſidering the ignorance of his Antagoniſt: but it is of ſo very ſmall merit, that I would not inſert it among his other Works, as a piece not capable to inſtruct or pleaſe any man now alive. I have not omitted his <hi>Anſwer to Dr.</hi> STUBBE <hi>concerning a ſelect Senat,</hi> as being ſo little worth; but as being only a repetition of what he has much better and more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply treated in ſom of his other pieces. Now we muſt note that upon the firſt appearance of his <hi>Oceana</hi> this STUBBE was ſo great an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of him, that, in his Preface to the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> he ſays <hi>he would inlarge in his praiſe, did he not think himſelf too inconſiderable to add any thing to thoſe Applauſes which the underſtanding part of the World muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon him, and which, tho Eloquence ſhould turn Panegyriſt, he not only merits but tranſcends.</hi>

OTHER Treatiſes of his, which are omitted for the ſame reaſon, are, 1. <hi>A Diſcourſe upon this Saying: The Spirit of the Nation is not yet to be truſted with Liberty, leſt it introduce Monarchy, or invade the Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> which Propoſition he diſapprov'd. 2. <hi>A Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhewing that the Spirit of Parlaments, with a Council in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, is not to be truſted for a Settlement, leſt it introduce Monarchy, and Perſecution for Conſcience.</hi> 3. <hi>A Parallel of the ſpirit of the People with the ſpirit of Mr.</hi> ROGERS, <hi>with an Appeal to the Reader whether the ſpirit of the People, or the ſpirit of men like Mr.</hi> ROGERS <hi>be the fitter to be truſted with the Government.</hi> This ROGERS was an Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, a ſeditious Enthuſiaſt, or fifthmonarchy man. 4. <hi>Pour enclouer le canon, or the nailing of the Enemys Artillery.</hi> 5. <hi>The ſtumbling block of Diſobedience and Rebellion, cunningly imputed by</hi> PETER HEYLIN <hi>to</hi> CALVIN, <hi>remov'd in a Letter to the ſaid</hi> P.

'Tis obvious by the bare peruſal of the Titles, that theſe are but Pamphlets ſolely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for that time; and it certainly argues a mighty want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in thoſe Editors who make no diſtinction between the elaborat Works which an Author intended for univerſal benefit, and his more

ſlight or temporary Compoſitions, which were written to ſerve a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent turn, and becom afterwards not only uſeleſs, but many times not intelligible. Of this nature are the Pieces I now mention'd: all their good things are much better treated in his other Books, and the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reflections are (as I ſaid before) neither inſtructive nor divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. On this occaſion I muſt ſignify, that tho the Hiſtory I wrote of MILTON'S Life be prefix'd to his Works, yet I had no hand in the Edition of thoſe Volumes; or otherwiſe his Logic, his Grammar, and the like, had not increas'd the bulk or price of his other uſeful Pieces. Our Author tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſe ſom of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Eclogs,</hi> and about ſix Books of his <hi>Aeneids;</hi> which, with his Epigrams, and other Poetical Conceits, are neither worthy of him nor the light.</p>

There is added, <hi>The Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divers well affected Perſons,</hi> drawn up by HARRINGTON, and containing the Abſtract of his <hi>Oceana;</hi> but preſented to the Houſe of Commons by HENRY NEVIL the 6<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1659, to which a ſatisfactory anſwer was return'd, but nothing don. 6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all theſe, finding his Doctrin of Elections by Balloting not ſo well underſtood as could he deſir'd, he publiſh'd on one ſide of a large ſheet of Paper, his <hi>uſe and manner of the Ballot,</hi> with a copper Cut in the middle repreſenting ſuch an Election in the great Aſſembly of the Commonwealth: but 'tis now inſerted in its proper place in the body of <hi>Oceana.</hi> Moſt of theſe contain Abridgments of his Model, adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the various Circumſtances and Occurrences of thoſe times; but containing likewiſe ſom Materials peculiar to themſelves, and for that reaſon thought fit to be printed a ſecond time. He did not write <hi>the Grounds and Reaſons of Monarchy exemplify'd in the</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Line</hi> (which Book is prefix'd to his Works) but one JOHN HALL, born in the City of <hi>Durham,</hi> educated at <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and a Student of <hi>Grays Inn.</hi> Being commanded by the Council of State (of whom he had a yearly Penſion) to attend OLIVER into <hi>Scotland,</hi> it occaſion'd him to publiſh that Piece.

                  <p n="29">29. HARRINGTON having thus exhauſted all that could be written on this Subject, he likewiſe indeavor'd to promote his Cauſe by public diſcourſes at a nightly meeting of ſeveral curious Gentlemen in the <hi>New Palace Yard</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> This Club was call'd the <hi>Rota,</hi> of which I ſhall give a ſhort account from ANTHONY WOOD, who mortally hated all Republicans, and was as much prejudic'd in favor of the Royaliſts, tho, to his honor be it ſpoken, he never deny'd juſtice to either ſide. <q>Their Diſcourſes about Government, <hi>ſays he,</hi> and of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a Commonwealth, were the moſt ingenious and ſmart that
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:49467:17"/>
ever were heard; for the Arguments in the Parlament houſe were but flat to thoſe. This Gang had a balloting Box, and balloted how things ſhould be carry'd by way of Eſſay; which not being us'd or known in <hi>England</hi> before on this account, the room was every even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very full. Beſides our Author and H. NEVIL, who were the prime men of this Club, were CYRIAC SKINNER, Major WILDMAN, Major VENNER, CHARLES WOLSLEY after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards knighted, ROGER COKE the Author of the <hi>Detection of the four laſt Reigns,</hi> WILLIAM POULTNEY afterwards made a Knight, JOHN AUBRY, MAXIMILIAN PETTY, and Dr. PETTY who was afterwards Sir WILLIAM, Sir JOHN HOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KYNS, and a great many others, ſom wherof are ſtill living.—The Doctrin was very taking, and the more becauſe, as to human foreſight, there was no poſſibility of the King's return. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Parlamentmen hated this Rotation and Balloting, as being againſt their Power. Eight or ten were for it, of which number H. NEVIL was one, who propos'd it to the Houſe, and made it out to the Members, that, except they imbrac'd that ſort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they muſt be ruin'd. The Model of it was, that the third part of the Senat or Houſe ſhould rote out by Ballot every year (not capable of being elected again for three years to com) ſo that every ninth year the Senat would be wholly alter'd. No Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat was to continue above three years, and all to be choſen by the Ballot, than which nothing could be invented more fair and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, as 'twas then thought, tho oppos'd by many for ſeveral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. This Club of Commonwealthſmen laſted till about the 21<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1659, at which time the ſecluded Members being reſtor'd by General GEORGE MONK, all their Models vaniſh'd.</q>

                  <p n="30">30. WHEN the whole matter is duly conſider'd, it's impoſſible a Commonwealth ſhould have ſucceded in <hi>England</hi> at that time, ſince CROMWEL, who alone had the Power, yet wanted the Will to ſet it up. They were comparatively but very few that entertain'd ſuch a Deſign from the beginning of the Troubles; and, as it uſually happens, a great part of theſe did afterwards deſert their Principles, being ſeduc'd by the Honors and Preferments wherby they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Service of the reigning Powers. The body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were either exaſperated on a religious account, only to obtain that Liberty which they afterwards mutually deny'd each other, or by the change of the Balance they grew weary of Monarchy, and did not know it. The Republicans indeed made an advantage of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents to deſtroy the eſtabliſh'd Government, without acquainting 'em with their real Deſigns; and when this was effectually don, the People (who had no ſettl'd Form in their view, and thought all things ſafe by the Victory they had gain'd over the King and the Church) fell in with what was firſt offer'd by thoſe in whom they confided, and would as well have accepted a better Government if they had bin ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd by men of honeſt and public Deſigns. But the Multitude can ſeel, tho they cannot ſee. Inſtead of injoying their deſir'd Liberty, they ſoon ſound themſelves under a moſt heavy Yoke, which they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally labor'd to ſhake off; and yet in all the changes then made, two things were remarkable, that every one of 'em would be ſtil'd a Commonwealth, and yet none of 'em would mend or take warning by the Errors of thoſe that preceded, but ſtill continu'd to abuſe the
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:49467:18"/>
Nation, and unnaturally to ingroſs the Government into a few hands. The People being all this while told they were under a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and not being able to ſee thro the deceit, begun to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves miſtaken in the choice they had made, ſince their ſufferings under theſe pretended Commonwealths were infinitly greater than what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd 'em to diſſolve the former Monarchy. In this condition the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Partys might (as HARRINGTON us'd to ſay) be fitly compar'd to a company of Puppydogs in a bag, where finding themſelves uneaſy for want of room, every one of 'em bites the tail or foot of the next, ſuppoſing that to be the cauſe of his miſery. By this means whatever was ſaid againſt a Commonwealth obtain'd ready belief, as, that it is the moſt ſeditious ſort of Government, and that inſtead of one Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant there are a great many who inrich themſelves by laying intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Taxes on others. All this and much more the People in <hi>England</hi> then experienc'd, and therfore deteſting their new Commonwealth, they reſtor'd the old Monarchy. But to do all Governments the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice due from an impartial Hiſtorian, they never had a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but were interchangeably under Anarchy, Tyranny, and Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy, to which Commonwealths have ever bin the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys, and have frequently lent their voluntary aſſiſtance to deliver other Nations from the like oppreſſions. Thus the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> came to hate the name of a Commonwealth, without loving their Liberty the leſs.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. BUT to return whence we digreſs'd: Our Author, not concern'd in the exceſſive fears and hopes of thoſe that favor'd or oppos'd the Reſtoration of CHARLES the Second, continu'd to live in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner at his one houſe, demeaning himſelf as became a perſon blindly ingag'd to no Party or Factions. But tho his Life was retir'd, it was not ſolitary, being frequented with people of all ſorts, ſom with a malicious deſign to fiſh ſomthing to his prejudice; and others to gain advantage to themſelves by his learned Converſation, or to put him upon ſomthing towards the better ſettlement of the Kingdom. Among theſe there was an eminent Royaliſt who prevail'd with him to draw up ſom Inſtructions for the King's ſervice, wherby he might be inabl'd to govern with ſatisfaction to the People and ſafety to himſelf: which being perform'd and ſign'd with his one hand, his Friend after ſhewing it to ſeveral of the Courtiers, found they did not approve a Scheme that was not likely to further their ſelfiſh Deſigns. At laſt he put his Paper into the hands of a great Miniſter about the King; and how well our Author was rewarded for his good Intentions, we are now going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. About this time he was buſy in reducing his Politics into ſhort and eaſy <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> yet methodically digeſted in their natural order, and ſuted to the moſt vulgar capacitys. Of this he made no ſecret, and freely communicated his Papers to all that viſited him. While he was putting the laſt hand to this Syſtem, and as an innocent man apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of no danger, he was by an Order from the King, on the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1661, ſeiz'd by Sir WILLIAM POULTNEY and others, and committed to the Tower of <hi>London</hi> for treaſonable Deſigns and Practices. He had the written ſheets of his Aphoriſms then lying looſe on the table before him, and underſtanding they intended to carry 'em to the Council, he beg'd the favor that he might ſtitch 'em together; which was granted, and ſo remov'd with ſom other Papers to <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.</hi> I have that Manuſcript now in my hands, and another Copy
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:49467:18"/>
of the ſame which was given me by one of his acquaintance, from both which I have printed it among the reſt of his Works. It is a complete <hi>Syſtem of Politics,</hi> and diſcovers the true Springs of the riſe, temper, and diſſolution of all ſorts of Governments, in a very brief and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous manner.</p>

His Siſters were inconſolable, and the more ſo, the leſs they knew what was laid to their Brother's charge. One of them, who on another occaſion had experienc'd the King's favor, threw her ſelf now at his feet, and petition'd him to have compaſſion on her Brother, who thro a great miſtake was fallen under his Majeſty's diſpleaſure: for as ſhe was ſure that none of his Subjects exceded his Loyalty, ſo his Majeſty might ſee he was not the man they deſign'd, ſince the Warrant was for Sir JAMES HARRINGTON, wheras her Brother was never honor'd with ſuch a Title by his Majeſty's Anceſtors, and he would not have accepted it from OLIVER. To this the King made anſwer, that tho they might be miſtaken in his Title, he doubted he might be found more guilty of the Crimes alleg'd againſt him, than he wiſh'd any Brother of hers to be. Then ſhe preſs'd he might be examin'd before his Majeſty, or be brought to a ſpeedy trial. Shortly after my Lord LAUDERDALE, Sir GEORGE CARTERET, and Sir EDWARD WALKER were ſent to the Tower to queſtion him about a Plot which, they ſaid, he had contriv'd againſt his Majeſty's Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At this he was extraordinarily reviv'd, not being able to divine before the cauſe of his Confinement, and knowing himſelf wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of this Charge. He found means to tranſmit a Copy of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination to his Siſters, giving 'em leave to publiſh it, which was never hitherto don, and is as follows.</p>

                     <p>MY Lord, in the Preamble you charge me with being emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in Principles contrary to the King's Government, and the Laws of this Nation. Som, my Lord, have aggravated this, ſaying, that <hi>I being a privat man have bin ſo mad as to meddle with Politics: what had a privat man to do with Government?</hi> My Lord, there is not any public Perſon, not any Magiſtrat, that has written in the Politics worth a button. All they that have bin excellent in this way, have bin privat men, as privat men, my Lord, as my ſelf. There is PLATO, there is ARISTOTLE, there is LIVY, there is MACCHIAVEL. My Lord, I can ſum up ARISTOTLE'S <hi>Politics</hi> in a very few words;
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:49467:20"/>
he ſays there is the barbarous Monarchy (ſuch a one where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have no Votes in making the Laws) he ſays there is the Heroic Monarchy (ſuch a one where the People have their Votes in making the Laws) and then he ſays there is Democracy; and affirms that a man cannot be ſaid to have Liberty, but in a Democracy only.</p>
                     <p>MY Lord LAUDERDALE, who thus far had bin very attentive, at this ſhew'd ſom impatience.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                     <p>I SAY, ARISTOTLE ſays ſo; I have not ſaid ſo much. And under what Prince was it? Was it not under ALEXANDER, the greateſt Prince then in the World? I beſeech you, my Lord, did ALEXANDER hang up ARISTOTLE, did he moleſt him? LIVY for a Commonwealth is one of the fulleſt Authors; did not he write under AUGUSTUS CAESAR? did CAESAR hang up LIVY, did he moleſt him? MACCHIAVEL what a Commonwealthſman was he? but he wrote under the <hi>Medici</hi> when they were Princes in <hi>Florence;</hi> did they hang up MACCHIAVEL, or did they moleſt him? I have don no otherwiſe than as the greateſt Politicians, the King will do no otherwiſe than as the greateſt Princes. But, my Lord, theſe Authors had not that to ſay for themſelves that I have; I did not write under a Prince, I wrote under a Uſurper, OLIVER. He having ſtarted up into the Throne, his Officers (as pretending to be for a Commonwealth) kept a murmuring, at which he told them that he knew not what they meant, nor themſelves; but let any of them ſhew him what they meant by a Commonwealth (or that there was any ſuch thing) they ſhould ſee that he ſought not himſelf: the Lord knew he ſought not himſelf, but to make good the Cauſe. Upon this ſom ſober men came to me and told me, if any man in <hi>England</hi> could ſhew what a Commonwealth was, it was my ſelf. Upon this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion I wrote; and after I had written, OLIVER never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd his Officers as he had don before, therfore I wrote not againſt the King's Government. And for the Law, if the Law could have puniſh'd me, OLIVER had don it; therfore my Writing was not obnoxious to the Law. After OLIVER the Parlament ſaid they were a Commonwealth; I ſaid they were not, and prov'd it: inſomuch that the Parlament accounted me a Cavalier, and one that had no other deſign in my writing, than to bring in the King; and now the King firſt of any man makes me a Roundhead.</p>

                     <p>THESE things are out of doors; if you be no Plotter, the King dos not reflect upon your Writings.</p>
                     <p>AND ſo riſing up, they went out: my Lord being at the head of the ſtairs, I ſaid to him, My Lord, there is one thing more; you tax me with Ingratitude to the King, who had ſuffer'd me to live undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd: truly, my Lord, had I bin taken right by the King, it had (by this Example already given) bin no more than my due. But I know well enough I have bin miſtaken by the King; the King ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking me for no Friend, and yet uſing me not as an Enemy, is ſuch a thing as I have mention'd to all I have convers'd with, as a high Character of Ingenuity and Honor in the King's Nature.</p>

That their firſt Conſideration was how to agree on the choice of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamentmen againſt the inſuing Seſſion; and that a ſpecial care ought to be had about Members for the City of <hi>London,</hi> as a precedent for the reſt of the Kingdom to follow, wherupon they nominated the four Members after choſen, and now ſitting in Parlament: but three of theſe, being then preſent, ſtood up, and clear'd themſelves of this Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Their next care was to frame a Petition to the Parlament for a preaching Miniſtry, and Liberty of Conſcience. Then they were to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and ſubdivide themſelves into ſeveral Councils and Committees, for the better carrying on their buſineſs by themſelves or their Agents and Accomplices all over the Kingdom. In theſe Meetings HARRING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON was ſaid to be often in the Chair; that they had taken an Oath of Secrecy, and concerted meaſures for levying Men and Mony.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. THE Chancellor added, that tho he had certain Information of the times and places of their meetings, and particularly thoſe of HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINGTON and WILDMAN, they were nevertheleſs ſo fixt in their nefarious deſign, that none of thoſe they had taken would confeſs any thing, not ſo much as that they had ſeen or ſpoken to one another at thoſe times or places; which obſtinacy, he thought, muſt needs procede from a faithfulneſs to their Oath. But a Committee of Lords and Commons, after ſeveral ſittings, could make nothing of this imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Plot, and did not ever name our Author in all their Reports.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. HIS Siſters in the mean time being impatient to ſee him, and to know his Condition, after ſeveral fruitleſs Petitions, obtain'd an order of Council at laſt to be admitted into the Tower, where they found him barbarouſly treated by the Lieutenant, whom they ſoften'd into more humanity with a preſent of fifty pounds under the notion of Fees. By them he deliver'd a Petition to the King, importing that in the late times he was no public Perſon, nor acted to any man's detriment in his Life, Body, or Eſtate, but on the contrary had don his indeavors to help all perſons in diſtreſs; that he had oppos'd the Uſurper in ſuch a manner as was judg'd even by the Royaliſts themſelves to be very much to his diſadvantage; and that it was not probable that he, who had liv'd ſo peaceably before, would attemt any Novelty after his Majeſty's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration: wherfore he beg'd the favor of a public Trial, or a more eaſy confinement. But tho he had bin now a priſoner during the ſpace of five months, neither he nor any on his behalf could receive an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their Petitions; which made him ſomwhat impatient, not ſo much to injoy his Liberty, as to vindicat himſelf from the baſe Aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Enemys. He therfore continually urg'd his ſiſter ASHTON to procure him a Trial, which ſhe not being able to effect, he petition'd the Parlament, ſhewing that he had lain a cloſe Priſoner in the Tower for five months upon a bare ſuſpicion of ſom diſaffection to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in all his Examinations did not in the leaſt appear; and that he hop'd e'er that time ſo to have clear'd his innocence by a public
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:49467:21"/>
Trial, as to deſerve his Liberty. But becauſe he underſtood theſe matters were in ſom meaſure repreſented to their Houſe, he would not preſume, without firſt making his application to them, to ſue for his freedom by other legal means. <q>May it therfore pleaſe this honorable Houſe, ſays he, to take tender conſideration of the ſufferings of an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> hitherto innocent; and that the long continuance of him in priſon without trial may be hereafter the caſe of others, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for the like caſe: and that this honorable Houſe would pleaſe to move his Majeſty that your Petitioner may be proceded againſt by a legal way of Trial, or that he may have his freedom; that ſo he may no longer languiſh in Priſon to the ruin of his Health and Eſtate.</q> Theſe are not the words of a man conſcious of Guilt, or afraid of Power.</p>

BUT his cloſe reſtraint to this ſmall ſpot of Earth, where there was no freſh Water, and ſcarce any room to move his Body, quickly chang'd the ſtate of his Health; this occaſion'd him to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition he might be remov'd to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> which was granted, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther WILLIAM, and his Uncle ANTHONY SAMUEL, obliging themſelves in a Bond of 5000 <hi>l.</hi> for his ſafe Impriſonment. Here he had not only the liberty of walking on the Hoe, but was alſo us'd with extraordinary Reſpect by the Deputy Governor of the Fort Sir JOHN SKELTON, who frequently invited him to his Table, and much lov'd his Converſation. Among the other Acquaintance he made at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> one was Dr. DUNSTAN, who advis'd him to take a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> in Coffee, as a certain cure for the Scurvy, with which he was then troubl'd. He drank of this Liquor in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titys, every morning and evening. But after uſing it for ſom time, his Siſters, to their no ſmall amazement, receiv'd no more Anſwers to their Letters. At length Advice was brought 'em from his Landlady, that his Fancy was much diſorder'd, and deſiring ſom body might com to look after him. Immediatly one of them addreſs'd her ſelf to the Earl of <hi>Bath,</hi> then chief Governor of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd him of his Priſoner's ſad condition. This noble Lord, who
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:49467:21"/>
laid many Obligations on him before, and gave frequent orders for his good Uſage, went hereupon to intercede for him with the King, repreſenting the danger of his Life if he were not remov'd from that unwholſom place to <hi>London,</hi> where he might have the Advice of able Phyſicians: and the King was accordingly pleas'd to grant a Warrant for his Releaſe, ſince nothing appear'd againſt him ſupported by good Proof or probable Preſumtions.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. THE next day the Lady ASHTON, with another of his Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, took their Journy towards <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where they found their poor Brother ſo transform'd in Body and Mind, that they ſcarce could perſuade themſelves it was the ſame perſon. He was reduc'd to a Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton, not able to walk alone, ſlept very little, his imagination diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb'd, often fainted when he took his drink, and yet ſo fond of it that he would by no means be advis'd to forbear it. Dr. PRUJEAN, and other eminent Phyſicians, greatly blam'd Dr. DUNSTAN'S pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, giving their Opinion under their hands that <hi>Guaiacum</hi> and the other drying things, which he adminiſter'd to his Patient in Coffee, were enough of themſelves to beget Melancholy or Phrenzy, where there was no previous diſpoſition to it. A rumor at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> that HARRINGTON had taken ſom drink which would make any man mad in a month; the ſurlineſs of his Doctor, and ſomthing blab'd by a Maid that was put againſt his will to attend him, made his Siſter ſuſpect he had ſoul play leſt he ſhould write any more <hi>Oceanas.</hi> 'Tis certain, that (tho his Recovery was never perfect) he mended finely as ſoon as he was perſuaded to abſtain from this Liquor. In leſs than a month he was able to bear the Journy to <hi>London</hi> in a Coach, where he was no ſooner arriv'd but Sir JOHN SKELTON, who was then in Town, paid him a viſit. My Lady ASHTON com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to him that ſhe had not timely notice of her Brother's Diſtemper, he proteſted he would have ſent her word of it, had not his Doctor aſſur'd him that he only counterfeited; and yet at the ſame time he made him take ſtrong Doſes of <hi>Hellebor,</hi> and God knows what beſides.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. HE paſt ſom time at <hi>Aſhted</hi> in <hi>Surrey</hi> to drink the <hi>Epſom</hi>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters, by which he found no benefit. At <hi>London</hi> he was put wholly under the care of Doctor PRUJEAN, who with all his Art could afford little help to the weakneſs of his Body, and none at all to the diſorder of his Mind, to his dying day. He was allow'd to diſcourſe of moſt other things as rationally as any man, except his own Diſtemper, fancying ſtrange things in the operation of his animal Spirits, which he thought to tranſpire from him in the ſhape of Birds, of Flys, of Bees, or the like. And thoſe about him reported that he talk'd much of good and evil Spirits, which made them have frightful apprehenſions. But he us'd, they ſaid, ſomtimes to argue ſo ſtrenuouſly that this was no deprav'd imagination, that his Doctor was often put to his ſhifts for an Anſwer. He would on ſuch occaſions compare himſelf to DEMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRITUS, who for his admirable diſcoverys in Anatomy was reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd diſtracted by his fellow Citizens, till HIPPOCRATES cur'd 'em of their miſtake. I confeſs I did not know at firſt what to make of theſe things from the informations of his Acquaintance, till I met with a Letter of Dr. BURTHOGGE to his Siſter, wherin are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd certain Querys propos'd to him by HARRINGTON, with a ſtate of his Caſe written by the Doctor, who was his intimat Friend,

and a very good judg, whether conſider'd as a Phyſician or a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, as appears by his late Treatiſe <hi>of the Soul of the World,</hi> &amp;c. and as I have particular reaſon to affirm from his Letters to my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ASHTON, which are all now before me. Among other things the Doctor ſays, that he ever expreſt the higheſt ſatisfaction in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what he had at any time written, as the beſt Service he was capable to do his Country, and ſincerely intended by him to the glory of God, which he thought in ſom meaſure to be the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: ſo far was he from being under any remorſe of Conſcience on that ſcore, as his ill wiſhers maliciouſly reported. Now, tho I was ſomwhat ſtagger'd concerning the nature of his Diſtemper by Dr. BURTHOGGE'S Letter, I grew perfectly amaz'd when I found among his Papers the beginning of a little Treatiſe written by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wherin (without raillery) he proves 'em to be all mad that thought him ſo with reſpect to what he diſcours'd of Nature, which he maintain'd to work mechanically or mathematically, as BELLINI, BORELLI, Dr. PITCAIRNS, and other eminent men have ſince evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhewn. It appears there that his pretended Viſions of Angels and Devils were nothing elſe but good or bad animal Spirits, and that his Flys and Bees were only Similitudes wherby he us'd to expreſs the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious figures and forms of thoſe Particles. I own that he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably enough be much decay'd in his underſtanding, by reaſon of his great and long weakneſs of body; but I ſhall never be convinc'd that he was delirious in that only inſtance which they allege: and to ſatisfy the Learned in this point (which, in my opinion, is a memorable Story that concerns 'em all) I ſhall ſubjoin his own diſcourſe to this Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>

An action that will better perſuade the world he was not truly himſelf, was his marrying in this condition. The Lady was a very agreable woman, whoſe Perſon and Converſation he always admir'd; ſhe was the Daughter of Sir MARMADUKE DORREL of <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> fam'd for wit more than became her pretenſions to good ſenſe, had long liv'd among his Relations with the reſpect of a Friend and a Siſter; but now would needs change the office of a voluntary Attendant for the name of a Wife. It ſoon appear'd that this match was not ſo much diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted as ſhe would pretend, which occaſion'd ſom difference between 'em; but they were quickly reconcil'd, and ſhe was always treated by him afterwards with the higheſt Generoſity, tho ſhe did not uſe him ſo handſomly when they were both young and healthy, and might have made a more ſeaſonable match than at this time. Towards his latter end he was ſubject to the Gout, and injoy'd little eaſe, but languiſhing and drooping a good while, he fell at laſt into a Palſy, and departed this Life at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> in the Year 1677 (leaving his Eſtate to his Brother's Children) and lys bury'd there in S. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s Church, on the South ſide of the Altar, next to the Grave of Sir WAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER RALEIGH, with this Inſcription over him: <hi>Hic jacet</hi> JACOBUS HARRINGTON <hi>Armiger (ſilius maximus natu</hi> SAPCOTIS HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINGTON <hi>de Rand, in Com.

42. THUS dy'd JAMES HARRINGTON, whoſe Name is ſure to live ſo long as Learning and Liberty bear any Reputation in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But tho he did not think ſo highly of himſelf, yet he was ſtrongly perſuaded that his <hi>Oceana</hi> was the Model of an equal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, or a Government wherin no Party can be at variance with or gaining ground upon another, and never to be conquer'd by any foren Power; whence he concluded it muſt needs be likewiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal: for as the People, who are the materials, never dy; ſo the Form, which is the Motion, muſt (without ſom oppoſition) be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. The <hi>Immortality of a Commonwealth</hi> is ſuch a new and curious Problem, that I could not aſſure my ſelf of the Reader's pardon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving him ſom brief account of the Arguments for it, and they run much after this manner. The perfection of Government is ſuch a Libration in the frame of it, that no Man or Men under it can have the intereſt, or (having the intereſt) can have the power to diſturb it with Sedition. This will be granted at firſt ſight, and HARRING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON appeals to all Mankind, whether his <hi>Oceana</hi> (examin'd by this principle) be not ſuch an equal Government, completely and intirely fram'd in all its neceſſary Orders or fundamental Laws, without any contradiction to it ſelf, to Reaſon, or Truth. If this be ſo (as the contrary dos not yet appear) then it has no internal cauſe of Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently ſuch a Government can never be ruin'd any way; for he further ſhews (what all Hiſtory cannot contradict) that a Commonwealth, if not firſt broken or divided by Factions at home, was never conquer'd by the Arms of any Monarch from the beginning of the World to this day: but the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> having no Factions within, and ſo not to be conquer'd from without, is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an equal, perfect, and immortal Government. For want of this equality in the frame he clearly demonſtrats how the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths of <hi>Rome, Athens,</hi> and others, came to be deſtroy'd by their contending and ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>topping partys; wheras that of <hi>Venice</hi> can never change or finiſh. He proves that this Equality is yet more wanting in Monarchys; for in abſolute Monarchy (as that of the <hi>Turk,</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) the <hi>Janizarys</hi> have frequent intereſt, and perpetual power to raiſe Sedition to the ruin of the Emperor, and, when they pleaſe, of the Empire: This cannot be ſaid of the Armys of <hi>Oceana,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an abſolute Monarchy is no perfect Government. In what they improperly call a mix'd Monarchy the Nobility are ſomtimes putting Chains on the King, at other times domineering over the People; the King is either oppreſſing the People without control, or contending with the Nobility as their Protectors; and the People are frequently in arms againſt both King and Nobility, till at laſt one of the three Eſtates becoms maſter of the other two, or till they ſo mutually weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en one another that either they fall a prey to ſom more potent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or naturally grow into a Commonwealth: therfore mixt Monarchy is not a perfect Government; and if no ſuch Partys or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions can poſſibly exiſt in <hi>Oceana,</hi> then on the contrary is it a moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, perfect, and immortal Commonwealth, <hi>Quod erat demonſtrandum.</hi>

                     <p>I AM diſpos'd to believe that my Lady ASHTON'S memory fail'd her, when ſhe ſaid that her Brother was at <hi>Rome</hi> during the Jubilee; for as Chronology ſeems to contradict it, ſo ſhe might eaſily miſtake the Jubilee for the Ceremony of conſecrating Candles, or any other ſolemnity; his remarks being equally applicable to all thoſe of the Popiſh Church. But as to the whole of this Hiſtory, tho it be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd with due moderation, and contains nothing but bare matters of fact, or ſuch obſervations as they naturally ſuggeſt; yet I was ſenſible before I wrote it, that I could not eſcape the diſpleaſure of three ſorts of perſons: ſuch as have reſolv'd to be angry at whatever I do; ſuch as neither rightly underſtand what is written by me nor any body elſe; and thoſe who, without any particular ſpite againſt an Author, yet to get a penny will pretend to anſwer any book that makes a conſiderable figure. Therfore I find my ſelf oblig'd beforehand to diſclaim all explanations made of my meaning, beyond what is warranted by the expreſs words of my Book; having conſtantly indeavor'd not only to write intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly, but ſo as that none can poſſibly miſunderſtand me. I renounce all the deſigns that may be imputed to me by ſuch as are ſo far from being admitted into my ſecret, that they were never in my company; but I ſpecially diſown whatever is ſaid by thoſe who firſt preſume to divine my thoughts, and then to vent their own raſh conjectures as my undoubted opinions. I ſlight their artifice who, when unable to object againſt the point in queſtion, labor to ingage their Adverſary in matters wholly beſides the purpoſe; and when their Evaſions have no better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune than their Attacks, fall to railing againſt his Perſon, becauſe they cannot confute his Arguments. I am as much above the malice of ſom, as they are below my reſentments; and I wou'd at any time chuſe to be rather the object of their Envy than of their Favor: but as I am far from thinking my ſelf exemt from all the indiſcretions of Youth, or the frailtys of human Nature; ſo I am not conſcious of entertaining higher thoughts of my own performances than are becoming, or meaner of other mens than they deſerve. I know that to enterprize any thing out of the common road is to undergo undoubted envy or peril; and that he, who is not beforehand reſolv'd to bear oppoſition, will never do any great or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial exploit: yet 'tis no ſmall incouragement to me, that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world to this time not a ſingle inſtance can be produc'd of one who either was or would be eminent, but he met with Enemys to his perſon and fame. Notwithſtanding this conſideration be juſt, yet if I write any thing hereafter (either as oblig'd by Duty, or to amuze idle time) I have determin'd it ſhall not concern perſonal diſputes, or the narrow intereſts of jarring Factions, but ſomthing of univerſal benefit, and which all ſides may indifferently read. Without ſuch provocations as no man ought to indure, this is my fix'd reſolution; and I particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire that none may blame me for acting otherwiſe, who force me to do ſo themſelves. I ſhall never be wanting to my own defence, when either the Cauſe or the Aggreſſor deſerves it: for as to thoſe Authors who conceal their names, if they write matters of fact 'tis a ſign they cannot make them good; and all men are agreed to reject their Teſtimony, except ſuch as reſolve to deny others common juſtice: but the ill opinion of theſe prejudic'd perſons can no more injure any
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:49467:24"/>
man, than their good opinion will do him honor. Beſides other reaſons of mentioning my ſuppos'd deſigns, one is to diſabuſe ſeveral people who (as I am told) are made to believe that in the Hiſtory of SOCRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TES I draw a Parallel between that Philoſopher and JESUS CHRIST. This is a moſt ſcandalous and unchriſtian calumny, as will more fully appear to the world whenever the Book it ſelf is publiſh'd: for that I have bin ſom time about it, I freely avow; yet not in the manner thoſe officious Informers report, but as becoms a diſintereſted Hiſtorian, and a friend to all mankind.</p>

                     <p>HAVING bin about nine months, ſom ſay in a Diſeaſe, I in a Cure, I have bin the wonder of Phyſicians, and they mine; not but that we might have bin reconcil'd, for Books (I grant) if they keep cloſe to Nature muſt be good ones, but I deny that Nature is bound to Books. I am no ſtudy'd Naturaliſt, having long ſince given over that Philoſophy as inſcrutable and incertain: for thus I thought with my ſelf; <q>Nature, to whom it is given to work as it were under her Veil or behind the Curtain, is the Art of God: now if there be Arts of Men who have wrought open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough to the underſtanding (for example that of <hi>TITIAN)</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs whoſe excellency I ſhall never reach; How ſhall I thus, ſticking in the Bark at the Arts of Men, be able to look thence to the Roots, or dive into the Abyſs of things in the Art of God?</q> And nevertheleſs, <hi>Si placidum caput undis extulerit,</hi> ſhould Nature afford me a ſight of her, I do not think ſo meanly of my ſelf but that I would know her as ſoon as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tho more learn'd man. Laying therfore Arts wholly, and Books almoſt all aſide, I ſhall truly deliver to the world how I felt and ſaw Nature; that is, how ſhe came firſt into my ſenſes, and by the ſenſes into my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Yet for the ſake of my Readers, and alſo for my own, I muſt invert the order of my Diſcourſe; For theirs, becauſe, till I can ſpeak to men that have had the ſame Senſations with my ſelf, I muſt ſpeak to ſuch as have a like underſtanding with others: For my own, becauſe, being like in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to be the Monky that play'd at Cheſs with his Maſter, I have need of ſom Cuſhion on my head, that being in all I have ſpoken hitherto more laid at than my Reaſon. My Diſcourſe then is to conſiſt of two parts: the firſt, in which I appeal to his underſtanding who will uſe his Reaſon, is a Platform of Nature drawn out in certain Aphoriſms; and the ſecond, in which I ſhall appeal to his ſenſes who in a Diſeaſe very common will make further trial, is a Narrative of my Caſe.</p>

                     <p n="6">6. THO Nature be not fallible, yet ſhe is limited, and can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above her matter; therfore no Miracles are to be expected from her.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. AS Defects, Redundancys, or ſuch other rude qualitys of matter, ought not to be attributed to the Artificer or his Art; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Nature, or the Art of God, to be charg'd with Monſters or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, the things ſo reputed being the regular Effects both of the Matter and the Art that forms it.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. NATURE is not only a Spirit, but is furniſh'd, or rather fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes her ſelf with innumerable miniſterial Spirits, by which ſhe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats on her whole matter, as the Univerſe; or on the ſeparat parts, as man's Body.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. THESE miniſterial Spirits are certain Aethereal Particles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly mix'd with elementary Matter; they work ordinarily unſeen or unfelt, and may be call'd Animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. AS in ſound Bodys there muſt needs be GOOD SPIRITS managing the Oeconomy of Health; ſo in unſound Bodies, as in chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſes, there muſt needs be EVIL SPIRITS managing the Oeconomy of Diſtempers.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. ANIMAL Spirits, whether in the Univerſe, or in man's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are good or evil Spirits, according to the Matter wherin and wherof they are generated.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. WHAT is a good Spirit to one Creature, is evil to another, as the food of ſom Beaſts is poiſon to man; whence the gentleneſs of the Dove, and the fierceneſs of the Hauk.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. BETWEEN the Animal Spirits of the whole or Univerſe, and of the parts, as of man's Body, there is an intercourſe or coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which preſerves the common order of Nature unſeen; and in ſom things often foretels or diſcovers it, which is what we call <hi>Prefages, Signs,</hi> and <hi>Prodigys.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. THE work of good Spirits, as Health for example, is felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and as it were Angelical; and that of evil Spirits, as in Diſeaſes, is noxious, and as it were diabolical, a ſort of faſcination or witchcraft.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. ALL Fermentation is caus'd by unlocking, unbinding, or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting looſe of Spirits; as all Attenuation is occaſion'd by ſtirring, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or provoking of Spirits; and all Tranſpiration by the emiſſion or ſending abroad of Spirits.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. NOTHING in Nature is annihilated or loſt, and therfore whatever is tranſpir'd, is receiv'd and put to ſom uſe by the Spirits of the Univerſe.</p>

17. SCARCE any man but at ſom time or other has felt ſuch a motion as Country people call the <hi>Lifeblood;</hi> if in his Ey, perhaps there has flown out ſomthing like a dusky cloud, which is a tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or emiſſion of Spirits; perhaps as it were a flaſh of Fire, which alſo was an emiſſion of Spirits, but differenc'd according to the matter wherin and wherof they were wrought, as Choler, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. ANIMAL Spirits are ordinarily emitted ſtreaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into various figures, anſwerable to little arms or hands, by which they work out the matter by Tranſpiration, no otherwiſe than they unlock'd it, and wrought it up in the body by attenuation, that is, by manufacture: for theſe operations are perfectly mechanical, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right handywork as any in our ſhops or workhouſes.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. IF we find Nature in her operations not only uſing hands, but likewiſe ſomthing analogous to any Art, Tool, Engin, or Inſtrument which we have or uſe, it cannot be ſaid that Nature had theſe things of men, becauſe we know that men muſt have theſe things of Nature.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. IN Attenuation and Tranſpiration, where the matter of the Diſeaſe is not only copious but inveterat, the Work will not as I may ſay be inarticulat, as in the trembling call'd the Lifeblood; but articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, and obviouſly ſo to the ſenſe of the Patient by immediat ſtrokes of the Humor upon his Organs, which ſomtimes may be ſtrong enough (tho not ordinarily) to reach anothers.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. NATURE can work no otherwiſe than as God taught her, nor any man than as ſhe taught him.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. WHEN I ſee a curious piece from the hands of an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, I cannot imagin that his Maſter was a bungler, or that he wrought not after the ſame manner as his Servant learn'd of him; which I apply to God and Nature.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. PHYSICIANS ſomtimes take the PRUDENCE of Nature for the PHRENSY of the Patient.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. IF any man can ſhew why theſe things are not thus, or that they may be otherwiſe, then I have don, and there is ſaid in this part already more than enough; but if they can neither ſhew that theſe things are not thus, nor know how they ſhould be otherwiſe, then ſo far I ſtand my ground, and am now arm'd for my Narrative <hi>Cap a pè.</hi>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THERE is nothing that has more confounded Knowledge among men, than the reciprocal violences of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and the Will; or, to ſpeak plainly, the Paſſion of the one and Blindneſs of the other: Since ſom by chance or intereſt take up Principles which they force the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding by ſtrain'd Arguments to maintain; others by the habit of ſom Opinion ſo bewitch the Will into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, that they can never quit it, even after confutation. To remedy this Diſorder, ſince I had reſolv'd with my ſelf to ſay ſomthing to this Point (which tho it be but as a ſmall Wyre, yet the great weight of civil Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity lys upon it) I knew no better Method than to take the Scales from the Eys of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and to ſhew the Will how better to bring about her great Deſign of Good. And in the proſecution of this, I would not skirmiſh with every Argument, which had bin a thing of immenſe ſlavery, and not for every Ey; but I choſe rather to ſtrike at the Foundations, that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding might loſe its Paſſion, and more freely conſider upon what Quickſands they lay. And in this I needed not to be poſitive, becauſe I undertake a Task in which moſt Men are commonly ſuccesful, that is, to ſupport Error rather than to aſſert Truth. Hence I conſider Kingſhip ſimply, not troubling my ſelf to maintain any other Form, or to conſider Oaths, Ends, Changes of Government, or the particular Neceſſity or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Safety: they being diſtinct Conſiderations and Subjects by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Now if this negative Method ſatisfys not, I ſee no ſuch great cauſe to be diſcourag'd; for, I confeſs, I do not perceive it ſo eaſy a thing to diſcover an Error; and I had rather tell a Man he was out of the way, than by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to bring him to the end of his Journy, lead him further about. And it is my opinion, that as Scepticiſm is not only uſeleſs, but dangerous; if in ſetting our Thoughts in a poſture of Defence, it makes us abſolutely wavering and incredulous: yet had I rather be ſceptical in my Opinion, than maintain it upon grounds taken upon truſt, and not demonſtrated.</p>
                  <p>THE Second Part is merely an inſtance accommodated to the Arguments of the Firſt, wherin I would not be underſtood to be a Writer of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome (for I have other Imployments for my Time and Thoughts, and thoſe nobler too) but to ſet down a true Series by way of Example; and therfore I was only to note Acceſſes to Government, and Receſſes from it, with the Effects proceding from the Perſons of Governors. And here as I needed not much trouble Chronology: So leſt it might be a bare <hi>Sceleton,</hi> I ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſom Obſervations that came to hand, and ſeem to afford either Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. Thus much, leſt I might be miſunderſtood, I thought neceſſary to premiſe.</p>

                  <head>THE Grounds and Reaſons OF MONARCHY.</head>
                  <head type="sub">The Firſt Part.</head>
                  <p>I HAVE often thought it ſtrange, that among all the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either paſt or preſent, the <hi>Monarchical</hi> ſhould ſo far in Extent and Number excede the <hi>Popular,</hi> as that they could never yet com into compariſon. I could never be perſuaded but it was more happy for a People to be diſpos'd of by a number of Perſons joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſted and concern'd with them, than to be number'd as the Herd and Inheritance of One, to whoſe Luſt and Madneſs they were abſolutely ſubject; and that any Man of the weakeſt Reaſon and Generoſity would not rather chuſe for his Habitation that ſpot of Earth where there was acceſs to Honor by Virtue, and no Worth could be excluded, rather than that where all Advancement ſhould procede from the Will of one ſcarcely hearing and ſeeing with his own Organs, and gain'd for the moſt part by means leud and indirect: and all this in the end to amount to nothing elſe but a more ſplendid and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Slavery. To clear this Point, I conſider'd how inſcrutably Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence carrys on the turns and ſtops of all Governments, ſo that moſt People rather found than made them. The Conſtitutions of Men, ſom not fit to be Maſters of their Liberty, ſom not capable, ſom not willing; the Ambition of ſettled Tyrants, who breaking their own Bonds have brought in violent Alterations; and laſtly, civil Diſcord, have either corrupted or alter'd better Settlements.</p>
                  <p>BUT theſe are Obſervations rather than Arguments, and relate to Fact rather than Reaſon. That which aſtoniſh'd me moſt was to ſee thoſe of this Heroic and Learn'd Age, not only not riſing to Thoughts of Liberty, but inſtead therof fooliſhly turning their Wits and Swords againſt themſelves in the maintenance of them whoſe Slaves they are: and indeed they can be no weak Cauſes that produce ſo long and ſettled a Diſtemper; tho ſom of thoſe I mention'd, if not moſt of them, are the true ones.</p>
                  <p>HE knows nothing that knows not how ſuperſtitiouſly the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mankind is given to retain Traditions, and how pertinacious they are in the maintenance of their firſt Prejudices, inſomuch that a Diſcovery or more refin'd Reaſon is as inſupportable to them, as the Sun is to an Ey newly brought out of Darkneſs. Hence Opiniative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (which is commonly proportion'd to their Ignorance) and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Obſtinacy ſomtimes to Death and Ruin. So that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if we ſee many Gentlemen, whoſe Education inabled them only
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49467:28"/>
to uſe their Senſes and firſt Thoughts, ſo dazled with the Splendor of a Court, prepoſſeſt with the Affection of a Prince, or bewitch'd with ſom ſubdolous Favor, that they chuſe rather any hazard than the Inchantment ſhould be diſſolv'd. Others, perhaps a degree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove theſe, yet in reſpect of ſom Title ſtuck upon the Family (which has bin as fortunat a Myſtery of Kingcraft as any other) or in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſom glorious former Atchievements (minding not that in all theſe caſes the People are the only effective means, and the King only imaginary) think they ſhould degenerat from Bravery in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Change. Others are witheld by Sloth and Timorouſneſs, either not daring, or unwilling to be happy; ſom looking no further than their privat Welfare, indifferent at the multiplication of public Evils; others (and theſe the worſt of all) out of a pravity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſacrificing to their Ambition and Avarice, and in order to that, following any Power, concurring with any Machinations, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting their Authors: while Princes themſelves (train'd up in theſe Arts, or receiving them by Tradition) know how to wind all their humors to their own advantage, now foiſting the Divinity of their Titles into Pulpits, now amuzing the People with Pomp and Shews, now diverting their hot Spirits to ſom unprofitable foren War (mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to their accurs'd ends of Revenge or Glory, with the effuſion of that Blood which ſhould be as dear to them as their own) now ſtroking the People with ſom feeble but inforc'd Law, for which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they will be paid (and 'tis obſerv'd, the moſt notorious Tyrants have taken this Courſe) now giving up the eminenteſt of their Miniſters (which they part with as indifferently as their Robes) to the Rage and Fury of the People; ſo that they are commanded and condemn'd by the ſame Mouth, and the credulous and ignorant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their King divinely ſet over them, ſit ſtill, and by degrees grow into Quiet and Admiration, eſpecially if lul'd aſleep with ſom ſmall continuance of Peace (be it never ſo injuſt, unſound, or dangerous) as if the Body Politic could not languiſh of an internal Diſeaſe, tho its Complexion be freſh and chearful.</p>
                  <p>THOSE are the Reaſons which (if I conceive aright) have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pify'd the leſs knowing part of Mankind. Now, how the more ſearching part have ſoodly miſcarry'd, will fall under conſideration.</p>
                  <p>FIRST then, we need not take the pains to demonſtrat how eaſy a thing it is for men of Acuteneſs, not converſant in Civil Affairs, not only to miſcarry in the Apprehenſion, but even in their Judgment of them: for they, inſtead of bringing the Series and Reaſon of things into Rule and Method, uſe on the contrary to meaſure them by their own preſuppos'd Speculation; and by that means becom incapable of weighing rightly the various Incidences and Circumſtances of Buſineſs. For it is to be obſerv'd, that the Theorems of no Art or Profeſſion are either more eaſily found, or of more difficult practice than thoſe of Policy; ſo that it is no wonder if Men merely contemplative, fail ſo oft in the very laying of Grounds, as we ſhall anon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſtance. Now how fruitful Daintys Error and Abſurdity are, we all know. But more eſpecially the Contentions of contemplative Men are moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, various, and endleſs; for wrangling is with them an Art, and they are indu'd with that ungenerous Shame, never to acknowlege their Miſtakes. Moreover, their Principles are moſt times ill-grounded, and it is to be fear'd that in their Superſtructures they as often call in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49467:28"/>
their Imaginations as their Judgment to frame Arguments. Beſides, theſe men fighting only with Pen, Ink and Paper, ſeldom arrive at a means to decide the Quarrel, by which he that gains the laſt word is ſuppos'd Conqueror; or the other leaves almoſt as inglorious a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to the Victor, as if he had bin overthrown.</p>
                  <p>THAT which I would infer from all this, is, that the Generality of ſpeculative Men, for the moſt part guiding their Underſtandings by thoſe Notions which they find in Books, fall not ſeldom by this means into conſiderable Errors. For all Books, thoſe I mean that are human, and fall directly under our Conſideration, either lay down practical Things and Obſervations of Kingſhip, or ſom general and univerſal Notions, or elſe controverſially aſſert <hi>Monarchy</hi> againſt ſom Oppoſers. Now in the two latter there are generally found two grand and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Fallacys, the firſt wherof is, that they fraudulently converſe in Generals, and (to borrow the School-terms) ſpeak of that in the <hi>Abſtract</hi> which they ſhould do in the <hi>Concrete:</hi> As for example, where they ſhould aſſert the particular Right of this or that Prince, they cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly or ignorantly lay out moſt of their Diſcourſe about <hi>Monarchy</hi> in general, and often weary and amaze the Diſpute before they com to the true ground and ſtating of the Quarrel, wherby the Readers (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by ſuch Prepoſſeſſion, and intangled by general Notions of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Power and Government) ſeldom deſcend into the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Particulars, where the great Scruple and Difficulty for the moſt part lys. So that any King (be his Acceſs to the Government never ſo fraudulent and unjuſtifiable) coms to be look'd on as ſacred, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, and by degrees begins not to bluſh at the Attributes of Sacred Majeſty, Grace, and Highneſs, or any other Terms that the ſervil Flattery and witty Barbarity of Courtiers can give to them: nay, ſom even of the wickedeſt of the Roman Emperors could be content to be ſaluted with <hi>Perennitys</hi> and <hi>Divinitys;</hi> wheras if Men would call their Reaſon into counſel, they might find that theſe blazing Stars were opace Bodys, and did ſhine only by Reflection: Theſe Men having no more Luſter than either the Cabal of their own ſtate and diſtance, or the wretched Impoſition upon the People, caſts on them. For did Men deveſt the Authority from the Perſon, they would then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find it inconſiderable, if not poſitively evil. And again, conſider Authority in it ſelf as a thing fixt, real, immutable, and (when juſtly adminiſter'd) ſacred, they might find, that granting a Prince to be the moſt regular, juſt Perſon in all the world, yet many Men as good join'd with him, intruſted, and concurring to the ſame end, might do much more good; and that to deny this, were to be as irrational as to deny that one Perſon could do any good at all. But however, this I take to be certain and demonſtrable out of their own Principles, that Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to be conſider'd in reſpect of the Truſt and Power lodg'd in them, a number of Men by as juſt means (not to ſay better) inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame Truſt and Power, are every jot as ſacred, and of as much Divine Right as any Monarch is, the Power being eſſentially the ſame, united or divided, as if a Commiſſion be to one or three. It will follow then, that Republics may be as juſt and authoritative as Kingſhips; and then their radical Argument of the <hi>Jure Divino</hi> of Kingſhip is wholly enervated, and the other render'd equally as Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain. And I am to note (but this is only tranſiently) the Poorneſs, or, to ſay better, the Blaſphemy of that Argument which flouriſhes out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49467:29"/>
Kings as the Types of Divinity, and vainly laviſhes ſom Metaphyſics, to prove that all things have a natural tendency to Oneneſs; nay, the itch of ſom merry Wits has carry'd them to run over moſt of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes (as ſom Engliſh Lawyers have talk'd of the legal, I muſt ſay phantaſtical Ubiquity and Omniſcience of our Kings, tho we ſee the contrary; and ſom Civilians have ſaid as much about the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror before them) wheras they ſhould conſider, that the immenſe Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of God flows out in its ſeveral Operations with ineffable variety, God being every where and the ſame, or, as the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> ſay, a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in every part of its Circle, a Spirit without Quantity, Diſtance, and Comprehenſion; wheras Man is a determinat narrow Being, who do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one thing, ceaſes to do another, and thinking of one thing is forc'd to quit his former thought. Now how ſit he is to be a Shadow of this Archetype, let any judg, unleſs he could be refin'd from his Corporei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and inlarg'd into a proportionable Immenſity. Beſides, I know not whether it be ſafe to think or no, That as God, who, for the moſt part, indues Men with Gifts ſutable to the places to which he calls them, would in ſom meaſure pour out his Spirit proportionat to theſe Men, wheras moſt commonly we find them, notwithſtanding their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary advantages of Society, Education, and Buſineſs, as weak Men as any other: and good Princes being ſway'd by the Advice of Men, good and wiſe, and the bad ſeduc'd by Men of their own Inclinations, what are all Monarchys but in reality Optimacys? for a few only eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially govern under the name of one, who is utterly as unable as the meaneſt of thoſe over whom he claims Superiority.</p>
                  <p>THE ſecond Fallacy is this, That Men, while they labor thus to ſupport Monarchy, tell us not what kind of Monarchy it is, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently gain nothing, tho we ſhould grant them the former Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be true. For what dos it avail to tell me of the Title of ſuch a Prince, if I know not by what Title he holds? Grant it were viſible to me that ſuch a Man was mark'd out by Providence to be my Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, yet if I cannot tell what kind of one, whether abſolute, mixt, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, merely executive, or only firſt in order, how ſhall I know to direct my Obedience? If he be abſolute, my very natural Liberty is taken away from me; nor do I know any Power that can make any Man ſuch, the Scripture ſetting juſt limitations and reſtrictions to all Governors. If mixt and limited, I muſt know the due Temper and Bounds wherby he is to rule, or elſe he may uſurp or be miſtaken, and I oppreſt or injur'd. If executive, the Power fundamentally reſides not in him, but in the Great Council, or them intruſted by the People; then I adore only a Shadow. Now if any Prince of <hi>Europe</hi> can really clear up theſe Miſts, and ſhew the Lines of his Government drawn fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his Charter whole and authentic, like that of <hi>Venice</hi> and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Rome,</hi> for my part, I'll be the firſt man ſhall ſwear him Allegiance, and the laſt that will preſerve him. But you will find that they will tell you in general about their Office, and in particular of their Claims of Succeſſion, Inheritance, and Anceſtors; when look but three or four Storys back, and you will meet either ſom ſavage unnatural Intruſion, diſguiz'd under ſom forc'd Title or chimerical Cognation, or elſe ſom violent Alteration, or poſſibly ſom ſlender Oath or Articles, hardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted and imperfectly kept. Now if any man that will but run over theſe Rules, and apply them to any Hiſtory whatever (as we ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplify in that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon which for the preſent we have pitcht)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49467:29"/>
and not find moſt Titles ambiguous, the Effects of former Monarchys (for where, in a Catalogue of forty Kings, can you almoſt ſhew me three good ones, but things merely ſtrugling to maintain their Titles and domeſtic Intereſt?) ruinous to the People, who for the moſt part conſider them no otherwiſe than as to be reſcu'd from violent Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not as they conduce to the poſitive Happineſs of a civil Life; I ſay, all this will be found to be true, or my ſmall Converſation in Books is extremely falſe. And truly I conceive reading of Hiſtory to be the moſt rational Courſe to ſet any Judgment right, becauſe it inſtructs by Experience and Effects, and grounds the Judgment upon material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and not blindly gropes after Notions and Cauſes, which to him are <hi>tantum non inſcrutabile;</hi> but of that anon. A main Miſtake under this Topic has bin an erroneous compariſon and application of matters Civil and Military; for Men obſerving that mixt Councils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Generals, Plurality, Equality of Commands, frequent and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Military Alterations, have brought no ſmall Diſtempers and Dangers to ſeveral Governments and Attemts; therefore they preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in Civils alſo it is the ſafeſt to continue a Command in one hand for preventing the like Diſturbances. But here they are deceiv'd; Civil matters conſiſt in long debate, great conſideration, patient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and wary foreſight, which is better to be found in a number of choice experienc'd Heads, than in one ſingle Perſon, whoſe Youth and Vigor of Spirit inables him rather to Action, and fills him with that noble Temerity which is commonly ſo happy in Martial Affairs; that muſt be guided always to improve Occaſions, which are ſeldom to be found again, and, which miſtaken, are to be ſcarcely amended. Beſides, the Ferocity of daring Spirits can hardly be bounded while they ſtand level; ſo that it is no wonder if they extinguiſh all Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by putting the Power into the hands of one, wheras in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth it is quite otherwiſe: and Factions (unleſs they be cruelly exorbitant) do but poiſe and balance one another; and many times, like the diſcord of Humors upon the natural Body, produce real good to the Government. That ſlender conceit, that Nature ſeems to dreſs out a Principality in moſt of her works, as among Birds, Bees, &amp;c. is ſo ſlender indeed (in regard they are no more Chiefs than what they fancy them, but all their Prepotency is merely predatory or oppreſſive; and even Lions, Elephants, Crocodils and Eagles, have ſmall incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Enemys, of which they ſtand in fear, and by which they are often ruin'd) that the Recital confutes it; and if it were ſo, yet unleſs they could prove their One Man to be as much more excellent than the reſt as thoſe are, and that ſolely too, I ſee not what it would advantage them, ſince to comply with the deſign of Nature in one, they would contradict it in others, where ſhe is equally concern'd. But theſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lological and Rhetorical Arguments have not a little hinder'd the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer Diſquiſition of Reaſon, and prepoſſeſs'd the more eaſy Minds with Notions ſo much harder to be laid aſide, as they are more erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and pleaſing.</p>
                  <p>THESE are the fundamental Errors that have miſled the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; now thoſe which have miſguided the Conſcience, have princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally proceded from the Miſinterpretation of Scripture; and therfore ſeeming Sacred, have bin leſs examin'd and doubted, as carrying the moſt Authority. Thus in the Old Teſtament, there being ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention of Kings, which notwithſtanding were given in Wrath,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49467:30"/>
they ſuperſtitiouſly maintain not only the neceſſity, but even the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity of Kings; wheras we know not their Powers and Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and it is inconſequent to argue, That becauſe <hi>Judea</hi> was ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, we ſhould follow the ſame Pattern, when we find neither Precept, Conſequence, nor Neceſſity convincing us. And it is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to think that while the Divine Spirit ſo freely and vehemently exclaims againſt the Iniquity of men, God would authorize it ſo far as to leave it in them only unpuniſhable who ſhould exterminat and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. As for the Antiquity from ADAM, it is true, before his Fall his Dominion was large and wide, but it was over the Beaſts that after his Fall learn'd to rebel againſt him; and oeconomically, not deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, over his Wife and Children. But what is this to Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? In the New Teſtament (for I the brieſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ier paſs over this head, in regard it has bin ſo copiouſly treated upon by thoſe under whoſe Profeſſion it falls, and that it dos not immediatly conduce to my Deſign) the principal Argument has bin the meekneſs of CHRIST and his compliance with Civil Powers, which certainly, if he had bin diſpos'd to have reſiſted, ſay they, he could as eaſily have overthrown, as with a few Cords whip the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple. But he, that was the Wiſdom of his Father, rather thought fit to build up his Kingdom (which is not earthly, nor known of earthly men) in Meekneſs and Obedience to Civil Powers, which are perpetually chang'd and hurry'd at the Will of the firſt Mover, otherwiſe he would never have concern'd himſelf ſo much in giving Dues to CAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAR, and to God what is Gods; intimating the diſtinct Obedience owing by all men, as Chriſtians, and Citizens. When, granting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy the moſt and only lawful Government, yet every one knows, that knows any thing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Story, that AUGUSTUS had no more Title to that Government, than to any of thoſe over whom he uſurp'd, and that his Acceſs to the Government was as fraudulent and violent as could be. Another Error is the miſtaking of the word <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Powers,</hi> when it's clear the Scripture ſpeaks of it in a Latitude, as extending it to all ſorts of eſtabliſh'd Governments. Now men have falſly pretended, that thoſe Powers were only meant of Kings; and what by an indiſcrete collation of the places of the Old, and violent wreſtings of others of the New Teſtament, they perfected the other grand Miſtake; which ſince it has bin already clear'd up, and as we ſaid is but collateral with us for the preſent, we ſhall no further mention it.</p>
                  <p>AS for the alleg'd Examples and Speeches of the Primitive Times, I ſee not much in them conſiderable: for tho Inſurrections againſt Princes cannot be produc'd, or rather much is ſaid againſt them, yet we are to conſider, that the Goſpel of CHRIST (which was at that time not much defil'd by the World) engages not to any Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but (wholly taken up with its own Extaſys, ſpiritual Delights and Expectations) neglects all other Affairs as ſtrange and dangerous. And moreover (tho I know what has bin ſaid to the contrary) I cannot find, after well conſidering thoſe Ages, any probable ground how, if they would have rebel'd, they could have made any Head. They were indeed numerous, but then they had Legionarys among them; and who knows not what an ineffectual thing a People is (be it never ſo deſirous) when overaw'd by the Soldiery? And they were a People (as Greatneſs to God and Man is different) not conſiderable for their worldly Power (for how few eminent Commanders were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49467:30"/>
converted in the firſt Ages?) but out of his own mere choice, ſo that it was not ſtrange if they could not do much. For God, as he choſe the weakeſt means in planting the Goſpel, even Fiſhermen; ſo, in the primitive Propagation he call'd the weaker Men, tho Chriſtianity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards grew ample and auguſt, and Kings were proud to give their Names to it.</p>
                  <p>AS for the Fathers (ſuppoſing them free of their many Adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Interpolations, and all thoſe Errors and Incertaintys which the proceſs of time and fraud of men has foiſted into them) they are to be accepted only as Witneſſes, not as Judges: that is to ſay, they may prove matter of Fact, but none of their words matter of Right; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we conſider their Writings, either Homilys, Commentarys, or Controverſys, which are ever directed to another end than this is, and they themſelves (men ſecluded from Buſineſs) are ſo much more unable to judg and reſolve civil Controverſys, in regard the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the latter times has produc'd many Controverſys not known or thought of in their days, which not falling directly under their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, cannot receive any Light or Authority from them.</p>
                  <p>HAVING thus conſider'd Kingſhip, and how well it has appear'd thro the falſe Lights of the Underſtanding, we ſhall now conſider, whether, taking it by it ſelf, its Foundations be laid upon a Cylinder or upon a Cube: and this, I think, we are the likelieſt to do, if we conſider them in their Rights and Uſes, or, to ſpeak plainer, in their Legality and Policy; ſo that if we find that none of the ways of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their Crowns can be authentic except one, and that one makes againſt them, we ſhall ſee we have no juſt cauſes of blind Adoration or implicit Obligation to truckle under any of their Commands. And if again we diſcover that ſort of Government it ſelf is not ſo profitable to the end of civil Happineſs, but rather diametrically oppoſit to it; we may ſuppoſe that men are either ſtrangly obſtinat, or elſe they might eradicat an Error which not only offers ſo many Prejudices to their Underſtanding, but that has ſuch an evil Influence upon their external Welbeing.</p>
                  <p>WE have then to conſider, that for One man to rule over Many, there muſt neceſſarily be pretended ſome Right, tho it be but colora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for either he muſt be choſen by the People as their Arbitrator and ſupreme Judg, or elſe he muſt by force of Arms invade them, and bring them to Obedience, which he by force preſerving for his Sons or Succeſſors, makes way for a third Claim, which is Inheritance. A fourth ſome have invented, tho were it real, it is but a difference of the laſt, and I therfore ſhall mention it under that Head. But to the Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>FIRST therfore Election, ſuppoſing the People, either finding themſelves unable to weild their own Happineſs, or for preventing of Diſorder, make choice of one Man to be ſet over them, it here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly follows, that the Authority is in the People, and flowing from them; for Choice argues a Power, and being elected a Subordination to it; in the end, I mean, tho not in every act. Now there is none choſen but for ſom End, or for ſom Intentions reciprocal betwixt both Partys; for otherwiſe ſuch a choice were but Dotage, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invalid: Wherefore thus it will follow, that thoſe who pretend to King it upon this Topic, muſt either ſhew a formal Election (which I think many Kings are not able to do) or if he can ſhew one, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49467:31"/>
alſo the Conditions and Ends for which he was choſen. Now all parts being either implicit or explain'd, let him exhibit the Covenant, that it may be known whether he governs according to it or not; for if he tranſgreſſes, he forfeits, and the others are abſolv'd from their promis'd Obedience. If the Agreement be unwritten or intentional, either Party is relatively ty'd; and then if he dos any thing againſt the welfare of the People (that Soverain Law and end of all Governments) the People may not only juſtly ſuppoſe the former Capitulation broken, but even endeavor, by what poſſible means they can, to reſtore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their former Rights: for why ſhould the making of a Compact prejudice any when it is once broken? And here comes in another Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, with which the Aſſertors of Royalty have ſo flouriſh'd, that an Agreement between a People and one Man ſhould deſcend to his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; wheras it is to be conſider'd, that the People chuſing one man is commonly in conſideration of his Perſon and perſonal Merit; which not being the ſame in his Son (as commonly Familys in the Horizon are in the Meridian, the Founders being braver than any that follow after them) that very intent is fruſtrated and ceaſes; and the People provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Happineſs of a few years, which are determinable with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of the latter part of the Life of one man, run themſelves and their Poſterity into an eternal Inconvenience (for any thing they know) of bad Governors. And if the People would never ſo formally agree with him, that in regard of his Merits or felicity of Actions, his Son ſhould be receiv'd in that place, yet would they not ſtand to it, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pact expiring with the life of either. For my Father may leave me notionally a Slave in a Tenure (a thing frequent with our Anceſtors) or as Civilians term it, a Feodary, with which I am content, in reſpect of the Advantage it brings me, or becauſe my own Eſtate is too little to be independent, and therfore I think it good prudence to be ſhelter'd under the protection of the greater; but my natural Liberty, that is to ſay, to make my Life as juſtly happy and advantageous to me as I may, he can no more give away from me than my Underſtanding or Eyſight: for theſe are Privileges with which God and Nature have indu'd me, and theſe I cannot be deny'd but by him that will alſo deny me a Being. But to go on, Suppoſe a ſecond Generation ſhould accept the Son, and a third a Grandſon, yet this confirms not a fourth; and the People very impoliticly ſtrengthen and confirm the Power by continuance, and in a manner with their own hands lay the Foundation of Abſoluteneſs; their Governors themſelves growing in Intereſts, increaſing in Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Forces: ſo it is very improbable but that within a little they grow too big and formidable, and leave nothing of Liberty except the Name, and (if they be leſs cunning) not that. A pertinent Example of this, and ſo near us that I cannot paſs it, we ſee in young ORANGE and the <hi>Low Countrys</hi> at this day, who continuing his Progenitors for their ſignal Services, and him for theirs, are now puniſh'd for their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and indiſcrete rewarding of Virtue, that their Liberty was lately almoſt blown up before they well perceiv'd it to be undermin'd, and they are now at charge to maintain their own Oppreſſion. As for that formal Election and Stipulation, who ſees not what a vain and ridiculous cheat it is, they coming with Swords in their hands to demand the Scepter of a weak and ſtupid multitude that appears only to gaze upon the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monys, and whoſe refuſal were ineffectual? but it is a gracious piece of the Cabal of <hi>Tyranny</hi> to deceive the People with Shadows, Fantaſms, and names of Liberty.</p>

AS for thoſe that intrude by Force, they cannot certainly have the Forehead to infer any Right, they being but, as the Pirat ſaid to ALEX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANDER, public and more magnificent Robbers. Certainly theſe are the NIMRODS, the great Hunters, Gods Scourges, and the Burdens of the Earth; and whether they be Founders of Empires, or great Captains (as BOCCALIN diſtinguiſhes them) they ought rather to be remember'd with horror and deteſtation, than have that undue Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence with which they commonly meet.</p>
                  <p>YET theſe are they that lay the Foundations of Succeſſion, and from theſe do the Succeſſors claim, and enjoy with he leſs reluctance, becauſe the regret of the Violences, and hate of the firſt daily wears out; whether it be by the continuance of Peace that charms men into a love of eaſe, or that the continuance of Slavery enfeebles their Minds, that they rather chuſe to look at their preſent Enjoyment than real Happineſs; ſo that it is not ſtrange if the Perſon of their Oppreſſor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in time adorable, and he himſelf thinks that confirm'd and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify'd to him in proceſs of time, to which in the beginning he had no right. But if we conſider the buſineſs a little higher, we might find that ſince neither the People (as we have prov'd before) have power to make themſelves Vaſſals, and the Intruders themſelves cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any juſt Title; their Domination is merely illegal, and apt to be ſhaken off with the firſt conveniency, it being every whit as equitable, that theſe men ſhould be judg'd Enemys of Mankind, and condemn'd to die the death of Parricids for uſurping a Power, as NERO for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing it. But I would fain ask the <hi>Regious Defenders,</hi> by what Law they can maintain Governments to be inherent in one, and to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Ofspring? If they ſay by the Law of God, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand again how they can make this Law appear to me? If they ſay that the Scripture contains the Right and ſacredneſs of Kings, I ask them again, How they know that God extends that Privilege and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to this King? If they ſay, that he is involv'd in the general Right, they do but run into a Circle; unleſs they can ſhow me, that all his Approches to the Government were regular, and ſuch as God was pleas'd with, or elſe God had by ſom Sign and Wonder declar'd his approbation of him; for without theſe two, they muſt make God the Author of Evil, which is impious, and pretend his Commiſſion for an unlawful Act; and by the ſame right, any other (as a Tyrant, for example) may pretend it to an Action never ſo unjuſt, it being no inuſual thing to borrow the face of Divinity, even upon ſom foul Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, as (to forbear further Inſtances) NUMA'S Conference with AEGERIA, SCIPIO'S Retirement into the Capitol, and SERTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIUS'S white Hart.</p>
                  <p>Now if they pretend the Law of Nature, they muſt demonſtrat to us, both that ſhe endow'd men with inequal Freedom, and that ſhe ſhap'd out ſuch a Man to rule; whereas it appears on the contrary, that all Men naturally are equal: for tho Nature with a noble Variety has made different the Features and Lineaments of Men, yet as to Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, till it be loſt by ſom external means, ſhe has made every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and given them the ſame Deſires. But ſuppoſe ſhe had intended ſuch a Family for Government, and had given them ſom illuſtrious Marks, as we read of ſom that had, whether by the imagination of their Mothers, or by Deceit; yet then would Nature fall into a double Irregularity, firſt in deſerting her Method of making all free, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49467:32"/>
in making her general Work merely ſubſervient, and ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to her particular; which how contrary it is to that beautiful Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of hers, I need not much inſiſt. Now if they ſay, they are Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the People, and for that reaſon they call themſelves the Heads, inferring the People to be no more than a Trunk, it's only metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and proves nothing: for they muſt remember, that ſince <hi>Father</hi> has a relation upon which it depends, and upon whoſe removal it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, they themſelves cannot bring any ſuch; for by phyſical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation they will not offer it; and for metaphorical Dependence, it will com to nothing, we ſeeing People languiſh when their Princes are fulleſt, and, like Leeches, rather willing to burſt than to fall of; and on the contrary, the People upon the removal of a Prince cheerful and reliev'd. Now if there were ſo ſtrict a Union between theſe two, ſuch a Contrariety and Antipathy could never appear; for certainly when any two Perſons endeavour to gain ground one upon another, there is an Enmity, whatever is pretended. Beſides, if theſe men would be Fathers, it were then their duty to do like Fathers, which is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for, defend and cheriſh; wheras on the contrary, it is they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that eat the bread out of the mouths of their Children, and thro the groans of the Poor. And wheras Flattery has ſaid, that what they draw up in Vapors they ſend down in Showers, yet are we ſure that ſuch rains are for the moſt part unfruitful, if not ominous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious. If they pretend the Law of Nations, it were well they would declare to us firſt what this Law is, and whether generally agreed on or no by Nations. If they ſay, yes, they muſt reſolve whether explicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or implicitly: if they ſay the former, let them produce them; if the latter, they muſt demonſtrat, that all Nations are agreed in ſuch and ſuch Notions, and all men of theſe Nations, ſince every one muſt be of equal capacity: When on the contrary, tho the Underſtandings of moſt men, whom we know or have convers'd with, ſeem to agree in ſom general maxims, but unpoliſh'd, unnumbred, and unmethodiz'd, yet we ſee many Nations differing from us in many things, which we think clearly, fundamentally, and naturally true; neither do Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats and Education only ſo diverſify the Minds of men, but even their Underſtandings, and the different ways of thinking ſo diſtinguiſh even thoſe of one Country, that tho we may pleaſe our ſelves in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all mens thoughts follow the fantaſtical method of ours, yet we might find, if we were perfectly converſant with all men of the World, and well read in their Authors (as we are not with half of them, no, nor any one man with the twentieth part) that there are ſcarce four or five Axioms, excepting as they make a part of the Law of nature, would be univerſally receiv'd. Now (for I have bin the longer by reaſon that this imaginary Law has bin ſo held up by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians, and made the ſubterfuge of ſo many conſiderable Diſputes) if it be ſo weak as that we can ſcarce tell whether it has a being or no, for even that which we account the moſt ſacred piece of it, the violation of public Meſſengers, the <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> unleſs reſtrain'd by fear, break it every day. What then are the Arguments deduc'd from it? or if there were ſuch a Law, what would it avail ſuch a particular man? for why ſhould other Nations impoſe a Governor where they are not concern'd? And if they pretend this Law as to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and impunity of their Perſons, the ſame Anſwer will ſerve again, with this addition, That they make an Offender incapable of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49467:32"/>
which is but to give them a Commiſſion to offend. Now if they run upon that diſtinction of ſuſpending only, and not puniſhing (as if forſooth this kind of People muſt be preſerv'd, tho by the ruin of Mankind, to immediat Vengeance) then I ſay, That Suſpenſion is really a Puniſhment; and if his Demerits can deſerve that, I ſee not but that upon a proportionable Increaſe, they may deſerve Dethroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation or Death, as clearly as two and two make four, and four more make eight. If they allege poſitive or municipal Laws, and number <hi>Homages,</hi> they are not much the nearer, ſince that all ſuch Laws are but Rivulets and Branches of them we before examin'd; and ſince we found that thoſe ſpeak ſo little in their favor, that which theſe do can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſignify much, eſpecially ſince Princes, who are ever watchful to improve all occaſions of this nature, can either by terror or artifice draw Aſſemblys, or the major part of them, to their own Lure; nay, even the worſt of them have not forgot to be ſolicitous in this caſe. But it muſt be remark'd, That whatever poſitive Laws are repugnant to thoſe general ones, they are injurious, and ought to be repeal'd. And truly it is a ſad Obſervation, that as Monarchs grow, either out of the weakneſs of Government, and (as I may ſay) its Pupilage, as ROMULUS and THESEUS did at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> or elſe out of the diſeaſe or depravation of it, as CAESAR again invaded <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo have the People bin never more fond of them, than when Manners were at the higheſt corruption, which ever gave acceſs of ſtrength to them; nor have they more diſtaſted them, than when their Spirits and Diſciplin were the moſt brave and healthful: ſo fatally diſagreeing are true Liberty, which is the very ſource of Virtue and Generoſity, and the impotent Domination of a ſingle Tyrant, who commonly reigns by no other means than the Diſcords of braver Citizens, who can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indure Equality or Superiority among themſelves, and rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a general Vaſſalage, than juſt Equality; or by the Vices of the baſer ſort, which naturally reconcile them and Kings, and concern them both in a bad Example. But ſuppoſe Succeſſion a thing ſacred and inviolable, yet once break and interrupt it, it is little worth, either the Uſurper being to be acknowleg'd regular, or the whole Series daſh'd out of order. Nay, we ſee Aſpirers themſelves either ſo blinded with their Pretences, or with Animoſity, and ſo crying up their own Titles, that it is almoſt impoſſible for any privat Judgment to do right in this caſe, themſelves thwarting one another; and it cannot be in the power of Nature that both ſhould be right. But who can inſtance one Monarch whoſe Crown is come to him by untainted Succeſſion? and what Hiſtory will not confirm the Example I ſhall anon bring? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tho Succeſſion were a thing that had not ſo little reaſon or reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet I ſee not why men ſhould with ſuch a ſtrange pertinacy defend it. Matters of Government ought to be manag'd by Prudence; but Succeſſion puts them into the hands of Fortune, when a Child incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or infirm, under the regiment of a Nurſe, muſt (poſſibly) be Supreme Governor, and thoſe whom either their Abilitys or Virtues fit for it, ſubordinat or laid aſide. But what if the Perſon whom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity has ſet at the ſtern be incapable, lunatic, weak, or vitious, is not this a good way to prevent Controverſys? yet this plainly ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vats all good Counſil, when a King ſhould have need of Tutors, and that a multitude of People ſhould be commanded by one who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands not himſelf; and, when we ſcarce obey even excellent Princes, to adore Shadows and weak ones.</p>

AS for BOXHORNIUS'S diſtinction of Succeſſion, wherin the next Heir muſt neceſſarily ſuccede by the original Right of the former, I would ask him, whether the Predeceſſor were a Poſſeſſor or Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fructuary? If the firſt, all our former Arguments fall on him; if the latter, it makes not for his Succeſſor, the People being Owners: and beſides, the diſtinction is one of his own coining, never pretended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; upon the firſt controverſy it is invalid, altho the firſt Founder had a Right, as we have prov'd the contrary.</p>
                  <p>HAVING, with what brevity I could, brought to an end my firſt Intention, I ſhall now fall upon the ſecond, which is the intrinſic value and expediency of this Government, and ſom little compariſon with others; but herein we ſhall be ſhort, and only ſo far as concerns this. And indeed it is a buſineſs ſo tickliſh, that even Mr. HOBS in his piece <hi>de Cive,</hi> tho he aſſur'd himſelf that the reſt of his Book (which is principally calculated for the aſſertion of Monarchy) is demonſtrated, yet he douts whether the Arguments which he brings to this buſineſs be ſo firm or not; and MALVEZZI contrarily remonſtrats (in his Diſcourſes upon TACITUS) that Optimacys are clearly better than Monarchys, as to all advantages. And indeed if we look on the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Monarchy, they are either Flouriſhes, or merely Notions; ſuch are the reference and perfection of Unity, which, ſay they, muſt needs work better and more naturally, as one ſimple cauſe (beſides that it ſtills and reſtrains all other claims) than many coordinat: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they never conſider that tho among many joint Cauſes there may be ſome jarring, yet like croſs Wheels in an Engin, they tend to the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the whole. What violent Miſchiefs are brought in by the Contentions of Pretenders in Monarchys, the Ambiguitys of Titles, and lawleſs Ambition of Aſpirers? wheras in a ſettled Republic all this is clear and unperplex'd; and in caſe any particular man aſpires, they know againſt whom to join, and puniſh as a common Enemy. As for that reaſon which alleges the advantage of Secreſy in buſineſs, it carries not much with it, in regard that under that even moſt pernicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns may be carried on; and for wholſom Councils (bating ſom more nice Tranſactions) it matters not how much they be toſt among thoſe who are ſo much intruſted and concern'd in them, all bad deſigns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never in probability ſo feeble and ineffectual, as when there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eyes to overlook them, and voices to decry them. As for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition in which they ſay Monarchs are ſo happy, it may as well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a bad intention, as give effect to a juſt Council, it depending on the Judgment of a ſingle man, to whoſe will and ends all muſt refer; wheras a ſelect number of intruſted Perſons may haſten every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity with a juſt ſlowneſs as well as they, tho indeed (unleſs it be in ſom Military critical Minutes) I ſee not ſuch an Excellency in the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heady Diſpatch, precipitation in Counſils being ſo dangerous and ominous. As for what concerns privat Suitors, they may as ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and effectually (if not more) be anſwer'd in ſtaid Republics, as in the Court of a King, where Bribery and unworthy Favorits do not what is juſt, but what is deſir'd.</p>
                  <p>WITH theſe and many others as conſiderable (which partly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and partly in this penury of Books, forgettingly I paſs) do they intend to ſtrengthen this fantaſtical and airy Building; but as ſly Controverters many times leave out the principal Text or Argument, becauſe ſhould it be produc'd, it could not be ſo eaſily anſwer'd: ſo
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49467:33"/>
theſe men tell us all the Advantages of Monarchy, ſuppoſing them ſtill well ſettled, and under virtuous men; but you ſhall never hear them talk of it in its corrupt ſtate under leud Kings and unſettled Laws; they never let fall a word of the dangers of Interreigns, the Minoritys and Vices of Princes, Miſgovernments, evil Councils, Ambitions, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitys of Titles, and the Animoſitys and Calamities that follow them, the neceſſary Injuſtices and Oppreſſions by which Monarchs (uſing the Peoples Wealth and Blood againſt themſelves) hold them faſt in their Seats, and, by ſom ſuſpenſion of Divine Juſtice, dy not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently.</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS other Governments, eſtabliſh'd againſt all theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, being ever of Vigor and juſt Age, ſettled in their own Right, freed from pretences, ſerv'd by experienc'd and engag'd Councils, and (as nothing under the Moon is perfect) ſomtimes gaining and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tag'd in their Controverſys, which have not ſeldom (as we may ſee in Old <hi>Rome)</hi> brought forth good Laws and Augmentations of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; whereas once declining from their Purity and Vigor, and (which is the effect of that) raviſh'd by an Invader, they languiſh in a brutiſh Servitude, (Monarchy being truly a Diſeaſe of Government) and like Slaves, ſtupid with harſhneſs and continuance of the laſh, wax old under it, till they either arrive at that Period which God preſcribes to all People and Governments, or elſe better Stars and Poſterity awaken them out of that Lethargy, and reſtore them to their priſtin Liberty, and its daughter Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>BUT this is but to converſe in Notions, wandring, and ill abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from things; let us now deſcend to practical Obſervation, and clearly manifeſt out the whole Series of Time and Actions, what Circumſtances and Events have either uſher'd or follow'd one Race of Kings, That if there were all the Juſtice in the World that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Nation ſhould be intail'd upon one Family, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we could not grant it to ſuch a one whoſe criminal Lives and formidable Deaths have bin Evidences of God's Wrath upon it for ſo many Generations.</p>

KINNATEL his Brother <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> was deſign'd for Succeſſor; yet AIDAN the Son of GORAN laid his claim, but was content to ſuſpend, in reſpect of the Age and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of KINNATEL, which after fourteen Months took him out of the World, and clear'd the controverſy, and AIDAN by the conſent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> of COLUMBA (a Prieſt that govern'd all in thoſe days) came to be King; a Man that, after thirty four years turbulently ſpent, being beaten by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and ſtruck with the Death of COLUMBA, dy'd of Grief.</p>

who continuing a blank Reign, or it may be a happy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="61"/> one, in regard it was peaceable, left it to ETFYN Son of EUGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIUS the Seventh: the firſt part of his Reign was peaceable; but Age obliging him to put the Government into the hands of four of his Servants, it happen'd to him, as it dos to other Princes, whoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes decay commonly with their Strength, that it was very unhappy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="62"/> and turbulent: Which Miſerys EUGENIUS the Eighth, Son of MORDAC, reſtrain'd. But he, it ſeems, having a Nature fitter to appeaſe Tumults than to enjoy Reſt, at the firſt enjoyment of Peace broke into ſuch Leudneſs, that the Nobility at a meeting ſtab'd him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="63"/> and made way for FERGUS<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Son of ETFYN, one like his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor in manner, death, and continuance of Reign, which was three years; the only diſſimilitude was, that the latters Wife brought his Death; for which others being impeach'd, ſhe ſtept in and confeſt it; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="64"/> and to avoid puniſhment, puniſh'd her ſelf with a knife. SOLUATH, Son of EUGENIUS the Eighth, follow'd him, who tho his Gout made him of leſs Action, yet it made his Prudence more viſible, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="65"/> himſelf not illaudable: His Death brought in ACHAIUS the Son of ETFYN, whoſe Reign was innobled with an <hi>Iriſh</hi> War, and many learned Men; beſides the Aſſiſtance lent HUNGUS to fight againſt the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> whom he beat in a famous Battel, which (if I may mention the matter) was preſignify'd to HUNGUS in a Dream, St. <hi>Andrew</hi> appearing to him, and aſſuring him of it; and in the time of Battel a white Croſs (that which the Heralds call a Saltier, and we ſee commonly in the <hi>Scots</hi> Banners) appear'd in the Sky; and this I think to have bin the occaſion of that bearing, and an Order of Knights of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> ſomtimes in reputation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but extinguiſh'd, for ought I can perceive, before the time of JAMES the Sixth, tho the Collar and Pendant of it are at this day worn about the <hi>Scots</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="66"/> Arms. To this man CONGAL his Couſin ſucceded, who left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behind him but five years to ſtretch out the account of time. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="67"/> DONGAL the Son of SOLUATH came next, who being of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fierce and inſupportable, there was an endeavor to ſet up ALPIN Son of ACHAIUS, which Deſign by ALPIN himſelf was fruſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which made the King willinger to aſſiſt ALPIN in his pretenſion to the Kingdom of <hi>Picts;</hi> in which Attemt he was drown'd, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="68"/> left to ALPIN that which he before had ſo nobly refus'd, who mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of the former, rais'd an Army, beat the <hi>Picts</hi> in many ſignal Victorys; but at laſt was ſlain by them, leaving his name to the place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="69"/> of his Death, and the Kingdom to his Son KENNETH. This man ſeeing the People broken with the late War, and unwilling to fight, drew them on by this Subtilty; he invites the Nobility to dinner, and after plying them with Drink till midnight, leaves them ſleeping on the floor (as the manner was) and then hanging Fiſhskins about the Walls of the Chamber, and making one ſpeak thro a Tube, and call them to war; they waking, and half aſleep, ſuppos'd ſomthing of Divinity to be in it, aud the next morning not only conſented to War, but (ſo ſtrange is deluded imagination) with unſpeakable Courage fell upon the Enemy and put them to the rout; which being confirm'd by other great Victorys, utterly ruin'd the <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Name. This man may be added to the two FERGUSES, and truly may be ſaid to be the Founder of the <hi>Scots</hi> Empire, not only in making that the middle of his Dominion, which was once the bounds, but in confirming his

                  <p>DAVID, Brother to K.

BRUCE on his Wife got ROBERT BRUCE Earl of <hi>Carick,</hi> having married the Heretrix therof. As for HUNTINGDON he deſiſted his claim. The queſtion is, whether BALIOL in right of the eldeſt Daughter, or BRUCE being com of the ſecond (but a Man) ſhould have the Crown, he being in the ſame degree, and of the more worthy Sex. The Controverſy being toſt up and down, at laſt was refer'd to ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD, the Firſt of that name, King of <hi>England.</hi> He thinking to fiſh in theſe troubled waters, ſtirs up eight other Competitors, the more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle the buſineſs, and with twenty four Counſellors, half <hi>Engliſh,</hi> half <hi>Scots,</hi> and abundance of Lawyers fit enough to perplex the matter, ſo handled the buſineſs, after cunning delays, that at length he ſecretly tampers with BRUCE (who was then conceiv'd to have the better right of the buſineſs) that if he would acknowlege the Crown of him, he would adjudg it for him; but he generouſly anſwering, that he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd a Crown at a leſs rate, than for it to put his Country under a foren Yoke: He made the ſame motion to BALIOL, who accepted it; and ſo we have a King again, by what Right we all ſee; but it is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that Kings, com they by their Power never ſo unjuſtly, may juſtly keep it.</p>

This man after he was King, whether it were Age or Sloth, did little; but his Lieutenants and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were perpetually in action. He left his Kingdom to JOHN his Baſtard Son by the Lady MORE his Concubin, whom he marry'd, either to legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timat the three Children (as the manner was then) he had by her, or elſe for old Acquaintance, his Wife and her Husband dying much about <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="101"/> time. This JOHN would be crown'd by the name of ROBERT (his own, they ſay, being unhappy for Kings) a wretched inactive Prince, lame, and only govern'd by his brother WALTER, who having DAVID the Prince upon complaint of ſom Exorbitancys deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to his care, caus'd him to be ſtarv'd; upon which the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſend his Son JAMES into <hi>France,</hi> the Boy was taken at <hi>Flamburg,</hi> and kept by our HENRY the Fourth: upon the hearing of which his Father ſwounded, and ſoon after dy'd. His Reign was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable for nothing but his breaking with GEORGE Earl of <hi>March</hi> (to whoſe Daughter, upon the payment of a great part of her Portion which he never would repay, he had promis'd his Son DAVID for a Husband) to take the Daughter of DOUGLAS who had a greater; which occaſion'd the Earl of <hi>March</hi> to make many inrodes with our HENRY HOTSPUR; and a famous Duel of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men apiece, wherof on the one ſide ten remain'd, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one, which was the only way to appeaſe the deadly Feuds of theſe two Familys.

Liberty of his Nephew, only he ſent ſom Auxiliarys into <hi>France,</hi> who, they ſay, behav'd themſelves worthily; and his ſlothful Son MORDAC, who making his Sons ſo bold with Indulgence, that one of them kil'd a Falcon on his fiſt, which he deny'd to give him: he in revenge procur'd the Parlament to ranſom the King, who had bin eighteen years a Priſoner. This JAMES was the Firſt of that name, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="102"/> and tho he was an excellent Prince, yet had a troubleſom Reign; firſt, in regard of a great Penſion rais'd for his Ranſom; next, for domeſtic Commotions; and laſtly, for raiſing of Mony; which, tho the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue was exhauſted, was call'd Covetouſneſs.

Afterwards having his middle years perpetually moleſted with civil Broils, yet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>York</hi> againſt HENRY the Sixth, he was diverted by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman that counterfeited himſelf a <hi>Nuncio</hi> (which I mention out of a Manuſcript, becauſe I do not remember it in our Storys) and broke up his Army.

His Succeſſor was his Son JAMES, the Fifth of that name, a Boy of not above two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="106"/> years of age; under whoſe Minority, what by the miſgovernment of Tutors, and what by the Factions of the Nobility, <hi>Scotland</hi> was waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt into Famin and Solitude: however in his juſt Age he prov'd an induſtrious Prince, yet could not ſo ſatisfy the Nobility, but that he and they continued in a mutual hate, till that barbarous execution of young HAMILTON ſo fil'd him with Remorſe, that he dream'd he came and cut of his two Arms, and threaten'd after to cut of his Head.

                  <p>I HAD almoſt forgot to tell, that this young Couple in the tranſport of their nuptial Solemnitys took the Arms and Title of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which indiſcrete Ambition we may ſuppoſe firſt quicken'd the jealouſy of ELIZABETH againſt her, which after kindl'd ſo great a flame.</p>
                  <p>IN <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhe ſhew'd what a ſtrange influence looſe Education has upon Youth, and the weaker Sex. All the <hi>French</hi> Effeminacys came over with her, and the Court loſt that little Severity which was left. DAVID RIZIO, an <hi>Italian</hi> Fidler, was the only Favorit, and it is too much fear'd, had thoſe enjoyments which no Woman can give but ſhe that gives away her Honor and Chaſtity.</p>
                  <p>BUT a little after, HENRY Lord <hi>Darnly</hi> coming with MAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEW Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> his Father, into <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhe caſt an ey upon him, and marry'd him. Whether it were to ſtrengthen her preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>England,</hi> he being com of HENRY the Seventh's Daughter, as we ſhall tell anon, or to color her Adulterys, and hide the ſhame of an Impregnation (tho ſom have whiſper'd, that ſhe never conceiv'd, and that the Son was ſuppoſititious) or ſom Phrenzy of Affection drew her that way; certain it is ſhe ſoon declin'd her Affection to her Husband, and increas'd it to DAVID (he being her perpetual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion at board, and managing all Affairs, while the King with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temtible Train was ſent away) inſomuch that ſom of the Nobility that could not digeſt this, enter'd a Conſpiracy, which the King head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſlew him in her Chamber.</p>
                  <p>THIS turn'd all her neglect of the King into rage, ſo that her chiefeſt buſineſs was to appeaſe her Favorits Ghoſt with the ſlaughter of her Husband; poiſon was firſt attemted, but it being (it ſeems) too weak, or his Youth overcoming it, that expectation fail'd. But the Devil and BOTHWEL furniſh'd her with another that ſucceded; ſhe ſo intices him, being ſo ſick that they were forc'd to bring him in a Horſlitter to <hi>Edinburg,</hi> where ſhe cheriſh'd him extremely, till the credulous young man began to lay aſide ſuſpicion, and to hope better: So ſhe puts him into a ruinous houſe near the Palace, from whence no news can be had, brings in her own bed, and lys in the houſe with him; and at length when the deſign was ripe, cauſes him one Sunday night, with his Servant, to be ſtrangl'd, thrown out of the Window, and the houſe to be blown up with Gunpowder, her own rich Bed having bin before ſecretly convey'd away. This and other perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances made her favor upon BOTHWEL ſo hot, that ſhe muſt marry

him; the only obſtacle was, he had a Wife already; but ſhe was compel'd to ſue for a Divorce, which (ſo great Perſons being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd) it was a wonder it ſhould be granting ſo long as ten days. Well, ſhe marrys; but the more honeſt Nobility amaz'd at thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancys, aſſemble together, and with Arms in their hands begin to expoſtulat. The newmarry'd Couple are forc'd to make back South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; where finding but ſlender aſſiſtance, and the Queen fooliſhly coming from <hi>Dunbar</hi> to <hi>Leith,</hi> was glad at laſt to delay a parly till her Dear was eſcap'd; and then (clad in an old tatter'd coat) to yield her ſelf a Priſoner.</p>
                  <p>BEING brought to <hi>Edinburg,</hi> and us'd rather with hate of her former Enormitys, than pity of her preſent Fortune, ſhe receiv'd a Meſſage, that ſhe muſt either reſign the Crown to her Son JAMES (that was born in the time of her marriage with DARNLY) or elſe they would procede to another Election, and was forc'd to obey.

                  <p>THE wretched Mother flying after into <hi>England,</hi> was entertain'd (tho with a Guard) by Queen ELIZABETH; but after that being ſuborn'd by the Papiſts, and exaſperated by the GUIZES, ſhe enter'd into Plots and Machinations, ſo inconſiſtent with the Safety of <hi>England,</hi> that by an Act of Parlament ſhe was condemn'd to death, which ſhe receiv'd by a Hatchet at <hi>Fotheringay</hi> Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>THE Infancy of her Son was attended with thoſe domeſtic Evils that accompany the Minority of Kings. In his Youth he took to Wife the Daughter of <hi>Denmark</hi> (a Woman I hear little of, ſaving the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter SALUST gives SEMPRONIA, that ſhe could dance better than became a virtuous Woman) with whom he ſuppoſing the Earl GOWRY too much in League, caus'd him and his Brother to be ſlain at their own houſe whither he was invited; he giving out, that they had an intent to murder him; and that by miracle and the aſſiſtance of ſom men (whom he had inſtructed for that purpoſe, and taught their tale) he eſcap'd. For this Deliverance (or to ſay better, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſination) he blaſphem'd God with a ſolemn Thankſgiving once a Year all the remainder of his Life.</p>
                  <p>WELL had it bin for us, if our Forefathers had laid hold of that happy opportunity of ELIZABETH'S Death (in which the TEU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THORS took a period) to have perform'd that which, perhaps in due puniſhment, has coſt us ſo much blood and ſweat; and not have bow'd under the ſway of a Stranger, diſdain'd by the moſt generous and wiſe at that time, and only ſupported by the Faction of ſom, and the Sloth of others; who brought but a ſlender Title, and (however the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of the times cry'd him up for a SOLOMON) weak Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for ſuch an advancement.</p>
                  <p>HIS Title ſtood thus, MARGARET, eldeſt Daughter to HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY the Seventh, was marry'd to JAMES the Fourth, whoſe Son JAMES the Fifth had MARY the Mother of JAMES the Sixth. MARGARET after her firſt Husband's death, marrys ARCHIBALD DOUGLAS Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> who upon her begot MARGARET Wife of MATTHEW Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and Mother of that HENRY DARNLY, whoſe tragical End we juſt now mention'd. Now upon this ſlender Title, and our internal Diſſenſions (for the <hi>Cecilians</hi> and <hi>Eſſexians,</hi> for ſeveral ends, made perpetual Applications) got
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49467:42"/>
JAMMY from a Revenue of 30000 <hi>l.</hi> to one of almoſt two Millions, tho there were others that had as fair pretences (and what elſe can any of them make?) the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. expreſly excluding Foren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from the Crown: and ſo the Children of CHARLES BRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON by MARY the ſecond Daughter, Dowager of <hi>France,</hi> being next to com in. And the Lady ARABELLA being ſprung from a third Husband (the Lord STUART) of the ſaid MARGARET, and by a Male Line, carry'd ſurely ſo formidable a pretenſion (it ſhould ſeem) that even that Iniquity which was perſonally inherent to her, made her days very unhappy, and for moſt part captive, and her death ('tis thought) ſomwhat too early; ſo cruel are the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of cowardly minds, even againſt the weakeſt and moſt unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected Innocence.</p>
                  <p>AND indeed his Right to the Crown was ſo unſatisfactory even to the moſt judicious of thoſe days, that TOBY MATTHEWS having ſuit about ſom Privileges which he claim'd to his Biſhoprick (which was then <hi>Durham)</hi> wherin the King oppos'd him; and having one day ſtated the Caſe before ſom of his Friends, who ſeem'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it; yes, ſays he, I could wiſh he had but half ſo good a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Crown. And 'tis known that ſome Speeches of Sir WAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER RAWLEY, too generous and Engliſh for the times, was that which brought him to Trial and Condemnation for a ſeign'd Crime; and afterwards ſo facilitated that barbarous Deſign of GUNDAMAR, to cut of his Head for a Crime, for which he was condemn'd fourteen years before, and which by the Commiſſions he after receiv'd (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of the then Lord Chancellor, and the greateſt Lawyers) was in Law pardon'd.</p>
                  <p>THIS may appear beſides our purpoſe; but we could not ſever this conſideration, unleſs we would draw him with a half face, and leave as much in umbrage as we expreſt. That which moſt ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd his Perſon was, firſt the conſideration of his adhering to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion; wheras we are to conſider that thoſe ſlight Velitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he had with BELLARMIN and the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> tended rather to make his own Authority more intrinſically intenſe and venerable, than to confute any thing they ſaid: for he had before ſhak'd them of as to foren Juriſdiction; and for matter of Popery, it appear'd in his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time that he was no ſuch enemy to it, both by his own compliances with the Spaniſh Embaſſadors, the deſign of the Spaniſh Match (in which his Son was perſonally imbarkt) and the ſlow aſſiſtances ſent to his Daughter, in whoſe ſafety and protection Proteſtantiſm was at that time ſo much concern'd.</p>
                  <p>FOR his Knowlege, he had ſome glancings and niblings, which the Severity of the excellent BUCHANAN forc'd into him in his younger time, and after converſation ſomwhat poliſh'd. But tho I bear not ſo great a contemt to his other Works, as BEN JOHNSON did to his Poetry, yet if they among many others were going to the fire, they would not be one of the firſt I ſhould reſcue, as poſſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a more ſevere and refin'd Judgment in many others; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he that had ſo many able Wits at command, might eaſily give their Oracles thro his Mouth. But ſuppoſe the things generous and fit to live (as I am not yet convinc'd) yet what commendation is this to a King, who ſhould have other buſineſs than ſpinning and weaving fine Theorys, and engaging in School Chiquaneries? which was well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49467:42"/>
by HENRY the Fourth, who hearing ſom men celebrat him with theſe Attributes; yes (anſwer'd he, very tartly) <hi>He is a fine King, and writes little Books.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'TIS true, he was a good Drol, and poſſibly after Greec Wine ſomwhat factious: But of his ſubſtantial and heroic Wiſdom I have not heard any great Inſtances. He himſelf us'd to brag of his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,</hi> which was not to render his People happy, and to proſecute the ends of a good King, but to ſcrue up the Prerogative, divert Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the due diſquiſition and proſecution of their Freedoms, and to break them up at pleaſure; and indeed his parting with the Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Towns of the <hi>Low Countrys,</hi> and that for ſo ſmall a Sum, ſhew'd him a Perſon not ſo quickſighted, or unfit to be overreach'd.</p>
                  <p>FOR his peaceable Reign, honorable and juſt Quarrels he wanted not; but ſloth and cowardice witheld him: and indeed the eaſe and luxury of thoſe times fomented and nouriſh'd thoſe lurking and peſtilent humors, which afterwards ſo dangerouſly broke out in his Son's Reign.</p>
                  <p>WE ſhall not trouble his Aſhes with the mention of his perſonal Faults; only, if we may compare God's Judgments with apparent Sins, we may find the latter end of his Life neither fortunat nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to him. His Wife diſtaſted by him, and ſom ſay, languiſhing of a ſoul Diſeaſe; his eldeſt Son dying with too violent ſymtoms of Poiſon, and that, as is fear'd, by a hand too much ally'd; his ſecond (againſt whom he ever had a ſecret antipathy) ſcarce return'd from a mad and dangerous Voyage; his Daughter (all that was left of that Sex) baniſh'd, with her numerous Iſſue, out of her Husband's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and living in miſerable Exile; and laſtly, himſelf dying of a violent death by poiſon, in which his Son was more than ſuſpected to have a hand, as may be infer'd from BUCKINGHAM'S Plea, that he did it by the Command of the Prince, and CHARLES'S diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Parlament that took in hand to examin it; and laſtly, his indifferency at <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s death (tho he pretended all love to him alive) as glad to be rid of ſo dangerous and ſo conſiderable a Partner of his Guilt. Yet the miter'd Paraſits of thoſe times could ſay, that one went to Heaven in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, the other in <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Chariot, he dying of a pretended Fever, ſhe (as they ſaid) of a Dropſy.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES having now obtain'd his Brother's Inheritance, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="109"/> himſelf in managing of it like one that gain'd it as he did. The firſt of his Acts was that glorious attemt upon the Ile of <hi>Rhee.</hi> The next, that Noble and Chriſtian betraying of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and conſequently in a manner the whole Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>France.</hi> The middle of the Reign was heightening of Prerogative and Prelacy, and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Churches to the pattern of <hi>Rome;</hi> till at laſt juſt Indignation brought his Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and ſo forc'd him to call a Parlament: which tho he ſhameleſly ſays in the firſt line of the Book, call'd his, was out of his <hi>own inclination to Parlaments,</hi> yet how well he lik'd them, may appear by his firſt tampering with his own Army in the North, to ſurprize and diſſolve them; then with the <hi>Scots,</hi> who at that time were Court proof; then raiſing up the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, which has waſted millions of Lives; and laſtly, his open ſeceſſion from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and hoſtility againſt the two Houſes, which maintain'd a firſt and ſecond ſharp War, that had almoſt ruin'd the Nation, had not Providence in a manner immediatly interpos'd and

reſcu'd us to Liberty, and made us ſuch ſignal Inſtruments of his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, that all wicked Kings may tremble at the example.</p>
                  <p>IN a word, never was Man ſo reſolute and obſtinat in a Tyranny; never People more ſtrangely beſotted with it. To paint the Image of DAVID with his face, and blaſphemouſly to parallel him with CHRIST, would make one at firſt thought think him a Saint: But to compare his Proteſtations and Actions; his Actions of the Day, his Actions of the Night; his Proteſtant Religion, and his courting of the Pope; and obedience to his Wife; we may juſtly ſay, he was one of the moſt conſummat in the Arts of Tyranny that ever was. And it could be no other than God's hand that arreſted him in the height of his Deſigns and Greatneſs, and cut off him and his Family, making good his own Imprecations on his own Head.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="110"/> OUR Scene is again in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which has accepted his Son, whom for diſtinction ſake we will be content to call CHARLES the Second.

                     <hi>TO ſpeak of the People in each of theſe Countrys, this of</hi> Oceana, <hi>for ſo ſoft a one, is the moſt martial in the whole World.</hi> Let States that aim at Greatneſs <hi>(ſays VERULAMIUS)</hi> take heed how their Nobility and Gentlemen multiply too faſt, for that makes the common Subject grow to be a Peaſant and baſe Swain driven out of heart, and in effect but a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Laborer; juſt as you may ſee in Coppice Woods, if you leave the Staddels too thick, you ſhall never have clean <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderwood, but Shrubs and Buſhes: So in Countrys, if the Gentlemen be too many, the Commons will be baſe; and you will bring it to that at laſt, that not the hundredth Poll will be ſit for a Helmet, ſpecially as to the Infantry, which is the nerve of an Army, and ſo there will be great Population and little Strength. This of which I ſpeak has bin no where better ſeen than by comparing of <hi>Oceana</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> wherof <hi>Oceana,</hi> tho far leſs in Territory and Population, has bin nevertheleſs an overmatch, in regard the middle People of <hi>Oceana</hi> make good Soldiers, which the Peaſants in <hi>France</hi> do not <hi>In which words VERULAMIUS (as MACHIAVEL has don before him) harps much upon a ſtring which he has not perfectly tun'd, and that is the</hi> balance of Dominion or Property: <hi>as it follows more plainly in his praiſe</hi> of the profound and admirable device of <hi>PANURGUS</hi> King of <hi>Oceana,</hi> in making Farms and Houſes of Husbandry of a Standard; that is, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with ſuch a proportion of Land to them, as may breed a Subject to live in convenient plenty, and no ſervil condition, and to keep the Plow in the hand of the owners, and not mere hirelings.

And the Genius of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49467:44"/>
this Nation has ever had ſom reſemblance with that of antient <hi>Italy,</hi> which was wholly addicted to Commonwealths, and where <hi>Rome</hi> came to make the greateſt account of her ruſtic Tribes, and to call her Conſuls from the Plow; for in the way of Parlaments, which was the Government of this Realm, men of Country-lives have bin ſtill intruſted with the greateſt Affairs, and the People have conſtantly had an averſion to the ways of the Court. Ambition loving to be gay, and to fawn, has bin a Gallantry look'd upon as having ſomthing in it of the Livery; and Husbandry, or the country way of Life, tho of a groſſer ſpinning, as the beſt ſtuf of a Commonwealth, according to ARISTOTLE, ſuch a one being the moſt obſtinat Aſſertors of her Liberty, and the leaſt ſubject to Innovation or Turbulency. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till the Foundations (as will be hereafter ſhew'd) were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, this People was obſerv'd to be the leaſt ſubject to Shakings and Turbulency of any: Wheras Commonwealths, upon which the City Life has had the ſtronger influence, as <hi>Athens,</hi> have ſeldom or never bin quiet; but at the beſt are found to have injur'd their own buſineſs by over-doing it. Whence the Urban Tribes of <hi>Rome,</hi> conſiſting of the <hi>Turba forenſis,</hi> and <hi>Libertins</hi> that had receiv'd their Freedom by manumiſſion, were of no reputation in compariſon of the Ruſtics. It is true, that with <hi>Venice</hi> it may ſeem to be otherwiſe, in regard the Gentlemen (for ſo are all ſuch call'd as have a right to that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) are wholly addicted to the City Life: but then the <hi>Turba foren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> the Secretarys, <hi>Cittadini,</hi> with the reſt of the Populace, are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excluded. Otherwiſe a Commonwealth, conſiſting but of one City, would doubtleſs be ſtormy, in regard that Ambition would be every man's trade: but where it conſiſts of a Country, the Plow in the hands of the owner finds him a better calling, and produces the moſt innocent and ſteddy Genius of a Commonwealth, ſuch as is that of <hi>Oceana.</hi>

                     <hi>JANOTTI,</hi> the moſt excellent Deſcriber of the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> divides the whole Series of Government into two Times or Periods. The one ending with the Liberty of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the Courſe of Empire, as I may call it, of Antient Prudence, firſt diſcover'd to mankind by GOD himſelf in the Fabric of the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and afterwards pick'd out of his Footſteps in Nature, and unanimouſly follow'd by the <hi>Greecs</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> The other beginning with the Arms of CAESAR, which, extinguiſhing Liberty, were the Tranſition of Antient into Modern Prudence, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by thoſe Inundations of <hi>Huns, Goths, Vandals, Lombards, Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which, breaking the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, deform'd the whole face of the World with thoſe ill features of Government, which at this time are becom far worſe in theſe weſtern parts, except <hi>Venice,</hi> which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping the hands of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> by virtue of its impregnable Situation, has had its ey fix'd upon antient Prudence, and is attain'd to a perfection even beyond the Copy.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Definitions of Government.</note> RELATION being had to theſe two times, Government (to define it <hi>de jure,</hi> or according to antient Prudence) is an Art wherby a Civil Society of Men is inſtituted and preſerv'd upon the Foundation of common Right or Intereſt; or (to follow ARISTOTLE and LIVY) It is the Empire of Laws, and not of Men.</p>
                  <p>AND Government (to define it <hi>de facto,</hi> or according to modern Prudence) is an Art wherby ſom man, or ſom few men, ſubject a City or a Nation, and rule it according to his or their privat Intereſt: which, becauſe the Laws in ſuch caſes are made according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a man, or of ſom few Familys, may be ſaid to be the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Men, and not of Laws.</p>

THE former kind is that which MACHIAVEL (whoſe Books are neglected) is the only Politician that has gon about to retrieve; and <note place="margin">

For, <hi>It is</hi> (ſays he) <hi>another Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of</hi> ARISTOTLE'S <hi>Politics, that in a well-order'd Commonwealth not Men ſhould govern, but the Laws. What man that has his natural ſenſes, tho he can neither write nor read, dos not find himſelf govern'd by them he fears, and believes can kill or hurt him when he obeys not? Or, who believes that the Law can hurt him, which is but Words and Paper, without the Hands and Swords of men?</hi> I confeſs, that <note n="*" place="bottom">Magiſtratus eſt lex armata.</note>the Magiſtrat upon his Bench is that to the Law, which a Gunner upon his Platform is to his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. Nevertheleſs, I ſhould not dare to argue with a man of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity after this manner. A whole Army, tho they can neither write nor read, are not afraid of a Platform, which they know is but Earth or Stone; nor of a Cannon, which without a hand to give fire to it, is but cold Iron; therfore a whole Army is afraid of one man. But of this kind is the Ratiocination of LEVIATHAN (as I ſhall ſhew in divers places that com in my way) throout his whole Politics, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 111.</note>or worſe; as where he ſays <hi>of</hi> ARISTOTLE <hi>and of</hi> CICERO, <hi>of the</hi> Greecs, <hi>and of the</hi> Romans, <hi>who liv'd under popular States, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd thoſe Rights not from the Principles of Nature, but tranſcrib'd them into their Books, out of the practice of their own Commonwealths, as Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians deſcribe the Rules of Language out of Poets.</hi> Which is as if a man ſhould tell famous HERVY, that he tranſcrib'd his Circulation of the Blood not out of the Principles of Nature, but out of the Anatomy of this or that Body.</p>
                  <p>TO go on therfore with this preliminary Diſcourſe, I ſhall divide it (according to the two definitions of Government relating to JANOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TI'S two times) into two parts. The Firſt treating of the Principles of Government in general, and according to the Antients: The Second treating of the late Governments of <hi>Oceana</hi> in particular, and in that of modern Prudence.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Diviſion of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> GOVERNMENT, according to the Antients, and their learn'd Diſciple MACHIAVEL, the only Politician of later Ages, is of three kinds; The Government of One Man, or of the Better ſort, or of the whole People: which by their more learn'd names are call'd <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy.</hi> Theſe they hold, thro their proneneſs to degenerat, to be all evil. For wheras they that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern ſhould govern according to Reaſon, if they govern according to Paſſion, they do that which they ſhould not do. Wherfore as Reaſon and Paſſion are two things, ſo Government by Reaſon is one thing, and the corruption of Government by Paſſion is another thing, but not always another Government: as a Body that is alive is one thing, and a Body that is dead is another thing, but not always ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creature, tho the Corruption of one coms at length to be the Generation of another. The Corruption then of <hi>Monarchy</hi> is call'd <hi>Tyranny;</hi> that of <hi>Ariſtocracy, Oligarchy;</hi> and that of <hi>Democracy, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi> But Legiſlators having found theſe three Governments at the beſt to be naught, have invented another conſiſting of a mixture of them all, which only is good. This is the Doctrin of the Antients.</p>

BUT LEVIATHAN is poſitive, that they are all deceiv'd, and that there is no other Government in Nature than one of the three; as alſo that the Fleſh of them cannot ſtink, the names of their Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being but the names of mens Phanſies, which will be underſtood when we are ſhown which of them was <hi>Senatus Populuſque Romanus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO go my own way, and yet to follow the Antients, the Principles of Government are twofold; Internal, or the goods of the Mind; and External, or the goods of Fortune. The goods of the Mind are <note place="margin">Goods of the Mind and of Fortune.</note>natural or acquir'd Virtues, as Wiſdom, Prudence, and Courage, &amp;c. The goods of Fortune are Riches. There be goods alſo of the Body, as Health, Beauty, Strength; but theſe are not to be brought into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, upon this ſcore, becauſe if a Man or an Army acquires Victory or Empire, it is more from their Diſciplin, Arms, and Courage, than from their natural Health, Beauty, or Strength, in regard that a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conquer'd may have more of natural Strength, Beauty and Health, and yet find little remedy. The Principles of Government then are in the goods of the Mind, or in the goods of Fortune. To the goods of the Mind anſwers Authority; to the goods of Fortune, Power or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. <note place="margin">Empire and Authority.</note>Wherfore LEVIATHAN, tho he be right where he ſays that <hi>Riches are Power,</hi> is miſtaken where he ſays that <hi>Prudence, or the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Prudence, is Power:</hi> for the Learning or Prudence of a Man is no more Power than the Learning or Prudence of a Book or Author, which is properly Authority. A learned Writer may have Authority tho he has no Power; and a fooliſh Magiſtrat may have Power, tho he has otherwiſe no Eſteem or Authority. The difference of theſe two is obſerv'd by LIVY in EVANDER, of whom he ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">Regebat magis Autoritate quam Imperio.</note>that he govern'd rather by the Authority of others, than by his own Power.</p>

                  <p>BUT there be certain other Confuſions, which, being rooted in the balance, are of longer continuance, and of worſe conſequence; as firſt, where a Nobility holds half the Property, or about that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and the People the other half; in which caſe, without altering the balance, there is no remedy but the one muſt eat out the other: as the People did the Nobility in <hi>Athens,</hi> and the Nobility the People in <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly, when a Prince holds about half the Dominion, and the People the other half (which was the caſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, planted partly upon their military Colonies, and partly upon the Senat and the People) the Government becoms a very ſhambles both of the Princes and the People. Somwhat of this nature are certain Governments at this day, which are ſaid to ſubſiſt by confuſion. In this caſe, to fix the balance, is to entail miſery: but in the three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, not to fix it, is to loſe the Government. Wherfore it being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in <hi>Turky,</hi> that any ſhould poſſeſs Land but the Grand Signior, the balance is fix'd by the Law, and that Empire firm. Nor, tho the Kings often fell, was the Throne of <hi>Oceana</hi> known to ſhake, until the Statute of <hi>Alienations</hi> broke the Pillars, by giving way to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to ſell their Eſtates. <note n="*" place="bottom">Si terra recedat, Ionium Aegaeo frangat mare.</note>While <hi>Lacedemon</hi> held to the diviſion of Land made by LYCURGUS, it was immovable, but, breaking that, could ſtand no longer.

But without an <hi>Agrarian,</hi> Government, whether Monarchical, Ariſtocratical, or Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, has no long Leaſe.</p>
                  <p>AS for Dominion perſonal or in Mony, it may now and then ſtir up a MELIUS or a MANLIUS, which, if the Commonwealth be not provided with ſom kind of <hi>Dictatorian</hi> Power, may be dangerous, tho it has bin ſeldom or never ſucceſsful: becauſe to Property produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Empire, it is requir'd that it ſhould have ſom certain root or foothold, which, except in Land, it cannot have, being otherwiſe as it were upon the Wing.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Balance of foren Empire.</note> THE balance of Foren or Provincial Empire is of a contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. A man may as well ſay, that it is unlawful for him who has made a fair and honeſt purchaſe to have Tenants, as for a Government that has made a juſt progreſs, and inlargement of it ſelf, to have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. But how a Province may be juſtly acquir'd, appertains to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. In this I am to ſhew no more than how or upon what kind of balance it is to be held; in order wherto I ſhall firſt ſhew upon what kind of balance it is not to be held. It has bin ſaid, that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal or independent Empire, of what kind ſoever, is to be exercis'd
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49467:49"/>
by them that have the proper balance of Dominion in the Nation; wherfore provincial or dependent Empire is not to be exercis'd by them that have the balance of Dominion in the Province, becauſe that would bring the Government from Provincial and Dependent, to National and Independent. Abſolute Monarchy, as that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> neither plants its People at home nor abroad, otherwiſe than as Tenants for life or at will; wherfore its National and Provincial Government is all one. But in Governments that admit the Citizen or Subject to Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Lands, the richeſt are they that ſhare moſt of the Power at home; wheras the richeſt among the Provincials, tho native Subjects, or Citizens that have bin tranſplanted, are leaſt admitted to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment abroad: for men, like ſlowers or roots being tranſplanted, take after the ſoil wherin they grow. Wherfore the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> by planting Colonys of its Citizens within the bounds of <hi>Italy,</hi> took the beſt way of propagating it ſelf, and naturalizing the Country; wheras if it had planted ſuch Colonys without the bounds of <hi>Italy,</hi> it would have alienated the Citizens, and given a root to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty abroad that might have ſprung up foren, or ſavage, and hoſtil to her: wherfore it never made any ſuch diſperſion of it ſelf and its ſtrength, till it was under the yoke of the Emperors, who disburden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves of the People, as having leſs apprehenſion of what they could do abroad than at home, took a contrary courſe.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Mamalucs</hi> (which till any man ſhew me the contrary, I ſhall preſume to have bin a Commonwealth conſiſting of an Army, wherof the common Soldier was the People, the Commiſſion Officer the Senat, and the General the Prince) were Foreners, and by Nation <hi>Circaſſians,</hi> that govern'd <hi>Aegypt;</hi> wherfore theſe never durſt plant themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Dominion, which growing naturally up into the National Intereſt, muſt have diſſolv'd the foren yoke in that Province.</p>
                  <p>THE like in ſom ſort may be ſaid of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Government wherof is uſually miſtaken: for <hi>Venice,</hi> tho it dos not take in the People, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver excluded them. This Commonwealth, the Orders wherof are the moſt Democratical or Popular of all others, in regard of the exquiſit Rotation of the Senat, at the firſt inſtitution took in the whole People; they that now live under the Government without participation of it, are ſuch as have ſince either voluntarily choſen ſo to do, or were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd by Arms. Wherfore the Subject of <hi>Venice</hi> is govern'd by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; and the balance of Dominion not ſtanding, as has bin ſaid, with Provincial Government: As the <hi>Mamalucs</hi> durſt not caſt their Government upon this balance in their Provinces, leſt the National In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſhould have rooted out the Foren; ſo neither dare the <hi>Venetians</hi> take in their Subjects upon this balance, leſt the foren Intereſt ſhould root out the National (which is that of the 3000 now governing) and by diffuſing the Commonwealth throout her Territorys, loſe the advantage of her Situation, by which in great part it ſubſiſts. And ſuch alſo is the Government of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> to which he deputes Natives of his own Country, not admitting the <hi>Creolios</hi> to the Government of thoſe Provinces, tho deſcended from <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT if a Prince or a Commonwealth may hold a Territory that is foren in this, it may be ask'd, why he may not hold one that is native in the like manner? To which I anſwer, becauſe he can hold a foren by a native Territory, but not a native by a foren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as hitherto I have ſhewn what is not the provincial Balance, ſo by this anſwer it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49467:50"/>
may appear what it is, namely the Overbalance of a native Territory to a foren; for as one Country balances it ſelf by the diſtribution of Property according to the proportion of the ſame, ſo one Country over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balances another by advantage of divers kinds. For example, the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> overbalanc'd her Provinces by the vigor of a more excellent Government oppos'd to a crazier, or by a more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit Militia oppos'd to one inferior in Courage or Diſciplin. The like was that of the <hi>Mamalucs,</hi> being a hardy People, to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> that were a ſoft one. And the balance of Situation is in this kind of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effect; ſeeing the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> being none of the moſt potent Princes, is able at the <hi>Sound</hi> to take Toll of the greateſt: and as this King by the advantage of the Land can make the Sea tributary; ſo <hi>Venice,</hi> by the advantage of the Sea, in whoſe arms ſhe is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, can make the Land to feed her <hi>Gulf.</hi> For the Colonys in the <hi>Indies,</hi> they are yet Babes that cannot live without ſucking the breaſts of their Mother Citys, but ſuch as I miſtake if when they com of age they do not wean themſelves: which cauſes me to wonder at Princes that delight to be exhauſted in that way. And ſo much for the principles of Power, whether National or Provincial, Domeſtic or Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren; being ſuch as are external, and founded in the goods of Fortune.</p>

                     <hi>Folly is ſet in great dignity, and the Rich</hi> (either in Virtue and Wiſdom, in the goods of the Mind, or thoſe of Fortune upon that balance which gives them a ſenſe of the National Intereſt) <hi>ſit in low places. I have ſeen Servants upon horſes, and Princes walking as Servants upon the earth.</hi> Sad complaints, that the principles of Power and of Authority, the goods of the Mind and of Fortune, do not meet and twine in the Wreath or Crown of Empire! Wherfore, if we have any thing of Piety or of Prudence, let us raiſe our ſelves out of the mire of privat Intereſt to the contemplation of Virtue, and put a hand to the removal of <hi>this evil from under the Sun;</hi> this evil againſt which no Government that is not ſecur'd, can be good; this evil from which the Government that is ſecure muſt be perfect. SOLOMON tels us, that the cauſe of it is from the Ruler, from thoſe principles of power, which, balanc'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earthly traſh, exclude the heavenly treaſures of Virtue, and that influence of it upon Government, which is Authority. We have wander'd the Earth to find out the balance of power: but to find out that of Authority, we muſt aſcend, as I ſaid, nearer Heaven, or to the Image of God, which is the Soul of Man.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Soul of Man</hi> (whoſe life or motion is perpetual Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Thought) is the Miſtreſs of two potent Rivals, the one Reaſon, the other Paſſion, that are in continual ſuit; and, according as ſhe gives up her will to theſe or either of them, is the felicity or miſery which Man partakes in this mortal life.</p>

FOR as whatever was Paſſion in the contemplation of a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought forth by his will into action, is Vice and the bondage of Sin; ſo whatever was Reaſon in the contemplation of a man, being brought forth by his will into action, is virtue and the freedom of Soul.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, as thoſe actions of a man that were Sin acquire to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Repentance or Shame, and affect others with Scorn or Pity; ſo thoſe actions of a man that are Virtue acquire to himſelf Honor, and upon others Authority.</p>
                  <p>NOW Government is no other than the Soul of a Nation or City: wherfore that which was Reaſon in the debate of a Commonwealth being brought forth by the reſult, muſt be Virtue; and foraſmuch as the Soul of a City or Nation is the Soverain Power, her Virtue muſt be Law. But the Government whoſe Law is Virtue, and whoſe Virtue is Law, is the ſame whoſe Empire is Authority, and whoſe Authority is Empire.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, If the Liberty of a man conſiſts in the Empire of his Reaſon, the abſence wherof would betray him to the bondage of his Paſſions; then the Liberty of a Commonwealth conſiſts in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of her Laws, the abſence wherof would betray her to the Luſt of Tyrants. And theſe I conceive to be the Principles upon which ARI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STOTLE and LIVY (injuriouſly accus'd by LEVIATHAN for not writing out of nature) have grounded their Aſſertion, <hi>That a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is an Empire of Laws, and not of Men.</hi> But they muſt not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>honorable mention in the Hiſtorys and Philoſophy of the antient Greecs and Romans, and the Writings and Diſcourſes of thoſe that from them have receiv'd all their Learning in the Politics, is not the Liberty of particular Men, but the Liberty of the Commonwealth.</hi> He might as well have ſaid, that the Eſtates of particular Men in a Commonwealth are not the Riches of particular Men, but the Riches of the Commonwealth; for equality of Eſtates cauſes equality of Power, and equality of Power is the Liberty not only of the Commonwealth, but of every Man. But ſure a Man would never be thus irreverent with the greateſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and poſitive againſt all Antiquity, without ſom certain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Truth: and, what is it?

The firſt may be ſaid of all Governments alike; the ſecond ſcarce of any two; much leſs of theſe, ſeeing it is known, that wheras the greateſt <hi>Baſha</hi> is a Tenant, as well of his Head as of his Eſtate, at the Will of his Lord, the meaneſt <hi>Luccheſe</hi> that has Land, is a Freeholder of both, and not to be control'd but by the Law, and that fram'd by every privat Man to no other end (or they may thank themſelves) than to protect the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of every privat Man, which by that means coms to be the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Commonwealth.</p>

BUT ſeeing they that make the Laws in Commonwealths are but Men, the main Queſtion ſeems to be, how a Commonwealth coms to be an Empire of Laws, and not of Men? or how the Debate or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of a Commonwealth is ſo ſure to be according to Reaſon; ſeeing they who debate, and they who reſolve, be but Men? <hi>And as often</hi>

Wherfore unleſs you can ſhew ſuch Orders of a Government, as, like thoſe of God in Nature, ſhall be able to conſtrain this or that Creature to ſhake off that Inclination which is more peculiar to it, and take up that which regards the common Good or Intereſt; all this is to no more end, than to perſuade every man in a popular Government not to carve himſelf of that which he deſires moſt, but to be mannerly at the public Table, and give the beſt from himſelf to Decency and the common Intereſt. But that ſuch Orders may be eſtabliſh'd, as may, nay muſt give the upper hand in all caſes to common Right or Intereſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the nearneſs of that which ſticks to every man in privat, and this in a way of equal certainty and facility, is known even to Girls, being no other than thoſe that are of common practice with them in

divers caſes. For example, two of them have a Cake yet undivided, which was given between them: that each of them therfore may have that which is due, Divide, ſays one to the other, and I will chuſe; or let me divide, and you ſhall chuſe. If this be but once agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is enough: for the divident, dividing unequally, loſes, in regard that the other takes the better half; wherfore ſhe divides equally, and ſo both have right. <hi>O the depth of the Wiſdom of God!</hi> and yet <hi>by the mouths of Babes and Sucklings has he ſet forth his ſtrength;</hi> that which great Philoſophers are diſputing upon in vain, is brought to light by two harmleſs Girls, even the whole Myſtery of a Commonwealth, which lys only in dividing and chuſing. Nor has God (if his Works in Nature be underſtood) left ſo much to Mankind to diſpute upon, as who ſhall divide, and who chuſe, but diſtributed them for ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Orders, wherof the one has the natural right of dividing, and the other of chuſing. For Example:</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Orders of popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Nature.</note> A COMMONWEALTH is but a civil Society of Men: let us take any number of Men (as twenty) and immediatly make a Commonwealth. Twenty Men (if they be not all Idiots, perhaps if they be) can never com ſo together, but there will be ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in them, that about a third will be wiſer, or at leaſt leſs fooliſh than all the reſt; theſe upon acquaintance, tho it be but ſmall, will be diſcover'd, and (as Stags that have the largeſt heads) lead the herd: for while the ſix diſcourſing and arguing one with another, ſhew the eminence of their parts, the fourteen diſcover things that they never thought on; or are clear'd in divers Truths which had formerly perplex'd them.

Wherfore the Office of the Senat is not to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, but Counſellors of the People; and that which is proper to Counſellors is firſt to debate, and afterward to give advice in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs wherupon they have debated; whence the Decrees of the Senat are never Laws, nor ſo <note n="†" place="bottom">Senatuſconſulta.</note>call'd: and theſe being maturely fram'd, it is their duty <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ferre ad Populum.</note>to propoſe in the caſe to the People. Wherfore the Senat is no more than the debate of the Commonwealth. But to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, is to diſcern or put a difference between things that, being alike, are not the ſame; or it is ſeparating and weighing this reaſon againſt that, and that reaſon againſt this, which is dividing.</p>

Now there being no other Commonwealth but this in Art or Nature, it is no wonder if MACCHIAVEL has ſhew'd us that the Antients held this only to be good; but it ſeems ſtrange to me, that they ſhould hold that there could be any other: for if there be ſuch a thing as pure <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> yet that there ſhould be ſuch a one as pure <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> or pure <hi>Democracy,</hi> is not in my underſtanding.

The Power therfore which the People had to depoſe even God himſelf as he was Civil Magiſtrat, leaves little doubt but that they had power to have rejected any of thoſe Laws confirm'd by them throout the

And
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49467:54"/>
for the executive part they have Magiſtrats or Judges in every Canton, Province or City, beſides thoſe which are more public, and relate to the League, as for adjuſting Controverſies between one Canton, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince or City, and another; or the like between ſuch perſons as are not of the ſame Canton, Province or City.</p>

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 170.</note>And yet LEVIATHAN will have it, that <hi>by reading of theſe Greec and Latin</hi> (he might as well in this ſenſe have ſaid <hi>Hebrew) Authors, young Men, and all others that are unprovided of the antidot of ſolid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, receiving a ſtrong and delightful impreſſion of the great Exploits of War, atchiev'd by the Conductors of their Armys, receive withal a pleaſing Idea of all they have don beſides; and imagin their great proſperity not to have proceded from the emulation of particular Men, but from the virtue of their popular form of Government, not conſidering the frequent Seditions and Civil Wars produc'd by the imperfection of their Polity.</hi> Where, firſt, the blame he lays to the Heathen Authors is in his ſenſe laid to the Scripture; and wheras he holds them to be young Men, or Men of no antidot that are of like opinions, it ſhould ſeem that MACCHIAVEL, the ſole retriever of this antient Prudence, is to his ſolid Reaſon a beardleſs Boy that has newly read LIVY. And how ſolid his Reaſon is, may appear, where he grants the great proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of antient Commonwealths, which is to give up the Controverſy. For ſuch an effect muſt have ſom adequat cauſe; which to evade he inſinuats that it was nothing elſe but the emulation of particular Men: as if ſo great an Emulation could have bin generated without as great Virtue; ſo great Virtue without the beſt Education; the beſt Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without the beſt Laws; or the beſt Laws any otherwiſe than by the excellency of their Polity.</p>
                  <p>BUT if ſom of theſe Commonwealths, as being leſs perfect in their Polity than others, have bin more ſeditious, it is not more an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the infirmity of this or that Commonwealth in particular, than of the excellency of that kind of Polity in general; which if they, that have not altogether reach'd, have nevertheleſs had greater proſperity, what would befal them that ſhould reach?</p>
                  <p>IN anſwer to which Queſtion let me invite LEVIATHAN, who of all other Governments gives the advantage to Monarchy for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to a better diſquiſition of it by theſe three aſſertions.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt, That the perfection of Government lys upon ſuch a libration in the frame of it, that no Man or Men in or under it can have the intereſt; or having the intereſt, can have the power to diſturb it with Sedition.</p>
                  <p>THE ſecond, That Monarchy, reaching the perfection of the kind, reaches not to the perfection of Government; but muſt have ſom dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous flaw in it.</p>
                  <p>THE third, That popular Government, reaching the perfection of the kind, reaches the perfection of Government, and has no flaw in it.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt aſſertion requires no proof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:49467:54"/>
FOR the proof of the ſecond; Monarchy, as has bin ſhewn, is of two kinds, the one by Arms, the other by a Nobility, and there is no other kind in Art or Nature: for if there have bin antiently ſom Governments call'd Kingdoms, as one of the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> where the King rul'd without a Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and by a Council of the People only; it is expreſly ſaid by the Authors that mention them, that the Kings were but the Captains, and that the People not only gave them Laws, but depos'd them as often as they pleas'd. Nor is it poſſible in reaſon that it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in like caſes; wherfore theſe were either no Monarchys, or had greater ſlaws in them than any other.</p>
                  <p>BUT for a Monarchy by Arms, as that of the <hi>Ture</hi> (which of all models that ever were coms up to the perfection of the kind) it is not in the wit or power of Man to cure it of this dangerous flaw, That the <hi>Janizarys</hi> have frequent intereſt and perpetual power to raiſe Sedition, and to tear the Magiſtrat, even the Prince himſelf, in pieces. Therfore the Monarchy of <hi>Turky</hi> is no perfect Government.</p>
                  <p>AND for a Monarchy by a Nobility, as of late in <hi>Oceana</hi> (which of all other models before the declination of it came up to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in that kind) it was not in the power or wit of Man to cure it of that dangerous flaw, That the Nobility had frequent intereſt and perpetual power by their Retainers and Tenants to raiſe Sedition; and (wheras the <hi>Janizarys</hi> occaſion this kind of Calamity no ſooner than they make an end of it) to levy a laſting War, to the vaſt effuſion of Blood, and that even upon occaſions wherin the People, but for their dependence upon their Lords, had no concernment, as in the feud of the <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>White.</hi> The like has bin frequent in <hi>Spain, France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and other Monarchys of this kind; wherfore Monarchy by a Nobility is no perfect Government.</p>
                  <p>FOR the proof of the third aſſertion; LEVIATHAN yields it to me, that there is no other Commonwealth but Monarchical or Popular: wherfore if no Monarchy be a perfect Government, then either there is no perfect Government, or it muſt be popular; for which kind of Conſtitution I have ſomthing more to ſay, than LEVIATHAN has ſaid or ever will be able to ſay for Monarchy. As,</p>
                  <p>FIRST, That it is the Government that was never conquer'd by any Monarch, from the beginning of the World to this day: for if the Commonwealths of <hi>Greece</hi> came under the yoke of the Kings of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> they were firſt broken by themſelves.</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY, That it is the Government that has frequently led mighty Monarchs in Triumph.</p>
                  <p>THIRDLY, That it is the Government, which, if it has bin ſeditious, it has not bin ſo from any imperfection in the kind, but in the particular Conſtitution; which, wherever the like has happen'd, muſt have bin inequal.</p>
                  <p>FOURTHLY, That it is the Government, which, if it has bin any thing near equal, was never ſeditious; or let him ſhew me what Sedition has happen'd in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> or <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FIFTHLY, That it is the Government, which, attaining to perfect equality, has ſuch a libration in the frame of it, that no Man living can ſhew which way any Man or Men, in or under it, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract any ſuch Intereſt or Power as ſhould be able to diſturb the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth with Sedition; wherfore an equal Commonwealth is that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49467:55"/>
only which is without flaw, and contains in it the full perfection of Government. But to return.</p>
                  <p>BY what has bin ſhewn in Reaſon and Experience it may appear, that tho Commonwealths in general be Governments of the Senat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, the People reſolving, and the Magiſtracy executing; yet ſom are not ſo good at theſe Orders as others, thro ſom impediment or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the frame, balance, or capacity of them, according to which they are of divers kinds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Diviſion of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.</note> THE firſt diviſion of them is into ſuch as are ſingle, as <hi>Iſrael, Athens, Lacedemon,</hi> &amp;c. and ſuch as are by Leagues, as thoſe of the <hi>Acheans, Etolians, Lyceans, Switz,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders.</hi>

                  <p>THE ſecond (being MACCHIAVEL'S) is into ſuch as are for preſervation, as <hi>Lacedemon</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſuch as are for increaſe, as <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> in which I can ſee no more than that the former takes in no more Citizens than are neceſſary for defence, and the latter ſo many as are capable of increaſe.</p>
                  <p>THE third diviſion (unſeen hitherto) is into equal and inequal, and this is the main point, eſpecially as to domeſtic Peace and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; for to make a Commonwealth inequal, is to divide it into partys, which ſets them at perpetual variance, the one party endeavoring to preſerve their Eminence and Inequality, and the other to attain to Equality: whence the People of <hi>Rome</hi> deriv'd their perpetual ſtrife with the Nobility or Senat. But in an equal Commonwealth there can be no more ſtrife than there can be overbalance in equal weights; wherfore the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> being that which of all others is the moſt equal in the Conſtitution, is that wherin there never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd any ſtrife between the Senat and the People.</p>
                  <p>AN equal Commonwealth is ſuch a one as is equal both in the balance or foundation, and in the ſuperſtructure; that is to ſay, in her Agrarian Law, and in her Rotation.</p>

was a welcom Conſtitution to the People, as that which, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the aſſurance of their brows, increas'd the freedom of their Judgment. I have not ſtood upon a more particular deſcription of this Ballot, becauſe that of <hi>Venice</hi> exemplify'd in the Model is of all others the moſt perfect.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Definition of an equal Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> AN <hi>equal Commonwealth</hi> (by that which has bin ſaid) <hi>is a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſh'd upon an equal Agrarian, ariſing into the Superſtructures or three Orders, the Senat debating and propoſing, the People reſolving, and the Magiſtracy executing by an equal Rotation thro the ſuffrage of the People given by the Ballot.</hi> For tho Rotation may be without the Ballot, and the Ballot without Rotation, yet the Ballot not only as to the inſuing Model includes both, but is by far the moſt equal way; for which cauſe under the name of the Ballot I ſhall hereafter under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand both that and Rotation too.</p>
                  <p>NOW having reaſon'd the Principles of an equal Commonwealth, I ſhould com to give an inſtance of ſuch a one in experience, if I could find it; but if this work be of any value, it lys in that it is the firſt example of a Commonwealth that is perfectly equal. For <hi>Venice,</hi> tho it coms the neareſt, yet is a Commonwealth for preſervation; and ſuch a one, conſidering the paucity of Citizens taken in, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not taken in, is externally unequal: and tho every Commonwealth that holds Provinces muſt in that regard be ſuch, yet not to that degree. Nevertheleſs <hi>Venice</hi> internally, and for her capacity, is by far the moſt equal, tho it has not in my judgment arriv'd at the full perfection of equality; both becauſe her Laws ſupplying the defect of an Agrarian, are not ſo clear nor effectual at the Foundation, nor her Superſtructures by the virtue of her Ballot or Rotation exactly librated; in regard that thro the paucity of her Citizens, her greater Magiſtracys are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually wheel'd thro a few hands, as is conſeſt by JANOTTI where he ſays, that if a Gentleman coms once to be <hi>Savio di terra ferma,</hi> it ſeldom happens that he fails from thenceforward to be adorn'd with ſom one of the greater Magiſtracys, as <hi>Savi di mare, Savi di terra fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Savi Grandi,</hi> Counſellors, thoſe of the Decemvirat or Dictatorian Council, the <hi>Aurogatori</hi> or Cenſors which require no vacation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval. Wherfore if this in <hi>Venice,</hi> or that in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> where the Kings were hereditary, and the Senators (tho elected by the People) for life, cauſe no inequality (which is hard to be conceiv'd) in a Commonwealth for preſervation, or ſuch a one as conſiſts of a few Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; yet is it manifeſt, that it would cauſe a very great one in a Commonwealth for increaſe, or conſiſting of the Many, which by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing the Magiſtracys in a few hands, would be obſtructed in their Rotation.</p>
                  <p>BUT there be who ſay (and think it a ſtrong Objection) that let a Commonwealth be as equal as you can imagin, two or three Men when all is don will govern it; and there is that in it, which, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pretended ſufficiency of a popular State, amounts to a plain confeſſion of the imbecillity of that Policy, and of the Prerogative of Monarchy: for as much as popular Governments in difficult caſes have had recourſe to Dictatorian Power, as in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO which I anſwer, That as Truth is a ſpark to which Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are like bellows, ſo in this reſpect our Commonwealth ſhines; for the Eminence acquir'd by ſuffrage of the People in a Commonwealth, eſpecially if it be popular and equal, can be aſcended by no other ſteps
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49467:56"/>
than the univerſal acknowlegement of Virtue: and where men excel in Virtue, the Commonwealth is ſtupid and injuſt, if accordingly they do not excel in Authority. Wherfore this is both the advantage of Virtue, which has her due incouragement, and of the Commonwealth which has her due ſervices. Theſe are the Philoſophers which PLATO would have to be Princes, the Princes which SOLOMON would have to be mounted, and their Steeds are thoſe of Authority, not Empire; or, if they be buckl'd to the Chariot of Empire, as that of the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian Power, like the Chariot of the Sun, it is glorious for terms and vacations, or intervals. And as a Commonwealth is a Government of Laws and not of Men, ſo is this the Principality of Virtue, and not of Man; if that fail or ſet in one, it riſes in another <note n="*" place="bottom">Uno avulſo, non deficit alter Aureus, &amp; ſimili frondeſcit virga metallo.</note>who is created his immediat Succeſſor. And this takes away that vanity from under the Sun, which is an Error proceding more or leſs from all other Rulers under Heaven but an equal Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>THESE things conſider'd, it will be convenient in this place to ſpeak a word to ſuch as go about to inſinuat to the Nobility or Gentry a fear of the People, or to the People a fear of the Nobility or Gentry, as if their intereſts were deſtructive to each other; when indeed an Army may as well conſiſt of Soldiers without Officers, or of Officers without Soldiers, as a Commonwealth (eſpecially ſuch a one as is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Greatneſs) of a People without a Gentry, or of a Gentry without a People. Wherfore this (tho not always ſo intended, as may appear by MACCHIAVEL, who elſe would be guilty) is a pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous error. There is ſomthing firſt in the making of a Commonwealth, then in the governing of it, and laſt of all in the leading of its Armys; which (tho there be great Divines, great Lawyers, great men in all profeſſions) ſeems to be peculiar only to the Genius of a Gentleman. For ſo it is in the univerſal ſeries of Story, that if any man has found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Commonwealth, he was firſt a Gentleman MOSES had his Education by the Daughter of PHARAOH; THESEUS and SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LON, of noble Birth, were held by the <hi>Athenians</hi> worthy to be Kings; LYCURGUS was of the Royal Blood; ROMULUS and NUMA Princes; BRUTUS and PUBLICOLA <hi>Patricians;</hi> the GRACCHI, that loſt their lives for the People of <hi>Rome</hi> and the reſtitution of that Commonwealth, were the Sons of a Father adorn'd with two Triumphs, and of CORNELIA the Daughter of SCIPIO, who being demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in marriage by King PTOLOMY, diſdain'd to becom the Queen of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And the moſt renown'd OLPHAUS MEGALETOR, ſole Legiſlator (as you will ſee anon) of the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana,</hi> was deriv'd from a noble Family: nor will it be any occaſion of ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this caſe, that LEVIATHAN affirms the Politics to be no anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter than his Book <hi>de Cive.</hi> Such alſo as have got any fame in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government of a Commonwealth, or by the leading of its Armys, have bin Gentlemen; for ſo in all other reſpects were thoſe plebeian Magiſtrats elected by the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> being of known Deſcents, and of equal Virtues, except only that they were excluded from the name by the Uſurpation of the <hi>Patricians. Holland,</hi> thro this defect at home, has borrow'd Princes for Generals, and Gentlemen of divers Nations for Commanders: And the <hi>Switzers,</hi> if they have any defect in this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49467:56"/>
kind, rather lend their People to the Colors of other Princes, than make that noble uſe of them at home, which ſhould aſſert the Liberty of Mankind. For where there is not a Nobility to hearten the People, they are ſlothful, regardleſs of the World, and of the public intereſt of Liberty, as even thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> had bin without their Gentry: wherfore let the People embrace the Gentry in peace, as the light of their eys; and in war, as the trophy of their arms. And if COR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NELIA diſdain'd to be Queen of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if a Roman Conſul look'd down from his Tribunal upon the greateſt King; let the Nobility love and cheriſh the People that afford them a Throne ſo much higher in a Commonwealth, in the acknowledgement of their Virtue, than the Crowns of Monarchs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">An inequal Commonwealth.</note> BUT if the equality of a Commonwealth conſiſt in the equality firſt of the Agrarian, and next of the Rotation, then the inequality of a Commonwealth muſt conſiſt in the abſence or inequality of the Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, or of the Rotation, or of both.</p>
                  <p>ISRAEL and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> which Commonwealths (as the People of this, in JOSEPHUS, claims kindred of that) have great reſemblance, were each of them equal in their Agrarian, and inequal in their Rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; eſpecially <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> or Senat, firſt elected by the People, as appears by the words of MOSES, took upon them <note place="margin">Deut. 1.</note>ever after, without any precept of God, to ſubſtitute their Succeſſors by Ordination; which having bin there of civil uſe, as Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Community of Goods, and other Cuſtoms of the <hi>Eſſeans,</hi> who were many of them converted, came afterward to be introduc'd into the Chriſtian Church. And the election of the Judg, <hi>Suffes</hi> or Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, was irregular, both for the occaſion, the term, and the vacation of that Magiſtracy; as you find in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> where it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated, That in thoſe days there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, no Judg: and in the firſt of SAMUEL, where ELY judg'd <hi>Iſrael</hi> forty years, and SAMUEL all his life. In <hi>Lacedemon</hi> the election of the Senat being by ſuffrage of the People, tho for life, was not altogether ſo inequal; yet the hereditary Right of Kings, were it not for the Agrarian, had ruin'd her.</p>
                  <p>ATHENS and <hi>Rome</hi> were inequal as to their Agrarian, that of <hi>Athens</hi> being infirm, and this of <hi>Rome</hi> none at all; for if it were more antiently carry'd, it was never obſerv'd. Whence by the time of TI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERIUS GRACCHUS the Nobility had almoſt eaten the People quite out o their Lands, which they held in the occupation of Tenants and Servants: Wherupon, the remedy being too late, and too vehemently apply'd, that Commonwealth was ruin'd.</p>
                  <p>THESE alſo were inequal in their Rotation, but in a contrary manner. <hi>Athens,</hi> in regard that the Senat (choſen at once by lot, not by ſuffrage, and chang'd every year, not in part, but in the whole) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted not of the natural Ariſtocracy; nor ſitting long enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or to be perfect in their office, had no ſufficient Authority to reſtrain the People from that perpetual Turbulence in the end, which was their ruin, notwithſtanding the efforts of NICIAS, who did all a man could do to help it. But as <hi>Athens</hi> by the headineſs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo <hi>Rome</hi> fell by the Ambition of the Nobility, thro the want of an equal Rotation; which, if the People had got into the Senat, and timely into the Magiſtracys (wherof the former was always uſurp'd
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49467:57"/>
by the <hi>Patricians,</hi> and the latter for the moſt part) they had both car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd and held their Agrarian, and that had render'd that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth immovable.</p>
                  <p>BUT let a Commonwealth be equal or inequal, it muſt conſiſt, as has bin ſhewn by Reaſon and all Experience, of the three general Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; that is to ſay, of the Senat debating and propoſing, of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reſolving, and of the Magiſtracy executing. Wherfore I can never wonder enough at LEVIATHAN, who, without any reaſon or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, will have it, that a Commonwealth conſiſts of a ſingle Perſon, or of a ſingle Aſſembly; nor can I ſufficiently pity thoſe <hi>thouſand Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, whoſe Minds, which otherwiſe would have waver'd, he has fram'd</hi> (as is affirm'd by himſelf) <hi>into a conſcientious obedience</hi> (for ſo he is pleas'd to call it) <hi>of ſuch a Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT to finiſh this part of the Diſcourſe, which I intend for as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete an Epitome of antient Prudence, and in that of the whole Art of Politics, as I am able to frame in ſo ſhort a time;</p>
                  <p>THE two firſt Orders, that is to ſay, the Senat and the People, are Legiſlative, wherunto anſwers that part of this Science which by Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians is intitl'd <note n="*" place="bottom">De Legibus.</note>
                     <hi>of Laws;</hi> and the third Order is executive, to which anſwers that part of the ſame Science which is ſtil'd <note n="†" place="bottom">De Judiciis.</note>
                     <hi>of the Frame and Courſe of Courts or Judicatorys.</hi> A word to each of theſe will be neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Laws.</note> AND firſt for Laws, they are either Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, ſuch as concern Religion or Government.</p>
                  <p>LAWS Eccleſiaſtical, or ſuch as concern Religion, according to the univerſal courſe of antient Prudence, are in the power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat; but according to the common practice of modern Prudence, ſince the Papacy, torn out of his hands.</p>
                  <p>BUT, as a Government pretending to Liberty, and yet ſuppreſſing Liberty of Conſcience (which, becauſe Religion not according to a man's Conſcience can to him be none at all, is the main) muſt be a contradiction; ſo, a man that, pleading for the Liberty of privat Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, refuſes Liberty to the National Conſcience, muſt be abſurd.</p>
                  <p>A COMMONWEALTH is nothing elſe but the National Conſcience. And if the conviction of a mans privat Conſcience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces his privat Religion, the conviction of the national Conſcience muſt produce a national Religion. Whether this be well reaſon'd, as alſo whether theſe two may ſtand together, will beſt be ſhewn by the examples of the antient Commonwealths taken in their order.</p>
                  <p>IN that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Government of the National Religion apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd not to the Prieſts and Levits, otherwiſe than as they happen'd to be of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> or Senat, to which they had no right at all but by election. It is in this capacity therfore that the People are commanded <note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note>under pain of death <hi>to hearken to them, and to do according to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law which they ſhould teach;</hi> but in <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Law Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and Civil was the ſame, therfore the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> having the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of one, had the power of both. But as the National Religion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain'd to the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> ſo the Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience appertain'd, from the ſame date, and by the ſame right, to the <note place="margin">Deut. 18. 10.</note>Prophets and their Diſciples; as where it is ſaid, <hi>I will raiſe up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49467:57"/>
—<hi>and whoever will not hearken to my words which he ſhall ſpeak in my name, I will require it of him.</hi> The words relate to prophetic Right, which was above all the Orders of this Commonwealth; whence ELIJAH not only refus'd to obey the King, but deſtroy'd his <note place="margin">2 Kings 1.</note>Meſſengers with fire. And wheras it was not lawful by the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Religion to ſacrifice in any other place than the Temple, a Prophet was his own Temple, and might ſacrifice where he would, as ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JAH did in <hi>Mount Carmel.</hi> By this right JOHN <hi>the Baptiſt</hi> and our <note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 19.</note>Savior, to whom it more particularly related, had their Diſciples, and taught the People; whence is deriv'd our preſent right of GATHER'D CONGREGATIONS: Wherfore the Chriſtian Religion grew up according to the Orders of the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and not againſt them. Nor was Liberty of Conſcience infring'd by this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, till the civil Liberty of the ſame was loſt, as under HE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROD, PILAT, and TIBERIUS, a threepil'd Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>TO procede, <hi>Athens</hi> preſerv'd her Religion, by the teſtimony of PAUL, with great Superſtition: If ALCIBIADES, that Atheiſtical fellow, had not ſhew'd them a pair of heels, they had ſhaven off his head for ſhaving their MERCURYS, and making their Gods look ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly upon them without beards. Nevertheleſs, if PAUL reaſon'd with them, they lov'd news, for which he was the more welcom; and if he converted DIONYSIUS the <hi>Areopagit,</hi> that is, one of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, there follow'd neither any hurt to him, nor loſs of honor to DIONYSIUS. And for <hi>Rome,</hi> if CICERO, in his moſt excellent Book <hi>de natura Deorum,</hi> overthrew the National Religion of that Commonwealth, he was never the farther from being Conſul. But there is a meanneſs and poorneſs in modern Prudence, not only to the damage of Civil Government, but of Religion it ſelf: for to make a man in matter of Religion, which admits not of ſenſible demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>(jurare in verba Magiſtri)</hi> engage to believe no otherwiſe than is believ'd by my Lord Biſhop, or Goodman Presbyter, is a Pedantiſm, that has made the Sword to be a Rod in the hands of Schoolmaſters; by which means, wheras the Chriſtian Religion is the fartheſt of any from countenancing War, there never was a War of Religion but ſince Chriſtianity: For which we are beholden to the Pope; for the Pope not giving liberty of Conſcience to Princes and Commonwealths, they cannot give that to their Subjects which they have not themſelves: whence both Princes and Subjects either thro his inſtigation, or their own diſputes, have introduc'd that execrable cuſtom, never known in the world before, of ſighting for Religion, and denying the Magiſtrat to have any juriſdiction concerning it; wheras the Magiſtrats loſing the power of Religion loſes the Liberty of Conſcience, which in that caſe has nothing to protect it. But if the People be otherwiſe taught, it concerns them to look about them, and to diſtinguiſh between the ſhrieking of the Lapwing, and the voice of the Turtle.</p>
                  <p>TO com to Civil Laws, if they ſtand one way and the balance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, it is the caſe of a Government which of neceſſity muſt be new model'd; wherfore your Lawyers adviſing you upon the like occaſions to fit your Government to their Laws, are no more to be regarded, than your Taylor if he ſhould deſire you to fit your body to his dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet. There is alſo danger in the plauſible pretence of reforming the Law, except the Government be firſt good, in which caſe it is a good
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49467:58"/>
Tree, and (trouble not your ſelves overmuch) brings not forth evil fruit; otherwiſe, if the Tree be evil, you can never reform the fruit: or if a Root that is naught bring forth fruit of this kind that ſeems to be good, take the more heed, for it is the ranker poiſon. It was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe probable, if AUGUSTUS had not made excellent Laws, that the bowels of <hi>Rome</hi> could have com to be ſo miſerably eaten out by the Tyranny of TIBERIUS and his Succeſſors. The beſt Rule as to your Laws in general is, that they be few. <hi>Rome</hi> by the teſtimony of CICERO was beſt govern'd under thoſe of the twelve Tables; and by that of TACITUS, <hi>Plurimae leges, corruptiſſima reſpublica.</hi> You will be told, That where the Laws be few, they leave much to Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power; but where they be many, they leave more: The Laws in this caſe, according to JUSTINIAN and the beſt Lawyers, being as litigious as the Suitors. SOLON made few; LYCURGUS fewer Laws: and Commonwealths have the feweſt at this day of all other Governments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Courts.</note> NOW to conclude this part with a word <hi>de Judiciis,</hi> or of the <hi>Conſtitution or Courſe of Courts;</hi> it is a Diſcourſe not otherwiſe capable of being well manag'd but by particular examples, both the Conſtitution and Courſe of Courts being divers in different Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but beſt beyond compare in <hi>Venice,</hi> where they regard not ſo much the Arbitrary Power of their Courts, as the Conſtitution of them; wherby that Arbitrary Power being altogether unable to retard or do hurt to buſineſs, produces and muſt produce the quickeſt diſpatch, and the moſt righteous dictats of Juſtice that are perhaps in human nature.

But as there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the Bulk or Conſtitution of modern Prudence, that it ſhould ever have bin able to com up and grapple with the Antient, ſo ſomthing of neceſſity muſt have interpos'd, wherby this came to be enervated, and that to receive ſtrength and incouragement. And this was the execrable Reign of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors taking riſe from (that <hi>foelix ſcelus)</hi> the Arms of CAESAR, in which ſtorm the Ship of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth was forc'd to disburden it ſelf of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Fraight, which never ſince could emerge or raiſe its head but in the <hi>Gulf of Venice.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Agrarian Laws of the Romans.</note> THEIR Agrarian Laws were ſuch, wherby their Lands ought to have bin divided among the People, either without mention of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, in which caſe they were not oblig'd to change their abode; or with mention and upon condition of a Colony, in which caſe they <note place="margin">Sigonius de Ant. Ro.</note>were to change their abode; and leaving the City, to plant themſelves upon the Lands ſo aſſign'd. The Lands aſſign'd, or that ought to have bin aſſign'd in either of theſe ways, were of three kinds: Such as were taken from the Enemy and diſtributed to the People; or ſuch as were taken from the Enemy, and under color of being reſerv'd to the Public uſe, were thro ſtealth poſſeſt by the Nobility; or ſuch as were bought with the Public Mony to be diſtributed. Of the Laws offer'd in theſe caſes, thoſe which divided the Lands taken from the Enemy, or purchas'd with the Public Mony, never occaſion'd any diſpute; but ſuch as drove at diſpoſſeſſing the Nobility of their Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, and dividing the <hi>common purchaſe of the Sword among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> were never touch'd but they caus'd Earthquakes, nor could they ever be obtain'd by the People; or being obtain'd, be obſerv'd by the Nobility, who not only preſerv'd their prey, but growing vaſtly rich upon it, bought the People by degrees quite out of thoſe Shares that had been confer'd upon them. This the GRACCHI coming too late to perceive, found the Balance of the Commonwealth to be loſt; but putting the People (when they had leaſt force) by forcible means upon the recovery of it, did ill, ſeeing it neither could nor did tend to any more than to ſhew them by worſe effects, that what the Wiſdom of their Leaders had diſcover'd was true. For (quite contrary to what has happen'd in <hi>Oceana,</hi> where, <hi>the Balance falling to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

                     <note place="margin">The Balance of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note> THESE Military Colonys (in which manner ſucceding Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors continu'd, as AUGUSTUS by the diſtribution of the <hi>Veterans,</hi> wherby he had overcom BRUTUS and CASSIUS, to plant their Soldiery) conſiſted of ſuch as I conceive were they that are call'd <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites beneficiarii;</hi> in regard that the Tenure of their Lands was by way of Benefices, that is for Life, and upon condition of Duty or Service in the War upon their own Charge. Theſe Benefices ALEXANDER SEVERUS granted to the Heirs of the Incumbents, but upon the ſame conditions. And ſuch was the Dominion by which the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors gave their Balance. But to the Beneficiarys, as was no leſs than neceſſary for the ſafety of the Prince, a matter of eight thouſand by the Example of AUGUSTUS were added, which departed not from his ſides, but were his perpetual Guard, call'd <hi>Pretorian Bands;</hi> tho theſe, according to the incurable flaw already obſerv'd in this kind of Government, became the moſt frequent Butchers of their Lords that are to be found in Story. Thus far the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy is much the ſame with that at this day in <hi>Turky,</hi> conſiſting of a Camp, and a Horſequarter; a Camp in regard of the <hi>Spahys</hi> and <hi>Janizarys,</hi> the perpetual Guard of the Prince, except they alſo chance to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh after his Blood; and a Horſequarter in regard of the diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his whole Land to Tenants for Life, upon condition of continual Service, or as often as they ſhall be commanded at their own charge by <hi>Timars,</hi> being a word which they ſay ſignifys <hi>Benefices,</hi> that it ſhall ſave me a labor of opening the Government.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Fame of MAHOMET and his Prudence, is eſpecially founded in this, That wheras the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, except that of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was the moſt imperfect, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> is the moſt perfect that ever was. Which happen'd in that the <hi>Roman</hi> (as the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> and the Congregation) had a mixture of the Senat and the People; and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> is pure. And that this was pure, and the other mix'd, happen'd not thro the Wiſdom of the Legiſlators, but the different Genius of the Nations; the People of the Eaſtern Parts, except the <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> which is to be attributed to their Agrarian, having bin ſuch as ſcarce ever knew any other Condition than that of Slavery; and theſe of the Weſtern having ever had ſuch a reliſh of Liberty, as thro what deſpair ſoever could never be brought to ſtand ſtill while the Yoke was putting on their Necks, but by being ſed with ſom hopes of reſerving to themſelves ſom part of their Freedom.</p>

The Benefices of the Soldiers that were hitherto held for Life and upon Duty, were by this Prince made Hereditary: ſo that the whole Foundation wherupon this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was firſt built being now remov'd, ſhews plainly, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors muſt long before this have found out ſom other way of ſupport; and this was by ſtipendiating the <hi>Goths,</hi> a People that, deriving their Roots from the Northern parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> or out of <hi>Sweden,</hi> had (thro their Victorys obtain'd againſt DOMITIAN) long ſince ſpred their Branches to ſo near a Neighborhood with the <hi>Roman</hi> Territorys, that they began to overſhadow them.

                  <p>THIS Argument (tho there be more) I ſhall pitch upon as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove; Firſt, that the lower ſort of the People had right to Seſſion in Parlament during the time of the <hi>Teutons.</hi> Secondly, that they were qualify'd to the ſame by election in their Boroughs, and, if Knights of the Shire (as no doubt they are) be as antient in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys. Thirdly, If it be a good Argument to ſay, that the Commons during the reign of the <hi>Teutons</hi> were elected into Parlament, becauſe they are ſo now, and no man can ſhew when this cuſtom began; I ſee not which way it ſhould be an ill one to ſay, that the Commons du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reign of the <hi>Teutons</hi> conſtituted alſo a diſtinct Houſe, becauſe they do ſo now; unleſs any man can ſhew that they did ever ſit in the ſame Houſe with the Lords.

                     <note place="margin">Their Barons.</note> FOR <hi>Barons,</hi> they came from henceforth to be in different times of three kinds; Barons by their Eſtates and Tenures, Barons by Writ, and Barons created by Letters Patents. From TURBO the firſt to ADOXUS the ſeventh King from the Conqueſt, Barons had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination from their Poſſeſſions and Tenures. And theſe were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spiritual or Temporal; for not only the Thane Lands, but the <note place="margin">Barons by their Poſſeſſions.</note>poſſeſſions of Biſhops, as alſo of ſom twenty ſix Abbats, and two Priors, were now erected into Baronys, whence the Lords Spiritual that had ſuffrage in the <hi>Teuton</hi> Parlament as Spiritual Lords, came to have it in the <hi>Neuſtrian</hi> Parlament as Barons, and were made ſubject (which they had not formerly bin) to Knights ſervice in chief. <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> coming henceforth to ſignify all honorary poſſeſſions as well of Earls as Barons, and Baronage to denote all kinds of Lords as well Spiritual as Temporal having right to ſit in Parlament, the Baronys in this ſenſe were ſomtimes more, and ſomtimes fewer, but commonly about 200 or 250, containing in them a matter of ſixty thouſand <hi>feuda militum,</hi> or Knights Fees, wherof ſom twenty eight thouſand were in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. It is ill luck that no man can tell what the Land of a Knights Fee (reckon'd in ſom Writs at 40 <hi>l.</hi> a year, and in others at 10) was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly worth; for by ſuch a help we might have exactly demonſtrated the Balance of this Government. But ſays COOK, it contain'd <note place="margin">Cook 11. Inſt. pag. 596.</note>twelve Plow Lands, and that was thought to be the moſt certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But this again is extremely uncertain; for one Plow out of ſom Land that was fruitful, might work more than ten out of ſom other that was barren. Nevertheleſs, ſeeing it appears by BRACTON, <note place="margin">Balance of the Neuſtrian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</note>that of Earldoms and Baronys it was wont to be ſaid, that the whole Kingdom was compos'd; as alſo, that theſe conſiſting of 60000 Knights Fees, furniſh'd 60000 men for the King's ſervice, being the whole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of this Monarchy, it cannot be imagin'd, that the <hi>Vavaſorys</hi> or Freeholds in the People amounted to any conſiderable proportion. Wherfore the Balance and Foundation of this Government was in the 60000 Knights Fees, and theſe being poſſeſt by the 250 Lords, it was a Government of the Few, or of the Nobility; wherin the People might alſo aſſemble, but could have no more than a mere name. And the Clergy holding a third to the whole Nation, as is plain by the Parlament Roll; it is an abſurdity (ſeeing the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> came firſt thro their Riches to be a State of that Kingdom) to acknowlege the People to have bin a State of this Realm, and not to allow it to the Clergy, who were ſo much more weighty in the Balance, which is <note place="margin">4 Rich. 2.

But the <hi>Neuſtrians</hi> while they were but foren Plants, having no ſecurity againſt the Natives, but in growing up by their Princes ſides, were no ſooner well rooted in their vaſt Dominions, than they came up according to the infallible conſequence of the Balance domeſtic,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49467:62"/>
and, contracting the National intereſt of the Baronage, grew as fierce in the vindication of the antient Rights and Liberties of the ſame, as if they had bin always Natives: Whence, the Kings being as obſtinat on the one ſide for their abſolute Power, as theſe on the other for their Immunitys, grew certain Wars which took their denomination from the Barons.</p>
                  <p>THIS fire about the middle of the Reign of ADOXUS began to break out. And wheras the Predeceſſors of this King had divers times bin forc'd to ſummon Councils reſembling thoſe of the <hi>Teutons,</hi> to <note place="margin">Barons by Writ.</note>which the Lords only that were Barons by Dominion and Tenure had hitherto repair'd, ADOXUS ſeeing the effects of ſuch Dominion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt not to call ſuch as were Barons by Writ (for that was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the practice of antient times) but to call ſuch by Writs as were otherwiſe no Barons; by which means ſtriving to avoid the conſequence of the Balance, in coming unwillingly to ſet the Government ſtreight, he was the firſt that ſet it awry. For the Barons in his Reign, and his Succeſſors, having vindicated their antient Authority, reſtor'd the Parlament with all the Rights and Privileges of the ſame, ſaving that from thenceforth the Kings had found out a way wherby to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the mighty, by Creatures of their own, and ſuch as had no other ſupport but by their favor. By which means this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being indeed the Maſterpiece of modern Prudence, has bin cry'd up to the Skys, as the only invention wherby at once to maintain the Soverainty of a Prince, and the Liberty of the People. Wheras in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it has bin no other than a wreſtling match, wherin the Nobility, as they have bin ſtronger, have thrown the King; or the King, if he has bin ſtronger, has thrown the Nobility; or the King, where he has had a Nobility, and could bring them to his party, has thrown the People, as in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> or the People where they have had no Nobility, or could get them to be of their party, have thrown the King, as in <hi>Holland,</hi> and of later times in <hi>Oceana.</hi> But they came not <note place="margin">49 11. 3.</note>to this ſtrength but by ſuch approaches and degrees, as remain to be further open'd. For wheras the Barons by Writ (as the ſixty four Abbats, and thirty ſix Priors that were ſo call'd) were but <hi>pro tempore,</hi> DICOTOME being the twelfth King from the Conqueſt, began to <note place="margin">Barons by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents.</note>make Barons by Letters Patents, with the addition of honorary Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the maintenance of their Dignitys to them and their Heirs; ſo that they were hands in the King's Purſe, and had no ſhoulders for his Throne. Of theſe when the Houſe of Peers came once to be full, as will be ſeen hereafter, there was nothing more emty. But for the preſent, the Throne having other ſupports, they did not hurt that ſo much as they did the King: For the old Barons taking DICOTOME'S Prodigality to ſuch Creatures ſo ill, that they depos'd him, got the trick of it, and never gave over ſetting up and pulling down their Kings according to their various intereſts, and that faction of the <hi>White</hi>

                     </note>and <hi>Red,</hi> into which they had bin thenceforth divided, till PANURGUS the eighteenth King from the Conqueſt, was more by their Favor than his Right advanc'd to the Crown. This King thro his natural ſubtilty reflecting at once upon the greatneſs of their Power, and the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their favor, began to find another Flaw in this kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is alſo noted by MACCHIAVEL, namely that a Throne ſupported by a Nobility, is not ſo hard to be aſcended, as kept warm. Wherfore his ſecret Jealouſy, leſt the diſſenſion of the Nobility, as it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49467:62"/>
brought him in, might throw him out, made him travel in ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcover'd by them, to ends as little foreſeen by himſelf: while to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his own ſafety, he by mixing Water with their Wine, firſt began to open thoſe Sluces that have ſince overwhelm'd not the King only, but the Throne. For wheras a Nobility ſtrikes not at the Throne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they cannot ſubſiſt, but at ſom King that they do not like; popular Power ſtrikes thro the King at the Throne, as that which is incompatible with it. Now that PANURGUS in abating the Power of the Nobility, was the cauſe whence it came to fall into the hands of the People, appears by thoſe ſeveral Statutes that were made in his Reign, as that for <hi>Population,</hi> thoſe againſt <hi>Retainers,</hi> and that for <hi>Alienations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BY the Statute of Population, all houſes of Husbandry that were us'd with twenty Acres of Ground and upwards, were to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and kept up for ever with a competent proportion of Land laid to them, and in no wiſe, as appears by a ſubſequent Statute, to be ſever'd. By which means the houſes being kept up, did of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inforce Dwellers; and the proportion of Land to be till'd being kept up, did of neceſſity inforce the Dweller not to be a Begger or Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tager, but a Man of ſom ſubſtance, that might keep Hinds and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and ſet the Plow a going. This did mightily concern (ſays the Hiſtorian of that Prince) the might and manhood of the Kingdom, and in effect amortize a great part of the Lands to the hold and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Yeomanry or middle People, who living not in a ſervil or indigent faſhion, were much unlink'd from dependence upon their Lords, and living in a free and plentiful manner, became a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Infantry; but ſuch a one upon which the Lords had ſo little Power, that from henceforth they may be computed to have bin diſarm'd.</p>
                  <p>AND as they loſt their Infantry after this manner, ſo their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry and Commanders were cut off by the Statute of Retainers: for wheras it was the cuſtom of the Nobility to have younger Brothers of good houſes, metal'd fellows, and ſuch as were knowing in the feats of Arms about them; they who were longer follow'd with ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a train, eſcap'd not ſuch Puniſhments, as made them take up.</p>
                  <p>HENCEFORTH the Country-lives, and great Tables of the Nobility, which no longer nouriſh'd veins that would bleed for them, were fruitleſs and loathſom till they chang'd the Air, and of Princes became Courtiers; where their Revenues, never to have bin exhauſted by Beef and Mutton, were found narrow, whence follow'd racking of Rents, and at length ſale of Lands: the riddance thro the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Alienations being render'd far more quick and facil than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it had bin thro the new invention of Intails.</p>
                  <p>TO this it happen'd, that CORAUNUS the Succeſſor of that King diſſolving the Abbys, brought with the declining ſtate of the Nobility ſo vaſt a prey to the Induſtry of the People, that the Balance of the Commonwealth was too apparently in the popular Party, to be unſeen by the wiſe Council of Queen PARTHENIA, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting her reign thro the perpetual Lovetricks that paſt between her and her People into a kind of Romance, wholly neglected the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And by theſe degrees came the Houſe of Commons to raiſe that head, which ſince has bin ſo high and formidable to their Princes, that they have look'd pale upon thoſe Aſſemblys. Nor was there any thing now wanting to the deſtruction of the Throne, but that the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49467:63"/>
People, not apt to ſee their own ſtrength, ſhould be put to feel it; when a Prince, as ſtiff in diſputes as the nerve of Monarchy was grown ſlack, receiv'd that unhappy incouragement from his Clergy which became his utter ruin, while truſting more to their Logic than the rough Philoſophy of his Parlament, it came to an irreparable breach; for the Houſe of Peers, which alone had ſtood in this gap, now ſinking down between the King and the Commons, ſhew'd that CRASSUS was dead, and the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> broken. But a Monarchy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of its Nobility, has no refuge under Heaven but an Army. Wherfore the diſſolution of this Government caus'd the War, not the War the diſſolution of this Government.</p>
                  <p>OF the King's ſucceſs with his Arms it is not neceſſary to give any further account, than that they prov'd as ineffectual as his Nobility; but without a Nobility or an Army (as has bin ſhew'd) there can be no Monarchy. Wherfore what is there in nature that can ariſe out of theſe Aſhes, but a popular Government, or a new Monarchy to be erected by the victorious Army?</p>
                  <p>TO erect a Monarchy, be it never ſo new, unleſs like LEVIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAN you can hang it, as the Country-fellow ſpeaks, by Geometry (for what elſe is it to ſay, that every other Man muſt give up his will to the will of this one Man without any other foundation?) it muſt ſtand upon old Principles, that is, upon a Nobility or an Army planted on a due balance of Dominion. <hi>Aut viam inveniam aut faciam,</hi> was an Adage of CAESAR; and there is no ſtanding for a Monarchy unleſs it finds this Balance, or makes it. If it finds it, the work's don to its hand: for, where there is inequality of Eſtates, there muſt be inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Power; and where there is inequality of Power, there can be no Commonwealth. To make it, the Sword muſt extirpat out of Dominion all other roots of Power, and plant an Army upon that ground. An Army may be planted Nationally or Provincially. To plant it Nationally, it muſt be in one of the four ways mention'd, that is, either Monarchically in part, as the <hi>Roman Beneſiciarii;</hi> or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchically in the whole, as the <hi>Turkiſh Timariots;</hi> Ariſtocratically, that is, by Earls and Barons, as the <hi>Neuſtrians</hi> were planted by TURBO; or Democratically, that is, by equal lots, as the Iſraelitiſh Army in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by JOSHUA. In every one of theſe ways there muſt not only be Confiſcations, but Confiſcations to ſuch a proportion as may anſwer to the work intended.</p>
                  <p>CONFISCATION of a People that never ſought againſt you, but whoſe Arms you have born, and in which you have bin victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and this upon premeditation, and in cold blood, I ſhould have thought to be againſt any example in human Nature, but for thoſe alleg'd by MACCHIAVEL of AGATHOCLES, and OLIVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RETTO <hi>di Fermo:</hi> the former wherof being Captain General of the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> upon a day aſſembl'd the Senat and the People, as if he had ſomthing to communicat with them, when at a ſign given he cut the Senators in pieces to a man, and all the richeſt of the People, by which means he came to be King. The procedings of OLIVERETTO in making himſelf Prince of <hi>Fermo,</hi> were ſomwhat different in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but of the ſame nature. Nevertheleſs CATILIN, who had a ſpirit equal to anv of theſe in his intended miſchief, could never bring the like to paſs in <hi>Rome.</hi> The head of a ſmall Commonwealth, ſuch a one as was that of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> or <hi>Fermo,</hi> is eaſily brought to the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49467:63"/>
block; but that a populous Nation, ſuch as <hi>Rome,</hi> had not ſuch a one, was the grief of NERO. If SYLLA or CAESAR attain'd to be Princes, it was by Civil War, and ſuch Civil War as yielded rich ſpoils, there being a vaſt Nobility to be confiſcated; which alſo was the caſe in <hi>Oceana,</hi> when it yielded earth by Earldoms and Baronys to the <hi>Neuſtrian,</hi> for the plantation of his new Potentats. Where a Conqueror finds the Riches of a Land in the hands of the Few, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeitures are eaſy, and amount to vaſt advantage; but where the People have equal ſhares, the Confiſcation of many coms to little, and is not only dangerous, but fruitleſs.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Romans</hi> in one of their defeats of the <hi>Volſci</hi> found among the Captives certain <hi>Tuſculans,</hi> who, upon examination, confeſt that the Arms they bore were by command of their State; wherupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation being given to the Senat by the General CAMILLUS, he was forthwith commanded to march againſt <hi>Tuſculum;</hi> which doing accordingly, he found the <hi>Tuſculan</hi> Fields full of Husbandmen, that ſtir'd not otherwiſe from the Plow, than to furniſh his Army with all kind of Accommodations and Victuals: drawing near to the City, he ſaw the Gates wide open, the Magiſtrats coming out in their Gowns to ſalute and bid him welcom: entring, the Shops were all at work, and open; the Streets ſounded with the noiſe of Schoolboys at their Books; there was no face of War. Wherupon CAMILLUS cauſing the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat to aſſemble, told them, That tho the Art was underſtood, yet had they at length found out the true Arms wherby the <hi>Romans</hi> were moſt undoubtedly to be conquer'd, for which cauſe he would not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipat the Senat, to which he deſir'd them forthwith to ſend, which they did accordingly; and their Dictator with the reſt of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors being found by the <hi>Roman</hi> Senators as they went into the houſe ſtanding ſadly at the door, were ſent for in as Friends, and not as Enemys: Where the Dictator having ſaid, If we have offended, the fault was not ſo great as is our Penitence and your Virtue; the Senat gave them peace forthwith, and ſoon after made the <hi>Tuſculans</hi> Citizens of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT putting the caſe, of which the World is not able to ſhew an example, That the forfeiture of a populous Nation, not conquer'd, but Friends, and in cool blood, might be taken; your Army muſt be planted in one of the ways mention'd. To plant it in the way of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarchy, that is, upon feuds for life, ſuch as the <hi>Timars,</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as large and fruitful as that of <hi>Greece,</hi> would afford you but ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand <hi>Timariots,</hi> for that is the moſt the <hi>Turc</hi> (being the beſt husband that ever was of this kind) makes of it at this day: and if <hi>Oceana,</hi> which is leſs in fruitfulneſs by one half, and in extent by three parts, ſhould have no greater a force, whoever breaks her in one bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, may be ſure ſhe ſhall never riſe; for ſuch (as was noted by MACCHIAVEL) is the nature of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Monarchy, if you break it in two battels, you have deſtroy'd its whole Militia; and the reſt being all ſlaves, you hold it without any further reſiſtance. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the erection of an abſolute Monarchy in <hi>Oceana,</hi> or in any other Country that is no larger, without making it a certain prey to the firſt Invader, is altogether impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>TO plant by halves, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors did their Beneficiarys, or military Colonys, it muſt be either for life; and this an Army of <hi>Oceaners</hi> in their own Country (eſpecially having Eſtates of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49467:64"/>
will never bear; becauſe ſuch an Army ſo planted is as well confiſcated as the People; nor had the <hi>Mamalucs</hi> bin contented with ſuch uſage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but that they were Foreners, and daring not to mix with the Natives, it was of abſolute neceſſity to their being.</p>
                  <p>OR planting them upon Inheritance, whether Ariſtocratically as the <hi>Neuſtrians,</hi> or Democratically as the <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> they grow up by certain conſequence into the national Intereſt: and this, if they be planted popularly, coms to a Commonwealth; if by way of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to a mix'd Monarchy, which of all other will be found to be the only kind of Monarchy, wherof this Nation, or any other that is of no greater extent, has bin or can be capable: for if the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> (tho their Democratical Balance, being fix'd by their Agrarian, ſtood firm) be yet found to have elected Kings, it was becauſe, their Territory lying open, they were perpetually invaded, and being perpetually invaded, turn'd themſelves to any thing which thro the want of experience they thought might be a remedy; whence their miſtake in election of their Kings (under whom they gain'd nothing, but on the contrary loſt all they had acquir'd by their Commonwealth, both Eſtates and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertys) is not only apparent, but without parallel. And if there have bin (as was ſhewn) a Kingdom of the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> conſiſting of a ſingle Perſon and a Parlament (taking a Parlament to be a Council of the People only, without a Nobility) it is expreſly ſaid of thoſe Councils, that they depos'd their Kings as often as they pleas'd: nor can there be any other conſequence of ſuch a Government, ſeeing where there is a Council of the People, they do never receive Laws, but give them; and a Council giving Laws to a ſingle Perſon, he has no means in the World wherby to be any more than a ſubordinat Magiſtrat, but force: in which caſe he is not a ſingle Perſon and a Parlament, but a ſingle Perſon and an Army, which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my again muſt be planted as has bin ſhewn, or can be of no long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
                  <p>IT is true, that the Provincial Balance being in nature quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the National, you are no way to plant a Provincial Army upon Dominion. But then you muſt have a native Territory in Strength, Situation, or Government, able to overbalance the foren, or you can never hold it. That an Army ſhould in any other caſe be long ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a mere Tax, is a mere phanſy as void of all reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as if a Man ſhould think to maintain ſuch a one by robbing of Orchards: for <hi>a mere Tax is but pulling of Plumtrees, the roots wherof are in other Mens grounds,</hi> who ſuffering perpetual Violence, com to hate the Author of it: And it is a Maxim, that <hi>no Prince that is hated by his People can be ſafe.</hi> Arms planted upon Dominion extirpat Enemys, and make Friends; but maintain'd by a mere Tax, have Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys that have roots, and Friends that have none.</p>
                  <p>TO conclude, <hi>Oceana,</hi> or any other Nation of no greater extent, muſt have a competent Nobility, or is altogether incapable of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy: for where there is equality of Eſtates, there muſt be equality of Power; and where there is equality of Power, there can be no Monarchy.</p>

                  <p>A PEOPLE (ſays MACCHIAVEL) that is corrupt, is not capable of a Commonwealth. But in ſhewing what a corrupt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is, he has either involv'd himſelf or me; nor can I otherwiſe com out of the Labyrinth, than by ſaying, that the Balance altering a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as to the foregoing Government, muſt of neceſſity be corrupt: but Corruption in this ſenſe ſignifys no more than that the Corruption of one Government (as in natural Bodys) is the Generation of another. Wherfore if the Balance alters from Monarchy, the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People in this caſe is that which makes them capable of a Commonwealth. But wheras I am not ignorant, that the Corruption which he means is in Manners, this alſo is from the Balance. For the Balance leading from Monarchical into Popular, abates the Luxury of the Nobility, and, inriching the People, brings the Government from a more privat to a more public Intereſt; which coming nearer, as has bin ſhewn, to Juſtice and right Reaſon, the People upon a like alteration is ſo far from ſuch a Corruption of Manners, as ſhould render them incapable of a Commonwealth, that of neceſſity they muſt therby contract ſuch a Reformation of Manners as will bear no other kind of Government. On the other ſide, where the Balance changes from Popular to Oligarchical or Monarchical, the public Intereſt, with the Reaſon and Juſtice included in the ſame, becoms more privat; Luxury is introduc'd in the room of Temperance, and Servitude in that of Freedom; which cauſes ſuch a corruption of Manners both in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and People, as, by the Example of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of the <hi>Triumvirs,</hi> is more at large diſcover'd by the Author to have bin alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether incapable of a Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Balance of <hi>Oceana</hi> changing quite contrary to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Manners of the People were not therby corrupted, but on the contrary adapted to a Commonwealth. For differences of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a People not rightly inform'd of their Balance, or a diviſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Partys (while there is not any common Ligament of Power ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49467:65"/>
to reconcile or hold them) is no ſufficient proof of Corruption. Nevertheleſs, ſeeing this muſt needs be matter of ſcandal and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it will not be amiſs, in ſhewing what were the Partys, to ſhew what were their Errors.</p>
                  <p>THE Partys into which this Nation was divided, were Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or Spiritual: and the Temporal Partys were eſpecially two, the one <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> the other <hi>Republicans:</hi> each of which aſſerted their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Cauſes, either out of Prudence or Ignorance, out of Intereſt or Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>FOR Prudence, either that of the Antients is inferior to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern (which we have hitherto bin ſetting face to face, that any one <note place="margin">The Royaliſt.</note>may judg) or that of the Royaliſt muſt be inferior to that of the Commonwealthſman. And for Intereſt, taking the Commonwealthſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to have really intended the Public (for otherwiſe he is a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crit and the worſt of Men) that of the Royaliſt muſt of neceſſity have bin more p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ivat. Wherfore the whole diſpute will com upon matter of Conſcience; and this, whether it be urg'd by the Right of Kings, the Obligation of former Laws, or of the Oath of Allegiance, is abſolv'd by the Balance.</p>
                  <p>FOR if the Right of Kings were as immediatly deriv'd from the Breath of God as the Life of Man, yet this excludes not Death and Diſſolution. But, that the diſſolution of the late Monarchy was as natural as the Death of a Man, has bin already ſhewn. Wherfore it remains with the Royaliſts to diſcover by what Reaſon or Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it is poſſible for a Monarchy to ſtand upon a popular Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; or, the Balance being popular, as well the Oath of Allegiance, as all other Monarchical Laws imply an impoſſibility, and are therfore void.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthſman.</note> TO the Commonwealthſman I have no more to ſay, but that if he excludes any Party, he is not truly ſuch; nor ſhall ever found a Commonwealth upon the natural Principle of the ſame, which is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And the Royaliſt for having oppos'd a Commonwealth in <hi>Oceana</hi> (where the Laws were ſo ambiguous that they might be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally diſputed, and never reconcil'd) can neither be juſtly for that cauſe excluded from his full and equal ſhare in the Government; nor prudently, for this reaſon, that a Commonwealth conſiſting of a Party will be in perpetual labor of her own deſtruction: Whence it was that the <hi>Romans</hi> having conquer'd the <hi>Albans,</hi> incorporated them with equal Right into the Commonwealth. And if the Royaliſts be <hi>fleſh of your fleſh,</hi> and nearer of Blood than were the <hi>Albans</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> you being alſo both Chriſtians, the Argument's the ſtronger. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs there is no reaſon that a Commonwealth ſhould any more favor a Party remaining in fix'd oppoſition againſt it, than BRUTUS did his own Sons. But if it ſixes them upon that oppoſition, it is its own fault, not theirs; and this is don by excluding them. Men that have equal Poſſeſſions, and the ſame ſecurity for their Eſtates and their Libertys that you have, have the ſame cauſe with you to defend both: But if you will be trampling, they fight for Liberty, tho for Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; and you for Tyranny, tho under the name of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: The nature of Orders in a Government rightly inſtituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing void of all jealouſy, becauſe, let the Partys which it imbraces bo what they will, its Orders are ſuch as they neither would reſiſt if they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49467:65"/>
could, nor could if they would, as has bin partly already ſhewn; and will appear more at large by the following Model.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Religious Par<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>tys.</note> THE Partys that are Spiritual are of more kinds than I need men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſom for a National Religion, and others for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, with ſuch animoſity on both ſides, as if theſe two could not conſiſt together, and of which I have already ſufficiently ſpoken, to ſhew, that indeed the one cannot well ſubſiſt without the other. But they of all the reſt are the moſt dangerous, who, holding that the Saints muſt govern, go about to reduce the Commonwealth to a Party, as well for the Reaſons already ſhewn, as that their Pretences are againſt Scripture, where the Saints are commanded to ſubmit to the Higher Powers, and to be ſubject to the Ordinance of Man. And that men, pretending under the notion of Saints or Religion to Civil Power, have hitherto never fail'd to diſhonor that Profeſſion, the World is full of Examples, wherof I ſhall confine my ſelf at preſent only to a couple, the one of Old, the other of New <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Saints.</note> IN Old <hi>Rome</hi> the Patricians or Nobility pretending to be the godly Party, were queſtion'd by the People for ingroſſing all the Magiſtracys of that Commonwealth, and had nothing to ſay why they did ſo, but <note n="*" place="bottom">Quòd nemo plebeius auſpicia haberet.</note>that Magiſtracy requir'd a kind of Holineſs which was not in the People: <note n="†" place="bottom">Plebs ad id maximâ indignatione exarſit, quod auſpicari, tanquam inviſi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diis immortalibus, negarentur poſſe. <hi>T.

                  <p>THE Example of New <hi>Rome</hi> in the riſe and practice of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy (too well known to require any further illuſtration) is far more immodeſt.</p>
                  <p>THIS has bin the courſe of Nature: and when it has pleas'd, or ſhall pleaſe God to introduce any thing that is above the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he will, as he has always don, confirm it by Miracle; for ſo in his Prophecy of the Reign of CHRIST upon Earth, he expreſly promiſes: ſeeing that <hi>the Souls of them that were beheaded for</hi> JESUS, <hi>ſhall be ſeen to live and reign with him;</hi> which will be an object of Senſe, the rather, becauſe the reſt of the Dead are not to live again till the Thouſand Years be finiſh'd. And it is not lawful for men to perſuade us that a thing already is, tho there be no ſuch object of our Senſe, which God has told us ſhall not be till it be an object of our Senſe.</p>
                  <p>THE Saintſhip of a People as to Government, conſiſts in the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Magiſtrats fearing God, and hating Covetouſneſs, and not in their confining themſelves, or being confin'd to men of this or that Party or Profeſſion. It conſiſts in making the moſt prudent and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious choice they can; yet not in truſting to Men, but, next God, to their own Orders. <hi>Give us good Men, and they will make us good Laws,</hi> is the Maxim of a Demagog, and is (thro the alteration which is commonly perceivable in men, when they have power to work their own Wills) exceding fallible. But <hi>give us good Orders, and they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49467:66"/>
will make us good Men,</hi> is the Maxim of a Legiſlator, and the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in the Politics.</p>
                  <p>BUT theſe Diviſions (however there be ſom good Men that look ſadly on them) are trivial things; firſt as to the Civil concern, becauſe the Government, wherof this Nation is capable, being once ſeen, takes in all Intereſts. And, ſecondly, as to the Spiritual; becauſe as the pretence of Religion has always bin turbulent in broken Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo where the Government has bin ſound and ſteddy, Religion has never ſhew'd it ſelf with any other face than that of the natural Sweetneſs, and Tranquillity: nor is there any reaſon why it ſhould; <note place="margin">The Errors of the People are from their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.</note>wherfore the Errors of the People are occaſion'd by their Governors. If they be doubtful of the way, or wander from it, it is becauſe their Guides miſled them; and the Guides of the People are never ſo well qualify'd for leading by any Virtue of their own, as by that of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>THE Government of <hi>Oceana</hi> (as it ſtood at the time wherof we diſcourſe, conſiſting of one ſingle Council of the People, excluſively of the King and the Lords) was call'd a Parlament: Nevertheleſs the Parlaments of the <hi>Teutons</hi> and of the <hi>Neuſtrians</hi> conſiſted, as has bin ſhewn, of the King, Lords and Commons; wherfore this under an old Name was a new thing: A Parlament conſiſting of a ſingle Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly elected by the People, and inveſted with the whole Power of the Government, without any Covenants, Conditions, or Orders what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. So new a thing, that neither antient nor modern Prudence can ſhew any avow'd Example of the like. And there is ſcarce any thing that ſeems to me ſo ſtrange as that (wheras there was nothing more familiar with theſe Counſillors, than to bring the Scripture to the Houſe) there ſhould not be a Man of them that ſo much as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to bring the Houſe to the Scripture, wherin, as has bin ſhewn, is contain'd that Original, wherof all the reſt of the Commonwealths ſeem to be Copys. Certainly if LEVIATHAN (who is ſurer of nothing than that a popular Commonwealth conſiſts but of one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil) tranſcrib'd his Doctrin out of this Aſſembly, for him to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ARISTOTLE and CICERO for writing out of their own Commonwealths, was not ſo fair play; or if the Parlament tranſcrib'd out of him, it had bin an honor better due to MOSES. But where one of them ſhould have an Example but from the other, I cannot imagin, there being nothing of this kind that I can find in ſtory, but the Oligarchy of <hi>Athens,</hi> the thirty Tyrants of the ſame, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Decemvirs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 8.</note> FOR the <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> THUCYDIDES tells us, that it was a Senat or Council of Four hundred, pretending to a Balancing Council of the People conſiſting of Five thouſand, but not producing them; wherin you have the definition of an <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> which is a ſingle Council both debating and reſolving, dividing and chuſing; and what that muſt com to, was ſhewn by the Example of the Girls, and is apparent by the experience of all times: wherfore the Thirty ſet up by the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> (when they had conquer'd <hi>Athens)</hi> are call'd Tyrants by all Authors, LEVIATHAN only excepted, who will have them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the World to have bin an <hi>Ariſtocracy;</hi> but for what reaſon I cannot imagin, theſe alſo, as void of any Balance, having bin void of that which is eſſential to every Commonwealth, whether Ariſtocratical or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49467:66"/>
Popular; except he be pleas'd with them, becauſe that, according to the Teſtimony of XENOPHON, they kill'd more men in eight months, than the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had don in ten years; <hi>oppreſſing the People</hi> (to uſe Sir WALTER RALEIGH'S words) <hi>with all baſe and intolerable Slavery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE uſurp'd Government of the <hi>Decemvirs</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> was of the ſame kind. Wherfore in the fear of God let Chriſtian Legiſlators (ſetting the Pattern given in the Mount on the one ſide, and theſe execrable Examples on the other) know the right hand from the left; and ſo much the rather, becauſe thoſe things which do not conduce to the good of the Govern'd, are fallacious, if they appear to be good for the Governors. God in chaſtiſing a People, is accuſtom'd to burn his Rod. The Empire of theſe Oligarchys was not ſo violent as ſhort, nor did they fall upon the People, but in their own immediat ruin. A Council without a Balance is not a Commonwealth, but an Oligarchy; and every Oligarchy, except it be put to the defence of its Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Power againſt ſom outward danger, is factious. Wherfore the Errors of the People being from their Governors (which Maxim in the Politics bearing a ſufficient teſtimony to it ſelf, is alſo prov'd by MACCHIAVEL) if the People of <hi>Oceana</hi> have bin factious, the Cauſe is apparent: But what Remedy?</p>

                     <note place="margin">The General.</note> IN anſwer to this Queſtion, I com now to the Army; of which the moſt victorious Captain, and incomparable Patriot OLPHAUS MEGALETOR was now General: who being a much greater maſter of that Art, wherof I have made a rough draught in theſe Prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys, had ſuch ſad reflections upon the ways and procedings of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, as caſt him upon Books, and all other means of diverſion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which he happen'd on this place of MACCHIAVEL: <q>Thrice happy is that People which chances to have a Man able to give them ſuch a Government at once, as without alteration may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them of their Libertys; ſeeing it is certain that <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> in obſerving the Laws of LYCURGUS, continu'd about eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years without any dangerous Tumult or Corruption.</q> My Lord General (as it is ſaid of THEMISTOCLES, that he could not ſleep for the Glory obtain'd by MILTIADES at the Battel of <hi>Maratho)</hi> took ſo new and deep an Impreſſion at theſe words of the much greater Glory of LYCURGUS, that, being on this ſide aſſaulted with the emulation of his illuſtrious Object, and on the other with the Miſery of the Nation, which ſeem'd (as it were ruin'd by his Victory) to caſt it ſelf at his feet, he was almoſt wholly depriv'd of his natural reſt, till the debate he had within himſelf came to a firm reſolution, that the greateſt Advantages of a Commonwealth are, firſt, that the Legiſlator ſhould be one Man: And, ſecondly, that the Government ſhould be made altogether, or at once. For the firſt, It is certain, ſays <note place="margin">Deſ.

The
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49467:67"/>
reaſon of this is demonſtrable: for the ordinary means not failing, the Commonwealth has no need of a Legiſlator; but the ordinary means failing, there is no recourſe to be had but to ſuch as are extraordinary. And, wheras a Book or a Building has not bin known to attain to its perfection, if it has not had a ſole Author or Architect; a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <note place="margin">That a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is to be made at once.</note>as to the Fabric of it, is of the like nature. And thus it may be made at once; in which there be great advantages: for a Commonwealth made at once, takes Security at the ſame time it lends its Mony; and truſts not it ſelf to the Faith of Men, but lanches immediatly forth into the Empire of Laws: and being ſet ſtreight, brings the Manners of its Citizens to its rule; whence follow'd that uprightneſs which was in <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> But Manners that are rooted in men, bow the tenderneſs of a Commonwealth coming up by twigs to their bent; whence follow'd the obliquity that was in <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe perpetual Repairs by the Conſuls Axes, and Tribuns Hammers, which could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver finiſh that Commonwealth but in deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>MY Lord General being clear in theſe Points, and of the neceſſity of ſom other courſe than would be thought upon by the Parlament, appointed a meeting of the Army, where he ſpoke his ſenſe agreable to theſe Preliminarys with ſuch ſucceſs to the Soldiery, that the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſoon after depos'd; and he himſelf (in the great Hall of the <hi>Pantheon</hi> or Palace of Juſtice, ſituated in <hi>Emporium</hi> the capital Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) was created by the univerſal Suffrage of the Army, Lord AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHON, or ſole Legiſlator of <hi>Oceana:</hi> upon which Theatre you have, to conclude this piece, a Perſon introduc'd, whoſe fame ſhall never draw its Curtain.</p>

And all Partys (being indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd by Proclamation of the ARCHON) were invited to diſpute their own Intereſts, or propoſe whatever they thought fit (in order to the future Government) to the Council of the <hi>Prytans,</hi> who (having a Guard of about two or three hundred men, leſt the heat of diſpute might break the peace) had the Right of Moderators, and were to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49467:68"/>
report from time to time ſuch Propoſitions or Occurrences as they thought fit, to the Council of Legiſlators ſitting more privatly in the Palace call'd <hi>Alma.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS was that which made the People (who were neither ſafely to be admitted, nor conveniently to be excluded in the framing of the Commonwealth) verily believe when it came forth, that it was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that wherof they themſelves had bin the makers.</p>
                  <p>MOREOVER, this Council ſat divers months after the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and during the promulgation of the Model to the People; by which means there is ſcarce any thing was ſaid or written for or againſt the ſaid Model, but you ſhall have it with the next impreſſion of this work by way of Oration addreſt to, and moderated by the <hi>Prytans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BY this means the Council of Legiſlators had their neceſſary Solitude and due aim in their greater work, as being acquainted from time to time with the pulſe of the People, and yet without any manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption or diſturbance.</p>
                  <p>WHERFORE every Commonwealth in its place having bin open'd by due Method; that is, Firſt, by the People; Secondly, by the Senat; And, Thirdly, by the Magiſtracy: The Council upon mature debate took ſuch reſults or orders out of each, and out oſ every part of each of them, as upon opening the ſame they thought fit; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put from time to time in writing by the Clere or Secretary, there remain'd no more in the concluſion, than putting the Orders ſo taken together, to view and examin them with a diligent ey, that it might be clearly diſcover'd whether they did interfere, or could any wiſe com to interfere or joſtle one with the other. For as ſuch Orders joſtling, or coming to joſtle one another, are the certain diſſolution of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; ſo taken upon the proof of like experience, and neither joſtling, nor ſhewing which way they can poſſibly com to joſtle one another, they make a perfect, and (for ought that in human Prudence can be foreſeen) an immortal Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>AND ſuch was the Art wherby my Lord ARCHON (taking Counſil of the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as of MOSES; and of the reſt of the Commonwealths, as of JETHRO) fram'd the Model of the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana.</hi>

                  <p>CITIZENS are not only to defend the Commonwealth, but according to their abilitys, as the <hi>Romans</hi> under SERVIUS TULLUS (regard had to their Eſtates) were ſom inrol'd in the Horſe Centurys, and others of the Foot, with Arms injoin'd accordingly; nor could it be otherwiſe in the reſt of the Commonwealths, tho out of Hiſtorical Remains, that are ſo much darker, it be not ſo clearly provable.

But he who draws the golden Ball is the Propoſer, and ſhall be ſeated between the Overſeers, where he ſhall begin in what order he pleaſes, and name ſuch as (upon his Oath already taken) he conceives fitteſt to be choſen, one by one, to the Elders; and the Party nam'd ſhall withdraw while the Congregation is balloting his name by the double Box or Boxes appointed and mark'd on the outward part, to ſhew which ſide is Affirmative and which Negative, being carry'd by a Boy or Boys appointed by the Overſeers, to every one of the Elders, who ſhall hold up a pellet made of linen Rags, between his Finger and his Thumb, and put it after ſuch a manner into the Box, as tho no man can ſee into which ſide he puts it, yet any man may ſee that he puts in but one pellet or ſuffrage. And the ſuffrage of the Congregation being thus given, ſhall be return'd with the Box or Boxes to the Overſeers, who opening the ſame, ſhall pour the affirmative Balls into a white Bowl ſtanding upon the Table on the right hand, to be number'd by the firſt Overſeer; and the Negative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a green Bowl ſtanding on the left hand, to be number'd by the ſecond Overſeer: and the ſuffrages being number'd, he who has the major part in the Affirmative is one of the Deputys of the Pariſh: and when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Deputys are choſen as amount to a full fifth part of the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Elders, the Ballot for that time ſhall ceaſe. The Deputys being choſen are to be liſted by the Overſeers in order as they were choſen, except only that ſuch as are Horſe muſt be liſted in the firſt place with the reſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the number of the Congregation, after this manner:

                  <p>FOR proof of this Order; Firſt, in Reaſon: It is with all Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians paſt diſpute, that paternal Power is in the right of Nature; and this is no other than the derivation of Power from Fathers of Familys, as the natural root of a Commonwealth. And for Experience, if it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in that of <hi>Holland,</hi> I know no other example of the like kind. In <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the ſoverain Power came clearly from the natural Root, the <note place="margin">Joſ. 24. 1.</note>Elders of the whole People; and <hi>Rome</hi> was born <hi>(Comitiis Curiatis)</hi> in her Parochial Congregations, out of which ROMULUS firſt rais'd her Senat, then all the reſt of the Orders of that Commonwealth, which roſe ſo high: For the depth of a Commonwealth is the juſt height of it.</p>

Congregation to receive a Probationer from that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity; the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor upon the receit therof ſhall call a Convocation, and having made choice of a fit Perſon, ſhall return him in due time to the Pariſh, where the Perſon ſo return'd ſhall receive the full fruits of the Benefice or Vicarage, and do the duty of the Parſon or Vicar, for the ſpace of one year, as Probationer: and that being expir'd, the Congregation of the Elders ſhall put their Probation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Ballot: and if he attains not to two parts in three of the Suffrage affirmative, he ſhall take his leave of the Pariſh, and they ſhall ſend in like manner as before for another Probationer; but if their Probationer obtains two parts in three of the Suffrage affirmative, he is then Paſtor of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. And the Paſtor of the Pariſh ſhall pray with the Congregation, preach the Word, and adminiſter the Sacraments to the ſame, according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory to be hereafter appointed by the Parlament. Nevertheleſs ſuch as are of gather'd Congregations, or from time to time ſhall join with any of them, are in no wiſe oblig'd to this way of electing their Teachers, or to give their Votes in this caſe, but wholly left to the liberty of their own Conſciences, and to that way of Worſhip which they ſhall chuſe, being not Popiſh, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, or Idolatrous. And to the end they may be the better protected by the State in the free exerciſe of the ſame, they are deſir'd to make choice, in ſuch manner as they beſt like, of certain Magiſtrats in every one of their Congregations, which we could wiſh might be four in each of them, to be Auditors in caſes of differences or diſtaſt, if any thro variety of opinions, that may be grievous or injurious to them, ſhould fall out. And ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors or Magiſtrats ſhall have power to examin the matter, and inform themſelves, to the end that if they think it of ſufficient weight, they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the <hi>Phylarch</hi> with it, or introduce it into the Council of Religion; where all ſuch Cauſes as thoſe Magiſtrats introduce, ſhall from time to time be heard and determin'd according to ſuch Laws as are or ſhall hereafter be provided by the Parlament for the juſt defence of the Liberty of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>THIS Order conſiſts of three parts, the firſt reſtoring the power of Ordination to the People, which, that it originally belongs to them, is clear, tho not in Engliſh yet in Scripture, where the Apoſtles <hi>ordain'd</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 14. 23.</note>
                     <hi>Elders by the holding up of hands in every Congregation,</hi> that is, by the ſuffrage of the People, which was alſo given in ſom of thoſe Citys by the Ballot. And tho it may be ſhewn that the Apoſtles ordain'd ſom by the laying on of hands, it will not be ſhewn that they did ſo in every Congregation.</p>
                  <p>EXCOMMUNICATION, as not clearly provable out of the Scripture, being omitted, the ſecond part of the Order implys and eſtabliſhes a National Religion: for there be degrees of Knowlege in divine things; true Religion is not to be learnt without ſearching the Scriptures; the Scriptures cannot be ſearch'd by us unleſs we have them to ſearch; and if we have nothing elſe, or (which is all one) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing elſe but a Tranſlation, we may be (as in the place alleg'd we have bin) beguil'd or miſled by the Tranſlation, while we ſhould be ſearching the true ſenſe of the Scripture, which cannot be attain'd in a natural way (and a Commonwealth is not to preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is ſupernatural) but by the knowlege of the Original and of Antiquity, acquir'd by our own ſtudys, or thoſe of ſom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for even <hi>Faith coms by hearing.</hi> Wherfore a Commonwealth not making proviſion of men from time to time, knowing in the original Languages wherin the Scriptures were written, and vers'd in thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitys
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49467:72"/>
to which they ſo frequently relate, that the true ſenſe of them depends in great part upon that Knowlege, can never be ſecure that ſhe ſhall not loſe the Scripture, and by conſequence her Religion; which to preſerve ſhe muſt inſtitute ſom method of this Knowlege, and ſom uſe of ſuch as have acquir'd it, which amounts to a National Religion.</p>
                  <p>THE Commonwealth having thus perform'd her duty towards God, as a rational Creature, by the beſt application of her Reaſon to Scripture, and for the preſervation of Religion in the purity of the ſame, yet pretends not to Infallibility, but coms in the third part of the Order, eſtabliſhing Liberty of Conſcience according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions given to her Council of Religion, to raiſe up her hands to Heaven for further light; in which proceding ſhe follows that (as was ſhewn in the Preliminarys) of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who tho her National Religion was always a part of her Civil Law, gave to her Prophets the upper hand of all her Orders.</p>

THIS is no great matter of charge for the building of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in regard that it has coſt (which was pleaded by the Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors) as much to rig a few Ships. Nevertheleſs that proves not them to be honeſt, nor their account to be juſt; but they had their Mony for once, tho their reckoning be plainly guilty of a Crime, to coſt him his Neck that commits it another time, it being impoſſible for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth (without an exact proviſion that it be not abus'd in this kind) to ſubſiſt: for if no regard ſhould be had of the Charge (tho that may go deep) yet the Debauchery and Corruption, wherto, by negligence in Accounts, it infallibly expoſes its Citizens, and therby leſſens the public Faith, which is the Nerve and Ligament of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to be prevented. But the Surveyors being diſpatch'd, the Lord ARCHON was very curious in giving names to his Tribes, which having caus'd to be written in Scrols caſt into an Urn, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Counſillors, each of them drew one, and was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent to the Tribe in his lot, as Orators of the ſame, a Magiſtracy no otherwiſe inſtituted, than for once and <hi>pro tempore,</hi> to the end that the Council upon ſo great an occaſion might both congratulat with the Tribes, and aſſiſt at the firſt muſter in ſom things of neceſſity to be differently carry'd from the eſtabliſh'd Adminiſtration, and future Courſe of the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>THE Orators being arriv'd, every one as ſoon as might be, at the Rendevouz of his Tribe, gave notice to the Hundreds, and ſummon'd the Muſter, which appear'd for the moſt part upon good Horſes, and already indifferently well arm'd; as to inſtance in one for all, the Tribe of <hi>Nubia,</hi> where HERMES DE CADUCEO, Lord Orator of the ſame, after a ſhort ſalutation and a hearty welcom, apply'd himſelf to his buſineſs, which began with</p>

                     <hi>THE eighth ORDER, requiring,</hi> That the Lord High Sheriff as Commander in Chief, and the Lord <hi>Cuſtos Rotulorum</hi> as Muſtermaſter of the Tribe (or the Orator for the firſt Muſter) upon reception of the Liſts of their Hundreds, return'd to them by the High Conſtables of the ſame, preſently cauſe them to be caſt up, dividing the Horſe from the Foot, and liſting the Horſe by their names in Troops, each Troop containing about a hundred in number, to be inſcrib'd, firſt, ſecond, or third Troop, &amp;c. according to the Order agreed upon by the ſaid Magiſtrats: Which don, they ſhall liſt the Foot in like manner, and inſcribe the Companys in like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Theſe Liſts upon the Eve of the Muſter ſhall be deliver'd to certain Trumpeters and Drummers, wherof there ſhall be fifteen of each ſort (as well for the preſent as other uſes to be hereafter mention'd) ſtipendiated by the Tribe. And the Trumpeters and Drummers ſhall be in the Field before the Pavilion, upon the day of the Muſter, ſo ſoon as it is light, where they ſhall ſtand every one with his Liſt in his hand, at a due diſtance, plac'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order of the Liſt; the Trumpeters with the Liſts of the Horſe on the right-hand, and the Drummers with the Liſts of the Foot on the left-hand: where having ſounded a while, each of them ſhall begin to call, and continue calling the names of the Deputys, as they com into the field, till both the Horſe and Foot be gather'd by that means into their due Order. The Horſe and Foot being in order, the Lord Lieutenant of the Tribe ſhall caſt ſo many Gold Balls mark'd with the figures <hi>1, 2, 3, 4,</hi> &amp;c. as there be Troops of Horſe in the Field, together with ſo many Silver Balls as there be Companys, mark'd in the ſame manner, into a little <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn, to

which he ſhall call the Captains; and the Captains drawing the Gold Balls ſhall command the Horſe, and thoſe that draw the Silver the Foot, each in the order of his Lot.

                  <p>THIS Order may puzzle the Reader, but tends to a wonderful ſpeed of the Muſter, to which it would be a great matter to loſe a day in ranging and martialling, wheras by virtue of this the Tribe is no ſooner in the field than in Battalia, nor ſooner in Battalia than call'd to the Urns or the Ballot by virtue of</p>

Wherfore the Cenſors are to put into the middle <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn for the Election of the firſt Liſt twenty four Gold Balls, with twenty ſix Blanks or Silver Balls, in all ſixty; and into the ſide <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns ſixty Gold Balls divided into each according to the different number of the Horſe and the Foot: that is to ſay, if the Horſe and the Foot be equal, equally; and if the Horſe and the Foot be inequal, inequally, by an Arithmetical Proportion. The like ſhall be don the ſecond day of the Muſter, for the ſecond Liſt, except that the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors ſhall put into the middle <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn <hi>36</hi> Gold Balls with <hi>24</hi> Blanks, in all ſixty; and ſixty Gold Balls into the ſide <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns, divided reſpectively into the number of the Horſe and the Foot: and the Gold Balls in the ſide <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns at either Ballot are by the addition of Blanks to be brought even with the number of the Ballotants at either <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn reſpectively. The Cenſors having prepar'd their Notes, as has bin ſhewn, and being com at the day appointed into the Field, ſhall preſent a little <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn to the Lord High Sheriff, who is to draw twice for the Letters to be us'd that day, the one at the ſide <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns, and the other at the middle. And the Cenſors having fitted the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns accordingly, ſhall place themſelves in certain movable Seats or Pulpits (to be kept for that uſe in the Pavilion) the firſt Cenſor before the Horſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn, the ſecond before the Foot <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn, the Lord Lieutenant doing the Office of Cenſor <hi>pro tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> at the middle <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn; where all and every one of them ſhall cauſe the Laws of the Ballot to be diligently obſerv'd, taking a ſpecial care that no Man be ſuffer'd to com above once to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn (wherof it more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns the Subcenſors, that is to ſay, the Overſeers of every Pariſh, to be careful; they being each in this regard reſponſible for their reſpective Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes) or to draw above one Ball, which if it be Gold, he is to preſent to the Cenſor, who ſhall look upon the Letter; and if it be not that of the day, and of the reſpective <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn, apprehend the Party, who for this or any other like diſorder, is obnoxious to the <hi>Phylarch.</hi>

                  <p>THIS Order being obſerv'd by the Cenſors, it is not poſſible for the People, if they can but draw the Balls, tho they underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of the Ballot, to be out. To philoſophize further upon this Art, tho there be nothing more rational, were not worth the while; becauſe in writing it will be perplex'd, and the firſt practice of it gives the demonſtration: whence it came to paſs, that the Orator,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49467:75"/>
after ſom needleſs pains in the explanation of the two foregoing Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, betaking himſelf to exemplify the ſame, found the work don to his hand; for the Tribe, as eager upon a buſineſs of this nature, had retain'd one of the Surveyors, out of whom (before the Orator ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd) they had got the whole Myſtery by a ſtoln Muſter, at which in order to the Ballot they had made certain Magiſtrats <hi>pro tempore.</hi> Wherfore he found not only the Pavilion (for this time a Tent) erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with three Poſts ſupplying the place of Pillars to the Urns; but the Urns being prepar'd with a juſt number of Balls for the firſt Ballot, to becom the Field, and the occaſion very gallantly, with their Covers made in the manner of Helmets, open at either ear to give paſſage to the hands of the Ballotants, and flanting with noble Plumes to direct the March of the People.

For example, if the Ball be inſcrib'd <hi>middle Files,</hi> the Ballot ſhall begin by the middle; that is, the two Files that are middle to the Horſe, ſhall draw out firſt to the Horſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn, and the two Files that are middle to the Foot, ſhall draw out firſt to the Foot <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn, and be follow'd by all the reſt of the Files as they are next to them in order. The like ſhall be don by the inward, or by the outward Files, in caſe they be firſt call'd. And the Files, as every Man has drawn his Ball, if it be Silver, ſhall begin at the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn to countermarch to their places; but he that has drawn a Gold Ball at a ſide <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn, ſhall procede to the middle <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn, where if the Ball he draws be Silver, he alſo ſhall countermarch: But if it be Gold, he ſhall take his place upon a form ſet croſs the Pavilion, with his face toward the Lord High Sheriff, who ſhall be ſeated in the middle of the Pavilion, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clercs by him, one of which ſhall write down the names of every E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, that is, of every one that drew a Gold Ball at the middle <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn, and in the Order his Ball was drawn, till the Electors amount to ſix in number. And the firſt ſix Electors, Horſe and Foot promiſcuouſly, are the firſt Order of Electors; the ſecond ſix (ſtill accounting them as they are drawn) the ſecond Order; the third ſix, the third Order; and the fourth ſix, the fourth Order of Electors: every Elector having place in his order, according to the order wherin he was drawn. But ſo ſoon as the firſt Order of Electors is complete, the Lord High Sheriff ſhall ſend them with a Copy of the following Liſt, and a Clerc that underſtands the Ballot, immediately to a little Tent ſtanding before the Pavilion in his ey, to which no other Perſon but themſelves, during the Election, ſhall approach.

If there ariſes any Diſpute in an Order of Electors, one of the Cenſors or Subcenſors appointed by them in caſe they be Electors, ſhall enter into the Tent of that Order; and that Order ſhall ſtand to his Judgment in the deciſion of the Controverſy. The like ſhall be don exactly by each other Order of Electors, being ſent as they are drawn, each with another Copy of the ſame Liſt, into a diſtinct Tent, till there be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Lord High Sheriff four Competitors to every Magiſtracy in the Liſt; that is to ſay, one Competitor elected to every Office in every one of the four Orders: which Competitors the Lord High Sheriff ſhall cauſe to be pronounc'd or read by a Cryer to the Congregation; and the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation having heard the whole Liſts repeated, the Names ſhall be put by the Lord High Sheriff to the Tribe, one by one, beginning with the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor in the firſt Order, thence proceding to the firſt Competitor in the ſecond Order, and ſo to the firſt in the third and fourth Orders. And the Suffrages being taken in boxes by boys <hi>(as has bin already ſhewn)</hi> ſhall be pour'd into the Bowls ſtanding before the Cenſors, who ſhall be ſeated at each end of the Table in the Pavilion, the one numbring the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and the other the Negatives; and he, of the four Competitors to the firſt Magiſtracy, that has moſt above half the Suffrages of the Tribe in the Affirmative, is the firſt Magiſtrat. The like is to be don ſucceſſively by the reſt of the Competitors in their order. But becauſe ſoon after the Boxes are ſent out for the firſt name, there be others ſent out for the ſecond, and ſo for the third, &amp;c. by which means divers names are ſucceſſively at one and the ſame time in ballotting; the Boy that carrys a Box ſhall ſing or repeat continually the name of the Competitor for whom that Box is carrying, with that alſo of the Magiſtracy to which he is propos'd. A Magiſtrat of the Tribe happening to be an Elector, may ſubſtitute any one of his own Order to execute his other Function. The Magiſtrats of the Prime Magnitude being thus elected, ſhall receive the preſent Charge of the Tribe.</p>
                  <p>IF it be objected againſt this Order, that the Magiſtrats to be elected by it, will be Men of more inferior rank than thoſe of the Hundreds, in regard that thoſe are choſen firſt; it may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49467:76"/>

As for what may be objected in point of Difficulty, it is demonſtrable by the foregoing Orders, that a Man might bring ten thouſand Men (if there were occaſion) with as much eaſe, and as ſuddenly to perform the Ballot, as he can make five thouſand Men (drawing them out by double Files) to march a quarter of a mile. But becauſe at this Ballot, to go up and down the Field, diſtributing the linen Pellets to every Man, with which he is to ballot or give ſuffrage, would loſe a great deal of time, therfore a Mans Wife, his Daughters, or others, make him his proviſion of Pellets before the Ballot; and he coms into the field with a matter of a ſcore of them in his pocket.

                  <p>WHOEVER ſhall rightly conſider the foregoing Orders, will be as little able to find how it is poſſible, that a worſhipful Knight ſhould declare himſelf in Ale and Beef worthy to ſerve his Country, as how my Lord High Sherifs Honor, in caſe he were protected from the Law, could play the knave. But tho the foregoing Orders, ſo far as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Conſtitution of the Senat and the People, requiring no more as to an ordinary Election than is therin explain'd, that is but one third part of their Knights and Deputys, are perfect; yet muſt we in this place, and as to the Inſtitution, of neceſſity erect a Scaffold.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Orator, whoſe aid in this place was moſt neceſſary, rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the People of the reaſon, ſtaid them two days longer at the Muſter, and took this courſe. One Liſt containing two Knights and ſeven Deputys, he caus'd to be choſen upon the ſecond day; which Liſt being call'd the <hi>firſt Galaxy,</hi> qualify'd the Partys elected of it with power for the term of one year and no longer: another Liſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining two Knights and ſeven Deputys more, he caus'd to be choſen the third day, which Liſt being call'd the <hi>ſecond Galaxy,</hi> qualify'd the Partys elected of it with Power for the term of two years and no longer.

Whether Souls, not confin'd to their peculiar Bodys, do govern them any more than thoſe of Witches in their Trances? Whether Power, not confin'd to the bounds of Reaſon and Virtue, has any other bounds than thoſe of Vice and Paſſion? Or if Vice and Paſſion be boundleſs, and Reaſon and Virtue have certain Limits, on which of theſe Thrones holy men ſhould anoint their Soverain? But to blow away this duſt, The Soverain Power of a Commonwealth is no more bounded, that is to ſay ſtraitned, than that of a Monarch; but is balanc'd. The Eagle mounts not to her proper pitch, if ſhe be bounded; nor is free, if ſhe be not balanc'd.

                                 <q>IF I did not, to my capacity, know from how profound a Counſillor I diſſent, it would certainly be no hard task to make it as light as the day: Firſt, That an Agrarian is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary. Secondly, That it is dangerous to a Commonwealth. Thirdly, That it is inſufficient to keep out Monarchy. Fourthly, That it ruins Familys. Fifthly, That it deſtroys Induſtry. And laſt of all, that tho it were indeed of any good uſe, it will be a matter of ſuch difficulty to introduce in this Nation, and ſo to ſettle that it may be laſting, as is altogether invincible.</q>

                                 <q>FIRST, That an Agrarian is unneceſſary to a Commonwealth, what clearer Teſtimony can there be, than that the Commonwealths which are our Cotemporarys <hi>(Venice,</hi> to which your Highneſs gives the upper hand of all Antiquity, being one) have no ſuch thing? And there can be no reaſon why they have it not, ſeeing it is in the Soverain Power at any time to eſtabliſh ſuch an Order, but that they need it not; wherfore no wonder if ARISTOTLE, who pretends to be a good Commonwealthſman, has long ſince derided PHALEAS, to whom it was attributed by the <hi>Greecs,</hi> for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</q>

                                 <q>THIRDLY, That it is inſufficient to keep out Monarchy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without impiety be deny'd, the holy Scriptures bearing witneſs, that the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> notwithſtanding her Agrarian, ſubmitted her neck to the arbitrary Yoke of her Princes.</q>

                                 <q>FOURTHLY, Therfore to com to my next Aſſertion, That it is deſtructive to Familys; this alſo is ſo apparent, that it needs pity rather than proof. Why, alas, do you bind a Nobility (which no Generation ſhall deny to have bin the firſt that freely ſacrific'd their Blood to the antient Libertys of this People) on an unholy Altar? Why are the People taught, That their Liberty, which, except our noble Anceſtors had bin born, muſt have long ſince bin bury'd, cannot now be born except we be bury'd? A Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſhould have the innocence of the Dove. Let us leave this purchaſe of her Birth to the Serpent, which eats it ſelf out of the womb of its Mother.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>FIFTHLY, But it may be ſaid, perhaps, that we are fallen from our firſt Love, becom proud and idle. It is certain, my Lords, that the hand of God is not upon us for nothing. But take heed how you admit of ſuch aſſaults and ſallys upon Mens Eſtates, as may ſlacken the Nerve of Labor, and give others alſo reaſon to believe that their Sweat is vain; or elſe, whatſoever be pretended, your Agrarian (which is my Fifth Aſſertion) muſt indeed deſtroy Induſtry. For, that ſo it did in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> is moſt apparent, as alſo that it could do no otherwiſe, where every Man having his 40 Quarters of Barly, with Wine proportionable, ſupply'd him out of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49467:80"/>
his own Lot by his Laborer or Helot; and being confin'd in that to the ſcantling above which he might not live, there was not any ſuch thing as a Trade, or other Art, except that of War, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. Wherfore a <hi>Spartan,</hi> if he were not in Arms, muſt ſit and play with his fingers, whence inſu'd perpetual War, and, the Eſtate of the City being as little capable of increaſe as that of the Citizens, her inevitable Ruin. Now what better ends you can propoſe to your ſelves in the like ways, I do not ſo well ſee as I perceive that there may be worſe: For <hi>Lacedemon</hi> yet was free from Civil War: But if you imploy your Citizens no better than ſhe did, I cannot promiſe you that you ſhall fare ſo well, becauſe they are ſtill deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of War that hope it may be profitable to them; and the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Security you can give of Peace, is to make it gainful. Otherwiſe Men will rather chuſe that wherby they may break your Laws, than that wherby your Laws may break them. Which I ſpeak not ſo much in relation to the Nobility or ſuch as would be holding, as to the People or them that would be getting; the paſſion in theſe being ſo much the ſtronger; as a Man's felicity is weaker in the fruition of things, than in their proſecution and increaſe.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>TRULY, my Lords, it is my fear, that by taking of more hands, and the beſt from Induſtry, you will further indamage it, than can be repair'd by laying on a few, and the worſt; while the Nobility muſt be forc'd to ſend their Sons to the Plow, and, as if this were not enough, to marry their Daughters alſo to Farmers.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>SIXTHLY, But I do not ſee (to com to the laſt point) how it is poſſible that this thing ſhould be brought about, to your good I mean, tho it may to the deſtruction of many. For that the Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or that of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> might ſtand, is no ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; the Lands, without any conſideration of the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, being ſurvey'd and caſt into equal Lots, which could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be bought, nor ſold, nor multiply'd: ſo that they knew wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about to have a Man. But in this Nation no ſuch Diviſion can be introduc'd, the Lands being already in the hands of Proprietors, and ſuch whoſe Eſtates ly very rarely together, but mix'd one with another; being alſo of Tenures in nature ſo different, that as there is no experience that an Agrarian was ever introduc'd in ſuch a caſe, ſo there is no appearance how, or reaſon why it ſhould: but that which is againſt Reaſon and Experience is impoſſible.</q>

                  <p>THE caſe of my Lord PHILAUTUS was the moſt concern'd in the whole Nation; for he had four younger Brothers, his Father being yet living to whom he was Heir of ten thouſand Pounds a year. Wherfore being a Man both of good Parts and Eſteem, his Words wrought both upon Mens Reaſon and Paſſions, and had born a ſtroke at the head of the buſineſs, if my Lord ARCHON had not interpos'd the Buckler in this Oration.</p>

and the Love he has moſt deſervedly purchas'd of all Men: nor is it rationally to be fear'd, that he who is ſo much beforehand in his privat, ſhould be in arrear in his public Capacity. Wherfore my Lord's tenderneſs throout his Speech ariſing from no other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple than his Solicitude leſt the Agrarian ſhould be hurtful to his Country; it is no leſs than my duty to give the beſt ſatisfaction I am able to ſo good a Patriot, taking every one of his Doubts in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der propos'd. And,</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>FIRST, Wheras my Lord, upon obſervation of the modern Commonwealths, is of opinion, that an Agrarian is not neceſſary: It muſt be conſeſt, that at the firſt ſight of them there is ſom appearance favoring his Aſſertion, but upon Accidents of no prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to us. For the Commonwealths of <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> I mean of thoſe Leagues, being ſituated in Countrys not alluring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to Wantonneſs, but obliging them to univerſal Induſtry, have an implicit Agrarian in the nature of them: and being not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to a growing Nobility (which, as long as their former Monarchys had ſpread the wing over them, could either not at all be hatch'd, or was ſoon broken) are of no example to us, whoſe Experience in this point has bin to the contrary. But what if even in theſe Governments there be indeed an explicit Agrarian? For when the Law commands an equal or near equal diſtribution of a Man's Eſtate in Land among his Children, as it is don in thoſe Countrys, a Nobility cannot grow; and ſo there needs no Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, or rather there is one. And for the growth of the Nobility in <hi>Venice</hi> (if ſo it be, for MACCHIAVEL obſerves in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, as a cauſe of it, a great mediocrity of Eſtates) it is not a point that ſhe is to fear, but might ſtudy, ſeeing ſhe conſiſts of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Nobility; by which, whatever their Eſtates ſuck from the People, eſpecially if it coms equally, is digeſted into the better Blood of that Commonwealth, which is all, or the greateſt benefit they can have by accumulation. For how inequal ſoever you will have them to be in their Incoms, they have Officers of the Pomp, to bring them equal in expences, or at leaſt in the oſtentation or ſhew of them. And ſo unleſs the advantage of an Eſtate conſiſts more in the meaſure than in the uſe of it, the Authority of <hi>Venice</hi> dos but inforce our Agrarian; nor ſhall a Man evade or elude the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, by the Authority of any other Commonwealth. For if a Commonwealth has bin introduc'd at once, as thoſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> you are certain to find her underlaid with this as the main Foundation; nor, if ſhe is oblig'd more to Fortune than Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, has ſhe rais'd her head without muſing upon this matter, as appears by that of <hi>Athens,</hi> which thro her defect in this point, ſays ARISTOTLE, introduc'd her <hi>Oſtraciſm,</hi> as moſt of the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracys <note place="margin">Poli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That if a People be in an equal balance, they can have no Lords? That no Government can otherwiſe be erected, than upon ſom one of theſe Foundations? That no one of theſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations (each being elſe apt to change into ſom other) can give any ſecurity to the Government, unleſs it be fix'd? That thro the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49467:81"/>
want of this fixation, potent Monarchys and Commonwealths have faln upon the heads of the People, and accompany'd their own ſad Ruins with vaſt effuſions of innocent Blood? Let the Fame, as was the merit of the antient Nobility of this Nation, be equal to, or above what has bin already ſaid, or can be ſpoken; yet have we ſeen not only their Glory, but that of a Throne, the moſt indulgent to, and leaſt invaſive for ſo many Ages upon the Liberty of a People that the World has known, thro the mere want of fixing her foot by a proportionable Agrarian upon her proper Foundation, to have faln with ſuch horror, as has bin a Spectacle of Aſtoniſhment to the whole Earth. And were it well argu'd from one Calamity, that we ought not to prevent another? Nor is ARISTOTLE ſo good a Commonwealthſman for deriding the invention of PHALEAS, as <note place="margin">Polit. l. 5. c. 3.</note>in recollecting himſelf, where he ſays, That Democracys, when a leſs part of their Citizens overtop the reſt in Wealth, degenerat into Oligarchys and Principalitys: and, which coms nearer to the preſent purpoſe, that the greater part of the Nobility of <hi>Tarantum</hi> coming accidentally to be ruin'd, the Government of the Few came by conſequence to be chang'd into that of the Many.</q>

For the <hi>Laconic,</hi> I ſhall reſerve the farther expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, as my Lord alſo did, to another place: and firſt ſee whether an Agrarian proportion'd to a popular Government be ſufficient to keep out Monarchy. My Lord is for the Negative, and fortify'd by the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> electing a King. To which I ſay, That the Action of the People therin expreſt is a full Anſwer to the Objection of that Example: For the Monarchy neither grew upon them, nor could, by reaſon of the Agrarian, poſſibly have invaded them, if they had not pull'd it upon themſelves by the election of a King. Which being an Accident, the like wherof is not to be found in any other People ſo planted, nor in this, till, as it is manifeſt, they were given up by God to infatuation (for ſays he to SAMUEL, <hi>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me, that I ſhould not reign over them)</hi> has ſomthing in it which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, by what went before, to have bin beſides the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by what follow'd. For the King having no other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

than the Calamitys of the People, ſo often beaten by their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemys, that deſpairing of themſelves, they were contented with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny change; if he had Peace as in the days of SOLOMON, leſt but a ſlippery Throne to his Succeſſor, as appear'd by REHOBOAM. And the Agrarian, notwithſtanding the Monarchy thus introduc'd, ſo faithfully preſerv'd the Root of that Commonwealth, that it ſhot forth oftner, and by intervals continu'd longer than any other Government, as may be computed from the Inſtitution of the ſame by JOSHUA, 1465 years before CHRIST, to the total diſſolution of it, which happen'd in the Reign of the Emperor ADRIAN, 135 years after the Incarnation. A People planted upon an equal Agrarian, and holding to it, if they part with their Liberty, muſt do it upon good will, and make but a bad title of their Bounty. As to inſtance yet further in that which is propos'd by the preſent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this Nation, the Standard wherof is at 2000 <hi>l.</hi> a year: The whole Territory of <hi>Oceana</hi> being divided by this proportion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to 5000 Lots. So the Lands of <hi>Oceana</hi> being thus diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bound to this Diſtribution, can never fall to fewer than five thouſand Proprietors. But five thouſand Proprietors ſo ſeiz'd will not agree to break the Agrarian, for that were to agree to rob one another; nor to bring in a King, becauſe they muſt maintain him, and can have no benefit by him; nor to exclude the People, becauſe they can have as little by that, and muſt ſpoil their Militia. So the Commonwealth continuing upon the balance propos'd, tho it ſhould com into five thouſand hands, can never alter; and that it ſhould ever com into five thouſand hands, is as improbable as any thing in the World that is not altogether impoſſible.</q>

                                 <q>MY Lords, other Conſiderations are more privat: As that this Order deſtroys Familys; which is as if one ſhould lay the ruins of ſom antient Caſtle to the Herbs which uſually grow out of them; the deſtruction of thoſe Familys being that indeed which naturally produc'd this Order. For we do not now argue for that which we would have, but for that which we are already poſſeſt of; as would appear, if a note were but taken of all ſuch as have at this day above two thouſand Pounds a year in <hi>Oceana.</hi> If my Lord ſhould grant (and I will put it with the moſt) that they who are Proprietors in Land, exceding this proportion, excede not three hundred; with what brow can the Intereſt of ſo few be balanc'd with that of the whole Nation? or rather, what Intereſt have they to put in ſuch a Balance? They would live as they have bin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to do; Who hinders them? They would enjoy their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; who touches them? They would diſpoſe of what they have according to the Intereſt of their Familys: It is that which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. A Man has one Son; let him be call'd: Would he enjoy his Father's Eſtate? It is his, his Son's, and his Son's Son's after him. A Man has five Sons; let them be call'd: Would they enjoy their Father's Eſtate? It is divided among them: for we have four Votes for one in the ſame Family, and therfore this muſt be the Intereſt of the Family, or the Family knows not its own Intereſt. If a Man ſhall diſpute otherwiſe, he muſt draw his Arguments from Cuſtom, and from Greatneſs, which was the Intereſt of the Monarchy, not of the Family: and we are now a Commonwealth. If the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy could not bear with ſuch Diviſions becauſe they tended to a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49467:82"/>
Commonwealth; neither can a Commonwealth connive at ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulations, becauſe they tend to a Monarchy. If the Monarchy might make bold with ſo many for the good of one, we may make bold with one for the good of ſo many; nay, for the good of all. My Lords, it coms into my mind, that which upon occaſion of the variety of Partys enumerated in our late Civil Wars, was ſaid by a Friend of mine coming home from his Travels, about the latter end of theſe Troubles; That he admir'd how it came to paſs, that younger Brothers, eſpecially being ſo many more in number than their Elder, did not unite as one man againſt a Tyranny, the like wherof has not bin exercis'd in any other Nation. And truly, when I conſider that our Countrymen are none of the worſt natur'd, I muſt confeſs I marvel much how it coms to paſs, that we ſhould uſe our Children as we do our Puppys; take one, lay it in the lap, feed it with every good bit, and drown five: nay yet worſe; foraſmuch as the Puppys are once drown'd, wheras the Children are left perpetually drowning. Really, my Lords, it is a flinty Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom! And all this for his cruel Ambition, that would raiſe himſelf a Pillar, a golden Pillar for his Monument, tho he has Children, his own reviving Fleſh, and a kind of Immortality. And this is that Intereſt of a Family, for which we are to think ill of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that will not indure it. But quiet your ſelves: The Land thro which the River <hi>Nilus</hi> wanders in one ſtream, is barren; but where it parts into ſeven, it multiplys its ſertil ſhores by diſtributing, yet keeping and improving ſuch a Propriety and Nutrition, as is a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Agrarian to a wellorder'd Commonwealth.</q>
                              </p>

                                 <q>NOR (to com to the fifth Aſſertion) is a political Body render'd any fitter for Induſtry, by having one gouty and another wither'd Leg, than a natural. It tends not to the improvement of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize that there be ſom who have no need of their Trading, and others that are not able to follow it. If Confinement diſcourages Induſtry, an Eſtate in Mony is not confin'd; and leſt Induſtry ſhould want wherupon to work, Land is not ingroſt or intail'd upon any man, but remains at its devotion. I wonder whence the computation can ariſe, that this ſhould diſcourage Induſtry. Two thouſand Pounds a year a man may enjoy in <hi>Oceana,</hi> as much in <hi>Panopea,</hi> five hundred in <hi>Marpeſia:</hi> There be other Plantations, and the Commonwealth will have more. Who knows how far the Arms of our Agrarian may extend themſelves? and whether he that might have left a Pillar, may not leave a Temple of many Pillars to his more pious Memory? Where there is ſom meaſure in Riches, a man may be rich; but if you will have them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit, there will be no end of ſtarving himſelf, and wanting what he has: and what pains dos ſuch a one take to be poor! Furthermore, if a man ſhall think that there may be an Induſtry leſs greaſy, or more noble, and ſo caſt his thoughts upon the Commonwealth, he will have leiſure for her, and ſhe Riches and Honors for him; his Sweat ſhall ſmell like ALEXANDER'S. My Lord PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAUTUS is a young Man, who enjoying his ten thouſand Pounds a year, may keep a noble Houſe in the old way, and have homely Gueſts; and having but two, by the means propos'd, may take the upper hand of his great Anceſtors; with reverence to whom, I may ſay, there has not bin one of them would have diſputed his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49467:82"/>
place with a <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul. My Lord, do not break my heart; the Nobility ſhall go to no other Plows than thoſe from which we call our Conſuls. But, ſays he, it having bin ſo with <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> that neither the City nor the Citizens were capable of increaſe, a blow was given by that Agrarian, which ruin'd both. And what are we concern'd with that Agrarian, or that blow, while our Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and our City (and that by our Agrarian) are both capable of increaſe? The <hi>Spartan,</hi> if he made a Conqueſt, had not Citizens to hold it; the <hi>Oceaner</hi> will have enow: the <hi>Spartan</hi> could have no Trade, the <hi>Oceaner</hi> may have all. The Agrarian in <hi>Laconia,</hi> that it might bind on Knapſacs, forbidding all other Arts but that of War, could not make an Army of above 30000 Citizens. The Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian in <hi>Oceana</hi> without interruption of Traffic, provides us in the fifth part of the Youth an annual ſource or freſh ſpring of 100000, beſides our Provincial Auxiliarys, out of which to draw marching Armys; and as many Elders, not feeble, but men moſt of them in the flower of their Age, and in Arms for the defence of our Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorys. The Agrarian in <hi>Laconia</hi> baniſh'd Mony, this multiplys it: That allow'd a matter of twenty or thirty Acres to a man; this two or three thouſand: There is no compariſon between them. And yet I differ ſo much from my Lord, or his Opinion that the Agrarian was the ruin of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> that I hold it no leſs than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable to have bin her main ſupport. For if, baniſhing all other diverſions, it could not make an Army of above 30000; then letting in all other diverſions, it muſt have broken that Army. Wherfore LYSANDER bringing in the golden ſpoils of <hi>Athens,</hi> irrecoverably ruin'd that Commonwealth; and is a warning to us, that in giving incouragement to Induſtry, we alſo remember, that Covetouſneſs is the root of all Evil. And our Agrarian can never be the cauſe of thoſe Seditions threaten'd by my Lord, but is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cure of them, as <note n="*" place="bottom">Hinc uſura vorax, rapidumque in tempore Foenus; Hinc concuſſa fides, &amp; multis utile bellum.</note>LUCAN notes well in the State of <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Civil Wars, which happen'd thro the want of ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote.</q>

                              <p>
                                 <q>Why then are we miſtaken, as if we intended not equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in our Commonwealth to either Sex, becauſe we would not have Womens Fortunes conſiſt in that metal, which expoſes them to Cutpurſes? If a man cuts my Purſe, I may have him by the heels, or by the neck for it; wheras a man may cut a woman's purſe, and have her for his pains in fetters. How brutiſh, and much more than brutiſh, is that Commonwealth, which prefers the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fruits of her Womb? If the People be her Treaſure, the ſtaff by which ſhe is ſuſtain'd and comforted, with what Juſtice can ſhe ſuffer them, by whom ſhe is moſt inrich'd, to be for that cauſe the moſt impoveriſh'd? And yet we ſee the Gifts of God, and the Bountys of Heaven in fruitful Familys, thro this wretched cuſtom of marrying for Mony, becom their inſupportable grief and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Nor falls this ſo heavy upon the lower ſort, being better able to ſhift for themſelves, as upon the Nobility or Gentry. For what avails it in this caſe, from whence their Veins have deriv'd their
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49467:83"/>
Blood; while they ſhall ſee the Tallow of a Chandler ſooner convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into that Beauty which is requir'd in a Bride? I appeal, whether my Lord PHILAUTUS or my ſelf be the Advocat of Nobility; againſt which in the caſe propos'd by me, there would be nothing to hold the balance. And why is a Woman, if ſhe may have but fifteen hundred pounds, undon? If ſhe be unmarry'd, what Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man allows his Daughter in that caſe a greater Revenu, than ſo much Mony may command? And if ſhe marry, no Nobleman can give his Daughter a greater portion than ſhe has. Who is hurt in this caſe? nay, who is not benefited? If the Agrarian gives us the ſweat of our brows without diminution; if it prepares our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if it makes our Cup to overflow; and above all this, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for our Children, anoints our Heads with that Oil which takes away the greateſt of worldly cares; what man, that is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted with a Covetouſneſs as vain as endleſs, can imagin ſuch a Conſtitution to be his Poverty? ſeeing where no woman can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for her portion, no portion will be conſiderable with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and ſo his Children will not only find better preferments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Brocage, but more freedom of their own Affections. We are wonderful ſevere in Laws, that they ſhall not marry without our conſent; as if it were care and tenderneſs over them: But is it not, leſt we ſhould not have the other thouſand Pounds with this Son, or the other hundred Pounds a year more in Jointure for that Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Theſe, when we are croſt in them, are the Sins for which we water our couch with tears, but not of Penitence; ſeeing wheras it is a miſchief beyond any that we can do to our Enemys, we perſiſt to make nothing of breaking the affection of our Children. But there is in this Agrarian a Homage to pure and ſpotleſs Love, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence wherof I will not give for all your Romances. An Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man makes not his Daughter a Counteſs till he has given her 20000 <hi>l.</hi> nor a Romance a conſiderable Miſtriſs till ſhe be a Princeſs; theſe are Characters of baſtard Love. But if our Agrarian excludes Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Covetouſneſs, we ſhall at length have the care of our own breed, in which we have bin curious as to our Dogs and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The Marriage-Bed will be truly legitimat, and the Race of the Commonwealth not ſpurious.</q>

And why? becauſe of the mixture of Eſtates, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Tenures. Nevertheleſs, there is yet extant in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> an old Survey of the whole Nation; wherfore ſuch a thing is not impoſſible. Now if a new Survey were taken at the preſent rates, and the Law made, that no man ſhould hold hereafter above ſo much Land as is valu'd therin at 2000 <hi>l.</hi> a year, it would amount to a good and ſufficient Agrarian. It is true, that there would remain ſom difficulty in the different kind of Rents, and that it is a matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring not only more leiſure than we have, but an Authority which may be better able to bow men to a more general Conſent, than is to be wrought out of them by ſuch as are in our capacity. Wherfore, as to the manner, it is neceſſary that we refer it to the Parlament; but as to the matter, they cannot otherwiſe fix their Government up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right Balance.</q>

                                 <q>I SHALL conclude with a few words to ſom parts of the Order, which my Lord has omitted. As firſt to the Conſequences of the Agrarian to be ſettled in <hi>Marpeſia,</hi> which irreparably breaks the Ariſtocracy of that Nation; being of ſuch a nature, as ſtanding, it is not poſſible that you ſhould govern. For while the People of that Country are little better than the Cattel of the Nobility, you muſt not wonder if according as theſe can make their Markets with foren Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, you find thoſe to be driven upon your Grounds. And if you be ſo tender, now you have it in your power, as not to hold a hand upon them that may prevent the ſlaughter which muſt otherwiſe inſue in like caſes, the Blood will ly at your door. But in holding ſuch a hand upon them, you may ſettle the Agrarian; and in ſettling the Agrarian, you give that People not only Liberty, but Lands; which makes your Protection neceſſary to their Security; and their Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution due to your Protection, as to their own Safety.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>FOR the Agrarian of <hi>Panopea,</hi> it allowing ſuch proportions of ſo good Land, men that conceive themſelves ſtraitned by this in <hi>Oceana,</hi> will begin there to let themſelves forth, where every Citizen will in time have his <hi>Villa.</hi> And there is no queſtion, but the improvement of that Country by this means muſt be far greater than it has bin in the beſt of former times.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>I HAVE no more to ſay, but that in thoſe antient and heroic Ages (when men thought that to be neceſſary which was virtuous) the Nobility of <hi>Athens</hi> having the People ſo much ingag'd in their debt, that there remain'd no other queſtion among theſe, than which of thoſe ſhould be King, no ſooner heard SOLON ſpeak than they quitted their Debts, and reſtor'd the Commonwealth; which ever after held a ſolemn and annual Feaſt call'd the <hi>Siſacthia,</hi> or <hi>Reciſion,</hi> in memory of that Action. Nor is this example the <hi>Phoenix;</hi> for at the inſtitution by LYCURGUS, the Nobility having Eſtates (as ours here) in the Lands of <hi>Laconia,</hi> upon no other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſideration than the Commonwealth propos'd by him, threw them up to be parcel'd by his Agrarian. But now when no man is deſir'd to throw up a farthing of his Mony, or a ſhovel full of his Earth, and that all we can do is but to make a virtue of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; we are diſputing whether we ſhould have Peace or War: For Peace you cannot have without ſom Government, nor any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment without the proper Balance. Wherfore if you will not fix this which you have, the reſt is Blood, for without Blood you can bring in no other.</q>

I SHALL indeavor by the preceding Figure to demonſtrat the Manner of the <hi>VENETIAN BALLOT</hi> (a thing as difficult in diſcourſe or writing, as facil in practice) according to the uſe of it in <hi>Oceana.</hi> The whole Figure repreſents the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, containing, as to the Houſe or form of ſitting, a ſquare and a half; the Tribunal at the upper end being aſcended by four ſteps. On the uppermoſt of theſe ſit the Magiſtrats that conſtitute the Signory of the Commonwealth, that is to ſay, A the Strategus; B the Orator; C the three Commiſſioners of the Great Seal; D the three Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, wherof one, E, exerciſes for the preſent the Office of a Cenſor at the middle Urn F.</p>
                  <p>TO the two upper ſteps of the Tribunal anſwer G G. G G. the two long Benches next the Wall on each ſide of the Houſe; the outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of which are equal in height to the uppermoſt ſtep, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt equal in height to the next. Of theſe four Benches conſiſts the firſt Seat; as the ſecond Seat conſiſts in like manner of thoſe four Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches H H. H H. which being next the Floor, are equal in height to the two nethermoſt ſteps of the Throne. <hi>So the whole Houſe is diſtributed into two Seats, each conſiſting of four Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS diſtribution cauſes not only the greater conveniency, as will be ſhewn, to the Senators in the exerciſe of their Function at the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, but a greater grace to the aſpect of the Senat. In the middle of the outward benches ſtand I. I. the chairs of the Cenſors, thoſe being their ordinary places, tho upon occaſion of the Ballot they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, and ſit where they are ſhewn by K. K. at each of the outward Urns L. L. Thoſe M. M. that ſit with their Tables, and the Bowls N. N. before them, upon the half ſpace or ſecond ſtep of the Tribunal from the floor, are the Clercs or Secretarys of the Houſe. Upon the ſhort Seats O. O. on the floor (which ſhould have bin repreſented by Woolſacks) ſit P the two Tribuns of the Horſe; Q the two Tribuns of the Foot; and R R. R R. the Judges: all which Magiſtrats are Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants, but have no ſuffrage. This poſture of the Senat conſider'd, the Ballot is perform'd as follows.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, wheras the gold Balls are of ſeveral ſutes, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mark'd with ſeveral Letters of the Alphabet, a Secretary preſents a little Urn (wherin there is one Ball of every ſute or mark) to the Strategus and the Orator; and look what Letter the Strategus draws, the ſame and no other is to be us'd for that time in the middle Urn F; the like for the Letter drawn by the Orator is to be obſerv'd for the ſide Urns L. L. that is to ſay, if the Strategus drew a Ball with an <hi>A,</hi> all the gold Balls in the middle Urn for that day are mark'd with the Letter <hi>A;</hi> and if the Orator drew a <hi>B,</hi> all the gold Balls in the ſide Urn for that day are mark'd with the Letter <hi>B:</hi> which don immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the Ballot, and ſo the Letter unknown to the Ballotants, they can uſe no fraud or jugling; otherwiſe a man might carry a gold Ball in his hand, and ſeem to have drawn it out of an Urn. He that draws a gold Ball at any Urn, delivers it to the Cenſor or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of that Urn, who views the Character, and allows accordingly of his Lot.</p>
                  <p>THE Strategus and the Orator having drawn for the Letters, the Urns are prepar'd accordingly by one of the Commiſſioners and the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49467:85"/>
two Cenſors. The preparation of the Urns is after this manner. If the Senat be to elect, for example, the Liſt call'd the <hi>Tropic of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats,</hi> which is this;</p>

                  <p>This Liſt or Schedule conſiſts of ſix Magiſtracys, and to every Magiſtracy there are to be four Competitors, that is, in all four and twenty Competitors propos'd to the Houſe. They that are to propoſe the Competitors are call'd Electors, and no Elector can propoſe above one Competitor: wherfore for the propoſing of four and twenty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors you muſt have four and twenty Electors; and wheras the Ballot conſiſts of a <hi>Lot</hi> and of a <hi>Suffrage,</hi> the Lot is for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe than for the deſignation of Electors; and he that draws a gold Ball at the middle Urn is an Elector. Now, as to have four and twenty Competitors propos'd, you muſt have four and twenty Electors made; ſo to have four and twenty Electors made by lot, you muſt have four and twenty gold Balls in the middle Urn; and theſe (becauſe otherwiſe it would be no Lot) mix'd with a competent number of Blanks, or ſilver Balls. Wherfore to the four and twenty gold Balls caſt ſix and twenty ſilver ones, and thoſe (reckoning the Blanks with the Prizes) make fifty Balls in the middle Urn. This don (becauſe no man can com to the middle Urn that has not firſt drawn a gold Ball at one of the ſide Urns) and to be ſure that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes or gold Balls in this Urn be all drawn, there muſt com to it fifty perſons: therfore there muſt be in each of the ſide Urns five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gold Balls, which in both com to fifty; and to the end that every Senator may have his Lot, the gold Balls in the ſide Urns are to be made up with Blanks equal to the number of the Ballotants at either Urn: for example, the Houſe conſiſting of 300 Senators, there muſt be in each of the ſide Urns 125 Blanks and 25 Prizes, which com in both the ſide Urns to 300 Balls. This is the whole Myſtery of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Urns, which the Cenſors having skill to do accordingly, the reſt of the Ballot, whether the partys balloting underſtand it or no, muſt of neceſſary conſequence com right; and they can neither be out, nor ſall into any confuſion in the exerciſe of this Art.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Ballot, as I ſaid, is of two parts, <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Suffrage,</hi> or the <hi>Propoſition</hi> and <hi>Reſult.</hi> The Lot determins who ſhall propoſe the Competitors; and the Reſult of the Senat, which of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors ſhall be the Magiſtrats. The whole, to begin with the Lot, procedes in this manner.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt Secretary with an audible Voice reads firſt the Liſt of the Magiſtrats to be choſen for the day; then the Oath for fair Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at which the Senators hold up their hands; which don, another Secretary preſents a little Urn to the Strategus, in which are four Balls, each of them having one of theſe four Inſcriptions: <hi>FIRST SEAT AT THE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PPER END. FIRST SEAT AT THE LOWER END. SECOND SEAT AT THE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PPER
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49467:85"/>
END. SECOND SEAT AT THE LOWER END.</hi> and look which of them the Strategus draws, the Secretary pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Inſcription with a loud Voice, the Seat ſo call'd coms ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to the Urns: this in the Figure is the <hi>SECOND SEAT AT THE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PPER END.</hi> The manner of their coming to the ſide Urns is in double Files, there being two holes in the cover of each ſide Urn, by which means two may draw at once. The Senators therfore SS. SS. are coming from the upper end of their Seats HH. HH. to the ſide Urns L. L. The Senators TT. T. are drawing. The Senator V has drawn a gold Ball at his ſide Urn, and is going to the middle Urn F, where the Senator W having don the like at the other ſide Urn, is already drawing. But the Senators X X. X X. having drawn Blanks at their ſide Urns, and thrown them into the Bowls Y. Y. ſtanding at the feet of the Urns, are marching by the lower end into their Seats again; the Senator <hi>a</hi> having don the like at the middle Urn, is alſo throwing his blank into the Bowl <hi>b,</hi> and marching to his Seat again: for a man by a prize at a ſide Urn gains no more than right to com to the middle Urn, where if he draws a Blank, his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune at the ſide Urn coms to nothing at all; wherfore he alſo returns to his place. But the Senator <hi>c</hi> has had a Prize at the middle Urn, where the Commiſſioner having viewed his Ball, and found the mark to be right, he marches up the ſteps to the Seat of the Electors, which is the form <hi>d</hi> ſet croſs the Tribunal, where he places himſelf according as he was drawn with the other Electors <hi>eee</hi> drawn before him. Theſe are not to look back, but ſit with their Faces towards the Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or State, till their number amount to that of the Magiſtrate to be that day choſen, which for the preſent, as was ſhewn, are ſix; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſix Electors being made, they are reckon'd according as they were drawn: Firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, fifth, ſixth, in their Order; and the firſt ſix that are choſen are the <hi>FIRST ORDER OF ELECTORS.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THE firſt Order of Electors</hi> being made, are conducted by a Secretary, with a copy of the Liſt to be choſen, out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, and into a Committee or Council-Chamber, being neither ſuffer'd by the way, nor in their room (till the Ballot be ended) to have conference with any but themſelves; wherfore the Secretary, having given them their Oath that they ſhall make Election according to the Law and their Conſcience, delivers them the Liſt, and ſeats himſelf at the lower end of the Table with his Pen and Paper, while another Secretary keeps the Door.</p>
                  <p>BY ſuch time as the firſt Order of Electors are thus ſeated, the ſecond Order of Electors is drawn, who with a ſecond Copy of the ſame Liſt are conducted into another Committee-chamber, by other Secretarys performing the ſame Office with the former.</p>
                  <p>THE like exactly is don by the third and by the fourth Orders (or <hi>Hands,</hi> as the <hi>Venetians</hi> call them) of Electors; by which means you have the four and twenty Electors divided according to the four Copys of the ſame Liſt, by ſix, into four Hands or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and every one of theſe Orders names one Competitor to every Magiſtracy in the Liſt; that is to ſay, the firſt Elector names to the firſt Magiſtracy, the ſecond Elector to the ſecond Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, and ſo forth. But tho the Electors, as has bin ſhewn, are choſen by mere lot, yet the Competitors by them nam'd are not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49467:86"/>
by any Lot, but by the Suffrage of the whole Order: For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; The firſt Elector in the firſt Order propoſes a Name to be Strate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, which Name is balloted by himſelf and the other five Electors; and if the Name ſo balloted attain not to above half the Suffrages, it is laid aſide, and the firſt Elector names another to the ſame Magiſtracy; and ſo in caſe this alſo fails, another, till one he has nam'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be himſelf, or ſom other, has attain'd to above half the Suffrages in the affirmative; and the name ſo attaining to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half the Suffrages in the Affirmative is written to the firſt Magiſtracy in the Liſt by the Secretary; which being don, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Elector of the firſt Order names to the ſecond Magiſtracy till one of his nomination be choſen to the ſame. The like is don by the reſt of the Electors of the firſt Order, till one Competitor be choſen, and written to every Magiſtracy in their Liſt. Now the ſecond, third, and fourth Orders of Electors doing exactly after the ſame manner, it coms to paſs that one Competitor to every Magiſtracy being choſen in each Order, there be in all four Competitors choſen to every Magiſtracy.</p>
                  <p>IF any Controverſy ariſes in an Order of Electors, one of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors (theſe being at this game the Groomporters) is advertis'd by the Secretary, who brings him in, and the Electors diſputing are bound to acquieſce in his Sentence. For which cauſe it is that the Cenſors do not ballot at the Urns; the Signory alſo abſtains, leſt it ſhould deform the Houſe: wherfore the Blanks in the ſide Urns are by ſo many the fewer. And ſo much for the Lot, which is of the greater Art but leſs Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, becauſe it concerns <hi>Propoſition</hi> only: But all (except the Tribuns and the Judges, which being but Aſſiſtants have no Suffrage) are to ballot at the <hi>Reſult,</hi> to which I now com.</p>
                  <p>THE four Orders of Electors having perfected their Liſts, the face of the Houſe is chang'd: for the Urns are taken away, and every Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator and Magiſtrat is ſeated in his proper place, ſaving the Electors, who, having given their Suffrages already, may not ſtir out of their Chambers, till the Houſe have given theirs, and the reſt of the Ballot be perform'd; which follows in this manner.</p>
                  <p>THE four Liſts being preſented by the Secretarys of each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Electors to the Signory, are firſt read, according to their Order, to the Houſe with an audible Voice; and then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors are put to the Ballot or Suffrage of the whole Senat in this manner: <hi>A. A.</hi> nam'd to be Strategus in the firſt Order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherupon eight Ballotins or Pages, ſuch as are expreſs'd by the Figures <hi>f. f.</hi> take eight of the Boxes repreſented, tho rudely, by the Figures <hi>g. g.</hi> and go four on the one, and four on the other ſide of the Houſe, that is, one to every Bench, ſinging <hi>A. A. nam'd to be the Strategus in the firſt Order:</hi> and every Magiſtrat and Senator (begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the Strategus and the Orator firſt) holds up a little Pellet of Linen, as the Box paſſes, between his Finger and his Thumb, that men may ſee he has but one, and then puts it into the ſame. The Box con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the inner part of two Boxes, being painted on the outſide white and green, to diſtinguiſh the Affirmative from the Nagative ſide, is ſo made, that when your Hand is in it, no man can ſee to which of the ſides you put the Suffrage, nor hear to which it falls, becauſe the Pellet being Linen, makes no noiſe. The Strategus and the Orator having begun, all the reſt do the like.</p>
                  <p>THE Ballotins having thus gather'd the Suffrages, bring them
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49467:86"/>
before the Signory, in whoſe preſence the outward Boxes being open'd, they take out the inner Boxes, wherof the Affirmative is white, and the Negative green, and pour the white into the Bowl N on the right hand, which is white alſo, and the green into the Bowl N on the leſt, which is alſo green. Theſe Bowls or Baſons (better repreſented at the lower end of the Figure by <hi>h. i.)</hi> being upon this occaſion ſet before the Tables of the Secretarys at the upper end N. N. the white on the right hand, and the green on the leſt, the Secretarys on each ſide num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Balls: by which if they find that the Affirmatives amount not to above one half, they write not the Name that was balloted; but if they amount to above one half, they write it, adding the number of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half the Suffrages to which it attain'd. The firſt name being written, or laid aſide, the next that is put is B. B. nam'd to be Strategus in the ſecond Order; the third C. C. nam'd to be Strategus in the third Order; the fourth D. D. nam'd to be Strategus in the fourth Order: and he of theſe four Competitors that has moſt above half in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, is the Magiſtrat; or if none of them attain to above half, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination for that Magiſtracy is to be repeated by ſuch new Electors as ſhall be choſen at the next Ballot. And ſo, as is exemplify'd in the firſt Magiſtracy, procedes the Ballot of the reſt; firſt in the firſt, then in the ſecond, and ſo in the third and fourth Orders.</p>
                  <p>NOW wheras it may happen that A. A. (for example) being nam'd Strategus in the firſt Order, may alſo be nam'd to the ſame or ſom one or more other Magiſtracys in one or more of the other Orders; his name is firſt balloted where it is firſt written, that is, to the more worthy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, wherof if he miſſes, he is balloted as it coms in courſe for the next, and ſo for the reſt, if he miſſes of that, as often as he is nam'd.</p>
                  <p>AND becauſe to be nam'd twice or oftner, whether to the ſame or ſom other Magiſtracy, is the ſtronger recommendation; the note muſt not fail to be given upon the name, at the propoſition, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; A. A. <hi>nam'd to be Strategus in the firſt, and in the ſecond Order:</hi> or A. A. <hi>nam'd to be Strategus in the firſt and the third; in the firſt and the fourth,</hi> &amp;c. But if he be nam'd to the ſame Magiſtracy in the firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third, and fourth Orders, he can have no Competitor; wherfore attaining to above half the Suffrages, he is the Magiſtrat. Or thus: A. A. <hi>nam'd to be Strategus in the firſt, to be Cenſor in the ſecond, to be Orator in the third, and to be Commiſſioner of the Seal in the fourth Order,</hi> or the like in more or fewer Orders: In which caſes if he miſſes of the firſt Magiſtracy, he is balloted to the ſecond; if he miſſes of the ſecond, to the third; and if he miſſes of the third, to the fourth</p>
                  <p>THE Ballot not finiſh'd before Sunſet, tho the Election of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats already choſen be good, voids the Election of ſuch Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors as being choſen are not yet furniſh'd with Magiſtracys, as if they had never bin nam'd (for this is no Jugling Box, but an Art that muſt ſee the Sun) and the Ballot for the remaining Magiſtracys is to be repeated the next day by new Orders of Electors, and ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors as by them ſhall be elected. And ſo in the like manner, if of all the names propos'd to the ſame Magiſtracy, no one of them attains to above half the Suffrages in the Affirmative.</p>
                  <p>THE Senatorian Ballot of <hi>Oceana</hi> being thus deſcrib'd, thoſe of the Pariſh, of the Hundred, and of the Tribe, being ſo little different, that in this they are all contain'd, and by this may be eaſily underſtood,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49467:87"/>
are yet fully deſcrib'd, and made plain enough before in the 5<hi>th,</hi> 6<hi>th,</hi> 7<hi>th,</hi> 8<hi>th,</hi> 9<hi>th,</hi> and 10<hi>th</hi> Orders.</p>
                  <p>THIS therfore is the general Order, whence thoſe branches of the Ballot, ſom wherof you have already ſeen, are deriv'd; which, with thoſe that follow, were all read and debated in this place at the Inſtitution. When my Lord EPIMONUS DE GARRULA, being one of the Counſillors, and having no farther patience (tho the Rules were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the Agent of this Commonwealth, reſiding for that purpoſe at <hi>Venice)</hi> than to hear the direction for the Pariſhes, ſtood up and made way for himſelf in this manner.</p>

                                 <q>UNDER correction of Mr. PEREGRIN SPY, our very learn'd Agent and Intelligencer, I have ſeen the World a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>Venice,</hi> and (as Gentlemen are permitted to do) the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil balloting. And truly I muſt needs ſay, that it is for a dumb ſhew the goodlieſt that I ever beheld with my eys. You ſhould have ſom would take it ill, as if the noble <hi>Venetians</hi> thought themſelves too good to ſpeak to ſtrangers, but they obſerv'd them not ſo narrowly. The truth is, they have nothing to ſay to their Acquaintance; or Men that are in Council ſure would have Tongues: For a Council, and not a word ſpoken in it, is a contradiction. But there is ſuch a pudder with their marching and countermarching, as, tho never a one of them draw a Sword, you would think they were training; which till I found that they did it only to entertain ſtrangers, I came from among them as wiſe as I went thither. But in the Parlament of <hi>Oceana</hi> you had no Balls, nor Dancing, but ſober Converſation; a man might know and be known, ſhew his parts, and improve 'em. And now if you take the advice of this ſame fellow, you will ſpoil all with his whimſys. <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi>—Cry you mercy, my Lord ARCHON, I mean; Set the wiſeſt man of your Houſe in the Great Council of <hi>Venice,</hi> and you will not know him from a fool. Wheras nothing is more certain, than that flat and dull fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the judgment of all ſuch as us'd to keep company with them before, upon election into our Houſe, have immediatly chitted like Barly in the fat, where it acquires a new Spirit, and ſlow'd forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Language, that I am as confident as I am here, if there were not ſuch as delight to abuſe us, is far better than TULLYS; Or, let any body but tranſlate one of his Orations, and ſpeak it in the Houſe, and ſee if every body do not laugh at him. This is a great matter, <hi>Mr. Speaker;</hi> they do not cant it with your Booklearning, your Orbs, your Centers, your prime Magnitudes, and your Nebulones, things I profeſs that would make a ſober man run ſtark mad to hear 'em; while we, who ſhould be conſidering the Honor of our Country, and that it gos now or never upon our hand, whether it ſhall be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to all the World, are going to Nineholes, or trow Madam for our buſineſs, like your dumb <hi>Venetian,</hi> whom this ſame Sir POLITIC your Reſident, that never ſaw him do any thing but make faces, would inſinuat into you, at this diſtance, to have the only knack of State. Wheras if you ſhould take the pains, as I have don, to look a little nearer, you would find theſe ſame wonderful
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49467:87"/>
things to be nothing elſe but mere natural Fopperys, or <hi>Capricios,</hi> as they call them in <hi>Italian,</hi> even of the meaneſt of that Nation. For, put the caſe you be travelling in <hi>Italy,</hi> ask your <hi>Contadino,</hi> that is, the next Country fellow you meet, ſom queſtion, and preſently he ballots you an anſwer with a nod, which is affirmative; or a ſhake with his head, which is the negative box; or a ſhrug with his ſhoulder, which is the <hi>Boſſolo di non ſinceri.</hi>—Good! You will admire SANDS for telling you, that <hi>Grotta di Cane</hi> is a Miracle: and I ſhall be laugh'd at for aſſuring you, that it is nothing elſe but ſuch a damp (continu'd by the neighborhood of certain Sulphur Mines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) as thro accidental heat dos ſomtimes happen in our Coalpits. But Ingratitude muſt not diſcorage an honeſt man from doing good. There is not, I ſay, ſuch a tonguety'd Generation under Heaven as your <hi>Italian;</hi> that you ſhould not wonder if he makes ſigns. But our People muſt have ſomthing in their Diurnals, we muſt ever and anon be telling 'em our minds; or if we be at it when we raiſe Taxes, like thoſe Gentlemen with the finger and the thumb, they will ſwear that we are Cutpurſes.—Com, I know what I have heard 'em ſay, when ſom men had mony that wrought hard enough for it; and do you conceive they will be better pleas'd when they ſhall be told, that upon like occaſions you are at mumchance or ſtoolball? I do not ſpeak for my ſelf; for tho I ſhall always acknowlege, that I got more by one years ſitting in the Houſe, than by my three years Travels, it was not of that kind. But I hate that this ſame SPY, for pretending to have play'd at Billiards with the moſt Serene Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhould make ſuch fools of us here, when I know that he muſt have had his intelligence from ſom Corncutter upon the <hi>Rialta;</hi> for a noble <hi>Venetian</hi> would be hang'd if he ſhould keep ſuch a fellow company. And yet if I do not think he has made you all dote, never truſt me, my Lord ARCHON is ſomtimes in ſuch ſtrange Raptures. Why, good my Lord, let me be heard as well as your Apple Squire; <hi>Venice</hi> has freſh blood in her Cheeks, I muſt confeſs, yet ſhe is but an old Lady. Nor has he pick'd her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet; theſe he ſends you are none of her Receits I can aſſure you, he bought them for a <hi>Julio</hi> at St. <hi>Marcs</hi> of a Mountebank. She has no other waſh, upon my knowledge, for that ſame envy'd Complexion of hers but her <hi>Marſhes,</hi> being a little better ſcented, ſaving your preſence, than a Chamberpot. My Lords, I know what I ſay, but you will never have don with it, That neither the Great <hi>Turc,</hi> nor any of thoſe little <hi>Turcs</hi> her Neighbors, have bin able to ſpoil her! Why you may as well wonder that Weeſels do not ſuck egs in Swans neſts. Do you think that it has lain in the devotion of her Beads; which you that have puk'd ſo much at Popery, are now at length reſolv'd ſhall conſecrat <hi>M. Parſon,</hi> and be drop'd by every one of his Congregation, while thoſe ſame whimſical Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces your Surveyors (you will break my heart) give the turn to your <hi>primum mobile?</hi> and ſo I think they will; for you will find, that Mony is the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> and they will turn you thus out of ſom three or four hundred thouſand Pounds: a pretty Sum for Urns and Balls, for Boxes and Pills, which theſe ſame Quackſalvers are to adminiſter to the Pariſhes; and for what Diſeaſe I marvel! Or how dos it work? Out coms a Conſtable, an Overſeer, and a Churchwarden! <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> I am amaz'd!</q>

For, firſt, wheras they are abominable liars, he has not told you (except ſom mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious body has miſinform'd him concerning poor SPY) one ſyllable of falſhood. And, ſecondly, wheras they never fail to give the upper hand in all their Diſcourſes to foren Nations, ſtill juſtling their own into the kennel; he bears an Honor to his Country that will not diſſolve in <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> nor be corrupted with Figs and Melons, which I can aſſure you is no ordinary obligation: And therfore hold it a matter of public concern, that we be no occaſion of quenching my Lord's Affections; nor is there any ſuch great matter between us, but in my opinion might be eaſily reconcil'd: for tho that which my Lord gain'd by ſitting in the Houſe, I ſtedfaſtly believe, as he can affirm, was got fairly; yet dare I not, nor do I think, that upon conſideration he will promiſe ſo much for other Gameſters, eſpecially when they were at it ſo high, as he intimats not only to have bin in uſe, but to be like enough to com about again. Wherfore, ſay I, let them throw with boxes; for unleſs we will be below the Politics of an ordinary, there is no ſuch bar to cogging. It is known to his Lordſhip, that our Game is <hi>moſt at a throw,</hi> and that every caſt of our Dice is in our Suffrages; nor will he deny, that partiality in a Suffrage is downright cogging. Now if the <hi>Venetian</hi> Boxes be the moſt ſoverain of all Remedys againſt this ſame cogging, is it not a ſtrange thing that they ſhould be thrown firſt into the fire by a fair Gameſter? Men are naturally ſubject to all kinds of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: Som you have that are not able to withſtand the brow of an Enemy; and others that make nothing of this, are leſs proof againſt that of a Friend. So that if your Suffrage be bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd, I dare ſay you ſhall not have one fair caſt in twenty. But whatever a man's fortune be at the box, he neither knows whom to thank, nor whom to challenge. Wherfore (that my Lord may have a charitable opinion of the choice Affection which I confeſs to have, above all other Beautys, for that of incomparable <hi>Venice)</hi> there is in this way of Suffrage no leſs than a demonſtration that it is the moſt pure: and the purity of the Suffrage in a popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is the Health, if not the Life of it; ſeeing the Soul is no otherwiſe breath'd into the Soverain Power, than by the Suffrage of the People. Wherfore no wonder if POSTELLUS be of opinion, that this uſe of the Ball is the very ſame with that of the Bean in <hi>Athens;</hi> or, that others, by the Text concerning ELDAD and MEDAD, derive it from the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> There is another thing, tho not ſo material to us, that my Lord will excuſe me if I be not willing to yield, which is, that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> ſubſiſts only by her Situation. It is true, that a man in time of War may be more ſecure from his Enemys by being in a Citadel, but not from his Diſeaſes: wherfore the firſt cauſe, if he lives long,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49467:88"/>
is his good Conſtitution, without which his Citadel were to little purpoſe;</q> and it is not otherwiſe with <hi>Venice.</hi>

Every Monday morning in the Summer at ſeven, and in the Winter at eight, the great Bell in the Clockhouſe at the <hi>Pantheon</hi> begins, and continues ringing for the ſpace of one hour: in which time the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats of the Senat, being attended according to their Quality, with a reſpective number of the Ballotins, Doorkeepers, and Meſſengers; and having the Enſigns of their Magiſtracys born before them, as the Sword before the Strategus, the Mace before the Orator, a Mace with the Seal before the Commiſſioners of the Chancery, the like with the Purſe before the Commiſſioners of the Treaſury; and a Silver Wand, like thoſe in uſe with the Univerſitys, before each of the Cenſors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chancellors of the ſame. Theſe with the Knights, in all three hundred, aſſemble in the Houſe or Hall of the Senat.</p>
                  <p>THE Houſe or Hall of the Senat, being ſituated in the <hi>Pantheon</hi> or Palace of Juſtice, is a Room conſiſting of a Square and a half. In the middle of the lower end is the Door; at the upper end hangs a rich State overſhadowing the greater part of a large Throne, or half pace of two Stages; the firſt aſcended by two ſteps from the floor, and the ſecond about the middle riſing two ſteps higher. Upon this ſtand two Chairs, in that on the right hand ſits the Strategus, in the other the Orator, adorn'd with Scarlet Robes, after the faſhion that was us'd by the Dukes in the Ariſtocracy. At the right end of the upper Stage ſtand three Chairs, in which the three Commiſſioners of the Seal are plac'd; and at the other end ſit the three Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, every one in a Robe or Habit like that of the Earls. Of theſe Magiſtrats of this upper Stage conſiſts the Signory. At either end of the lower Stage ſtands a little Table, to which the Secretarys of the Senat are ſet with their tuſted Sleeves in the habit of civil Lawyers. To the four ſteps, wherby the two Stages of the Throne are aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, anſwer four long Benches, which ſucceſſively deriving from every one of the ſteps, continue their reſpective height, and extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the ſide Walls towards the lower end of the Houſe, every Bench being divided by numeral Characters into the thirty ſeven parts or places. Upon the upper benches ſit the Cenſors in the Robes of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons; the firſt in the middle of the right hand bench, and the ſecond directly oppoſit to him on the other ſide. Upon the reſt of the Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſit the Knights, who if they be call'd to the Urns, diſtributing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49467:89"/>
themſelves by the Figures, com in equal files, either by the firſt Seat, which conſiſts of the two upper Benches on either ſide; or by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Seat, conſiſting of the two lower Benches on either ſide: begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alſo at the upper, or at the lower ends of the ſame, according to the Lot wherby they are call'd; for which end the Benches are open, and aſcended at either end with eaſy ſtairs and large paſſages. The reſt of the Ballot is conformable to that of the Tribe; the Cenſors of the Houſe ſitting at the ſide Urns, and the youngeſt Magiſtrat of the Signory at the middle: the Urns being plac'd before the Throne, and prepar'd according to the number of the Magiſtrats to be at that time choſen by the Rules already given to the Cenſors of the Tribes. But before the Benches of the Knights on either ſide ſtands one being ſhorter; and at the upper end of this ſit the two Tribuns of the Horſe. At the upper end of the other, the two Tribuns of the Foot in their Arms; the reſt of the Benches being cover'd by the Judges of the Land in their Robes. But theſe Magiſtrats have no Suffrage, nor the Tribuns, tho they derive their preſence in the Senat from the <hi>Romans;</hi> nor the Judges, tho they derive theirs from the antient Senat of <hi>Oceana.</hi> Every Monday this Aſſembly ſits of courſe; at other times, if there be occaſion, any Magiſtrat of the Houſe by giving order for the Bell, or by his Lictor or Enſignbearer, calls a Senat. And every Magiſtrat or Knight during his Seſſion has the Title, Place, and Honor of a Duke, Earl, Baron, or Knight, reſpectively. And every one that has born the ſame Magiſtracy by his third Seſſion, has his reſpective Place and Title during the term of his Life, which is all the Honor confer'd by this Commonwealth, except upon the Maſter of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonys, the Maſter of the Horſe, and the King of the Heralds, who are Knights by their places. And thus you have the face of the Senat, in which there is ſcarce any Feature that is not <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian;</hi> nor do the Horns of the Creſcent extend themſelves much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like thoſe of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> on either hand of the Prince, and of the Father of that Senat. But upon Beauty, in which every Man has his phanſy, we will not otherwiſe philoſophize than to remember that there is ſomthing more than decency in the Robe of a Judg, that would not be well ſpar'd from the Bench; and that the graveſt Magiſtrat, to whom you can commit the Sword of Juſtice, will find a quickneſs in the Spurs of Honor, which if they be not laid to Virtue, will lay themſelves to that which may rout a Commonwealth.</p>

As, firſt, by the annual Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of five Knights out of the third Region of the Senat, into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, conſisting of fifteen Knights, five in every Region. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">Of the Council of War.</note>By the annual Election of three Knights out of the third Region of the Council of State, to be propos'd by the Provoſts, and elected by that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, into the Council of War, conſisting of nine Knights, three in every Region, not excluded by this Election from remaining Members alſo of the Council of State. The four Tribuns of the People have right of Seſſion <note place="margin">Of the Council of Religion.</note>and Suffrage in the Council of War. Thirdly, By the annual Election of four Knights out of the third Region of the Senat into the Council of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, conſisting of twelve Knights, four in every Region: Of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <note place="margin">Of the Council of Trade.</note>the Cenſors are Preſidents. Fourthly, By the annual Election of four Knights out of the third Region of the Senat into the Council of Trade, <note place="margin">Of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſts.</note>conſisting of twelve Knights, four in every Region. And each Region, in every one of theſe Councils thus conſtituted, ſhall weekly and interchangeably elect one Provoſt, whoſe Magiſtracy ſhall continue for one Week; nor ſhall he be reelected into the ſame, till every Knight of that Region in the ſame <note place="margin">Of the Council of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſts.</note>Council has once born the ſame Magiſtracy. And the Provoſts being one in every Region, three in every Council, and twelve in all, beſides their other Capacitys, ſhall aſſemble and be a Council, or rather an Academy apart, to certain ends and purpoſes to be hereafter further explain'd, with thoſe of the reſt of the Councils.</p>
                  <p>THIS Order is of no other uſe than for the frame and turn of the Councils, and yet of no ſmall one: for in Motion conſiſts Life; and the Motion of a Commonwealth will never be current, unleſs it be circular. Men that, like my Lord EPIMONUS, not induring the reſemblance of this kind of Government to Orbs and Spheres, fall on phyſicing and purging it, do no more than is neceſſary; for if it be not in Rotation both as to Perſons and Things, it will be very ſick. The People of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to Perſons, if they had not bin taken up by the Wheel of Magiſtracy, had overturn'd the Chariot of the Senat. And thoſe of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> as to Things, had not bin ſo quiet when the Senat traſh'd their Buſineſs, by incroaching upon the Reſult, if by the Inſtitution of the <hi>Ephors</hi> they had not brought it about again. So that if you allow not a Commonwealth her Rotation, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts her Equality, you reduce her to a Party, and then it is neceſſary that you be Phyſicians indeed, or rather Farriers; for you will have ſtrong Patients, and ſuch as muſt be halter'd and caſt, or your ſelves may need Boneſetters. Wherfore the Councils of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, both in regard of their Elections, and, as will be ſhewn, of their Affairs, are uniform with the Senat in their Revolutions; not as Whirlpits to ſwallow, but to bite, and with the Scrues of their Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to hold and turn a Buſineſs (like the Vice of a Smith) to the

                     <hi>THE ſeventeenth ORDER,</hi> directing biennial Elections, or the Conſtitution of the Orb of Ambaſſadors in ordinary, conſisting of four Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidences, the Revolution wherof is perform'd in eight years, and preſerv'd thro the Election of one Ambaſſador in two years by the Ballot of the Senat to repair to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and reſide there for the term of two years; and the term of two years being expir'd, to remove from thence to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> there to continue for the ſpace of two years, and thence to remove to the State of <hi>Venice;</hi> and after two years reſidence in that City, to conclude with his reſidence at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for a like term of time, and ſo to return. A Knight of the Senat, or a Deputy of the Prerogative, may not be elected Ambaſſador in Ordinary, becauſe a Knight or Deputy ſo choſen, muſt either loſe his Seſſion, which would cauſe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſs in the motion of this Commonwealth, or accumulat Magiſtracy, which agrees not with the equality of the ſame.

For Example, if there be occaſion of an Ambaſſador Extraordinary, the Provoſts of the Council of State, or any two of them ſhall propoſe to the ſame, till one Competitor be choſen by that Council: and the Council having choſen a Competitor, ſhall bring his name into the Senat, which in the uſual way ſhall chuſe four more Competitors to the ſame Magiſtracy; and put them, with the Competitor of the Council, to the Ballot of the Houſe, by which he of the five that is choſen is ſaid to be elected by the Scrutiny of the Council of State. A Vice-Admiral, a Polemarch, or Field Officer, ſhall be elected after the ſame manner, by the Scrutiny of the Council of War.

                                 <q>YOUR Councils, except the Dictator only, are proper and native Springs and Sources, you ſee, which (hanging a few ſticks and ſtraws, that, as leſs conſiderable, would otherwiſe be more troubleſom, upon the banks of their peculiar Channels) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the full ſtream of buſineſs into the Senat, ſo pure, and ſo far from the poſſibility of being troubl'd or ſtain'd (as will undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly appear by the Courſe contain'd in the inſuing Order) with any kind of privat Intereſt or Partiality, that it ſhall never be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any Aſſembly hearkning to the advice or information of this or that worthy Member (either inſtructed upon his Pillow, or while he was making himſelf ready, or by the Petition or Ticket which he receiv'd at the door) to have half the Security in his Faith, or advantage by his Wiſdom; ſuch a Senat or Council being, thro the incertainty of the Winds, like a wave of the Sea. Nor ſhall it otherwiſe mend the matter by flowing up into dry ditches, or referring buſineſſes to be better examin'd by Committees, than to go further about with it to leſs purpoſe; if it dos not eb back again with the more mud in it. For in a caſe refer'd to an occaſional Committee, of which any Member that is deſirous may get himſelf nam'd, and to which no body will com, but either for the ſake of his Friend, or his own Intereſt; it fares little better as to the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Senat, than if it had bin refer'd to the Partys. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Athenians</hi> being diſtributed into four Tribes, out of which by equal numbers they annually choſe four hundred Men, call'd <hi>the Senat of the Bean</hi> (becauſe the Ballot at their Election was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the uſe of Beans) divided them by Fiftys into eight parts. And every Fifty in their turn, for one eighth part of the year, was a Council apart call'd the <hi>Prytans.</hi> The <hi>Prytans</hi> in their diſtinct Council receiving all Comers, and giving ear to every Man that had any thing to propoſe concerning the Commonwealth,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49467:93"/>
had power to debate and prepare all the buſineſſes that were to be introduc'd into the Senat. The <hi>Achaeans</hi> had ten ſelected Magiſtrats call'd the <hi>Demiurgs,</hi> conſtituting a Council apart call'd the <hi>Synarchy,</hi> which with the <hi>Strategus</hi> prepar'd all the buſineſs that was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into their Senat. But both the Senat of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and that of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> would have wonder'd if a Man had told them, that they were to receive all Comers and Diſcourſes, to the end that they might refer them afterwards to the <hi>Prytans</hi> or the <hi>Synarchy;</hi> much leſs to an occaſional Committee, expos'd to the catch that catch may of the Partys intereſted. And yet <hi>Venice</hi> in this, as in moſt of her Orders, excels them all by the Conſtitution of her Councils, that of the College, and the other of the <hi>Dieci,</hi> or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Ten. The courſe of the College is exactly deſcrib'd in the inſuing Order: And for that of the <hi>Dieci,</hi> it ſo little differs from what it has beſtow'd upon our <hi>Dictator,</hi> that I need not make any particular deſcription of it. But to <hi>Dictatorian</hi> Power in general, and the uſe of it, becauſe it muſt needs be of difficult digeſtion to ſuch as, puking ſtill at antient Prudence, ſhew themſelves to be in the Nurſery of Motherwit; it is no leſs than neceſſary to ſay ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And, Firſt, in a Commonwealth that is not wrought up, or perfected, this Power will be of very frequent, if not continual uſe; wherfore it is ſaid more than once, upon defects of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the Book of <hi>Judges, That in thoſe days there was no King in</hi> Iſrael. Nor has the Tranſlator, tho for <hi>no King</hi> he ſhould have ſaid <hi>no Judg,</hi> abus'd you ſo much; ſeeing that the Dictator (and ſuch was the <hi>Judg of Iſrael)</hi> or the Dictatorian Power being in a ſingle Perſon, ſo little differs from Monarchy, which follow'd in that, that from the ſame cauſe there has bin no other effect in any Commonwealth; as in <hi>Rome</hi> was manifeſt by SYLLA and CESAR, who to make themſelves Abſolute or Soverain, had no more to do than to prolong their Magiſtracy; for <note n="*" place="bottom">Dictatoris imperium quaſi Numen. <hi>Liv.</hi>
                                    </note>the Dictatorian Power was reputed Divine, and therfore irreſiſtible. Nevertheleſs, ſo it is, that without this Power, which is ſo dangerous, and ſubject to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Monarchy, a Commonwealth cannot be ſafe from falling into the like diſſolution; unleſs you have an Expedient in this caſe of your own, and bound up by your Providence from recoiling. Expedients in ſom caſes you muſt not only have, but be beholden for them to ſuch whom you muſt truſt at a pinch, when you have not leiſure to ſtand with them for Security; which will be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more dangerous. And there can never be a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth otherwiſe than by the Order in debate wrought up to that perfection; but this neceſſity muſt ſomtimes happen in regard of her natural ſlowneſs and openneſs, and the ſuddenneſs of Aſſaults that may be made upon her, as alſo the Secrecy which in ſom caſes may be of abſolute neceſſity to her Affairs. Whence MACCHIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEL concludes it poſitively, That a Commonwealth unprovided of ſuch a Refuge, muſt fall to ruin: for her courſe is either broken by the blow in one of thoſe caſes, or by her ſelf, while it ſtartles her out of her Orders. And indeed a Commonwealth is like a Greyhound, which having once coaſted, will never after run fair, but grow ſlothful; and when it coms to make a common practice
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49467:93"/>
of taking nearer ways than its Orders, it is diſſolv'd: for the being of a Commonwealth conſiſts in its Orders. Wherfore at this lift you will be expos'd to danger, if you have not provided before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand for the ſafety of your Reſort in the like caſes: nor is it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that your Reſort be ſafe, unleſs it be as ſecret and quick; for if it be ſlow or open, your former Inconveniences are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy'd. Now for our imitation in this part, there is nothing in experience like that of the Council of Ten in <hi>Venice;</hi> the benefit wherof would be too long to be ſhewn in the whole piece, and therfore I ſhall take but a pattern out of JANOTTI. In the War, ſays he, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had with <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Caſentin,</hi> the <hi>Florentins</hi> finding a neceſſity in their affairs far from any other incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in themſelves to ask their Peace, ſent Ambaſſadors about it to <hi>Venice,</hi> where they were no ſooner heard, than the bargain was ſtruck up by the Council of Ten: and every body admiring (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Commonwealth ſtood upon the higher ground) what ſhould be the reaſon of ſuch haſt; the Council upon the return of the Ambaſſadors imparted Letters to the Senat, wherby it appear'd, that the <hi>Turc</hi> had newly lanch'd a formidable Fleet againſt their State; which had it bin underſtood by the <hi>Florentins,</hi> it was well enough known they would have made no Peace. Wherfore the ſervice of the Ten was highly applauded by the Senat, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Wherby may appear, not only in part what uſe there is of Dictatorian Power in that Government, but that it is aſſum'd at the diſcretion of that Council; wheras in this of <hi>Oceana</hi> it is not otherwiſe intruſted than when the Senat, in the Election of nine Knights extraordinary, gives at once the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and takes ſecurity in a balance, added to the Council of War, tho ſecurer before by the Tribuns of the People than that of <hi>Venice,</hi> which yet never incur'd Jealouſy: For if the younger Nobility have bin often girding at it, that happen'd not ſo much thro the apprehenſion of danger in it to the Commonwealth, as thro the aw of it upon themſelves. Wherfore the Graver have doubtleſly ſhewn their Prudence in the Law; wherby, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy of theſe Counſillors being to laſt till their Succeſſors be created,</q> the Council is eſtabliſh'd.</p>

                     <hi>THE twentieth ORDER,</hi> containing the Method of Debates to be obſerv'd by the Magiſtrats and the Councils ſucceſſively, in order to a Decree of the Senat.</p>
                  <p>THE Magiſtrats of the Signory, as Counſillors of this Commonwealth, ſhall take into their conſideration all matters of State, or of Government; and, having right to propoſe in any Council, may any one or more of them propoſe what buſineſs he or they pleaſe in that Council to which it moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs. And, that the Councils may be held to their duty, the ſaid Magiſtrats are ſuperintendents and inſpectors of the ſame, with right to propoſe to the Senat.</p>
                  <p>THE Cenſors have equal Power with theſe Magiſtrats, but in relation to the Council of Religion only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:49467:94"/>
ANY two of the three Provoſts in every Council may propoſe to, and are the more peculiar Propoſers of, the ſame Council; to the end that there be not only an inſpection and ſuperintendency of buſineſs in general, but that every work be alſo committed to a peculiar hand.</p>
                  <p>ANY one or more of the Magiſtrats, or any two of the Provoſts reſpectively having propos'd, the Council ſhall debate the buſineſs ſo propos'd, to which they of the third Region that are willing ſhall ſpeak firſt in their order; they of the ſecond, next; and they of the firſt, laſt: and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of thoſe that propos'd or ſpoke, as they ſhall be thought the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable by the Council, ſhall be taken by the Secretary of the ſame in writing, and each of them ſign'd with the name of the Author.</p>
                  <p>THE Opinions being thus prepar'd, any Magiſtrat of the Signory, the Cenſor, or any two of the Provoſts of that Council, upon this occaſion may aſſemble the Senat.</p>
                  <p>THE Senat being aſſembled, the Opinions (for example, if they be four) ſhall be read in their Order, that is, according to the Order or Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Magiſtrats or Counſillors by which they were ſign'd. And being read, if any of the Council introducing them will ſpeak, they, as beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the buſineſs, ſhall have precedence; and after them the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators ſhall ſpeak according to their Regions, beginning by the third firſt, and ſo continuing till every man that will has ſpoken: and when the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have bin ſufficiently debated, they ſhall be put all together to the Ballot after this manner.</p>
                  <p>FO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R Secretarys carrying each of them one of the Opinions in one hand, with a white Box in the other, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ach following the other, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order of the Opinions, ſhall preſent his Box, naming the Author of his Opinion to every Senator; and one Secretary or Ballotin with a green Box ſhall follow the four white ones; and one Secretary or Ballotin with a red Box ſhall follow the green one: and every Senator ſhall put one Ball into ſom one of theſe ſix boxes. The Suffrage being gather'd and open'd before the Signory, if the red Box or <hi>Nonſincere</hi> had above half the Suffrages, the Opinions ſhall he all caſt out, for the major part of the Houſe is not clear in the buſineſs. If no one of the four Opinions had above half the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages in the Affirmative, that which had feweſt ſhall be caſt out, and the other three ſhall be balloted again. If no one of the three had above half, that which had feweſt ſhall be caſt out, and the other two ſhall ballot again. If nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two had above half, that which had feweſt ſhall be caſt out, and the remaining Opinion ſhall be balloted again. And if the remaining Opinion has not above half, it ſhall alſo be caſt out. But the firſt of the Opinions that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at moſt above half in the Affirmative, is the Decree of the Senat. The Opinions being all of them caſt out by the <hi>Nonſincere,</hi> may be review'd, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion permits, by the Council, and brought in again. If they be caſt out by the Negative, the caſe being of advice only, the Houſe approves not, and there is an end of it: the caſe being neceſſary, and admitting delay, the Council is to think again upon the buſineſs, and to bring in new Opinions; but the Caſe being neceſſary, and not admitting delay, the Senat immediatly electing the <hi>Juncta,</hi> ſhall create the Dictator. <note n="*" place="bottom">Et videat Dictator ne quid Reſpub. detrimenti capiat.</note>
                     <hi>And let the Dictator,</hi> as the Roman ſaying is, <hi>take care that the Commonwealth receives no harm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS in caſe the Debate concludes not in a Decree. But if a Decree be paſt, it is either in matter of State or Government according to Law enacted already, and then it is good without going any further: or it is in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49467:94"/>
matter of Law to be enacted, repeal'd, or amended; and then the Decree of the Senat, eſpecially if it be for a War, or for a Levy of Men or Mony, is invalid, without the reſult of the Commonwealth, which is in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Tribe, or Repreſentative of the People.</p>
                  <p>THE Senat having prepar'd a Decree to be propos'd to the People, ſhall appoint their Propoſers; and no other may propoſe for the Senat to the People but the Magiſtrats of the Houſe: that is to ſay, the three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Seal, or any two of them; the three of the Treaſury, or any two of them; or the two Cenſors.</p>
                  <p>THE Senat having appointed their Propoſers, ſhall require of the Tribuns a muſter of the People at a ſet time and place: and the Tribuns or any two of them having muſter'd the People accordingly, the Propoſers ſhall propoſe the Senſe or Decree of the Senat by clauſes to the People. And that which is propos'd by the Authority of the Senat, and reſolv'd by the Command of the People, is the Law of <hi>Oceana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO this Order, implicitly containing the ſum very near of the whole Civil part of the Commonwealth, my Lord ARCHON ſpoke thus in Council.</p>

                                 <q>THERE is a Saying, That a man muſt cut his Coat accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Cloth. When I conſider what God has allow'd or furniſh'd to our preſent work, I am amaz'd. You would have a popular Government, he has weigh'd it to you in the preſent ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, as I may ſay, to a dram; you have no more to do, but to fix it. For the Superſtructures of ſuch a Government, they require a good Ariſtocracy: and you have, or have had a Nobility or Gentry the beſt ſtudy'd, and the beſt Writers, at leaſt next that of <hi>Italy,</hi> in the whole World; nor have they bin inferior, when ſo exercis'd, in the leading of Armys. But the People are the main body of a Commonwealth; ſhew me from the Treaſurys of the Snow (as it is in JOB) to the burning Zone, a People whoſe ſhoulders ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally and ſo exactly fit the Corſlet. Nevertheleſs it were conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to be well provided with Auxiliarys. There is <hi>Marpeſia</hi> thro her fruitfulneſs inexhauſtible of men, and men thro her barrenneſs not only inur'd to hardſhip, but in your Arms. It may be ſaid, that <hi>Venice,</hi> excepting only that ſhe takes not in the People, is the moſt incomparable Situation of a Commonwealth. You are <hi>Venice</hi> taking in your People and your Auxiliarys too. My Lords, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were makers of Brick, before they were builders of a Commonwealth: But our brick is made, our Morter temper'd, the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon</hi> are hew'd and ſquar'd to our hands. Has this bin the work of man? or is it in man to withſtand this work? <hi>Shall he that contends with the Almighty, inſtruct him? He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves God, let him anſwer it.</hi> For our parts, every thing is ſo laid, that when we com to have uſe of it, it is the next at hand; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we can conceive that God and Nature do any thing in vain, there is no more for us to do but to diſpatch. The Piece, which we have reach'd to us in the foregoing Orders, is the Ariſtocracy. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> as has bin ſhewn, was plainly loſt thro the want of a good Ariſtocracy. But the ſufficiency of an Ariſtocracy gos demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upon the hand of the Nobility or Gentry: for that the Politics
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49467:95"/>
can be maſter'd without ſtudy, or that the People can have leiſure to ſtudy, is a vain imagination; and what kind of Ariſtocracy Divines and Lawyers would make, let their incurable running upon their own narrow biaſs, and their perpetual invectives againſt MACCHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AVEL (tho in ſom places juſtly reprovable, yet the only Politician, and incomparable Patron of the People) ſerve for inſtruction. I will ſtand no more to the Judgment of Lawyers and Divines in this work, than to that of ſo many other Tradeſmen; but if this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del chances to wander abroad, I recommend it to the <hi>Roman Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lativi</hi> (the moſt complete Gentlemen of this age) for their cenſure: or, with my Lord EPIMONUS his leave, ſend three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Copys to your Agent at <hi>Venice,</hi> to be preſented to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats there; and when they have conſider'd them, to be propos'd to the debate of the Senat, the moſt competent Judges under Heaven, who, tho they have great Affairs, will not refuſe to return you the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of their Ballot. The Counſillors of Princes I will not truſt; they are but Journymen. <hi>The Wiſdom of theſe later times in Princes Affairs</hi> (ſays VERULAMIUS) <hi>is rather fine deliverys and ſhiftings of dangers when they be near, than ſolid and grounded courſes to keep them off.</hi> Their Counſillors do not derive their procedings from any ſound root of Government that may contain the demonſtration, and aſſure the ſucceſs of them, but are expedient-mongers, givers of themſelves to help a lame dog over a ſtile; elſe how coms it to paſs, that the fame of Cardinal RICHLIEU has bin like Thunder, wherof we hear the noiſe, but can make no demonſtration of the reaſon? But to return, if neither the People, nor Divines, and Lawyers, can be the Ariſtocracy of a Nation, there remains only the Nobility; in which ſtile, to avoid farther repetition, I ſhall underſtand the Gentry alſo, as the <hi>French</hi> do by the word <hi>Nobleſſe.</hi>

                                 <q>NOBILITY may be defin'd divers ways; for it is either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Riches, or antient Virtue, or a Title confer'd by a Prince or a Commonwealth.</q>
                              </p>

                                 <q>NOBILITY of the firſt kind may be ſubdivided into two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſuch as hold an overbalance in Dominion or Property to the whole People, or ſuch as hold not an overbalance. In the former caſe, a Nobility (ſuch was the <hi>Gothic,</hi> of which ſufficient has bin ſpoken) is incompatible with popular Government; for to popular Government it is eſſential that Power ſhould be in the People, but the overbalance of a Nobility in Dominion draws the Power to themſelves. Wherfore in this ſenſe it is that MACCHIAVEL is to be underſtood, where he ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">Queſti tali ſono pernitioſi in ogni Republica, &amp; in ogni Provincia.</note>That theſe are pernicious in a Commonwealth; and of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> that they are
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49467:95"/>
Nations <note n="†" place="bottom">Lequali tutte inſieme ſono la corruttela del mondo.</note>which for this cauſe are the corruption of the World: for otherwiſe Nobility may according to his definition (which is, <hi>That they are ſuch as live upon their own Revenues in plenty, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement either to the tilling of their Lands, or other work for their livelihood)</hi> hold an underbalance to the People; in which caſe they are not only ſafe, but neceſſary to the natural mixture of a well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Commonwealth. For how elſe can you have a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth that is not altogether mechanic? or what compariſon is there of ſuch Commonwealths as are, or com neareſt to mechanic, for example, <hi>Athens, Switzerland, Holland,</hi> to <hi>Lacedemon, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> plum'd with their Ariſtocracys? Your Mechanics, till they have firſt fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd their neſts, like the Fowls of the Air, whoſe whole imployment is to ſeek their food, are ſo buſy'd in their privat concernments, that they have neither leiſure to ſtudy the public, nor are ſafely to be truſted with it, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Egeſtas haud ſacile habetur ſine damno.</note>becauſe a Man is not faithfully imbark'd in this kind of ſhip, if he has no ſhare in the freight. But if his ſhare be ſuch as gives him leiſure by his privat advantage to reflect upon that of the public, what other name is there for this ſort of Men, being <hi>a leur aiſe,</hi> but (as MACCHIAVEL you ſee calls them) NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BILITY? eſpecially when their Familys com to be ſuch as are noted for their Services don to the Commonwealth, and ſo take into their antient Riches antient Virtue, which is the ſecond definition of Nobility, but ſuch a one as is ſcarce poſſible in nature without the former. <hi>For as the Baggage,</hi> ſays VERULAMIUS, <hi>is to an Army, ſo are Riches to Virtue; they cannot be ſpar'd nor left behind, tho they be impediments, ſuch as not only hinder the march, but ſomtimes thro the care of them loſe or diſturb the Victory.</hi> Of this latter ſort is the Nobility of <hi>Oceana;</hi> the beſt of all others, becauſe they, having no ſtamp whence to derive their price, can have it no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by their intrinſic value. The third definition of Nobility, is a Title, Honor, or diſtinction from the People, confer'd or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the Prince or the Commonwealth. And this may be two ways, either without any ſtamp or privilege, as in <hi>Oceana;</hi> or with ſuch privileges as are inconſiderable, as in <hi>Athens</hi> after the battel of <hi>Plateae,</hi> whence the Nobility had no right, as ſuch, but to religious Offices, or inſpection of the public Games, to which they were alſo to be elected by the People: or with Privileges, and thoſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ones, as the Nobility in <hi>Athens</hi> before the battel of <hi>Plateae,</hi> and the <hi>Patricians</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> each of which had right, or claim'd it, to the Senat and all the Magiſtracys; wherin for ſom time they only by their ſtamp were current.</q>

Theſe MACCHIAVEL excepts from his rule, by ſaying, that their Eſtates are rather perſonal than real, or of any great revenue in Land; which coms to our account, and ſhews, that a Nobility or party of the Nobility, not overbalancing in Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not dangerous, but of neceſſary uſe in every Commonwealth, provided it be rightly order'd: for if it be ſo order'd as was that of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho they do not overbalance in the beginning, as they did not there, it will not be long ere they do, as is clear both in reaſon and experience towards the latter end.

Wherfore tho the Senat, to correct the temerity of the Lot, had power to caſt out ſuch as they ſhould judg unworthy of that honor; this related to manners only, and was not ſufficient to repair the Commonwealth, which by ſuch means became impotent: and foraſmuch as her Senat conſiſted not of the natural Ariſtocracy, which in a Commonwealth is the only ſpur and rein of the People, it was caſt headlong by the raſhneſs of her Demagogs or Grandees into ruin; while her Senat, like the <hi>Roman</hi> Tribuns (<note n="*" place="bottom">Qui ferè ſemper regebantur à multitudine magis quam regebant.</note> 
                                    <hi>who almoſt always, inſtead of governing, were rather govern'd by the multitude)</hi> propos'd not to the Reſult only, but to the Debate alſo of the People, who were therfore call'd to the Pulpits, where ſom vomited, and others drank poiſon.</q>

                                 <q>THE Senat of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> moſt truly diſcover'd by my Lord LACO DE SCYTALE, conſiſted but of 30 for life, wherof the two Kings having but ſingle Votes, were hereditary, the reſt elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the free Suffrage of the People, but out of ſuch as were ſixty years of age. Theſe had the whole debate of the Commonwealth in themſelves, and propos'd to the Reſult only of the People. And now the riddle which I have heretofore found troubleſom to unfold, is out; that is to ſay, why <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> conſiſting each of the Senat and the People, the one ſhould be held a Democracy, and the other an Ariſtocracy, or laudable Oligarchy, as it is term'd by ISOCRATES; for that word is not, wherever you meet it, to be branded, ſeeing it is us'd alſo by ARISTOTLE, PLUTARCH, and others, ſomtimes in a good ſenſe. The main difference was, that the People in this had the Reſult only, and in that the Debate and Reſult too. But for my part, where the People have the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Senat, not bound to a diſtinct order, and the Reſult, which is the Soverain Power, I hold them to have that ſhare in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (the Senat being not for life) wherof, with the ſafety of the Commonwealth, they are capable in nature; and ſuch a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that cauſe, to be Democracy: tho I do not deny, but in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> the paucity of the Senators conſider'd, it might be call'd <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> in compariſon of <hi>Athens;</hi> or, if we look on their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for life, tho they had bin more, <hi>Ariſtocracy.</hi>

Wherfore theſe, if they had their wills, would have reſolv'd as well as debated; which ſet the People at ſuch variance with them, as diſſolv'd the Commonwealth: wheras if the People had injoy'd the Reſult, that about the Agrarian, as well as all other ſtrife, muſt of neceſſity have ceas'd.</q>

To every one of which, becauſe ſomthing has bin already ſaid, I ſhall not ſpeak in particular. But in general, your Senat, and the other Aſſembly, or the Prerogative, as I ſhall ſhew in due place, are perpetual, not as Lakes or Puddles, but as the Rivers of <hi>Eden;</hi> and are beds made, as you have ſeen, to receive the whole People, by a due and faithful viciſſitude, into their current.

The Wars of later ages, ſays VERULAMIUS, ſeem to be made in the dark, in reſpect of the glory and honor which reflected on men from the Wars in antient times. Their ſhipping of this ſort was for Voyages, ours dare not lanch; nor lys it ſafe at home. Your <hi>Gothic</hi> Politicians ſeem to me rather to have invented ſom new Ammunition or Gunpowder, in their King and Parlament, than Government.

People, is obnoxious to every Spark. Nor ſhall any man ſhew a reaſon that will be holding in prudence, why the People of <hi>Oceana</hi> have blown up their King, but that their Kings did not firſt blow up them.

For at this rate you muſt always have two hundred knowing Men in the Government. And thus the Viciſſitude of your Senators is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable in the ſteadineſs and perpetuity of your Senat; which, like that of <hi>Venice,</hi> being always changing, is for ever the ſame. And tho other Politicians have not ſo well imitated their Pattern, there is nothing more obvious in Nature, ſeeing a Man who wears the ſame Fleſh but a ſhort time, is nevertheleſs the ſame Man, and of the ſame genius; and whence is this but from the conſtancy of Nature, in holding a Man to her Orders? Wherfore keep alſo to your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But this is a mean Requeſt, your Orders will be worth little, if they do not hold you to them; wherfore imbark.

                                 <q>IT is affirm'd by CICERO in his Oration for FLACCUS, that the Commonwealths of <hi>Greece</hi> were all ſhaken or ruin'd by the intemperance of their <hi>Comitia,</hi> or Aſſemblys of the People. The truth is, if good heed in this point be not taken, a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth will have bad legs. But all the world knows he ſhould have excepted <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> where the People, as has bin ſhewn by the Oracle, had no power at all of Debate, nor (till after LYSAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER, whoſe Avarice open'd a gulf, that was not long ere it ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up his Country) came it ever to be exercis'd by them. Whence that Commonwealth ſtood longeſt and firmeſt of any other, but this, in our days, of <hi>Venice:</hi> which having underlaid her ſelf with the like Inſtitution, ows a great, if not the greateſt part of her ſteddineſs to the ſame principle; the great Council, which is with her the People, by the Authority of my Lord EPIMONUS, never ſpeaking a word. Nor ſhall any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, where the People in their political capacity is talkative, ever ſee half the days of one of theſe: But being carry'd away by vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Men (that, as OVERBURY ſays, piſs more than they drink) ſwim down the ſtream; as did <hi>Athens,</hi> the moſt prating of theſe Dames, when that ſame ranting fellow ALCIBIADES fell a demagoging for the <hi>Sicilian</hi> War. But wheras Debate by the authority and experience of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the People in a well-order'd Government, it may be ſaid, That the Order ſpecify'd is but a ſlight bar in a matter of like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for ſo much as an Oath, if there be no recourſe upon the breach of it, is a weak ty for ſuch hands as have the Sword in them: wherfore what ſhould hinder the People of <hi>Oceana,</hi> if they happen not to regard an Oath, from aſſuming Debate, and making themſelves as much an Anarchy as thoſe of <hi>Athens?</hi> To which I anſwer, Take the common fort in a privat capacity, and, except they be injur'd, you ſhall find them to have a baſhfulneſs in the preſence of the better ſort, or wiſer Men; acknowleging their Abilitys by attention, and accounting it no mean honor to receive reſpect from them: But if they be injur'd by them, they hate them, and the more for being wife or great, becauſe that makes it the greater injury. Nor refrain they in this caſe from any kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance of Speech, if of Action. It is no otherwiſe with a People in their political capacity; you ſhall never find that they have aſſum'd Debate for it ſelf, but for ſomthing elſe. Wherfore in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon</hi> where there was, and in <hi>Venice</hi> where there is nothing elſe for which they ſhould aſſume it, they have never ſhewn ſo much as an inclination to it. Nor was there any appearance of ſuch a deſire in the People of <hi>Rome</hi> (who from the time of ROMULUS had bin very well contented with the power of Reſult either in the <note n="*" place="bottom">Comitiis Curiatis.</note>Parochial Aſſemblys, as it was ſettled upon them by him; or in the meetings of the <note n="†" place="bottom">Centuriatis.</note>Hundreds, as it was alter'd in their regard for the worſe by SERVIUS TULLIUS) till news was brought ſom fifteen years after the exile of TARQUIN their late King (during

Wherupon, but with the greateſt modeſty that was ever known in the like caſe, they firſt fell upon debate, affirming, <note n="†" place="bottom">Se foris pro libertate &amp; imperio dimicantes, domi à civibus captos &amp; oppreſſos eſſe: tutiorem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que in bello quam in pace, inter hoſtes quam inter cives, libertatem plebis eſſe.</note>

SERVILIUS being of another temper, thought it better and ſafer to try if the People might be bow'd than broken. But this debate was interrupted by tumultuous news of the near approach of the <hi>Volſci,</hi> a caſe in which the Senat had no recourſe but to the People, who contrary to their former cuſtom upon the like occaſions would not ſtir a foot, but fell a laughing, and ſaying, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Patres milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, patres arma caperent, ut penes eoſdem pericula belli, penes quos praemia, eſſent.</note>Let them fight that have ſomthing to fight for. The Senat that had purſes, and could not ſing ſo well before the Thief, being in a great perplexity, found no poſſible way out of it, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech SERVILIUS, one of a Genius well known to be popular, That he would accept of the Conſulſhip, and make ſom ſuch uſe of it as might be helpful to the <hi>Patrician</hi> Intereſt. SERVILIUS ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the Offer, and making uſe of his Intereſt with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, perſuaded them to hope well of the good intention of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whom it would little beſeem to be forc'd to thoſe things which would loſe their Grace, and that in view of the Enemy, if they came not freely; and withal publiſh'd an Edict, that no Man ſhould withhold a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> by impriſonment from giving his name (for that was the way, as I ſhall have opportunity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to ſhew more at large, wherby they drew out their Armys) nor to ſeize or ſell any man's Goods or Children that was in the Camp. Wherupon the People with a mighty concourſe immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took Arms, march'd forth, and (which to them was as eaſy as to be put into the humor, and that, as appears in this place, was not
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49467:100"/>
hard) totally defeated the <hi>Volſci</hi> firſt, then the <hi>Sabins</hi> (for the neighbor Nations, hoping to have had a good bargain of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in <hi>Rome,</hi> were up in arms on all ſides) and after the <hi>Sabins,</hi> the <hi>Aurunci.</hi> Whence returning victorious in three Battels, they expected no leſs than that the Senat would have made good their words: when APPIUS CLAUDIUS, the other Conſul, of his innate Pride, and that he might fruſtrat the Faith of his Collegue, caus'd the Soldiers (who being ſet at liberty, had behav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch valor) to be reſtor'd at their return to their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and their Goals. Great reſort upon this was made by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to SERVILIUS, ſhewing him their Wounds, calling him to witneſs how they had behav'd themſelves, and minding him of his promiſe. Poor SERVILIUS was ſorry, but ſo overaw'd with the headineſs of his Collegue, and the obſtinacy of the whole faction of the Nobility, that not daring to do any thing either way, he loſt both Partys: the Fathers conceiving that he was ambitious, and the People that he was falſe; while the Conſul CLAUDIUS continuing to countenance ſuch as daily ſeiz'd and impriſon'd ſom of the indebted People, had ſtill new and dangerous Controverſys with them, inſomuch that the Commonwealth was torn with horrid Diviſion, and the People (becauſe they found it not ſo ſafe, or ſo effectual in public) minded nothing but laying their heads together in privat Conventicles. For this AULUS VIRGINIUS, and TITUS VETUSIUS, the new Conſuls, were reprov'd by the Senat as ſlothful, and upbraided with the Virtue of APPIUS CLAUDIUS. Wherupon the Conſuls having deſir'd the Senat, that they might know their pleaſure, ſhew'd afterwards their readineſs to obey it, by ſummoning the People according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and requiring names wherby to draw forth an Army for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but no man would anſwer. Report hereof being made to the Senat, the younger ſort of the Fathers grew ſo hot with the Conſuls, that they deſir'd them to abdicat the Magiſtracy, which they had not the courage to defend.</q>

Nor was there leſs in the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49467:101"/>
Senat, being ſuddenly rally'd upon this occaſion, where they that receiv'd the repulſe, with others whoſe heads were as addle as their own, fell upon the buſineſs as if it had bin to be determin'd by cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, till the Conſuls, upbraiding the Senat that it differ'd not from the Marketplace, reduc'd the Houſe to Orders. And the Fathers having bin conſulted accordingly, there were three Opinions; PUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIUS VIRGINIUS conceiv'd, that the conſideration to be had upon the matter in queſtion, or aid of the indebted and impriſon'd People, was not to be further extended than to ſuch as had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd upon the promiſe made by SERVILIUS: TITUS LAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIUS, that it was no time to think it enough, if mens Merits were acknowleg'd, while the whole People, ſunk under the weight of their debts, could not emerge without ſom common aid; which to reſtrain, by putting ſom into a better condition than others, would rather more inflame the Diſcord than extinguiſh it. APPIUS CLAUDIUS (ſtill upon the old hant) would have it, that the People were rather wanton than fierce: It was not oppreſſion that neceſſitated, but their power that invited them to theſe freaks; the Empire of the Conſuls ſince the appeal to the People (wherby a Plebeian might ask his fellows if he were a Thief) being but a mere ſcarecrow. Go to, ſays he, let us create the Dictator, from whom there is no appeal, and then let me ſee more of this work, or him that ſhall forbid my Lictor. The advice of APPIUS was abhor'd by many; and to introduce a general reciſion of Debts with LARGIUS, was to violat all Faith: That of VIRGINIUS, as the moſt moderat, would have paſt beſt, but that there were privat Intereſts, that conſtant bane of the Public, which withſtood it. So they concluded with APPIUS, who alſo had bin Dictator, if the Conſuls and ſom of the graver ſort had not thought it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unſeaſonable, at a time when the <hi>Volſci</hi> and the <hi>Sabins</hi> were up again, to venture ſo far upon alienation of the People: for which cauſe VALERIUS, being deſcended from the PUBLICOLAS, the moſt popular Family, as alſo in his own perſon of a mild nature, was rather truſted with ſo rigid a Magiſtracy. Whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, that the People, tho they knew well enough againſt whom the Dictator was created, ſear'd nothing from VALERIUS; but upon a new promiſe made to the ſame effect with that of SERVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIUS, hop'd better another time, and throwing away all diſputes, gave their names roundly, went out, and, to be brief, came home again as victorious as in the former Action, the Dictator entring the City in Triumph. Nevertheleſs when he came to preſs the Senat to make good his promiſe, and do ſomthing for the eaſe of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they regarded him no more as to that point than they had don SERVILIUS. Wherupon the Dictator, in diſdain to be made a ſtale, abdicated his Magiſtracy, and went home. Here then was a victorious Army without a Captain, and a Senat pulling it by the beard in their Gowns. What is it (if you have read the Story, for there is not ſuch another) that muſt follow? Can any man imagin, that ſuch only ſhould be the opportunity upon which this People could run away? Alas, poor men, the <hi>Aequi</hi> and the <hi>Volſci,</hi> and the <hi>Sabins</hi> were nothing, but the Fathers invincible! There they ſat ſom three hundred of them arm'd all in Robes, and thundering with their Tongues, without any hopes in the earth to reduce them to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49467:101"/>
any tolerable conditions. Wherfore, not thinking it convenient to abide long ſo near them, away marches the Army, and incamps in the fields. This Retreat of the People is call'd the <hi>Seceſſion of Mount Aventin,</hi> where they lodg'd very ſad at their condition; but not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fall ſo much as a word of murmur againſt the Fathers. The Senat by this time were great Lords, had the whole City to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but certain Neighbors were upon the way that might com to ſpeak with them, not asking leave of the Porter. Wherfore their minds became troubl'd, and an Orator was poſted to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make as good conditions with them as he could; but, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the terms were, to bring them home, and with all ſpeed. And here it was covenanted between the Senat and the People, that theſe ſhould have Magiſtrats of their own Election, call'd the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buns;</hi> upon which they return'd.</q>

                                 <q>TO hold you no longer, the Senat having don this upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, made frequent attempts to retract it again; while the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buns on the other ſide, to defend what they had got, inſtituted their <hi>Tributa Comitia,</hi> or Council of the People; where they came in time, and, as Diſputes increas'd, to make Laws without the Authority of the Senat, call'd <hi>Plebiſcita.</hi> Now to conclude in the point at which I drive; ſuch were the ſteps wherby the People of <hi>Rome</hi> came to aſſume Debate: nor is it in Art or Nature to debar a People of the like effect, where there is the like cauſe. For ROMULUS having in the Election of his Senat ſquar'd out a Nobility for the ſupport of a Throne, by making that of the <hi>Patricians</hi> a diſtinct and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Order, planted the Commonwealth upon two contrary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts or Roots, which ſhooting forth in time produc'd two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, the one Oligarchical in the Nobility, the other a mere Anarchy of the People, and ever after caus'd a perpetual feud and enmity between the Senat and the People, even to death.</q>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49467:102"/>
and were not communicable to the People: nor did the Nobility by uſing them ill, ever give them a deſire to participat of the ſame. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from the Kings, whoſe Principality being plac'd in the midſt of the Nobility, had no greater means wherby to ſupport it ſelf, than to ſhield the People from all injury; whence the People not fearing Empire, deſir'd it not: And ſo all occaſion of enmity between the Senat and the People was taken away.

Whence they that were included in the Adminiſtration had right; and they that were excluded, coming afterwards, and being receiv'd upon no other conditions to be Inhabitants, had no wrong; and therfore had no occaſion, nor (being never truſted with Arms) any means to be tumultuous.

Nor is this to be help'd in a Commonwealth for increaſe, ſeeing if <hi>Rome</hi> had cut off the occaſion of her Tumults, ſhe muſt have cut off the means of her Increaſe, and by conſequence of her Greatneſs.</q>

                                 <q>IF he makes her for preſervation, ſhe may be quiet at home; but will be in danger abroad. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe her Foundation muſt be narrow, and therfore weak, as that of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> which lay but upon <hi>30000</hi> Citizens; or that of <hi>Venice,</hi> which lys but upon <hi>3000. Secondly,</hi> Such a Commonwealth muſt either be in Peace, or in War: If ſhe be in Peace, the Few are ſooneſt effeminated and corrupted, and ſo obnoxious alſo to Faction. If in War, ſucceding ill, ſhe is an eaſy prey; or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding well, ruin'd by increaſe: a weight which her Foundation is not able to bear. For <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> when ſhe had made her ſelf Miſtriſs, upon the matter, of all <hi>Greece,</hi> thro a ſlight accident, the Rebellion of <hi>Thebes,</hi> occaſion'd by the Conſpiracy of <hi>PELOPIDAS</hi> diſcovering this infirmity of her nature, the reſt of her conquer'd Citys immediatly fell off, and in the turn as it were of a hand reduc'd her from the fulleſt tide to the loweſt eb of her fortune. And <hi>Venice</hi> having poſſeſt her ſelf of a great part of <hi>Italy</hi> by her purſe, was no ſooner in defence of it put to the trial of Arms, than ſhe loſt all in one Battel.</q>

                                 <q>WHENCE I conclude, That in the Ordination of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth a Legiſlator is to think upon that which is moſt honorable; and laying aſide Models for Preſervation, to follow the example of <hi>Rome</hi> conniving at, and temporizing with the enmity between the Senat and the People, as a neceſſary ſtep to the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatneſs. For that any Man ſhould find out a balance that may take in the Conveniences, and ſhut out the Inconveniences of both, I do not think it poſſible. <hi>Theſe are the words of the Author, tho the method be ſomwhat alter'd, to the end that I may the better turn them to my purpoſe.</hi>

                                 <q>MY LORDS, I do not know how you hearken to this ſound; but to hear the greateſt Artiſt in the modern World, giving ſentence againſt our Commonwealth, is that with which I am nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. Wherfore, with all honor due to the Prince of Politicians, let us examin his reaſoning with the ſame liberty which he has aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the right of a free People. But we ſhall never com up to him, except by taking the buſineſs a little lower, we deſcend from effects to their cauſes. The cauſes of Commotion in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth are either external or internal. External are from Enemys, from Subjects, or from Servants. To diſpute then what was the cauſe why <hi>Rome</hi> was infeſted by the <hi>Italian,</hi> or by the Servil Wars; why the Slaves took the Capitol; why the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were near as frequently troubl'd with their Helots, as <hi>Rome</hi> with all thoſe; or why <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe Situation is not truſted to the faith of Men, has as good or better quarter with them whom ſhe governs, than <hi>Rome</hi> had with the <hi>Latins;</hi> were to diſpute upon external cauſes. The queſtion put by MACCHIAVEL is of internal cauſes; Whether the enmity that was beeween the Senat and the People of <hi>Rome</hi> might have bin remov'd. And to determin otherwiſe of this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than he dos, I muſt lay down other Principles than he has don. To which end I affirm, that a Commonwealth internally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, is either equal or inequal. A Commonwealth that is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally equal, has no internal cauſe of Commotion, and therfore can have no ſuch effect but from without. A Commonwealth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally inequal has no internal cauſe of quiet, and therfore can have no ſuch effect but by diverſion.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>TO prove my Aſſertions, I ſhall at this time make uſe of no other than his examples. <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was externally unquiet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was externally inequal, that is as to her <hi>Helots;</hi> and ſhe was internally at reſt, becauſe ſhe was equal in her ſelf, both in root and branch: In the root by her Agrarian, and in branch by the Senat, inaſmuch as no Man was therto qualify'd, but by election of the People. Which Inſtitution of LYCURGUS is mention'd <note place="margin">Ariſt. Polit. B. 2.</note>by ARISTOTLE, where he ſays, that rendering his Citizens emulous (not careleſs) of that honor, he aſſign'd to the People the election of the Senat. Wherfore MACCHIAVEL in this, as in other places, having his ey upon the diviſion of <hi>Patrician</hi> and <hi>Plebeian</hi> Familys as they were in <hi>Rome,</hi> has quite miſtaken the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this Commonwealth, where there was no ſuch thing. Nor did the quiet of it derive from the Power of the Kings, who were ſo far from ſhielding the People from the injury of the Nobility, of which there was none in his ſenſe but the Senat, that one declar'd end of the Senat at the inſtitution was to ſhield the People from the Kings, who from that time had but ſingle Votes. Neither did it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49467:103"/>
procede from the ſtraitneſs of the Senat, or their keeping the People excluded from the Government, that they were quiet, but from the equality of their adminiſtration, ſeeing the Senat (as is plain by the Oracle, their fundamental Law) had no more than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and the Reſult of the Commonwealth belong'd to the People. Wherfore when THEOPOMPUS and POLYDORUS Kings of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> would have kept the People excluded from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by adding to the antient Law this Clauſe, <hi>If the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People be faulty, it ſhall be lawful for the Senat to reſume the Debate;</hi> the People immediatly became unquiet, and reſum'd that Debate, which ended not till they had ſet up their <hi>Ephors,</hi> and caus'd that Magiſtracy to be confirm'd by their Kings. <note n="*" place="bottom">Nam cum primus inſtituiſſet Theopompus ut Ephori Lacedamone crearentur, ita futuri regiae poteſtati oppoſiti quemadmodum Romae Tribuni pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this was excellently ſaid; for that Power only is ſafe which is limited from doing hurt.</hi> THEOPOMPUS <hi>therfore, by confining the Kingly Power within the bounds of the Laws, did recommend it by ſo much to the Peoples Affection, as he remov'd it from being Arbitrary.</hi> By which it may appear, that a Commonwealth for preſervation, if ſhe coms to be inequal, is as obnoxious to enmity between the Senat and the People, as a Commonwealth for increaſe; and that the Tranquillity of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was deriv'd from no other cauſe than her Equality.</q>

                                 <q>FOR <hi>Venice,</hi> to ſay that ſhe is quiet becauſe ſhe diſarms her Subjects, is to forget that <hi>Lacedemon</hi> diſarm'd her <hi>Helots,</hi> and yet could not in their regard be quiet; wherfore if <hi>Venice</hi> be defended from external cauſes of Commotion, it is firſt thro her Situation, in which reſpect her Subjects have no hope (and this indeed may be attributed to her fortune) and, ſecondly, thro her exquiſit Juſtice, whence they have no will to invade her. But this can be attributed to no other cauſe than her Prudence; which will appear to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as we look nearer; for the effects that procede from Fortune, if there be any ſuch thing, are like their cauſe, inconſtant. But there never happen'd to any other Commonwealth ſo undiſturb'd and conſtant a Tranquillity and Peace in her ſelf, as is that of <hi>Venice;</hi> wherfore this muſt procede from ſom other cauſe than Chance. And we ſee that as ſhe is of all others the moſt quiet, ſo the moſt equal Commonwealth. Her Body conſiſts of one Order, and her Senat is like a rolling ſtone, as was ſaid, which never did, nor, while it continues upon that rotation, never ſhall gather the moſs of a divided or ambitious intereſt; much leſs ſuch a one as that which graſp'd the People of <hi>Rome</hi> in the talons of their own Eagles. And if MACCHIAVEL, averſe from doing this Commonwealth right, had conſider'd her Orders, as his Reader
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49467:103"/>
ſhall eaſily perceive he never did, he muſt have bin ſo far from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing the Prudence of them to Chance, that he would have touch'd up his admirable work to that perfection, which, as to the civil part, has no pattern in the univerſal World but this of <hi>Venice.</hi>

My LORDS, you that are Parents of a Commonwealth, and ſo freer Agents than ſuch as are merely natural, have a care. For, as no man ſhall ſhew me a Commonwealth born ſtreight, that ever became crooked; ſo, no man ſhall ſhew me a Commonwealth born crooked, that ever became ſtreight. <hi>Rome</hi> was crooked in her birth, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prodigious. Her twins the <hi>Patricians</hi> and <hi>Plebeian</hi> Orders came, as was ſhewn by the foregoing ſtory, into the World, one body but two heads, or rather two bellys: for, notwithſtanding the Fable out of AESOP, wherby MENENIUS AGRIPPA the Orator that was ſent from the Senat to the People at Mount <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> ſhew'd the Fathers to be the Belly, and the People to be the Arms and the Legs (which except that, how ſlothful ſoever it might ſeem, they were nouriſh'd, not theſe only, but the whole Body muſt languiſh and be diſſolv'd) it is plain, that the Fathers were a diſtinct Belly; ſuch a one as took the meat indeed out of the Peoples mouths, but abhorring the Agrarian, return'd it not in the due and neceſſary nutrition of a Commonwealth. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, as the People that live about the Cataracts of <hi>Nilus</hi> are ſaid not to hear the noiſe, ſo neither the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, nor MACCHIAVEL the moſt converſant with them, ſeem among ſo many of the Tribunitian ſtorms, to hear their natural voice: for tho they could not miſs of it ſo far as to attribute them to the ſtrife of the People for participation in Magiſtracy, or, in which MAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHIAVEL more particularly joins, to that about the Agrarian; this was to take the buſineſs ſhort, and the remedy for the diſeaſe.</q>

Thus the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho in their miſery they had recourſe by inſtinct, as it were, to the two main Fundamentals of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, participation of Magiſtracy, and the Agrarian, did but taſt and ſpit at them, not (which is neceſſary in Phyſic) drink down the potion, and in that their healths. For when they had obtain'd participation of Magiſtracy, it was but lamely, not to a full and equal Rotation in all Elections; nor did they greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it in what they had got. And when they had attain'd to the Agrarian, they neglected it ſo far as to ſuffer the Law to grow ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolete: but if you do not take the due doſe of your Medicins (as there be ſlight taſts which a man may have of Philoſophy that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to Atheiſm) it may chance to be poiſon, there being a like taſt of the Politics that inclines to Confuſion, as appears in the Inſtitution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Tribuns, by which Magiſtracy and no more, the People were ſo far from attaining to Peace, that they in getting but ſo much, got but heads for an eternal feud; wheras if
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49467:104"/>
they had attain'd in perfection either to the Agrarian, they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd the equality and calm of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> or to Rotation, and they had introduc'd that of <hi>Venice:</hi> And ſo there could have bin no more enmity between the Senat and the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> than there was between thoſe Orders in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> or is now in <hi>Venice.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore MACCHIAVEL ſeems to me, in attributing the Peace of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> more to her luck than her prudence, of the whole ſtable to have ſaddled the wrong Horſe; for tho <hi>Rome</hi>

And if a man conſiders the poſture that the People were in when they obtain'd their Tribuns, they might as well, and with as great eaſe (foraſmuch as the reaſon why the Nobility yielded to the Tribuns was no other, than that there was no remedy) have obtain'd any thing elſe.

Theſe alſo being exceding numerous, became bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom to themſelves, and dangerous to the Commonwealth; the more for their ill education, as is obſerv'd by XENOPHON and POLYBIUS, who compare them to Mariners that in a calm are perpetually diſputing and ſwaggering one with another, and never lay their hands to the common tackling or ſafety, till they be all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd by ſom ſtorm.

To this you may add, That wheras a Commonwealth, which in regard of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not of facility in execution, were ſure enough in this Nation to be caſt off thro impatience; your Muſters and Galaxys are given to the People, as milk to Babes, wherby when they are brought up thro four days election in a whole year (one at the Pariſh, one at the Hundred, and two at the Tribe) to their ſtrongeſt meat, it is of no harder digeſtion, than to give their. Negative or Affirmative as they ſee cauſe. There be gallant men among us that laugh at ſuch an Appeal or Umpire; but I refer it whether you be more inclining to pardon them or me, who I confeſs have bin this day laughing at a ſober man, but without meaning him any harm, and that is PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRUS CUNAEUS, where ſpeaking of the nature of the People, he ſays, that <hi>taking them apart, they are very ſimple, but yet in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblys they ſee and know ſomthing:</hi> and ſo runs away without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himſelf with what that ſomthing is. Wheras the People,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49467:105"/>
taken apart, are but ſo many privat Intereſts; but if you take them together, they are the public Intereſt. The public Intereſt of a Commonwealth, as has bin ſhewn, is neareſt that of mankind, and that of mankind is right reaſon; but with Ariſtocracy (whoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Intereſt, when they are all together, as appear'd by the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> is but that of a Party) it is quite contrary: for as, taken apart, they are far wiſer than the People conſider'd in that manner; ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put together, they are ſuch fools, who by depoſing the People, as did thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> will ſaw off the branch wherupon they ſit, or rather deſtroy the root of their own Greatneſs.

                     <hi>THE twenty third ORDER,</hi> ſhewing the Power, Function, and manner of Proceding of the Prerogative Tribe.</p>
                  <p>THE Power or Function of the Prerogative is of two parts, the one of Reſult, in which it is the Legiſlative Power; the other of Judicature, in which regard it is the higheſt Court, and the laſt appeal in this Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>FOR the former part (the People by this Conſtitution being not oblig'd by any Law that is not of their own making or confirmation, by the reſult of the Prerogative, their equal Repreſentative) it ſhall not be lawful for the Senat to require obedience from the People, nor for the People to give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Senat in or by any Law that has not bin promulgated, or print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and publiſh'd for the ſpace of ſix weeks; and afterwards propos'd by the Authority of the Senat to the Prerogative Tribe, and reſolv'd by the major Vote of the ſame in the Affirmative. Nor ſhall the Senat have any power to levy War, Men, or Mony, otherwiſe than by the conſent of the People ſo given, or by a Law ſo enacted, except in caſes of Exigence, in which it is agreed, that the Power both of the Senat and the People ſhall be in the Dictator, ſo qualify'd, and for ſuch a term of time, as is according to that Conſtitution already preſcrib'd. While a Law is in promulgation, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors ſhall animadvert upon the Senat, and the Tribuns upon the People, that there be no laying of heads together, no Conventicles or canvaſſing to carry on or oppoſe any thing; but that all may be don in a free and open way.</p>
                  <p>FOR the latter part of the Power of the Prerogative, or that wherby they are the Supreme Judicatory of this Nation, and of the Provinces of the ſame, the cognizance of Crimes againſt the Majeſty of the People, ſuch as High Treaſon, as alſo of Peculat, that is, robbery of the Treaſury, or defraudation of the Commonwealth, appertains to this Tribe. And if any Perſon or Perſons, Provincials or Citizens, ſhall appeal to the People, it belongs to the Prerogative to judg and determin the caſe; provided that if the Appeal be from any Court of Juſtice in this Nation or the Provinces,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49467:106"/>
the Appellant ſhall firſt depoſit a hundred Pounds in the Court from which he appeals, to be forfeited to the ſame, if he be caſt in his Suit by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But the Power of the Council of War being the expedition of this Commonwealth, and the martial Law of the <hi>Strategus</hi> in the Field, are thoſe only from which there ſhall ly no Appeal to the People.</p>
                  <p>THE Proceding of the Prerogative in caſe of a Propoſition, is to be thus order'd. The Magiſtrats, propoſing by Authority of the Senat, ſhall rehearſe the whole matter, and expound it to the People: which don, they ſhall put the whole together to the Suffrage, with three Boxes, the Negative, the Affirmative, and the Nonſincere: and the Suffrage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing return'd to the Tribuns, and number'd in the preſence of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, if the major Vote be in the Nonſincere, the Propoſers ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and the Senat ſhall reſume the Debate. If the major Vote be in the Negative, the Propoſers ſhall deſiſt, and the Senat too. But if the major Vote be in the Affirmative, then the Tribe is clear, and the Propoſers ſhall begin and put the whole matter, with the Negative and the Affirmative (leaving out the Nonſincere) by Clauſes; and the Suffrages being taken and number'd by the Tribuns in the preſence of the Propoſers, ſhall be written and reported by the Tribuns to the Senat. And that which is propos'd by the Authority of the Senat, and conſirm'd by the Command of the People, is the Law of <hi>Oceana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Proceding of the Prerogative in a caſe of Judicature is to be thus order'd. The Tribuns being Auditors of all Cauſes appertaining to the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of the People, ſhall have notice of the Suit or Trial, whether of Appeal or otherwiſe, that is to be commenc'd; and if any one of them ſhall ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ept of the ſame, it appertains to him to introduce it. A Cauſe being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd, and the People muſter'd or aſſembl'd for the deciſion of the ſame, the Tribuns are Preſidents of the Court, having power to keep it to Orders, and ſhall be ſeated upon a Scaffold erected in the middle of the Tribe. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right hand ſhall ſtand a Seat, or large Pulpit aſſign'd to the Plaintif, or the Accuſer; and, upon the left, another for the Defendent, each if they pleaſe with his Council. And the Tribuns (being attended upon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with ſo many Ballotins, Secretarys, Doorkeepers, and Meſſengers of the Senat as ſhall be requiſit) one of them ſhall turn up a Glaſs of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Hourglaſs, but ſuch a one as is to be of an hour and a halfs run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; which being turn'd up, the Party or Council on the right hand may begin to ſpeak to the People. If there be Papers to be read, or Witneſſes to be examin'd, the Officer ſhall lay the Glaſs ſideways till the Papers be read, and the Witneſſes examin'd, and then turn it up again; and ſo long as the Glaſs is running, the Party on the right hand has liberty to ſpeak, and no longer. The Party on the right hand having had his time, the like ſhall be don in every reſpect for the Party on the left. And the Cauſe being thus heard, the Tribuns ſhall put the queſtion to the Tribe with a white, a black, and a red Box (or Nonſincere) whether Guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or not Guilty. And if the Suffrage being taken, the major Vote be in the Nonſincere, the Cauſe ſhall be reheard upon the next juridical day following, and put to the queſtion in the ſame manner. If the major Vote coms the ſecond time in the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere, the Cauſe ſhall be heard again upon the third day: but at the third hearing the queſtion ſhall be put without the Nonſincere. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the firſt of the three days in which the major Vote coms in the white Box, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty accus'd is abſolv'd; and upon the firſt of them in which it coms in the black Box, the Party accus'd is condemn'd. The Party accus'd being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, the Tribuns (if the caſe be criminal) ſhall put with the white and

Nor need I run over the Commonwealths in this place for the proof of a thing ſo doubtleſs, and ſuch as has bin already made ſo apparent, as that the Reſult of each was in the popular part of it. The popular part of yours, or the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Tribe, conſiſts of ſeven Deputys (wherof three are of the Horſe) annually elected out of every Tribe of <hi>Oceana;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fifty, amounts to one hundred and fifty Horſe, and two hundred Foot. And the Prerogative conſiſting of three of theſe Liſts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of four hundred and fifty Horſe, and ſix hundred Foot, beſides thoſe of the Provinces to be hereafter mention'd; by which means the overbalance in the Suffrage remaining to the Foot by one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Votes, you have to the ſupport of a true and natural Ariſtocracy, the deepeſt root of a Democracy that has bin ever planted. Wherfore there is nothing in Art or Nature better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd for the Reſult than this Aſſembly. It is noted out of CICERO by MACCHIAVEL, That the People, tho they are not ſo prone to find out Truth of themſelves, as to follow Cuſtom, or run into Error; yet if they be ſhewn Truth, they not only acknowlege and imbrace it very ſuddenly, but are the moſt conſtant and faithful Guardians and Conſervators of it. It is your Duty and Office, wherto you are alſo qualify'd by the Orders of this Commonwealth, to have the People as you have your Hauks and Greyhounds, in Leaſes and Slips, to range the Fields, and beat the Buſhes for them; for they are of a nature that is never good at this ſport, but when you ſpring or ſtart their proper quarry. Think not that they will ſtand to ask you what it is, or leſs know it than your Hauks and Greyhounds do theirs; but preſently make ſuch a flight or courſe, that a Huntſman may as well undertake to run with his Dogs, or a Falconer to fly with his Hauk, as an Ariſtocracy at this game to compare with the People. The People of <hi>Rome</hi> were poſſeſt of no leſs a prey than the Empire of the World, when the Nobility turn'd tails, and perch'd among Daws upon the Tower of Monarchy. For tho they did not all of them intend the thing, they would none of them indure the Remedy, which was the Agrarian.</q>

As an Eſtate in truſt becoms a man's own, if he be not anſwerable for it; ſo the Power of a Magiſtracy not accountable to the People, from whom it was receiv'd, becoming of privat uſe, the Commonwealth loſes her Liberty.

Judicature in the People (without which there can be no ſuch thing as popular Government) is confirm'd by the conſtant practice of all Commonwealths; as that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the caſes of ACHAN, and of the Tribe of BENJAMIN, adjudg'd by the Congregation. The <hi>Dicaſterion</hi> or Court call'd the <hi>Heliaia</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> which (the <hi>Comitia</hi> of that Commonwealth conſiſting of the whole People, and ſo being too numerous to be a Judicatory) was conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted ſomtimes of five hundred, at others of one thouſand, or, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatneſs of the cauſe, of fifteen hundred, elected by the Lot out of the whole Body of the People, had with the nine ARCHONS that were Preſidents, the cognizance of ſuch Cauſes as were of higheſt importance in that State. The five Ephors in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> which were popular Magiſtrats, might queſtion their Kings, as appears by the caſes of PAUSANIAS, and of AGIS, who being upon his Trial in this Court, was cry'd to by his Mother to appeal to the People, as PLUTARCH has it in his Life. The Tribuns of the People of <hi>Rome</hi> (like, in the nature of their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, and for ſom time in number, to the Ephors, as being, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to HALICARNASSEUS and PLUTARCH, inſtituted in imitation of them) h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Cauſes of theſe two kinds were of a more public nature; but the like Power upon Appeals was alſo exercis'd by the People in privat matters, even during the time of the Kings; as in the caſe of HORATIUS. Nor is it otherwiſe with <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Doge LOREDANO was ſentenc'd by the Great Council; and ANTONIO GRIMANI, afterwards Doge, queſtion'd, for that he being Admiral had ſuffer'd the <hi>Ture</hi> to take <hi>Lepanto</hi> in view of his Fleet.</q>

                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>THE Tueſday Lectures or Orations to the People will be of great benefit to the Senat, the Prerogative, and the whole Nation. To the Senat, becauſe they will not only teach your Senators Elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but keep the Syſtem of the Government in their memorys. Elocution is of great uſe to your Senators; for if they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Rhetoric (giving it at this time for granted, that the Art were not otherwiſe good) and com to treat with, or vindicat the cauſe of the Commonwealth againſt ſom other Nation that is good at it, the advantage will be ſubject to remain upon the merit of the Art, and not upon the merit of the Cauſe. Furthermore, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius or Soul of this Government being in the whole and in every part, they will never be of ability in determination upon any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, unleſs at the ſame time they have an Idea of the whole. That this therfore muſt be, in that regard, of equal benefit to the Prerogative, is plain; tho theſe have a greater concernment in it. For this Commonwealth is the Eſtate of the People: and a man, you know, tho he be virtuous, yet if he dos not underſtand his Eſtate, may run out or be cheated of it. Laſt of all, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Politics will by this means be ſo open'd, riſled, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd, that this Nation will as ſoon dote, like the <hi>Indians,</hi> upon glaſs Beads, as diſturb your Government with Whimſys and Freaks of Motherwit; or ſuffer themſelves to be ſtutter'd out of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertys. There is not any reaſon why your Grandees, your wiſe men of this Age, that laugh out and openly at a Commonwealth as the moſt ridiculous thing, do not appear to be, as in this regard they are,</q> mere Idiots, but that the People have not eys.</p>

but in a civil Capacity ſufficient to give us what Laws they pleaſe. Now every body knows, that the lower ſort of People regard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Mony; and you ſay it is the Duty of a Legiſlator to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all men to be wicked: wherfore they muſt fall upon the richer, as they are an Army; or, leſt their minds ſhould miſgive them in ſuch a villany, you have given them incouragement that they have a nearer way, ſeeing it may be don every whit as well as by the overbalancing Power which they have in Elections. There is a Fair which is annually kept in the Center of theſe Territorys at <hi>Kiberton,</hi> a Town famous for Ale, and frequented by good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; where there is a Solemnity of the Pipers and Fidlers of this Nation (I know not whether <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> where the Senat kept ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſtops of the Flutes and of the Fiddleſtrings of that Commonwealth, had any ſuch Cuſtom) call'd the <hi>Bulrunning;</hi> and he that catches and holds the Bull, is the annual and ſupreme Magiſtrat of that <hi>Comitia</hi> or Congregation, call'd <hi>King Piper;</hi> without whoſe Licence it is not lawful for any of thoſe Citizens to injoy the liberty of his Calling; nor is he otherwiſe legitimatly qualify'd (or <hi>civitate donatus)</hi> to lead Apes or Bears in any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulation of the ſame. Mine Hoſt of the Bear, in <hi>Kiberton,</hi> the Father of Ale, and Patron of good Footbal and Cudgelplayers, has any time ſince I can remember, bin Grand Chancellor of this Order. Now, ſay I, ſeeing great things ariſe from ſmall beginnings, what ſhould hinder the People, prone to their own Advantage, and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mony, from having Intelligence convey'd to them by this ſame <hi>King Piper</hi> and his Chancellor, with their Loyal Subjects the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils and Bearwards, Maſters of Ceremonys, to which there is great recourſe in their reſpective Perambulations, and which they will commiſſion and inſtruct, with Directions to all the Tribes, willing and commanding them, that as they wiſh their own good, they chuſe no other into the next <hi>primum Mobile,</hi> but of the ableſt Cudgel and Footbalplayers?

Well, my Lords, it might have bin otherwiſe expreſt, but this is well enough a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. In your way, the Wit of man ſhall not prevent this or the like Inconvenience; but if this (for I have confer'd with Artiſts) be a mathematical Demonſtration, I could kneel to you, that e're it be too late we might return to ſom kind of Sobriety.</q>

King Piper, I deny not, may teach his Bears to dance, but they have the worſt ear of all Creatures. Now how he ſhould make them keep time in fifty ſeveral Tribes, and that two years together, for elſe it will be to no purpoſe, may be a ſmall matter with my Lord to promiſe; but it ſeems to me of impoſſible performance.

However, there is ſo much more in their way by the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this, than is to be found in that of any other Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that I am reconcil'd; it now appearing plainly, that the Points of my Lord's Arrows are directed at no other White, than to ſhew the excellency of our Government above others; which, as he procedes further, is yet plainer; while he makes it appear, that there can be no other elected by the People but Smiths,</q>

Popular Elections are of that kind, that all the reſt of the World is not able, either in number or glory, to equal thoſe of theſe three Commonwealths. Theſe indeed were the ableſt Cudgel and Footbal-players; bright Arms were their Cudgels, and the World was the Ball that lay at their feet. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not ſo to underſtand the Maxim of Legiſlators, which holds <hi>all men to be wicked,</hi> as if it related to Mankind or a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, the Intereſts wherof are the only ſtrait lines they have wherby to reform the crooked; but as it relates to every Man or Party, under what color ſoever he or they pretend to be truſted

apart, with or by the whole. Hence then it is deriv'd, which is made good in all experience, that the Ariſtocracy is ravenous, and not the People. Your Highwaymen are not ſuch as have Trades, or have bin brought up to Induſtry; but ſuch commonly whoſe Education has pretended to that of Gentlemen. My Lord is ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, he dos not know the Maxims that are of abſolute neceſſity to the Arts of Wickedneſs; for it is moſt certain, if there be not more Purſes than Thieves, that the Thieves themſelves muſt be forc'd to turn honeſt, becauſe they cannot thrive by their Trade: But now if the People ſhould turn Thieves, who ſees not that there would be more Thieves than Purſes? Wherfore that a whole People ſhould turn Robbers or Levellers, is as impoſſible in the end as in the means. But that I do not think your Artiſt which you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, whether Aſtronomer or Arithmetician, can tell me how many Barlycorns would reach to the Sun; I could be content he were call'd to the account, with which I ſhall conclude this Point: when by the way I have chid my Lords the Legiſlators, who, as if they doubted my Tackling could not hold, would leave me to flag in a perpetual Calm, but for my Lord EPIMONUS, who breaths now and then into my Sails, and ſtirs the Waters. A Ship makes not her way ſo briskly, as when ſhe is handſomly bruſh'd by the Waves, and tumbles over thoſe that ſeem to tumble againſt her; in which caſe I have perceiv'd in the dark, that Light has bin ſtruck even out of the Sea, as in this place, where my Lord EPIMONUS feigning to give us a demonſtration of one thing, has given it of another, and of a better. For the People of this Nation, if they amount in each Tribe to two thouſand Elders, and two thouſand Youths, upon the annual Roll, holding a fifth to the whole Tribe; then the whole of a Tribe, not accounting Women and Children, muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to twenty thouſand; and ſo the whole of all the Tribes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fifty, to one Million. Now you have ten thouſand Pariſhes, and reckoning theſe one with another, each at one thouſand pounds a Year dry Rent, the Rent or Revenue of the Nation, as it is or might be let to Farm, amounts to ten Millions; and ten Millions in Revenue divided equally to one Million of men, coms but to ten pounds a year to each wherwith to maintain himſelf, his Wife and Children. But he that has a Cow upon the Common, and earns his Shilling by the day at his labor, has twice as much already as this would com to for his ſhare; becauſe if the Land were thus divided, there would be no body to ſet him on work. So my Lord EPIMONUS'S Footman, who coſts him thrice as much as one of theſe could thus get, would certainly loſe by this bargain. What ſhould we ſpeak of thoſe innumerable Trades wherupon men live, not only better than others upon good ſhares of Lands, but becom alſo purchaſers of greater Eſtates? Is not this the demonſtration which my Lord meant, that the Revenue of Induſtry in a Nation, at leaſt in this, is three or fourfold greater than that of the mere Rent? If the People then obſtruct Induſtry, they obſtruct their own livelihood; but if they make a War, they obſtruct Induſtry. Take the Bread out of the Peoples mouths, as did the <hi>Roman</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and you are ſure enough of a War, in which caſe they may be Levellers; but our Agrarian cauſes their Induſtry to ſlow with Milk and Hony. It will be own'd, that this is true, if the People

Let me reply with the like queſtion, Where do they not? They do not know their happineſs it ſhould ſeem in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy:</hi> but reach them what it is, and try whoſe Senſe is the truer. As to the late Wars in <hi>Germany,</hi> it has bin affirm'd to me there, that the Princes could never make the People to take Arms while they had Bread, and have therfore ſuffer'd Countrys now and then to be waſted, that they might get Soldiers. This you will find to be the certain pulſe and temper of the People; and if they have bin already prov'd to be the moſt wiſe and conſtant Order of a Government, why ſhould we think (when no man can produce one Example of the common Soldiery in an Army muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying becauſe they had not Captains pay) that the Prerogative ſhould jole the heads of the Senat together, becauſe theſe have the better Salarys; when it muſt be as evident to the People in a Nation, as to the Soldiery in an Army, that it is no more poſſible their Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments of this kind ſhould be afforded by any Commonwealth in the World to be made equal with thoſe of the Senat, than that the common Soldiers ſhould be equal with the Captains? It is enough for the common Soldier, that his Virtue may bring him to be a Captain, and more to the Prerogative, that each of them is nearer to be a Senator.</q>

                  <p>THE Services perform'd by the Youth, or by the Elders, in caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, and according to this Order, ſhall be at their proper coſt and charges that are any ways able to indure it; but if there be ſuch as are known in their Pariſhes to be ſo indigent that they cannot march out of their Tribes, nor undergo the burden in this caſe incumbent, then the Congregations of their Pariſhes ſhall furniſh them with ſufficient ſums of Mony to be repaid upon the Certificat of the ſame by the Parlament when the Action ſhall be over. And of that which is reſpectively injoin'd by this Order, any Tribe, Pariſh, Magiſtrat, or Perſon that ſhall fail, is to anſwer for it at the Council of War, as a Deſerter of his Country.</p>

THE ARCHON, being the greateſt Captain of his own, if not of any age, added much to the Glory of this Commonwealth, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terweaving the Militia with more Art and Luſter than any Legiſlator from or before the time of SERVIUS TULLIUS, who conſtituted the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia.

I could wiſh I were Husband good enough to direct ſomthing to this end; but racking of Rents is a vile thing in the richer ſort, an uncharitable one to the poorer, a perfect mark of Slavery, and nips your Commonwealth in the faireſt Bloſſom. On the other ſide, if there ſhould be too much eaſe given in this kind, it would occaſion Sloth, and ſo deſtroy Induſtry, the principal nerve of a Commonwealth. But if ought might be don to hold the Balance even between theſe two, it would be a work in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equal to that for which FABIUS was ſirnam'd MAXIMUS by the <hi>Romans.</hi>

MOSES the Divine Legiſlator was not only skilful in all the Learning of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but took alſo into the Fabric of his Commonwealth the Learning of the <hi>Midianites</hi> in the advice of JETHRO: and his Foundation of a Univerſity laid in the Tabernacle, and finiſh'd in the Temple, became that Pinacle from whence (according to many <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Authors) all the Learning in the world has taken wing; as the Philoſophy of the <hi>Stoics</hi> from the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> that of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> from the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces;</hi> and from the Learning of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo often quoted by our <note place="margin">Acts 17. 18.</note>SAVIOR, and fulfil'd in Him, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. <hi>Athens</hi> was the moſt famous Univerſity in her days; and her Senators, that is to ſay, the <hi>Areopagits,</hi> were all Philoſophers. <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> to ſpeak truth, tho ſhe could write and read, was not very bookiſh. But he that diſputes hence againſt Univerſitys, diſputes by the ſame Argument againſt Agriculture, Manufacture, and Merchandize; every one of theſe having bin equally forbid by LYCURGUS, not for it ſelf (for if he had not bin learn'd in all the Learning of <hi>Crete,</hi>

and well travel'd in the knowledge of other Governments, he had never made his Commonwealth) but for the diverſion which they muſt have given his Citizens from their Arms, who, being but ſew, if they had minded any thing elſe, muſt have deſerted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. For <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe had <hi>ingenium par imperio,</hi> was as learned as great, and held her College of <hi>Augurs</hi> in much reverence. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> has taken her Religion upon truſt. <hi>Holland</hi> cannot attend it to be very ſtudious. Nor dos <hi>Switzerland</hi> mind it much; yet are they all addicted to their Univerſitys. We cut down Trees to build Houſes; but I would have ſom body ſhew me, by what reaſon or experience the cutting down of a Univerſity ſhould tend to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of a Commonwealth. Of this I am ſure, that the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Commonwealth is not to be attain'd without the knowledge of antient Prudence; nor the knowledge of antient Prudence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Learning; nor Learning without Schools of good Literature: and theſe are ſuch as we call Univerſitys. Now tho mere Univerſity learning of it ſelf be that which (to ſpeak the words of VERU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAMIUS) <hi>crafty men contemn, and ſimple men only admire, yet is it ſuch as wiſe men have uſe of; for Studys do not teach their own uſe, but that is a Wiſdom without and above them, won by obſervation.

But what tho the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a man drinks be not nouriſhment; it is the Vehicle without which he cannot be nouriſh'd. Nor is Religion leſs concern'd in this point than Government; for take away your Univerſitys, and in a few years you loſe it.</q>

                                 <q>THE Holy Scriptures are written in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greec:</hi> they that have neither of theſe Languages may think light of both; but find me a man that has one in perfection, the ſtudy of whoſe whole Life it has not bin. Again, this is apparent to us in daily Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that if four or five Perſons that have liv'd together be talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, another ſpeaking the ſame Language may com in, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand very little of their Diſcourſe, in that it relates to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Perſons, Things, Times and Places, which he knows not. It is no otherwiſe with a man, having no inſight of the times in which they were written, and the Circumſtances to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, in the reading of antient Books, whether they be divine or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. For example, when we fall upon the Diſcourſe about Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and Regeneration that was between our SAVIOR and NICO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEMUS, where CHRIST reproaches him with his ignorance in this matter: <hi>Art thou a Doctor in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and underſtandeſt not theſe things?</hi> What ſhall we think of it? or wherfore ſhould a Doctor in <hi>Iſrael</hi> have underſtood theſe things more than another, but that both Baptiſm and Regeneration, as was ſhew'd at large by my Lord PHOSPHORUS, were Doctrins held in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> I inſtance in one place of a hundred, which he, that has not maſter'd the Circumſtances to which they relate, cannot underſtand. Wherfore to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture, it is neceſſary to have antient Languages, and the knowledge of antient times, or the aid of them who have ſuch knowledge: and to have ſuch as may be always able and ready to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49467:119"/>
give ſuch aid (unleſs you would borrow it of another Nation, which would not only be baſe, but deceitful) it is neceſſary to a Commonwealth that ſhe have Schools of good Literature, or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitys of her own. We are commanded, as has bin ſaid more than once, to ſearch the Scriptures; and which of 'em ſearch the Scriptures, they that take this pains in antient Languages and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or they that will not, but truſt to Tranſlations only, and to words as they ſound to preſent Circumſtances? than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more fallible, or certain to loſe the true ſenſe of Scriptures, pretended to be above human Underſtanding, for no other cauſe than that they are below it. But in ſearching the Scriptures by the proper uſe of our Univerſitys, we have bin heretofore bleſt with greater Victorys and Trophys againſt the purple Hoſts and golden Standards of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Hierarchy, than any Nation; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, why we ſhould relinquiſh this upon the preſumtion of ſom, that becauſe there is a greater Light which they have, I do not know. There is a greater Light than the Sun, but it dos not extinguiſh the Sun, nor dos any Light of Gods giving extinguiſh that of Nature, but increaſe and ſanctify it. Wherfore, neither the Honor born by the <hi>Iſraelitiſh, Roman,</hi> or any other Commonwealth that I have ſhewn, to their Eccleſiaſtics, conſiſted in being govern'd by them, but in conſulting them in matters of Religion; upon whoſe Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Oracles they did afterwards as they thought fit. Nor would I be here miſtaken, as if, by affirming the Univerſitys to be, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both to Religion and Government, of abſolute neceſſity, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd them or the Miniſtry in any wiſe fit to be truſted, ſo far as to exerciſe any power not deriv'd from the Civil Magiſtrat in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of either. If the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion were directed and eſtabliſh'd by MOSES, it was directed and eſtabliſh'd by the Civil Magiſtrat; or if MOSES exercis'd this Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Prophet, the ſame Prophet did inveſt with the ſame Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and not the Prieſts; and ſo dos our Commonwealth the Senat, and not the Clergy. They who had the ſupreme Adminiſtration or Government of the National Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Athens,</hi> were the firſt ARCHON, the <hi>Rex Sacrificus,</hi> or High Prieſt, and a <hi>Polemarch;</hi> which Magiſtrats were ordain'd or elected <note n="*" place="bottom">Per <gap reason="foreign">

The Religion of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was govern'd by the Kings, who were alſo High Prieſts, and officiated at the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; theſe had power to ſubſtitute their <hi>Pythii,</hi> Embaſſadors, or Nuncios, by which, not without concurrence of the Senat, they held intelligence with the Oracle of APOLLO at <hi>Delphos.</hi> And the Eccleſiaſtical part of the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was govern'd by the <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> the <hi>Rex Sacrificulus,</hi> and the <hi>Flamins,</hi> all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd or elected by the People, the <hi>Pontifex</hi> by the <note n="†" place="bottom">Tributis.</note>Tribes, the King by the <note n="‖" place="bottom">Centuriatis.</note>Centurys, and the <hi>Flamins</hi> by the <note n="‖ ‖" place="bottom">Curiatis Comitiis.</note>Pariſhes. I do not mind you of theſe things, as if, for the matter, there were any parallel to be drawn out of their Superſtitions to our Religion; but to ſhew that for the manner, antient Prudence is as well a rule in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine as human things; nay, and ſuch a one as the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ordaining Elders by the holding up of hands in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49467:119"/>
have exactly follow'd: for ſom of the Congregations where they thus ordain'd Elders were thoſe of <hi>Antioch, Iconium, Lyſtra, Derbe,</hi> the Countrys of <hi>Lycaonia, Piſidia, Pamphylia, Perga,</hi> with <hi>Attalia.</hi> Now that theſe Citys and Countrys, when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> propagated their Empire into <hi>Aſia,</hi> were found moſt of them Commonwealths, and that many of the reſt were indu'd with like power, ſo that the People living under the protection of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, continu'd to elect their own Magiſtrats, is ſo known a thing, that I wonder whence it is that men, quite contrary to the univerſal proof of theſe examples, will have Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be neceſſarily diſtinct from Civil Power, when the Right of the Elders ordain'd by the holding up of hands in every Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to teach the People, was plainly deriv'd from the ſame Civil Power by which they ordain'd the reſt of their Magiſtrats. And it is not otherwiſe in our Commonwealth, where the Parochial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation elects or ordains its Paſtor. To object the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> in this place, were to ſhew us that it has bin no otherwiſe but where the Civil Power has loſt the liberty of her Conſcience by imbracing Popery; as alſo that to take away the Liberty of Conſcience in this Adminiſtration from the Civil Power, were a proceding which has no other precedent than ſuch as is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh. Wherfore your Religion is ſettled after the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: the Univerſitys are the Seminarys of that part which is natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, by which means others with all ſafety may be permitted to follow the Liberty of their own Conſciences, in regard that, however they behave themſelves, the ignorance of the unlearned in this caſe cannot loſe your Religion nor diſturb your Government, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it would moſt certainly do; and the Univerſitys with their Emoluments, as alſo the Benefices of the whole Nation, are to be improv'd by ſuch Augmentations as may make a very decent and comfortable ſubſiſtence for the Miniſtry, which is neither to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd Synods nor Aſſemblys, except upon the occaſion ſhewn in the Univerſitys, when they are conſulted by the Council of State, and ſuffer'd to meddle with Affairs of Religion, nor to be capable of any other public Preferment whatſoever; by which means the Intereſt of the Learned can never com to corrupt your Religion, nor diſturb your Government, which otherwiſe it would moſt certainly do. <hi>Venice,</hi> tho ſhe dos not ſee, or cannot help the corruption of her Religion, is yet ſo circumſpect to avoid diſturbance of her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in this kind, that her Council procedes not to election of Magiſtrats, till it be proclaim'd, <hi>Fora Papalini,</hi> by which words ſuch as have conſanguinity with red Hats, or relation to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> are warn'd to withdraw. If a Miniſter in <hi>Holland</hi> meddles with matter of State, the Magiſtrat ſends him <hi>a pair of Shoes;</hi> wherupon, if he dos not go, he is driven away from his charge. I wonder why Miniſters, of all men, ſhould be perpetually tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Government; firſt becauſe they, as well as others, have it in expreſs charge to ſubmit themſelves to the Ordinances of men; and ſecondly, becauſe theſe Ordinances of men muſt go upon ſuch political Principles, as they of all others, by any thing that can be found in their Writings or Actions, leaſt underſtand: whence you have the ſuffrage of all Nations to this ſenſe, that an ounce of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is worth a pound of Clergy. Your greateſt Clercs are not
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49467:120"/>
your wiſeſt men: and when ſom foul Abſurdity in State is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it is common with the <hi>French,</hi> and even the <hi>Italians,</hi> to call it <hi>Pas de Clerc,</hi> or, <hi>Governo da Prete.</hi> They may bear with men that will be preaching without ſtudy, while they will be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Prudence. My Lords, if you know not how to rule your Clergy, you will moſt certainly, like a man that cannot rule his Wife, have neither quiet at home, nor honor abroad. Their honeſt Vocation is to teach your Children at the Schools and the Univerſitys, and the People in the Pariſhes; and yours is concern'd to ſee that they do not play the ſhrews: of which parts dos con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Education of your Commonwealth, ſo far as it regards Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</q>

And wheras Lawyers are likeſt to exact further reaſon for this, they (growing up from the moſt gainful Art at the Bar to thoſe Magiſtracys upon the Bench, which are continually appropriated to themſelves, and not only indow'd with the greateſt Revenues, but alſo held for life) have the leaſt reaſon of all the reſt to pretend to any other; eſpecially in an equal Commonwealth, where Accumulation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, or to take a Perſon ingag'd by his Profit to the Laws, as they ſtand, into the Power which is Legiſlative, and which ſhould keep them to what they were, or ought to be, were a Soloeciſm in Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

But if the Client accus'd his Patron, gave teſtimony or ſuffrage againſt him, it was a crime of ſuch a nature, that any man might lawfully kill him as a Traitor; and this, as being the nerve of the Optimacy, was a great cauſe of ruin to that Commonwealth: for when the People would carry any thing that pleas'd not the Senat, the Senators were ill provided if they could not intercede, that is, oppoſe it by their Clients; with whom, to vote otherwiſe than they pleas'd, was the higheſt Crime. The obſervation of this Bond till the time of the GRAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHI, that is to ſay, till it was too late, or to no purpoſe to break it, was the cauſe, why in all the former heats and diſputes that had

Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we may not ſhut out this part of Education in a Commonwealth, which will be her ſelf a Traveller; for thoſe of this make have ſeen the World, eſpecially becauſe this is certain (tho it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded in our times, when things being left to take their chance, it ſares with us accordingly) that no man can be a Politician, except he be firſt a Hiſtorian or a Traveller; for except he can ſee what muſt be, or what may be, he is no Politician. Now if he has no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in Story, he cannot tell what has bin; and if he has not bin a Traveller, he cannot tell what is: but he that neither knows what has bin, nor what is, can never tell what muſt be, or what may be. Furthermore, the Embaſſys in ordinary by our Conſtitution are the Prizes of young men, more eſpecially ſuch as have bin Travellers. Wherfore they of theſe inclinations having leave of the Cenſors, ow them an account of their time, and cannot chuſe but lay it out with ſom ambition of Praiſe or Reward, where both are open: whence you will have eys abroad, and better choice of public Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; your Gallants ſhewing themſelves not more to the Ladys at their Balls, than to your Commonwealth at her Academy, when they return from their Travels.</q>

                                 <q>BUT this Commonwealth being conſtituted more eſpecially of two Elements, Arms and Councils, drives by a natural inſtinct at Courage and Wiſdom; which he who has attain'd, is arriv'd at the perfection of human nature. It is true, that theſe Virtues muſt have ſom natural root in him that is capable of them; but this amounts not to ſo great a matter as ſom will have it. For if Poverty makes an induſtrious, a moderat Eſtate a temperat, and a laviſh Fortune a wanton man, and this be the common courſe of things; Wiſdom then is rather of neceſſity than inclination. And that an Army which was meditating upon flight, has bin brought by deſpair to win the Field, is ſo far from being ſtrange, that like cauſes will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore produce like effects. Wherfore this Commonwealth drives her Citizens like Wedges; there is no way with them but thorow, nor end but that Glory wherof Man is capable by Art or Nature. That the Genius of the <hi>Roman</hi> Familys commonly preſerv'd it ſelf throout the line (as to inſtance in ſom, the MANLII were ſtill ſevere, the PUBLICOLAE lovers, and the APPII haters of the People) is attributed by MACCHIAVEL to their Education: nor, if Intereſt might add to the reaſon why the Genius of a <hi>Patrician</hi> was one thing, and that of a <hi>Plebeian</hi> another, is the like ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent between different Nations, who, according to their different Educations, have yet as different manners. It was antiently noted, and long confirm'd by the actions of the <hi>French,</hi> that in their firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults their Courage was more than that of Men; and for the reſt leſs
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49467:121"/>
than that of Women: which nevertheleſs, thro the amendment of their Diſciplin, we ſee now to be otherwiſe. I will not ſay, but that ſom Man or Nation upon an equal improvement of this kind may be lighter than ſom other; but certainly, Education is the ſcale without which no Man or Nation can truly know his or her own weight or value. By our Hiſtorys we can tell when one <hi>Marpeſian</hi> would have beaten ten <hi>Oceaners,</hi> and when one <hi>Oceaner</hi> would have beaten ten <hi>Marpeſians.</hi> MARC ANTHONY was a <hi>Roman,</hi> but how did that appear in the imbraces of CLEOPATRA?

Yet how much it did worſe at other times, is obvious in POMPEY and CAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAR; Examples by which BOCCALINI illuſtrats the Prudence of <hi>Venice</hi> in her contrary practice, affirming it to have bin no ſmall ſtep to the ruin of the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty, that theſe (having taſted in their Youth of the ſupreme Honors) had no greater in their age to hope for, but by perpetuating of the ſame in themſelves; which came to Blood, and ended in Tyranny. The opinion of VERU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAMIUS is ſafe: <hi>The Errors,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of young men are the ruin of buſineſs; wheras the Errors of old men amount but to this, that more might have bin don, or ſooner.</hi> But tho their Wiſdom be little, their Courage is great: Wherfore (to com to the main Education of this Commonwealth) the Militia of <hi>Oceana</hi> is the Province of Youth.</q>

                                 <q>THE diſtribution of this Province by the Eſſays is ſo fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in the Order, that I need repeat nothing: the Order it ſelf being but a Repetition or Copy of that Original, which in antient Prudence is of all others the faireſt; as that from whence the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> more particularly deriv'd the Empire of the World. And there is much more reaſon in this age, when Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are univerſally broken, or ſwerv'd from their Foundations, and the People groan under Tyranny, that the ſame cauſes (which could not be withſtood when the World was full of popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments) ſhould have the like effects.</q>

                                 <q>THE Cauſes in the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherof the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the World was not any miraculous, but a natural (nay I may ſafely ſay a neceſſary) conſequence, are contain'd in that part of her Diſciplin which was domeſtic, and in that which ſhe exercis'd in her Provinces or Conqueſt. Of the latter I ſhall have better occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſpeak when we com to our provincial Orbs; the former divided the whole People by Tribes, amounting, as LIVY and CICERO ſhew, at their full growth to thirty five, and every Tribe by the Cenſe or Valuation of Eſtates into five Claſſes: for the ſixth being <hi>Proletary,</hi> that is the Nurſery, or ſuch as thro their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty contributed nothing to the Commonwealth but Children, was not reckon'd, nor us'd in Arms. And this is the firſt point of the Militia, in which modern Prudence is quite contrary to the antient; for wheras we, excuſing the rich, and arming the poor, becom the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49467:121"/>
Vaſſals of our Servants, they, by excuſing the poor, and arming ſuch as were rich enough to be Freemen, became Lords of the Earth. The Nobility and Gentry of this Nation, who underſtand ſo little what it is to be Lords of the Earth, that they have not bin able to keep their own Lands, will think it a ſtrange Education for their Children to be common Soldiers, and oblig'd to all the Dutys of Arms: nevertheleſs it is not for 4 <hi>s.</hi> a week, but to be capable of being the beſt man in the Field or in the City; the latter part of which conſideration makes the common Soldier herein a better man than the General of any monarchical Army. And wheras it may be thought, that this would drink deep of noble Blood, I dare boldly ſay, take the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility in the heat of their fierceſt Wars, and you ſhall not find ſuch a ſhambles of them as has bin made of ours by mere Luxury and Slothfulneſs; which, killing the Body, kill the Soul alſo; <hi>Animaſque in vulnere ponunt.</hi> Wheras common Right is that which who ſtands in the vindication of, has us'd that Sword of Juſtice for which he receives the Purple of Magiſtracy. The Glory of a man on Earth can go no higher, and if he falls he riſes again, and coms ſooner to that reward which is ſo much higher as Heaven is above the Earth. To return to the <hi>Roman</hi> Example: Every Claſſis was divided, as has bin more than once ſhewn, into Centurys, and every Century was equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Youth and Elders; the Youth for foren Service, and the Elders for the guard of the Territory. In the firſt Claſſis were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighteen Centurys of Horſe, being thoſe which by the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of SERVIUS were firſt call'd to the Suffrage in the <note n="*" place="bottom">Centuriatis.</note>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turial Aſſemblys. But the <hi>Delectus,</hi> or Levy of an Army, which is the preſent buſineſs, proceded, according to POLYBIUS, in this manner.</q>

                                 <q>Upon a War decreed, the Conſuls elected four and twenty mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Tribuns or Colonels; wherof ten, being ſuch as had merited their tenth Stipend, were younger Officers. The Tribuns being choſen, the Conſuls appointed a day to the Tribes, when thoſe in them of military age were to appear at the Capitol; the day being com, and the Youth aſſembl'd accordingly, the Conſuls aſcended their Tribunal, and the younger Tribuns were ſtraight divided into four parts after this manner: four were aſſign'd to the firſt Legion (a Legion at the moſt conſiſted of 6000 Foot, and 300 Horſe) three to the ſecond, four to the third, and three to the fourth. The younger Tribuns being thus diſtributed, two of the elder were aſſign'd to the firſt Legion, three to the ſecond, two to the third, and three to the fourth. And the Officers of each Legion thus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, having drawn the Tribes by Lots, and being ſeated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their diviſions at a convenient diſtance from each other, the Tribe of the firſt Lot was call'd: wherupon they that were of it knowing the buſineſs, and being prepar'd, preſently bolted out four of their number, in the choice wherof ſuch care was taken, that they offer'd none that was not a Citizen; no Citizen that was not of the Youth; no Youth that was not of ſom one of the five Claſſes; nor any one of the five Claſſes that was not expert at his Exerciſes. Moreover, they us'd ſuch diligence in matching them
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49467:122"/>
for Age and Stature, that the Officers of the Legions, except they happen'd to be acquainted with the Youth ſo bolted, were forc'd to put themſelves upon fortune, while they of the firſt Legion choſe one; they of the ſecond, the next; they of the third another; and the fourth Youth fell to the laſt Legion: and thus was the Election (the Legions and the Tribes varying according to their Lots) carry'd on till the Foot were complete. The like courſe with little alteration was taken by the Horſe Officers till the Horſe alſo were complete. This was call'd giving of Names, which the <note place="margin">Judg. 20. 9.</note>Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did alſo by Lot; and if any man refus'd to give his Name, he was ſold for a Slave, or his Eſtate confiſcated to the Commonwealth. <hi>When</hi>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49467:122"/>
Horſe and Foot, with ſuch Arms for their Forge, Proof, and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as (notwithſtanding the <hi>Argyraſpides,</hi> or ſilver Shields of ALEXANDER'S Guards) were never worn by ſo many; ſuch as will preſent marks of Virtue and Direction to your General or Strategus in the diſtribution of his Army, which doubles the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of them to the Proprietors, who are bound to wear them, and eaſes the Commonwealth of ſo much Charge, ſo many being arm'd already.</q>

                                 <q>BUT here will be the Objection now. How ſhall ſuch a Revenue be compas'd? Fifty pounds a year in every Hundred is a great deal, not ſo eaſily rais'd: Men will not part with their Mony; nor would the ſum as it is propos'd by the Order of <hi>Pompe,</hi> riſe in many years. Theſe are difficulties that fit our Genius exactly: And yet a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds in each Hundred once levy'd, eſtabliſhes the Revenue for ever. Now the Hundreds one with another are worth ten thouſand pounds a year dry Rent, over and above perſonal Eſtates, which bring it to twice the value: So that a twentieth part of one year's Revenue of the Hundred dos it. If you cannot afford this while you pay Taxes, tho from henceforth they will be but ſmall ones, do it when you pay none. If it be then too much for one year, do it in two: If it be two much for two years, do it in four. What Husbands have we hitherto bin? What is becom of greater Sums? My Lords, if you ſhould thus caſt your Bread upon the Waters, after many days you would find it: ſtand not huckling when you are offer'd Corn and your Mony again in the mouth of the Sack.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>BUT to procede: The firſt Eſſay being officer'd at the Hundreds, and muſter'd at the <note n="*" place="bottom">Tributis.</note>Tribes (where they are entertain'd with other Sports, which will be very fine ones) procedes to the Election of the ſecond Eſſay, or ſtanding Army of this Nation, conſiſting of thirty thouſand Foot, and ten thouſand Horſe; and theſe, upon a War decreed, being deliver'd at the Rendevous of <hi>Oceana</hi> to the Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegus, are the third Eſſay, which anſwers to the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions. But you may obſerve, that wheras the Conſuls elected the military Tribuns, and rais'd commanded Men out of the Veterans at their own diſcretion; our Polemarchs or Field Officers are elected by the Scrutiny of the Council of War: and our Veterans not otherwiſe taken on than as Volunteers, and with the conſent of the Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchs; which may ſerve for the removal of certain ſcruples which might otherwiſe be incident in this place, tho without incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the <hi>Roman</hi> way of proceding, much leſs by that which is propos'd. But wheras the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions in all amounted not in one Army to above 30000 Men, or little more, you have here forty thouſand; and wheras they added Auxiliarys, it is in this regard that <hi>Marpeſia</hi> will be a greater Revenue to you, than if you had the <hi>Indys;</hi> for wheras heretofore ſhe has yielded you nothing but her native Thiſtles, in plowing out the rankneſs of her Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy by your Agrarian, you will find her an inexhauſtible Magazin of Men, and to her own advantage, who will make a far better account by the Arms, than by the Pins of <hi>Poland.</hi> Wherfore as a Conſular Army conſiſted of about an equal number of Auxiliarys added to their Legions by their <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> Aſſociats, you may
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49467:123"/>
add to a Parlamentary Army an equal number of <hi>Marpeſians</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopeans,</hi> as that Colony ſhall hereafter be able to ſupply you: By which means the Commonwealth will be able to go forth to Battel with fourſcore thouſand Men. To make Wars with ſmall Forces is no Husbandry, but a waſt, a diſeaſe, a lingring and painful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumtion of Men and Mony; the <hi>Romans</hi> making theirs thick, made them ſhort, and had little regard to Mony, as that which they who have Men enow, can command where it is fitteſt that it ſhould be levy'd. All the antient Monarchys by this means got on wing, and attain'd to vaſt Riches. Wheras your modern Princes being dear purchaſers of ſmall parcels, have but emty pockets. But it may be ſom will accuſe the Order of raſhneſs, in that it commits the ſole Conduct of the War to the General; and the Cuſtom of <hi>Venice</hi> by her <hi>Proveditori,</hi> or checks upon her Commanders in chief, may ſeem to be of greater Prudence: but in this part of our Government neither <hi>Venice</hi> nor any Nation that makes uſe of mercenary Forces is for our inſtruction. A mercenary Army, with a ſtanding Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is like the fatal Siſter that ſpins; but proper Forces, with an annual Magiſtrat, are like her that cuts the thred. Their Intereſts are quite contrary, and yet you have a better Proveditor than the <hi>Venetian,</hi> another Strategus ſitting with an Army ſtanding by him; wherupon that which is marching, if there were any probability it ſhould, would find as little poſſibility that it could recoil, as a foren Enemy to invade you. Theſe things conſider'd, a War will appear to be of a contrary nature to that of all other reckonings, inaſmuch as of this you muſt never look to have a good account if you be ſtrict in impoſing checks. Let a Council of Huntſmen aſſembl'd beforehand, tell you which way the Stag ſhall run, where you ſhall caſt about at the fault, and how you ſhall ride to be in at the chaſe all the day: but theſe may as well do that, as a Council of War direct a General. The hours that have painted wings, and of different colors, are his Council: he muſt be like the Ey that makes not the Scene, but has it ſo ſoon as it changes. That in many Counſillors there is ſtrength, is ſpoken of Civil Adminiſtrations: as to thoſe that are military, there is nothing more certain, than that in many Counſillors there is weakneſs. Joint Commiſſions in military affairs, are like hunting your Hounds in their Couples. In the <hi>Attic</hi> War CLEOMENES and DEMARATUS, Kings of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> being thus coupl'd, tug'd one againſt another; and while they ſhould have join'd againſt the <hi>Perſian,</hi> were the cauſe of the common calamity: wherupon that Commonwealth took better Counſil, and made a Law, wherby from thenceforth there went at once but one of her Kings to Battel.</q>

                                 <q>THE <hi>Fidenati</hi> being in rebellion, and having ſlain the Colony of the <hi>Romans,</hi> four Tribuns with Conſular Power were created by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherof one being left for the guard of the City, the other three were ſent againſt the <hi>Fidenati,</hi> who, thro the diviſion that happen'd among them, brought nothing home but Diſhonor: wherupon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> created the Dictator, and <hi>LIVY</hi> gives his Judgment in theſe words: <note n="*" place="bottom">Tres Tribuni, poteſtate Conſulari, documento fuêre, quàm plurium imperium bello inutile eſſet; tendendo ad ſua quiſque conſilia, cum alii aliud videretur, aperuerunt ad occaſionem, locum hoſti.</note>The three Tribuns with Conſular Power were a leſſon how uſeleſs

in War is the joint Command of ſeveral Generals; for each following his own Counſils, while they all differ'd in their opinions, gave by this opportunity an advantage to the Enemy. When the Conſuls <hi>QUINTIUS</hi> and <hi>AGRIPPA</hi> were ſent againſt the <hi>AEQUI, AGRIPPA</hi> for this reaſon refus'd to go with his Collegue, ſaying, <note n="*" place="bottom">Saluberrimum in adminiſtratione magnarum rerum, ſummam imperii apud unum eſſe.</note>That in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of great Actions it was moſt ſafe that the chief Command ſhould be lodg'd in one Perſon.

                                    <hi>ROME</hi> was ſaid to be broken by her own weight, but poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: For that weight by which ſhe was pretended to be ruin'd, was ſupported in her Emperors by a far ſlighter Foundation. And in the common experience of good Architecture, there is nothing more known, than that Buildings ſtand the firmer and the longer for their own weight; nor ever ſwerve thro any other internal cauſe, than that their Materials are corruptible: But the People ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dy; nor, as a political Body, are ſubject to any other Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that which derives from their Government. Unleſs a Man will deny the Chain of Cauſes, in which he denys God, he muſt alſo acknowlege the Chain of Effects; wherfore there can be no effect in Nature, that is not from the firſt Cauſe, and thoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Links of the Chain, without which it could not have bin. Now except a Man can ſhew the contrary in a Commonwealth; if there be no cauſe of Corruption in the firſt make of it, there can never be any ſuch Effect. Let no Man's Superſtitition impoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs upon this Aſſertion; for as Man is ſinful, but yet the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe is perfect, ſo may the Citizen be ſinful, and yet the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth be perfect. And as Man, ſeeing the World is perfect, can never commit any ſuch Sin as ſhall render it imperfect, or bring
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49467:125"/>
it to a natural diſſolution; ſo the Citizen, where the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is perfect, can never commit any ſuch Crime as will render it imperfect, or bring it to a natural diſſolution. To com to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; <hi>Venice,</hi> notwithſtanding we have found fom flaws in it, is the only Commonwealth in the Make wherof no man can find a cauſe of diſſolution; for which reaſon we behold her (tho ſhe conſiſts of men that are not without ſin) at this day with one thouſand Years upon her back, yet for any internal cauſe, as young, as freſh, and free from decay, or any appearance of it, as ſhe was born: but whatever in nature is not ſenſible of decay by the courſe of a thouſand Years, is capable of the whole Age of Nature; by which Calculation, for any check that I am able to give my ſelf, a Commonwealth, rightly order'd, may, for any internal cauſes, be as immortal or longliv'd as the World. But if this be true, thoſe Commonwealths that are naturally fall'n, muſt have deriv'd their Ruin from the riſe of them. <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> dy'd not natural but violent deaths; in which manner the World it ſelf is to dy. We are ſpeaking of thoſe cauſes of Diſſolution which are natural to Government; and they are but two, either Contradiction or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality: If a Commonwealth be a Contradiction, ſhe muſt needs deſtroy her ſelf; and if ſhe be inequal, it tends to ſtrife, and ſtrife to ruin. By the former of theſe fell <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> by the latter <hi>Rome. Lacedemon</hi> being made altogether for War, and yet not for Increaſe, her natural Progreſs became her natural Diſſolution, and the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her own victorious Hand too heavy for her Foundation; ſo that ſhe fell indeed by her own weight.

It was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to theſe in ſpeculation, or, if you read the ſtory of AGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SILAUS, in action, that either of them with thirty thouſand men might have maſter'd the Eaſt; and certainly, if the one had not ſtood in the others light, ALEXANDER had com too late to that end, which was the means (and would be if they were to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) of ruin, at leaſt to one of them: wherfore with any man that underſtands the nature of Government this is excuſable. So it was between <hi>Oceana</hi> and <hi>Marpeſia;</hi> ſo it is between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> tho leſs excuſable; and ſo it ever will be in the like caſes. But to com to the ſecond occaſion of Scandal by them given, which was in the way of their propagation, it is not excuſable: for they brought their Confederats under bondage; by which means <hi>Athens</hi> gave occaſion of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, the wound of which ſhe dy'd ſtinking, when <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> taking the fame Infection from her Carcaſe, ſoon follow'd.</q>

                                 <q>THE ſecond way of Propagation or Inlargement us'd by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, is that of <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> equal Leagues: This, tho it be not otherwiſe miſchievous, is uſeleſs to the World,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49467:127"/>
and dangerous to themſelves: uſeleſs to the World; for as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Governments were Storks, theſe are Blocks, have no ſenſe of Honor, or concern in the Sufferings of others. But as the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> a State of the like Fabric, were reproach'd by PHILIP of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to proſtitute themſelves, by letting out their Arms to the Luſts of others, while they leave their own Liberty barren, and without legitimat iſſue; ſo I do not defame theſe People: the <hi>Switzer</hi> for Valor has no Superior, the <hi>Hollander</hi> for Induſtry no equal; but themſelves in the mean time ſhall ſo much the leſs excuſe their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, ſeeing that to the <hi>Switz</hi> it is well enough known that the Enſigns of his Commonwealth have no other <hi>Motto</hi> than <hi>in te con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verte manus:</hi> and that of the <hi>Hollander,</hi> tho he ſweats more Gold than the <hi>Spaniard</hi> digs, lets him languiſh in debt; for ſhe her ſelf lives upon charity. Theſe are dangerous to themſelves, precarious Governments, ſuch as do not command, but beg their Bread from Province to Province, in Coats that being patch'd up of all colors are in effect of none. That their Cantons and Provinces are ſo many Arrows, is good; but they are ſo many Bows too, which is naught.</q>

Now that <hi>Rome (ſeris Avaritia Luxuriaque)</hi> thro the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural thirſt of her conſtitution, came at length with the fulneſs of her Provinces to burſt her ſelf, this is no otherwiſe to be underſtood, than as when a man that from his own evil Conſtitution had contracted the Dropſy, dys with drinking: It being apparent that in caſe her

                                 <q>THE facility of this Enterprize, upon the grounds already laid, muſt needs be great, foraſmuch as the Empire of the World has bin, both in Reaſon and Experience, the neceſſary conſequence of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of this nature only: for tho it has bin given to all kinds to drive at it, ſince that of <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> if the one had not hung in the others light, might have gain'd it; yet could neither of them have held it: not <hi>Athens,</hi> thro the manner of her propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which, being by downright Tyranny, could not preſerve what ſhe had; nor <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> becauſe ſhe was overthrown by the weight of a leſs Conqueſt. The facility then of this great Enterprize be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peculiar to popular Government, I ſhall conſider it, firſt, In gaining; and ſecondly, In holding.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>FOR the former, <hi>Volenti non ſit injuria;</hi> it is ſaid of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under EUMENES, that they would not have chang'd their ſubjection for Liberty; wherfore the <hi>Romans</hi> gave them no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance. If a People be contented with their Government, it is a certain ſign that it is good, and much good do them with it. The Sword of your Magiſtracy is for a terror to them that do evil. EUMENES had the ſear of God, or of the <hi>Romans</hi> before his eys; concerning ſuch he has given you no Commiſſion.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>BUT till we can ſay here are the <hi>Romans,</hi> where is EUMENES? Do not think that the late <hi>appearances of God</hi> to you have bin alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for your ſelves; <hi>he has ſurely ſeen the Affliction</hi> of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>and heard their cry by reaſon of their Taskmaſters.</hi> For to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve otherwiſe, is not only to be mindleſs of his ways, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deaf. If you have ears to hear, this is the way in which you will certainly be call'd upon: For if, while there is no ſtock of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, no ſanctuary of the afflicted, it be a common object to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a People caſting themſelves out of the Pan of one Prince into the Fire of another; what can you think, but if the World ſhould ſee the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle again, ſhe would renew her age, and her ſlight? Nor did ever ſhe ſpread her Wings with better Omen, than will be read in your Enſigns; which if, call'd in by an oppreſs'd People, they interpoſe between them and their Yoke, the People them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves muſt either do nothing in the mean time, or have no more pains to take for their wiſh'd Fruit than to gather it, if that be not likewiſe don for them. Wherfore this muſt needs be eaſy, and yet you have a greater facility than is in the arm of fleſh; for if the Cauſe of Mankind be the Cauſe of God, the Lord of Hoſts will be your Captain, and you ſhall be a Praiſe to the whole Earth.</q>
                              </p>

                                 <q>THE facility of Holding is in the way of your Propagation; if you take that of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> you ſhall rain Snares; but either catch, or hold nothing. Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord: If ſetting up for Liberty, you impoſe Yokes, he will infallibly deſtroy you. On the other ſide, to go about a work of this nature by a League without a Head, is to abdicat that Magiſtracy, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he has not only indu'd you, but wherof he will require an account of you; for, <hi>curs'd is he that dos the Work of the Lord neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently.</hi> Wherfore you are to take the courſe of <hi>Rome:</hi> if you have ſubdu'd a Nation that is capable of Liberty, you ſhall make them a preſent of it, as did FLAMINIUS to <hi>Greece,</hi> and AEMILIUS to <hi>Macedon,</hi> reſerving to your ſelves ſom part of that Revenue which was legally paid to the former Government, together with the right of being Head of the League, which includes ſuch Levys of Men and Mony as ſhall be neceſſary for the carrying on of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Work. For if a People have by your means attain'd to freedom, they ow both to the Cauſe and you, ſuch Aid as may propagat the like Fruit to the reſt of the World. But wheras every Nation is not capable of her Liberty to this degree, leſt you be put to doing and undoing of things, as the <hi>Romans</hi> were in <hi>Macedon,</hi> you ſhall diligently obſerve what Nation is fit for her Liberty to this degree, and what not: Which is to be don by two Marks, the firſt if ſhe be willing to <hi>help the Lord againſt the Mighty;</hi> for if ſhe has no care of the Liberty of Mankind, ſhe deſerves not her own. But becauſe in this you may be deceiv'd by Pretences, which, continuing for a while ſpecious, may afterwards vaniſh; the other is more certain, and that is if ſhe be capable of an equal Agrarian; which that it was not obſerv'd by excellent AEMILIUS in his donation of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and introduction of a Popular State among the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> I am more than mov'd to believe for two reaſons: the firſt, becauſe at the ſame time the Agrarian was odious to the Roman <hi>Patricians;</hi> the ſecond, that the PSEUDO-PHILIP could afterwards ſo eaſily recover <hi>Macedon,</hi> which could not have happen'd but by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and their impatience, having great Eſtates, to be equal'd with the People; for that the People ſhould otherwiſe, at the mere ſound of a Name, have thrown away their Liberty, is incredible. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be aſſur'd, that the Nation where you cannot eſtabliſh an equal Agrarian, is incapable of its Liberty as to this kind of Donation. For example, except the Ariſtocracy in <hi>Marpeſia</hi> be diſſolv'd, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can that People have their Liberty there, nor you govern at home; for they continuing ſtill liable to be ſold by their Lords to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Princes, there will never (eſpecially in a Country of which there is no other profit to be made) be want of ſuch Merchants and Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, while you muſt be the Market where they are to receive their ſecond Payment.</q>

                              <p>
                                 <q>NOR can the Ariſtocracy there be diſſolv'd but by your means, in relation wherto you are provided with your Provincial Orb; which being proportion'd to the meaſure of the Nation that you have vindicated or conquer'd, will eaſily hold it: for there is not a People in the World more difficult to be held than the <hi>Marpeſians,</hi> which tho by themſelves it be aſcrib'd to their own nature, is truly to be attributed to that of their Country.

                  <p>FOR the reſt (ſays PLUTARCH, cloſing up the ſtory of LY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CURGUS) when he ſaw that his Government had taken root, and was in the very Plantation ſtrong enough to ſtand by it ſelf, he conceiv'd ſuch a delight within him, as GOD is deſcrib'd by PLATO to have don when he had finiſh'd the Creation of the World, and ſaw his own Orbs move below him: For in the Art of Man (being the imitation of Nature, which is the <note n="‖" place="margin">Hobbs.</note>Art of GOD) there is nothing ſo like the firſt call of beautiful Order out of Chaos and Confuſion, as the Architecture of a welorder'd Commonwealth. Wherfore LYCURGUS ſeeing in effect, that his Orders were good, fell into deep Contemplation how he might render them, ſo far as could be effected by human Providence, inalterable and immortal. To which end he aſſembl'd the People, and remonſtrated to them, That for ought he could perceive, their Policy was already ſuch, and ſo well eſtabliſh'd, as was ſufficient to intail upon them and theirs all that Virtue and Felicity wherof human Life is capable: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs that there being another thing of greater concern than all the reſt, wherof he was not yet provided to give them a perfect account, nor could, till he had conſulted the Oracle of APOLLO, he deſir'd that they would obſerve his Laws without any change or alteration whatſoever, till his return from <hi>Delphos;</hi> to which all the People chearfully and unanimouſly ingag'd themſelves by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, deſiring him that he would make as much haſt as he could. But LYCURGUS before he went, began with the Kings and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, and thence taking the whole People in order, made them all ſwear to that which they had promis'd, and then took his Journy. Being arriv'd at <hi>Delphos,</hi> he ſacrific'd to APOLLO, and afterwards inquir'd if the Policy which he had eſtabliſh'd, was good and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for a virtuous and a happy Life? By the way, it has bin a Maxim with Legiſlators not to give checks to the preſent Superſtition, but to make the beſt uſe of it, as that which is always the moſt powerful with the People; otherwiſe tho PLUTARCH being a Prieſt, was intereſted in the cauſe, there is nothing plainer than CICERO in his Book <hi>De Divinatione</hi> has made it, that there was never any ſuch thing as an Oracle, except in the cunning of the Prieſts. But to be civil to the Author, The God anſwer'd to LYCURGUS, that his Policy was exquiſit, and that his City, holding to the ſtrict obſervation of his form of Government, ſhould attain to the height of fame and glory. Which Oracle LYCURGUS cauſing to be written, fail'd not of tranſmitting to his <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> This don, that his Citizens might be for ever invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olably bound by their Oath, that they would alter nothing till his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he took ſo firm a reſolution to dy in the place, that from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward receiving no manner of Food, he ſoon after perform'd it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Nor was he deceiv'd in the conſequence; for his City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the firſt in glory and excellency of Government in the whole World. And ſo much for LYCURGUS according to PLUTARCH.</p>

MY Lord ARCHON when he beheld not only the rapture of motion, but of joy and harmony, into which his Spheres (without any manner of obſtruction or interfering, but as if it had bin naturally) were caſt, conceiv'd not leſs of exultation in his Spirit; but ſaw no more neceſſity or reaſon why he ſhould adminiſter an Oath to the Senat and the People that they would obſerve his Inſtitutions, than to a Man in perfect health and felicity of Conſtitution, that he would not kill himſelf. Nevertheleſs wheras Chriſtianity, tho it forbids violent hands, conſiſts no leſs in ſelfdenial than any other Religion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd that all unreaſonable Deſires ſhould dy upon the ſpot; to which end that no manner of food might be left to Ambition, he enter'd into the Senat with a unanimous Applauſe, and having ſpoken of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as LYCURGUS did when he aſſembl'd the People, he abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Magiſtracy of ARCHON. The Senat, as ſtruck with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, continu'd ſilent; Men upon ſo ſudden an Accident being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unprovided of what to ſay; till the ARCHON withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being almoſt at the door, divers of the Knights flew from their Places, offering as it were to lay violent hands on him, while he eſcaping left the Senat with the tears in their Eys of Children that had loſt their Father; and to rid himſelf of all farther importunity, retir'd to a Country Houſe of his, being remote, and very privat, in ſo much that no man could tell for ſom time what was becom of him. Thus the Lawmaker happen'd to be the firſt object and reflection of the Law made: For as Liberty of all things is the moſt welcom to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Never Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> much Love, the conſtant fault of the People.</note>ſo is there nothing more abhorrent from their nature than Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. We, accuſing the <hi>Roman</hi> People of this Crime againſt ſom of their greateſt Benefactors, as CAMILLUS, heap miſtake upon miſtake; for being not ſo competent Judges of what belongs to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as they were, we take upon us to be more competent Judges of Virtue. And wheras Virtue, for being a vulgar thing among them, was of no leſs rate than Jewels are with ſuch as wear the moſt; we are ſelling this precious Stone, which we have ignorantly rak'd out of the <hi>Roman</hi> ruins, at ſuch a rate as the <hi>Switzers</hi> did that which they took in the Baggage of CHARLES of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> For that CAMILLUS had ſtood more firm againſt the ruin of <hi>Rome</hi> than her Capitol, was acknowleg'd; but on the other ſide that he ſtood as firm for the <hi>Patricians</hi> againſt the Liberty of the People, was as plain: wherfore he never wanted thoſe of the People that would dy at his foot in the Field, nor that would withſtand him to his beard in the City. An example in which they that think CAMILLUS had wrong, neither do themſelves right, nor the People of <hi>Rome;</hi> who in this ſignify no leſs than that they had a ſcorn of Slavery beyond the ſear of Ruin, which is the height of Magnanimity. The like might be ſhewn by other examples objected againſt this, and other Popular Governments, as in the Baniſhment of ARISTIDES the <hi>Juſt</hi> from <hi>Athens,</hi> by the Oſtraciſm, which, firſt, was no puniſhment, nor ever underſtood for ſo much as a diſparagement; but tended only to the Security of the Commonwealth, thro the removal of a Citizen (whoſe Riches or Power with a Party was ſuſpected) out of harms way for the ſpace of ten years, neither to the diminution of his Eſtate or Honor. And next, tho the virtue of ARISTIDES might in it ſelf be unqueſtion'd, yet for him under the name of the <hi>Juſt</hi> to becom Univerſal Umpire of the People in all caſes, even to the neglect of the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49467:135"/>
legal ways and orders of the Commonwealth, approach'd ſo much to the Prince, that the <hi>Athenians,</hi> doing ARISTIDES no wrong, did their Government no more than right in removing him; which therfore is not ſo probable to have com to paſs, as PLUTARCH preſumes, thro the envy of THEMISTOCLES, ſeeing ARISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DES was far more popular than THEMISTOCLES, who ſoon after took the ſame walk upon a worſe occaſion. Wherfore as MACCHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AVEL, for any thing ſince alleg'd, has irrefragably prov'd that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Governments are of all others the leaſt ingrateful; ſo the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, I ſay, into which my Lord ARCHON had now withdrawn himſelf, caus'd a univerſal ſadneſs and cloud in the minds of Men upon the glory of his riſing Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>MUCH had bin ventilated in privat diſcourſe, and the People (for the Nation was yet divided into Partys that had not loſt their animoſitys) being troubl'd, bent their eys upon the Senat, when, after ſom time ſpent in devotion, and the ſolemn action of Thankſgiving, his Excellency NAVARCHUS DE PARALO in the Tribe of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean,</hi> Lord <hi>Strategus</hi> of <hi>Oceana</hi> (tho in a new Commonwealth a very prudent Magiſtrat) propos'd his part or opinion in ſuch a manner to the Council of State, that paſſing the Ballot of the ſame with great unanimity and applauſe, it was introduc'd into the Senat, where it paſt with greater. Wherfore the Decree being forthwith printed and publiſh'd, Copys were return'd by the Secretarys to the <hi>Phylarchs</hi> (which is the manner of Promulgation) and the Commiſſioners of the Seal, that is to ſay, the Right Honorable PHOSPHORUS DE AUGE in the Tribe of <hi>Eudia,</hi> DOLABELLA D' ENYO in the Tribe of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi> and LINCEUS DE STELLA in the Tribe of <hi>Nubia,</hi> being elected Propoſers <hi>pro tempore,</hi> beſpoke of the Tribuns a Muſter of the People to be held that day ſix weeks, which was the time allow'd for Promulgation at the <hi>Halo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Satisfaction which the People throout the Tribes receiv'd upon promulgation of the Decree, loaded the Carriers with weekly Letters between Friend and Friend, whether Magiſtrats or privat Perſons. But the day for Propoſition being com, and the Prerogative upon the Place appointed in Diſciplin, SANGUINE DE RING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WOOD in the Tribe of <hi>Saltum,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Phaenix,</hi> march'd by order of the Tribuns with his Troop to the Piazza of the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> where his Trumpets entering into the great Hall by their Blazon gave notice of his Arrival; at which the Serjeant of the Houſe came down, and returning inform'd the Propoſers, who deſcending were receiv'd at the foot of the Stairs by the Captain, and attended to the Coaches of State, with which CALCAR DE GILVO in the Tribe of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lera</hi> Maſter of the Horſe, and the Ballotins upon their great Horſes, ſtood waiting at the Gate.</p>
                  <p>THE Propoſers being in their Coaches, the Train for the Pomp, the ſame that is us'd at the reception of Embaſſadors, proceded in this order: In the Front march'd the Troop with the Cornet in the Van, and the Captain in the Rear: next the Troop came the twenty Meſſengers or Trumpets; the Ballotins upon the Curvet with their Uſher in the Van, and the Maſter of the Horſe in the Rear: Next the Ballotins, BRONCUS DE RAUCO in the Tribe of <hi>Beſtia</hi> King of the Heralds, with his Fraternity in their Coats of Arms; and next to Sir BRONCHUS, BORISTHENES DE HOLIWATER in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49467:136"/>
the Tribe of <hi>Ave,</hi> Maſter of the Ceremonys: The Mace and the Seal of the Chancery went immediatly before the Coaches; and on either ſide, the Doorkeepers or Guard of the Senat, with their Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes, accompany'd with ſom three or four hundred Footmen belonging to the Knights or Senators; the Trumpeters, Ballotins, Guards, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilions, Coachmen and Footmen, being very gallant in the Liverys of the Commonwealth; but all, except the Ballotins, without Hats, in lieu wherof they wore black velvet Calots, being pointed with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle peak at the forehead. After the Propoſers came a long file of Coaches full of ſuch Gentlemen as uſe to grace the Commonwealth upon the like occaſions. In this poſture they mov'd ſlowly thro the ſtreets (affording in the gravity of the Pomp, and the welcomneſs of the end, a moſt reverend and acceptable Proſpect to the People all the way from the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> being about half a mile) and arriv'd at the <hi>Halo,</hi> where they found the Prerogative in a cloſe body inviron'd with Scaffolds that were cover'd with Spectators. The Tribuns receiv'd the Propoſers, and conducted them into a Seat plac'd in the front of the Tribe, like a Pulpit, but that it was of ſom length, and well adorn'd by the Heralds with all manner of Birds and Beaſts, except that they were ill painted, and never a one of his natural color. The Tribuns were plac'd at a Table that ſtood below the long Seat, thoſe of the Horſe in the middle, and thoſe of the Foot at either end, with each of them a Boul or Baſon before him, that on the right hand being white, and the other green: In the middle of the Table ſtood a third which was red. And the Houſekeeper of the Pavilion, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deliver'd a proportion of linen Balls or Pellets to every one of the Tribe, now preſented Boxes to the Ballotins. But the Propoſers as they enter'd the Gallery, or long Seat, having put off their Hats by way of Salutation, were anſwer'd by the People with a ſhout; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the younger Commiſſioners ſeated themſelves at either end; and the firſt ſtanding in the middle, ſpoke after this manner.</p>

The Sword of War, if it be any otherwiſe us'd than as the Sword of Magiſtracy, for the fear and puniſhment of thoſe that do evil, is as guilty in the ſight of God, as the Sword of a Murderer; nay more, for if the Blood of ABEL, of one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Man, cry'd in the ears of the Lord for Vengeance, what ſhall the Blood of an innocent Nation? Of this kind of Empire, the Throne of Ambition, and the Quarry of a mighty Hunter, it has bin truly ſaid, that it is but a great Robbery. But if ALEXAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER had reſtor'd the Liberty of <hi>Greece,</hi> and propagated it to mankind, he had don like my Lord ARCHON, and might have bin truly call'd the Great. ALEXANDER car'd not to ſteal a Victory that would be given: But my Lord ARCHON has torn away a Victory which had bin ſtol'n, while we were tamely yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Obedience to a <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Royal Line.</note>Nation reaping in our Fields, whoſe Fields he has ſubjected to our Empire, and nail'd them with his victorious Sword to their native <hi>Caucaſus.</hi>

And yet by how much his Virtue, that is crown'd with the perfection of his Work, is beyond theirs, who were either inferior in their aim, or in their performance; by ſo much is my Lord ARCHON to be prefer'd before SOLON, LYCURGUS, BRUTUS, and PUBLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COLA.</q>

                  <p>THE propoſer having ended his Oration, the Trumpets ſounded; and the Tribuns of the Horſe being mounted to view the Ballot, caus'd the Tribe (which thronging up to the Speech, came almoſt round the Gallery) to retreat about twenty paces, when LINCEUS DE STELLA receiving the Propoſitions, repair'd with BRONCHUS DE RAUCO the Herald, to a little Scaffold erected in the middle of the Tribe, where he ſeated himſelf, the Herald ſtanding bare upon his right hand. The <hi>Ballotins</hi> having their Boxes ready, ſtood before the Gallery, and at the command of the Tribuns march'd, one to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Troop on Horſeback, and one to every Company on Foot; each of them being follow'd by other Children that bore red Boxes: now this is putting the Queſtion, whether the Queſtion ſhould be put. And the Suffrage being very ſuddenly return'd to the Tribuns at the Table, and number'd in the view of the Propoſers, the Votes were all in the Affirmative: wherupon the red or doubtful Boxes were laid aſide, it appearing that the Tribe, whether for the Negative or Affirmative, was clear in the matter. Wherfore the Herald began from the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold in the middle of the Tribe, to pronounce the firſt Propoſition, and the <hi>Ballotins</hi> marching with the Negative and Affirmative only, BRONCHUS with his Voice like Thunder, continu'd to repeat the Propoſition over and over again, ſo long as it was in Ballotting. The like was don for every Clauſe, till the Ballot was finiſh'd, and the Tribuns aſſembling, had ſign'd the Points, that is to ſay, the number of every Suffrage, as it was taken by the Secretary upon the tale of the Tribuns, and in the ſight of the Propoſers; for this may not be omitted, it is the pulſe of the People. Now wheras it appertains to the Tribuns to report the Suffrage of the People to the Senat, they caſt the Lot for this Office with three ſilver Balls, and one gold one; and it fell upon the Right Worſhipful ARGUS DE CROOKHORN in the Tribe of <hi>Paſcua,</hi> firſt Tribun of the Foot. ARGUS being a good ſufficient man in his own Country, was yet of the mind that he ſhould make but a bad Spokeſman; and therfore became ſomthing blank at his luck, till his Collegues perſwaded him that it was no ſuch great matter, if he could but read, having his Paper before him. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers taking Coach, receiv'd a Volly upon the Field, and return'd in the ſame order, ſave that being accompany'd with the Tribuns, they were alſo attended by the whole Prerogative to the Piazza of the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> where with another Volly they took their leaves. ARGUS, who had not thought upon his Wife and Children all the way, went very gravely up: and every one being ſeated, the Senat by their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſeem'd to call for the Report; which ARGUS ſtanding up, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in this wiſe.</p>

                                 <q>BUT as concerning my Lord ARCHON (as I was ſaying) theſe are to ſignify to you the true-heartedneſs and good-will which is in the People, ſeeing by joining with you, as one man, they confeſs that all they have to give, is too little for his Highneſs. For truly, Fathers, if he who is able to do harm, and dos none, may well be call'd honeſt; What ſhall we ſay to my Lord ARCHON'S High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who having had it in his power to have don us the greateſt miſchief that ever befel a poor Nation, ſo willing to truſt ſuch as they thought well of, has don us ſo much good, as we ſhould never have known how to do our ſelves? which was ſo ſweetly deliver'd by my Lord Chancellor PHOSPORUS to the People, that I dare ſay there was never a one of them could forbear to do as I do—An't pleaſe your Fatherhoods, they be tears of Joy. Ay, my Lord ARCHON ſhall walk the ſtreets (if it be for his eaſe I mean) with a Switch, while the People run after him, and pray for him: he ſhall not wet his foot; they will ſtrew flowers in his way: he ſhall ſit higher in their hearts, and in the Judgment of all good men, than the Kings that go up ſtairs to their Seats; and one of theſe had as good pull two or three of his fellows out of their great Chairs, as wrong him, or meddle with him; he has two or three hundred thouſand men, that when you ſay the word, ſhall ſell themſelves to their ſhirts for him, and dy at his foot. His Pillow is of Down, and his Grave ſhall be as ſoft, over which they that are alive ſhall wring their hands. And to com to your Fatherhoods, moſt truly ſo call'd, as being the loving Parents of the People, truly you do not know what a feeling they have of your Kindneſs, ſeeing you are ſo bound up, that if there coms any harm, they may thank themſelves. And, alas! poor Souls, they ſee that they are given to be of ſo many minds, that tho they always mean well, yet if there coms any good, they may thank them that teach them better. Wherfore there was never ſuch a thing as this invented, they do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe that it is no other than the ſame which they always had in their very heads, if they could have but told how to bring it out. As now for a ſample; My Lords the Propoſers had no ſooner ſaid your minds, than they found it to be that which heart could wiſh. And your Fatherhoods may comfort your ſelves, that there is not a People in the world more willing to learn what is for
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49467:138"/>
their own good, nor more apt to ſee it, when you have ſhew'd it them. Wherfore they do love you as they do their own ſelves; honor you as Fathers; reſolve to give you as it were Obedience for ever: and ſo thanking you for your moſt good and excellent Laws, they do pray for you as the very Worthys of the Land, Right Honorable Lords and Fathers aſſembl'd in Parlament.</q>

                     <hi>ARG<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> came off beyond his own expectation; for thinking right, and ſpeaking as he thought, it was apparent by the Houſe, and the thanks they gave him, that they eſteem'd him to be abſolutely of the beſt ſort of Orators; upon which having a mind that till then miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave him, he became very crounſe, and much delighted with that which might go down the next week in print to his Wife and Neighbors. LIVY makes the <hi>Roman</hi> Tribuns to ſpeak in the ſame ſtile with the Conſuls, which could not be, and therfore for ought in him to the contrary, VOLERO and CANULEIUS might have ſpoken in no better ſtile than ARGUS. However, they were not created the firſt year of the Commonwealth; and the Tribuns of <hi>Oceana</hi> are ſince becom better Orators than were needful. But the Laws being enacted, had the Preamble annex'd, and were deliver'd to BRONCHUS, who lov'd nothing in the Earth ſo much as to go ſtaring and bellowing up and down the Town, like a Stag in a Foreſt, as he now did, with his fraternity in their Coats of Arms, and I know not how many Trumpets, proclaiming the Act of Parlament; when meeting my Lord ARCHON, who from a retreat that was without Affectation, as being for Devotion only, and to implore a Bleſſing by Prayer and Faſting upon his Labors, now newly arriv'd in Town, the Herald of the Tribe of <hi>Beſtia</hi> ſet up his throat, and having chanted out his Leſſon, paſt as haughtily by him, as if his own had bin the better Office; which in this place was very well taken, tho BRONCHUS for his high mind happen'd afterwards upon ſom diſaſters, too long to tell, that ſpoil'd much of his Imbroidery.</p>
                  <p>MY Lord ARCHON'S Arrival being known, the Signory, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by the Tribuns, repair'd to him, with the news he had already heard by the Herald; to which my Lord Strategus added, That his Highneſs could not doubt upon the Demonſtrations given, but the minds of Men were firm in the opinion, that he could be no ſeeker of himſelf in the way of earthly Pomp and Glory: and that the Gratitude of the Senat, and the People, could not therfore be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to have any ſuch reflection upon him. But ſo it was, that in regard of Dangers abroad, and Partys at home, they durſt not truſt themſelves without a ſtanding Army, nor a ſtanding Army in any man's hands but thoſe of his Highneſs.</p>
                  <p>THE ARCHON made anſwer, that he ever expected this would be the ſenſe of the Senat and the People; and this being their ſenſe, he ſhould have bin ſorry they had made choice of any other than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a ſtanding General: Firſt, Becauſe it could not have bin more to their own ſafety: And, Secondly, Becauſe ſo long as they ſhould have need of a ſtanding Army, his work was not done: That he would not diſpute againſt the Judgment of the Senat and the People, nor ought that to be. Nevertheleſs, he made little doubt but experience would ſhew every Party their own Intereſt in this Government, and that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter improv'd than they could expect from any other; that Mens ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſitys
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49467:139"/>
ſhould overbalance their Intereſt for any time, was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that humor could never be laſting, nor, thro the Conſtitution of the Government, of any effect at the firſt charge. For ſuppoſing the worſt, and that the People had choſen no other into the Senat and the Prerogative than Royaliſts, a matter of fourteen hundred men muſt have taken their Oaths at their Election, with an intention to go quite contrary, not only to their Oaths ſo taken, but to their own Intereſt; for being eſtated in the Soverain Power, they muſt have decreed it from themſelves (ſuch an example for which there was never any experience, nor can there be any reaſon) or holding it, it muſt have don in their hands as well every whit as in any other. Furthermore, they muſt have remov'd the Government from a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation that apparently would hold, to ſet it upon another which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently would not hold; vvhich things if they could not com to paſs, the Senat and the People conſiſting vvholly of Royaliſts, much leſs by a parcel of them elected. But if the fear of the Senat and of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple deriv'd from a Party without, ſuch a one as vvould not be elected, nor ingage themſelves to the Commonwealth by an Oath; this again muſt be ſo large, as would go quite contrary to their own Intereſt, they being as free and as fully eſtated in their Liberty as any other, or ſo narrow that they could do no hurt, vvhile the People being in Arms, and at the beck of the Strategus, every Tribe vvould at any time make a better Army than ſuch a Party; and there being no Partys at home, fears from abroad vvould vaniſh. But ſeeing it vvas otherwiſe determin'd by the Senat and the People, the beſt courſe vvas to take that which they held the ſafeſt, in vvhich vvith his humble thanks for their great bounty, he was reſolv'd to ſerve them vvith all Duty and Obedience.</p>
                  <p>A VERY ſhort time after the Royaliſts, now equal Citizens, made good the ARCHON'S Judgment, there being no other that found any thing near ſo great a ſweet in the Government. For he who has not bin acquainted with Affliction, ſays SENECA, knows but half the things of this world.</p>
                  <p>MOREOVER they ſaw plainly, that to reſtore the antient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they muſt caſt up their Eſtates into the hands of three hundred men; wherfore in caſe the Senat and the Prerogative, conſiſting of thirteen hundred men, had bin all Royaliſts, there muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have bin, and be for ever, one thouſand againſt this or any ſuch Vote. But the Senat being inform'd by the Signory, that the ARCHON had accepted of his Dignity and Office, caus'd a third Chair to be ſet for his Highneſs, between thoſe of the Strategus and the Orator in the Houſe, the like at every Council; to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd, not of neceſſity, but at his pleaſure, being the beſt, and, as ARGUS not vainly ſaid, the greateſt Prince in the World: for in the Pomp of his Court he was not inferior to any, and in the Field he was follow'd with a Force that was formidable to all. Nor was there a cauſe in the nature of this Conſtitution to put him to the charge of Guards, to ſpoil his ſtomach or his ſleep: Inſomuch, as being hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly diſputed by the Wits of the Academy, whether my Lord ARCHON, if he had bin ambitious, could have made himſelf ſo great, it was carry'd clear in the Negative; not only for the Reaſons drawn from the preſent balance, which was Popular; but putting the caſe the balance had bin Monarchical. For there be ſom Nations,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49467:139"/>
wherof this is one, that will bear a Prince in a Commonwealth far higher than it is poſſible for them to bear a Monarch. <hi>Spain</hi> look'd upon the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> as her moſt formidable Enemy; but if ever there be a Monarch in <hi>Holland,</hi> he will be the <hi>Spaniards</hi> beſt friend. For wheras a Prince in a Commonwealth derives his Greatneſs from the root of the People, a Monarch derives his from one of thoſe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances which nip them in the root; by which means the <hi>Low Countrys</hi> under a Monarch were poor and inconſiderable, but in bearing a Prince could grow to a miraculous height, and give the Glory of his Actions by far the upper hand of the greateſt King in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> There are Kings in <hi>Europe,</hi> to whom a King of <hi>Oceana</hi> would be but a <hi>petit Companion.</hi> But the Prince of this Commonwealth is the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and the Judg of them all.</p>
                  <p>THAT which my Lord ARCHON now minded moſt, was the Agrarian, upon which Debate he inceſſantly thruſt the Senat and the Council of State; to the end it might be planted upon ſom firm root, as the main point and baſis of perpetuity to the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>AND theſe are ſom of the moſt remarkable Paſſages that happen'd in the firſt year of this Government. About the latter end of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the Army was disbanded, but the Taxes continu'd at thirty thouſand Pounds a month, for three years and a half. By which means a piece of Artillery was planted, and a portion of Land to the value of 50 <hi>l.</hi> a year purchas'd for the maintenance of the Games, and of the Prize arms for ever, in each Hundred.</p>
                  <p>WITH the eleventh year of the Commonwealth, the term of the Exciſe, allotted for the maintenance of the Senat and the People, and for the raiſing of a public Revenue, expir'd. By which time the Exchequer, over and above the annual Salarys, amounting to three hundred thouſand Pounds, accumulating every year out of one Million incom ſeven hundred thouſand Pounds in Banco, brought it with a product of the Sum, riſing to about eight Millions in the whole: wherby at ſeveral times they had purchas'd to the Senat and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple four hundred thouſand Pounds <hi>per annum</hi> ſolid Revenue; which, beſides the Lands held in <hi>Panopea,</hi> together with the Perquiſits of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Province, was held ſufficient for a public Revenue. Nevertheleſs, Taxes being now wholly taken off, the Exciſe of no great burden (and many ſpecious advantages not vainly propos'd in the heightning of the public Revenue) was very chearfully eſtabliſh'd by the Senat and the People, for the term of ten years longer; and the ſame courſe being taken, the public Revenue was found in the one and twentieth of the Commonwealth, to be worth one Million in good Land. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Exciſe was ſo aboliſh'd for the preſent, as withal reſolv'd to be the beſt, the moſt fruitful and eaſy way of raiſing Taxes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to future Exigencys. But the Revenue being now ſuch as was able to be a yearly Purchaſer, gave a jealouſy that by this means the balance of the Commonwealth, conſiſting in privat Fortunes, might be eaten out; whence this year is famous for that Law wherby the Senat and the People forbidding any further purchaſe of Lands to the Public within the Dominions of <hi>Oceana</hi> and the adjacent Provinces, put the Agrarian upon the Commonwealth her ſelf. Theſe Increaſes are things which Men, addicted to Monarchy, deride as impoſſible, wherby they unwarily urge a ſtrong Argument againſt that which they would defend. For having their eys fix'd upon the Pomp and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49467:140"/>
Expence, by which not only every Child of a King being a Prince, exhauſts his Father's Coffers; but Favorits and ſervil Spirits, devoted to the flattery of thoſe Princes, grow inſolent and profuſe, returning a fit Gratitude to their Maſters, whom while they hold it honorable to deceive, they ſuck and keep eternally poor: It follows that they do not ſee how it ſhould be poſſible for a Commonwealth to clothe her ſelf in Purple, and thrive ſo ſtrangely upon that which would make a Prince's hair grow thro his hood, and not afford him bread. As if it were a Miracle that a careleſs and prodigal Man ſhould bring ten thouſand Pounds a year to nothing, or that an induſtrious and frugal Man brings a little to ten thouſand Pounds a year. But the fruit of one man's induſtry and frugality can never be like that of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; Firſt, becauſe the greatneſs of the Increaſe follows the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Stock or Principal: And, Secondly, becauſe a frugal Father is for the moſt part ſucceded by a laviſh Son; wheras a Commonwealth is her own Heir.</p>
                  <p>THIS year a part was propos'd by the Right Honorable AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REUS DE WOOLSACK in the Tribe of <hi>Pecus,</hi> firſt Commiſſioner of the Treaſury, to the Council of State, which ſoon after paſt the Ballot of the Senat and the People: by which the Lands of the Public Revenue, amounting to one Million, were equally divided into five thouſand Lots, enter'd by their names and parcels into a Lotbook pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the Exchequer. And if any Orphan, being a Maid, ſhould caſt her Eſtate into the Exchequer for fourteen hundred Pounds, the Treaſury was bound by the Law to pay her quarterly two hundred Pounds a year, free from Taxes, for her Life, and to aſſign her a Lot for her Security: if ſhe marry'd, her Husband was neither to take out the Principal without her conſent (acknowleg'd by her ſelf to one of the Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, who according as he found it to be free, or forc'd, was to allow or diſallow of it) nor any other way ingage it, than to her proper uſe. But if the Principal were taken out, the Treaſury was not bound to repay any more of it than one thouſand Pounds; nor might that be repaid at any time, ſave within the firſt year of her Marriage: the like was to be don by a half or quarter Lot reſpectively.</p>
                  <p>THIS was found to be a great Charity to the weaker Sex, and as ſom ſay, who are more skilful in the like Affairs than my ſelf, of good Profit to the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>NOW began the native Spleen of <hi>Oceana</hi> to be much purg'd, and Men not to affect Sullenneſs and Pedantiſm. The Elders could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that they had bin Youth. Wit and Gallantry were ſo far from being thought Crimes in themſelves, that care was taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their innocence. For which cauſe it was propos'd to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for Religion by the Right Honorable CADISCUS DE CLERO, in the Tribe of <hi>Stamnum,</hi> firſt Cenſor, That ſuch Women as living in Gallantry and View about the Town, were of evil fame, and could not ſhew that they were maintain'd by their own Eſtates or Induſtry; or ſuch as having Eſtates of their own, were yet waſtful in their way of life, and of ill example to others, ſhould be obnoxious to the animadverſion of the Council of Religion, or of the Cenſors: In which the proceding ſhould be after this manner. Notice ſhould be firſt given of the ſcandal to the party offending, in privat: if there were no amendment within the ſpace of ſix months, ſhe ſhould be
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49467:140"/>
ſummon'd and rebuk'd before the ſaid Council or Cenſors; and, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other ſix months it were found that neither this avail'd, ſhe ſhould be cenſured not to appear at any public Meetings, Games, or Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon penalty of being taken up by the Doorkeepers, or Guards of the Senat, and by them to be detain'd, till for every ſuch Offence, five Pounds were duly paid for her inlargement.</p>
                  <p>FURTHERMORE, if any common Strumpet ſhould be found, or any ſcurrility or profaneneſs repreſented at either of the Theaters, the Prelats for every ſuch Offence ſhould be fin'd twenty Pounds by the ſaid Council, and the Poet, for every ſuch offence on his part, ſhould be whipt. This Law relates to another, which alſo was enacted the ſame year upon this occaſion.</p>
                  <p>THE Youth and Wits of the Academy having put the Buſineſs ſo home in the defence of Comedys, that the Provoſts had nothing but the Conſequences provided againſt by the foregoing Law to object, prevail'd ſo far, that two of the Provoſts of the Council of State join'd in a Propoſition, which after much ado came to a Law, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one hundred thouſand pounds was allotted for the building of two Theaters on each ſide of the Piazza of the <hi>Halo:</hi> and two annual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats cal'd <hi>Prelats,</hi> choſen out of the Knights, were added to the Tropic, the one call'd the Prelat of the Buskin, for inſpection of the Tragic Scene call'd <hi>Melpomene;</hi> and the other the Prelat of the Sock, for the Comic call'd <hi>Thalia,</hi> which Magiſtrats had each five hundred pounds a year allow'd out of the Profits of the Theaters; the reſt, except eight hundred a year to four Poets, payable into the Exchequer. A Poet Laureat created in one of theſe Theaters, by the <hi>Strategus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a Wreath of five hundred pounds in Gold, paid out of the ſaid Profits. But no man is capable of this Creation, that had not two parts in three of the Suffrages at the Academy, aſſembl'd after ſix weeks warning, and upon that occaſion.</p>
                  <p>THESE things among us are ſure enough to be cenſur'd, but by ſuch only as do not know the nature of a Commonwealth: for to tell men that they are free, and yet to curb the genius of a People in a lawful Recreation, to which they are naturally inclin'd, is to tell a tale of a Tub. I have heard the Proteſtant Miniſters in <hi>France,</hi> by men that were wiſe, and of their own profeſſion, much blam'd in that they forbad Dancing, a Recreation to which the genius of that Air is ſo inclining, that they loſt many who would not loſe that: Nor do they leſs than blame the former determination of raſhneſs, who now gently connive at that which they had ſo roughly forbidden. Theſe Sports in <hi>Oceana</hi> are ſo govern'd, that they are pleaſing for privat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and profitable to the Public: For the Theaters ſoon defray'd their own charge, and now bring in a good Revenue. All this is ſo far from the detriment of Virtue, that it is to the improvement of it, ſeeing Women that heretofore made havock of their Honors that they might have their Pleaſures, are now incapable of their Pleaſures, if they loſe their Honors.</p>
                  <p>ABOUT the one and fortieth year of the Commonwealth, the Cenſors, according to their annual Cuſtom, reported the Pillar of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> by which it was found that the People were increas'd very near one third. Wherupon the Council of War was appointed by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat to bring in a State of War, and the Treaſurers the State of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury. The State of War, or the Pay and Charge of an Army, was ſoon after exhibited by the Council in this Account.</p>

BUT I cannot depart out of this Country, till I have taken leave of my Lord ARCHON, a Prince of immenſe Felicity, who having built as high with his Counſils, as he dig'd deep with his Sword, had now ſeen fifty years meaſur'd with his own inerring Orbs.</p>

                     <hi>TIMOLEON</hi> (ſuch a hater of Tyrants, that not able to perſuade his Brother TIMOPHANES to relinquiſh the Tyranny of <hi>Corinth,</hi> he ſlew him) was afterwards elected by the People (the <hi>Sicilians</hi> groaning to them from under the like burden) to be ſent to their relief: Wherupon TELECLIDES the Man at that time of moſt Authority in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſtood up, and giving an Exhortation to TIMOLEON, how he ſhould behave himſelf in his Expedition, told him, that if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd the <hi>Sicilians</hi> to Liberty, it would be acknowleg'd that he had deſtroy'd a Tyrant; if otherwiſe, he muſt expect to hear that he had murder'd a King. TIMOLEON taking his leave, with a very ſmall Proviſion for ſo great a Deſign, purſu'd it with a Courage not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to, and a Felicity beyond any that had bin known to that day in mortal Fleſh, having in the ſpace of eight years utterly rooted out of all <hi>Sicily</hi> thoſe Weeds of Tyranny, thro the deteſtation wherof men fled in ſuch abundance from their Native Country, that whole Citys were left deſolat; and brought it to ſuch a paſs, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thro the fame of his Virtues, and the excellency of the Soil, flockt as faſt from all Quarters to it, as to the Garden of the World: While he, being preſented by the People of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> with his Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and his Country Retreat, the ſweeteſt Places in either, liv'd with his Wife and Children a moſt quiet, happy, and holy Life; for he attributed no part of his Succeſs to himſelf, but all to the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Providence of the Gods. As he paſt his time in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, admir'd and honor'd by Mankind, LAPHISTIUS an envious Demagog, going to ſummon him upon ſom pretence or other to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for himſelf before the Aſſembly, the People fell into ſuch a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, as could not be appeas'd but by TIMOLEON, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the matter, reprov'd them, by repeating the pains and travel which he had gon thro, to no other end than that every Man might have the free uſe of the Laws. Wherfore when DAEMENETUS ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Demagog, had brought the ſame Deſign about again, and blam'd him impertinently to the People for things which he did when he was General, TIMOLEON anſwer'd nothing, but raiſing up his hands, gave the Gods thanks for their return to his frequent Prayers, that he might but live to ſee the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> ſo free, that they could queſtion whom they pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>NOT long after being old, thro ſom natural imperfection, he fell blind; but the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> by their perpetual viſits held him, tho he could not ſee, their greateſt Object: if there arriv'd Strangers, they brought them to ſee this ſight. Whatever came in debate at the Aſſembly, if it were of ſmall conſequence, they determin'd it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but if of importance, they always ſent for TIMOLEON; who being brought by his Servants in a Chair, and ſet in the middle of the Theater, there ever follow'd a great ſhout, after which ſom time was allow'd for the Benedictions of the People; and then the matter propos'd, when TIMOLEON had ſpoken to it, was put to the Suffrage; which given, his Servants bore him back in his Chair, accompany'd by the People clapping their hands, and making all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Joy and Applauſe, till leaving him at his Houſe, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49467:142"/>
to the diſpatch of their Buſineſs. And this was the Life of TIMOLEON, till he dy'd of Age, and drop'd like a mature Fruit, while the Eys of the People were as the Showers of Autumn.</p>
                  <p>THE Life and Death of my Lord ARCHON (but that he had his Senſes to the laſt, and that his Character, as not the Reſtorer, but the Founder of a Commonwealth, was greater) is ſo exactly the ſame, that (ſeeing by Men wholly ignorant of Antiquity, I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd of writing Romance) I ſhall repeat nothing: but tell you that this year the whole Nation of <hi>Oceana,</hi> even to the Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were in mourning, where ſo great or ſad a Funeral Pomp had never bin ſeen or known.

                     <hi>VVHOSOEVER ſheds mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed; for in the Image of God made he Man.</hi> If this Rule holds as well in ſhedding the blood of a <hi>Turk</hi> as of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> then <hi>that wherin Man is the Image of God is REASON.</hi> Of all Controverſys, thoſe of the Pen are the moſt honorable: for in thoſe of Force, there is more of the Image of the Beaſt, but in thoſe of the Pen there is more of the Image of God. In the Controverſys of the Sword, there is but too often no other Reaſon than Force; but the Controverſy of the Pen has never any Force but Reaſon. Of all Controverſys of the Pen next thoſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, thoſe of Government are the moſt honorable, and the moſt uſeful; the true end of each, tho in a different way, being that the Will of God may be <hi>don in Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> Of all Controverſys of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thoſe in the vindication of Popular Government are the moſt noble, as being that Conſtitution alone, from whence all we have that is good is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to us; and which, if it had not exiſted, Mankind at this day had bin but a Herd of Beaſts. The Prerogative of Popular Government muſt either be in an ill hand, or elſe it is a game againſt which there is not a Card in the wole pack; for we have the Books of <hi>MOSES,</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Greecs</hi> and of the <hi>Romans,</hi> not to omit <hi>MACCHIAVEL,</hi> all for it. What have the Aſſerters of Monarchy; what can they have againſt us? A Sword; but that ruſts, or muſt have a Scabbard; and the Scabbard of this kind of Sword is a good frame of Government.</p>
                  <p>A MAN may be poſſeſt of a piece of Ground by force, but to make uſe or profit of it, he muſt build upon it, and till it by Reaſon; <hi>for whatever is not founded upon Reaſon, cannot be permanent.</hi> In Reaſon there are two parts, <hi>Invention</hi> and <hi>Judgment:</hi> As to the latter, <hi>In a multitude of Counſillors</hi> (ſay both <hi>SOLOMON</hi> and <hi>MACCHIAVEL) there is ſtrength.</hi> Nay as for Judgment, there is not that Order in Art or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that can compare with a Popular Aſſembly. <hi>THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE IS THE VOICE OF GOD.</hi> Hence it is that in all well-order'd Policys the People have the ultimat reſult: but unleſs there be ſom other to invent, a Popular Aſſembly can be of no effect at all but Confuſion. <hi>Invention</hi> is a ſolitary thing. All the Phyſicians in the world put together, invented not the Circulation of the Blood, nor can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any ſuch thing, tho in their own Art; yet this was invented by one alone, and being invented, is unanimouſly voted and imbrac'd by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Phyſicians. The Plow and Wheels were at firſt, you muſt think, the invention of ſom rare Artiſts; but who or what ſhall ever be able to tear the uſe of them from the People? Hence, where Government is at a loſs, a ſole Legiſlator is of abſolute neceſſity; nay where it is not at a loſs, if well model'd, as in <hi>Venice,</hi> the Propoſers, tho frequently change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as in that caſe is neceſſary, are very few, as the <hi>Counſillors,</hi> the <hi>Savi,</hi> the <hi>Provoſts.</hi> Wherever a Commonwealth is thus propos'd to, the Balance or Popular Aſſembly will do her duty to admiration, but till then never. Yet ſo it has bin with us of late years, that altho in Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

there was no more than the right of Propoſing, and the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was to ſtand <hi>(legibus &amp; conſuetudinibus quas vulgas elegerit)</hi> to the reſult of the People, yet the popular Council has bin put upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and they that have bin the prevailing Party have us'd means to keep the Reſult to themſelves, quite contrary to the nature of Popular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. <hi>Let one ſpeak, and the reſt judg.</hi> Of whatever any one man can ſay or do, Mankind is the natural and competent Judg, in which is contain'd the very reaſon of Parlaments; thro the want of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this came in confuſion. <hi>Man that is in Honor, and has no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is like the Beaſts that periſh.</hi> Nor can we poſſibly return to Order, but by mending the Hedg where it was broken. A prudent, intire and ſit Propoſition made to a free Parlament, recovers all. To them who are of the greateſt Eminency or Authority in a Commonwealth, belongs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally that part of Reaſon which is Invention; and uſing this, they are to propoſe: but what did our Grandees ever invent or propoſe, that might ſhew ſo much as that themſelves knew what they would be at? and yet how confidently do they lay the fault upon the People, and their unfitneſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, for Government: in which they are wondrous wiſe! For, this I will boldly ſay, Where there was an Ariſtocracy that perform'd their duty, there never was, nor ever can be a People unfit for Government; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, where the Ariſtocracy have fail'd, the People being once under Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, have held very often. But while they are not under Orders, if they fail it is not their fault, but the fault of the Ariſtocracy; for who elſe ſhould model a Government but men of Experience? There is not in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I ſpeak it to their ſhame, one <hi>GRANDEE</hi> that has any perfect knowlege of the Orders of any one Commonwealth that ever was in the World. Away with this ſame grave complexion, this huff of Wiſdom maintain'd by making faces. The People cannot do their duty conſiſting in Judgment, but by virtue of ſuch Orders as may bring them together, and direct them; but the duty of the Ariſtocracy conſiſting in Invention, may be don by any one man, and in his ſtudy; and where is that one man among all the Grandees that ſtudys? They are ſo far from knowing their own duty, that a man for propoſing that in which none can find a flaw, has don enough to be ridiculous to them, who are themſelves ridiculous to the whole World, in that they could never yet propoſe any thing that would hold.</p>
                  <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T if this amounts to a Demonſtration, it amounts to a clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of your profound Grandees, and a full proof that they are Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Perſons, State Jeſuits, ſuch as have reduc'd the Politics to mental Reſervation and implicit Faith in their nods or nightcaps.</p>
                  <p>GOD, to propoſe his Commandments to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> wrote them on two Tables; the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> to propoſe their Commandments to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> wrote them on twelve Tables; the <hi>Athenians</hi> propos'd in writing, ſign'd with the name of the particular Inventor; after this pattern do the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as was ſaid, the ſame at this day. But no Gooſquill, no Scribling: Your Grandees are above this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>MOSES,</hi> who was the firſt Writer in this kind, ſhall be pardon'd; but <hi>MACCHIAVEL,</hi> the firſt in later times that has reviv'd his Principles, or trod in his ſteps, is deſervedly pelted for it by Sermons. They are not for the Scripture, but the <hi>Cabala.</hi>

                  <p>IT is commonly ſaid, and not without incouragement by ſom who think they have <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> by the horns, <hi>that the Univerſity has laſh'd me:</hi> ſo it ſeems I have to do with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, and laſhing is lawful; with both which I am contented. In <hi>Moorfields,</hi> while the People are buſy at their ſports, they often and ridiculouſly loſe their Buttons, their Ribbands, and their Purſes; where if they light, as ſomtimes they do, upon the Maſters of that Art, they fall a kicking them a while (which one may call a <hi>rude charge)</hi> and then to their work again. I know not whether I invite you to <hi>Moorfields,</hi> but <hi>(difficile eſt Satyram non ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere)</hi> all the favor I deſire at your hands is but this, that you would not ſo condemn one man for kicking, as in the ſame Act to pardon another for cutting of Purſes. A Gentleman that commits a fallacious Argument to writing, or gos about to ſatisfy others with ſuch Reaſons as he is not ſatisfy'd with himſelf, is no more a Gentleman but a Pickpocket; with this in my mind, I betake my ſelf to my work, or rather to draw open the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and begin the Play.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ONE that has written</hi> Conſiderations upon OCEANA, <hi>ſpeaks the Prolog in this manner:</hi> I beſeech you Gentlemen, are not we the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">Epiſt.</note>of Politics ſomwhat a ridiculous ſort of People? Is it not a fine piece of Folly for privat men ſitting in their Cabinets to rack their brains about Models of Government? Certainly our Labors make a very pleaſant recreation for thoſe great Perſonages, who, ſitting at the Helm of Affairs, have by their large Experience not only acquir'd the perfect Art of Ruling, but have attain'd alſo to the comprehenſion of the Nature and Foundation of Government. <hi>In which egregious Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Conſiderer has loſt his conſidering Cap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT was in the time of <hi>ALEXANDER,</hi> the greateſt Prince and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of his age, that <hi>ARISTOTLE,</hi> with ſcarce inferior Applauſe and equal Fame, being a privat man, wrote that excellent piece of Prudence in his Cabinet, which is call'd his <hi>Politics,</hi> going upon far other Principles than thoſe of <hi>ALEXANDER'S</hi> Government, which it has long outliv'd. The like did <hi>TITUS LIVIUS</hi> in the time of <hi>AUGUSTUS,</hi> Sir <hi>THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS MOOR</hi> in the time of <hi>HENRY</hi> the Eighth, and <hi>MACCHIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEL</hi> when <hi>Italy</hi> was under Princes that afforded him not the ear.

A man may be intruſted with a Ship, and a good Pilot too, yet not underſtand how to make Sea-charts. To ſay that a man may not write of Government except he be a Magiſtrat, is as abſurd as to ſay, that a man may not make a Sea-chart, unleſs he be a Pilot. It is known that <hi>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS</hi> made a Chart in his Cabinet, that found out the <hi>Indys.</hi> The Magiſtrat that was good at his Steerage never took it ill of him that brought him a Chart, ſeeing whether he would uſe it or no, was at his own choice; and if Flatterers, being the worſt ſort of Crows, did not pick out the eys of the living, the Ship of Government at this day

                     <p>THE Conſiderer (where by Antient Prudence I underſtand the Policy of a Commonwealth, and by Modern Prudence that of King, Lords, and Commons, which introduc'd by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> upon the ruin of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, has ſince reign'd in theſe Weſtern Countrys, till by the predominating of ſom one of the three parts, it be now almoſt univerſally extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd) thinks it enough for the confutation of this diſtinction, to ſhew out of THUCYDIDES that of Monarchy to be a more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Policy than that of a Commonwealth. Upon which occaſion, I muſt begin here to diſcover that which, the further I go, will be the more manifeſt; namely, that there is a difference between quoting Authors, and ſaying ſom part of them without book: this may be don by their words, but the former no otherwiſe than by keeping to their ſenſe. Now the ſenſe of THUCYDIDES, as he is tranſlated by Mr. HOBBS in the place alleg'd, is thus: <hi>The manner,</hi> ſays he, <note place="margin">Thu. B. 1. P. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.</note>
                        <hi>of living in the moſt antient times of</hi> Greece <hi>was Thieving; the ſtronger going abroad under the conduct of their moſt puiſſant Men, both to inrich themſelves, and fetch home maintenance for the weak:</hi> for there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Traffic, property of Lands, nor conſtant Abode, till MINOS <hi>built a Navy, and expelling the Malefactors out of the Iſlands, planted Colonys of his own, by which means they who inhabited the Seacoaſts, becoming more addicted to Riches, grew more conſtant to their dwellings: of whom ſom, grown now rich, compaſs'd their Towns about with Walls. For out of a deſire of Gain, the meaner ſort underwent Servitude with the Mighty; and the Mighty</hi> (thus overbalancing at home) <hi>with their Wealth, brought the leſſer Citys</hi> (abroad) <hi>into ſubjection.</hi> Thus PELOPS, <hi>tho he was a ſtranger, obtain'd ſuch Power in</hi> Peloponneſus, <hi>that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was call'd after his name.</hi> Thus ATREUS <hi>obtain'd the Kingdom of</hi> Mycenae; and thus <hi>Kingdoms with Honors limited came to be hereditary;</hi> and riſing to Power, proceded afterwards to the War againſt <hi>Troy.</hi> After the War with <hi>Troy, tho with much ado, and in a long time</hi> Greece <hi>had conſtant reſt</hi> (and Land without doubt came to Property) for <hi>ſhifting their ſeats no longer, at length they ſent Colonys abroad; the</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians <hi>into</hi> Ionia <hi>with the Iſlands, the</hi> Peloponneſians <hi>into</hi> Italy, Sicily, <hi>and other parts.

                        <hi>the cauſe of their preſent Sufferings, ſlipt into Popular Government, not that upon calm and mature Debates they found it beſt, but that they might put themſelves at the greateſt diſtance (which Spirit uſually accompanys all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations) from that with which they were grown into diſlike.</hi> Wherby he agrees exactly with his Author in making out the true Force and Nature of the Balance, working even without deliberation, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men will or no. For the Government that is natural and eaſy, being in no other direction than that of the reſpective Balance, is not of choice but of neceſſity. The Policy of King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, was not ſo much from the Prudence of our Anceſtors, as from their neceſſity. If three hundred men held at this day the like over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance to the whole People, it was not in the power of Prudence to inſtitute any other than the ſame kind of Government, thro the ſame neceſſity. Thus the meaner ſort with THUCYDIDES <hi>ſubmitting to the Mighty,</hi> it came to <hi>Kingdoms with hereditary Honors:</hi> but the People coming to be wealthy, call'd their Kings, tho they knew not why, <hi>Tyrants;</hi> nay, and uſing them accordingly, found out means, with as little deliberation it may be as a Bull takes to toſs a Dog, or a Hern to ſplit a Hauk (that is, rather, as at the long-run they will ever do in the like caſes, by Inſtinct, than Prudence or Debate) to thro down that, which by the mere information of ſenſe they could no longer bear; and which being thrown down, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eas'd. But the queſtion yet remains, and that is, forſooth, whether of theſe is to be call'd <hi>Antient Prudence.</hi> To this end, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man made a more unlucky choice than the Conſiderer has don for himſelf of this Author, who in the very beginning of his Book, ſpeaking of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, or that between the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> ſays, that <hi>the Actions which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded this, and thoſe again that were more antient, tho the truth of them thro length of time cannot by any means be clearly diſcover'd; yet for any Argument that (looking into times far paſt) he had yet lighted on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him, he dos not think they have bin very great either for matter of War, or otherwiſe;</hi> that is, for matter of Peace or Government.

                     <p>HEREBY it is plain, whether in an Empire of Laws, and not of Men, as a Commonwealth; or in an Empire of Men, and not of Laws, as Monarchy: Firſt, That Law muſt equally procede from

                     <head type="sub">Whether the Balance of Dominion in Land be the natural Cauſe of Empire?</head>
                     <p>THE Doctrin of the Balance is that, tho he ſtrains at it, which choaks the Prevaricator: for this of all others is that Principle which makes the Politics, not ſo before the invention of the ſame, to be undeniable throout, and (not to meddle with the Mathematics, an Art I underſtand as little as Mathematicians do this) the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable of any whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>FOR this cauſe I ſhall rather take pleaſure than pains to look back, or tread the ſame path with other, and perhaps plainer ſteps: as thus; If a man having one hundred pounds a year may keep one Servant, or have one man at his command, then having one hundred times ſo much, he may keep one hundred Servants; and this multiply'd by a thouſand, he may have one hundred thouſand men at his command. Now that the ſingle Perſon, or Nobility of any Country in <hi>Europe,</hi> that had but half ſo many men at command, would be King or Prince, is that which I think no man will doubt. But <note n="*" place="bottom">Point de Argent, point de Suiſſe.</note>
                        <hi>no Mony, no Switzers,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> ſpeak: If the Mony be flown, ſo are the Men alſo. Tho Riches in general have Wings, and be apt to bate; yet thoſe in Land are the moſt hooded, and ty'd to the Perch, wheras thoſe in Mony have the leaſt hold, and are the ſwifteſt of flight. A Bank where the Mony takes not wing, but to com home ſeiz'd, or like a Coyduck, may well be great; but the Treaſure of the <hi>Indys</hi> going out, and not upon returns, makes no Bank. Whence a Bank never paid an Army; or paying an Army, ſoon became no Bank. But where a Prince or a Nobility has an Eſtate in Land, the Revenue wherof will deſray this Charge, there their Men are planted, have Toes that are Roots, and Arms that bring forth what Fruit you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>THUS a ſingle Perſon is made, or a Nobility makes a King, not with difficulty, or any great prudence, but with eaſe, the reſt coming home, as the <hi>Ox that not only knows his Maſter's Crib,</hi> but muſt ſtarve or repair to it, Nor for the ſame reaſon is Government acquir'd with more eaſe than it is preſerv'd; that is, if the Foundation of Property
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49467:151"/>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Book </seg>I</label> be in Land: but if in Mony, <hi>lightly com, lightly go.</hi> The reaſon why a ſingle Perſon, or the Nobility that has one hundred thouſand men, or half ſo many at command, will have the Government, is that the Eſtate in Land, wherby they are able to maintain ſo many, in any <hi>European</hi> Territory, muſt overbalance the reſt that remains to the People, at leaſt three parts in four, by which means they are no more able to diſpute the Government with him or them, than your Servant is with you. Now for the ſame reaſon, if the People hold three parts in four of the Territory, it is plain there can neither be any ſingle Perſon nor Nobility able to diſpute the Government with them; in this caſe therfore, except Force be interpos'd, they govern themſelves. So by this computation of the Balance of Property or Dominion in Land, you have according to the threefold Foundation of Property, the Root or Generation of the threefold kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Empire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Oceana, <hi>p.</hi> 39.</note> IF one man be ſole Landlord of a Territory, or overbalance the whole People, three parts in four, or therabouts, he is Grand Signior; for ſo the <hi>Turc,</hi> not from his Empire, but his Property is call'd; and the Empire in this caſe is abſolute Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>IF the Few, or a Nobility, or a Nobility with a Clergy, be Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords to ſuch a proportion as overbalances the People in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they may make whom they pleaſe King; or if they be not pleas'd with their King, down with him, and ſet up whom they like better; a HENRY the Fourth, or the Seventh, a GUISE, a MONTFORT, a NEVIL, or a PORTER, ſhould they find that beſt for their own ends and purpoſes: For as not the Balance of the King, but that of the Nobility in this caſe is the cauſe of the Government, ſo not the Eſtate or Riches of the Prince or Captain, but his Virtue or Ability, or fitneſs for the ends of the Nobility, acquires that Command or Office. This for Ariſtocracy, or mix'd Monarchy. But if the whole People be Landlords, or hold the Land ſo divided among them, that no one man or number of men within the compaſs of the Few, or Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy overbalance them, it is a Commonwealth. Such is the Branch in the Root, or the Balance of Property naturally producing Empire; which not confuted, no man ſhall be able to batter my Superſtructures, and which confuted, I lay down my Arms. Till then, if the cauſe neceſſarily precede the effect, Property muſt have a being before Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or beginning with it, muſt be ſtill firſt in order.</p>
                     <p>PROPERTY coms to have a being before Empire or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment two ways, either by a natural or violent Revolution. Natural Revolution happens from within, or by Commerce, as when a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment erected upon one Balance, that for example of a Nobility or a Clergy, thro the decay of their Eſtates coms to alter to another Balance; which alteration in the Root of Property, leaves all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, or produces a new Branch or Government, according to the kind or nature of the Root. Violent Revolution happens from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or by Arms, as when upon Conqueſt there follows Confiſcation. Confiſcation again is of three kinds, when the Captain taking all to himſelf, plants his Army by way of military Colonys, Benefices, or Timars, which was the Policy of MAHOMET; or when the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain has ſom Sharers, or a Nobility that divides with him, which was the Policy introduc'd by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals;</hi> or when the Captain divides the Inheritance by Lots, or otherwiſe, to the whole People;

                        <hi>THE Aſſertion, that Property producing Empire conſiſts only in Land, appears too poſitive.</hi> A Pig of my own Sow; this is no more than I told him, only there is more imply'd in what I told him, than he will ſee; which therfore I ſhall now further explain. The balance in Mony may be as good or better than that of Land in three caſes. Firſt, where there is no Property of Land yet introduc'd, as in <hi>Greece</hi> during the time of her antient Imbecillity; whence, as is noted by THU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CYDIDES, <hi>the meaner ſort thro a deſire of Gain underwent the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Mighty.</hi> Secondly, in Citys of ſmall Territory and great Trade, as <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Land not being able to feed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who muſt live upon Traffic, is overbalanc'd by the means of that Traffic, which is Mony. Thirdly, in a narrow Country, where the Lots are at a low ſcantling, as among the <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> if care be not had of Mony in the regulation of the ſame, it will eat out the balance of Land. For which cauſe tho an <hi>Iſraelit</hi> might both have Mony, and put it to Uſury <hi>(Thou ſhalt lend</hi> [upon uſury] <hi>to many Nations)</hi> yet <note place="margin">Deut. 15. 6. &amp; 23. 19.</note>might he not lend it upon uſury to a Citizen or Brother: whence two things are manifeſt: Firſt, that Uſury in it ſelf is not unlawful: And next, that Uſury in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was no otherwiſe forbidden, than as it might com to overthrow the Balance or Foundation of the Government: for where a Lot as to the general amounted not perhaps to four Acres, a man that ſhould have had a thouſand Pounds in his Purſe, would not have regarded ſuch a Lot in compariſon of his Mony; and he that ſhould have bin half ſo much in debt, would have bin quite eaten out. Uſury is of ſuch a nature, as, not forbidden in the like caſes, muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Government. The <hi>Roman</hi> People, while their Territory was no bigger, and their Lots, which exceded not two Acres a man, were yet ſcantier, were flead alive with it; and if they had not help'd themſelves by their Tumults, and the Inſtitution of their Tribuns, it had totally ruin'd both them and their Government. In a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whoſe Territory is very ſmall, the Balance of the Government being laid upon the Land, as in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> it will not be ſufficient to forbid Uſury, but Mony it ſelf muſt be forbidden. Whence LYCURGUS al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd of none, or of ſuch only as being of old, or otherwiſe uſeleſs Iron, was little better, or, if you will, little worſe than none. The Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of which Law appear'd in the neglect of it, as when LYSAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER, General for the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken <hi>Athens,</hi> and brought home the ſpoil of it, occaſion'd the Ruin of that Commonwealth in her Victory. The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> compar'd with <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> was at the moſt but a <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and <hi>Laconia</hi> was leſs than <hi>Canaan.</hi> Now if we imagin <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> divided, as was <hi>Canaan,</hi> into ſix hundred thouſand Lots, or as was <hi>Laconia,</hi> into thirty thouſand; a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> man having one thouſand Pounds in his Purſe, would, I believe, have a better Eſtate in Mony than in Land; wherfore in this caſe, to make the Land hold the Balance, there is no way but either that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by forbidding Uſury, or that of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> by forbidding Mony.

                        <hi>Prevaricator, who argues thus;</hi> The Wiſdom or the Riches of another man can never give him a Title to my Obedience, nor oblige Mr. <hi>HARRING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON</hi> to give his Clothes or Mony to the next man he meets, wiſer or richer than himſelf.</p>
                     <p>IF he had ſaid ſtronger, he had ſpoil'd all; for the parting with a mans Clothes or Mony in that caſe, cannot be help'd: now the richer, as to the caſe in debate, is the ſtronger, that is, the advantage of Strength remains to the Balance. But well; he preſumes me to have Clothes and Mony of my own, let him put the ſame caſe in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or the ſimilitude dos not hold. But if the People have Clothes and Mony of their own, theſe muſt either riſe (for the bulk) out of Property in Land, or at leaſt out of the cultivation of the Land, or the Revenue of Induſtry; which if it be dependent, they muſt give ſuch a part of their Clothes and Mony to preſerve that dependence out of which the reſt ariſes to him or them on whom they depend, as he or they ſhall think fit, or parting with nothing to this end, muſt loſe all; that is, if they be Tenants, they muſt pay their Rent, or turn out.

                        </gap> they have Clothes and Mony dependently, the Balance of Land is in the Landlord or Landlords of the People: but if they have Clothes and Mony independently, then the Balance of Land muſt of neceſſity be in the People themſelves, in which caſe they neither would, if there were any ſuch, nor can, becauſe there be no ſuch, give their Mony or Clothes to ſuch as are wiſer, or richer, or ſtronger than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So it is not a mans Clothes and Mony or Riches, that oblige him to acknowlege the Title of his Obedience to him that is wiſer or richer, but a man's no Clothes or Mony, or his Poverty, with which, if the Prevaricator ſhould com to want, he could not ſo finely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicat but he muſt ſerve ſom body, ſo he were rich, no matter if leſs wiſe than himſelf.

                     <p>FOR a ſecond Demonſtration of this Truth, HENRY the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, tho he miſs'd of the <hi>Indys,</hi> in which for my part I think him happy, was the richeſt in Mony of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Princes. Nevertheleſs this acceſſion of Revenue did not at all preponderat on the King's part, nor change the balance. But while making Farms of a Standard he increas'd the Yeomanry, and cutting off Retainers he abas'd the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, began that Breach in the balance of Land, which proceding has ruin'd the Nobility, and in them that Government.</p>
                     <p>FOR a third, the Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſince <hi>the Silver of</hi> Potoſi <hi>ſail'd up the</hi> Guadalquivir, which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> is, ſince that King had the <hi>Indys,</hi> ſtands upon the ſame balance in the Lands of the Nobility on which it always ſtood.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 16.</note> AND ſo the learned Concluſion of the Prevaricator <hi>(That it is not to be doubted but a Revenue ſufficient to maintain a Force able</hi> [to cry ware horns] <hi>or beat down all oppoſition, dos equally conduce to Empire, whether it ariſes from Rents, Lands, Profits of ready Mony, Dutys, Cuſtoms,</hi> &amp;c.) asks you no more than where you ſaw her Premiſes. For unleſs they aſcended his <hi>Monti,</hi> and his Banks, it is not to be imagin'd which way they went; and with theſe, becauſe he is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Zealot for Monarchy, I would wiſh him by no means to be mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanking or meddling: for the purſe of a Prince never yet made a Bank, nor, till ſpending and trading Mony be all one, ever ſhall. The <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> could never do with the <hi>Indys,</hi> can make you a Bank out of Letters of Exchange, and the <hi>Hollander</hi> with Herrings. Let him com no more here; where there is a Bank, ten to one there is a Commonwealth. A King is a Soldier, or a Lover, neither of which makes a good Merchant; and without Merchandize you will have a lean Bank. It is true, the Family of the MEDICI were both Merchants, and made a Bank into a Throne: but it was in Commonwealth of Merchants, in aſmall Territory, by great purchaſes in Land, and rather in a mere confuſion than under any ſettl'd Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; which Cauſes, if he can give them all ſuch another meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may do as much for another man. Otherwiſe let it be agreed and reſolv'd, that in a Territory of any extent, the balance of Empire conſiſts in Land, and not in Mony; always provided that in caſe a Prince has occaſion to run away, as HENRY the Third of <hi>France</hi> did out of <hi>Poland, his Balance in ready Mony is abſolutely the moſt proper for the carrying on of ſo great and ſudden an Enterprize.</hi>

So a man that will receive the Rents and Profits of other mens Land, muſt either take them by mere force, or bring the People to make a Law deveſting themſelves of ſo much of their Property; which upon the matter is all one, becauſe a People poſſeſt of the Balance, cannot be brought to make ſuch a Law, further than they ſee neceſſary for their common defence, but by force, nor to keep it any longer than that Force continues. It is true, there is not only ſuch a thing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as health, but ſickneſs too: nor do I deny that there is ſuch a thing as a Government againſt the Balance. But look about, ſeek, find where it ſtood, how it was nam'd, how lik'd, or how long it laſted. Otherwiſe the comical Propoſition coms to this, <hi>It is not to be doubted but that Violence may be permanent or durable,</hi> and the <hi>Blackberry,</hi> for it is becauſe Nature is permanent or durable! What other conſtruction can be made of theſe words? <hi>It is not to be doubted but a Revenue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to maintain a Force able to beat down all oppoſition</hi> (that is, a Force able to raiſe ſuch a Revenue) <hi>dos equally</hi> (on which word grows the <hi>Blackberry) conduce to Empire;</hi> that is, as much as could any natural Balance of the ſame! He may ſtain mouths, as he has don ſom, but he ſhall never make a Politician. The Earth yields her natural increaſe without loſing her heart; but if you com once to force her, look your Force continue, or ſhe yields you nothing: and the balance of Empire conſiſting of Earth, is of the nature of her Element.</p>

                     <p>FOR the former; If ADAM had liv'd till now, he could have ſeen no other than his own Children; and ſo that he muſt have bin King by the right of Nature, was his peculiar Prerogative. But whether the eldeſt Son of his Houſe, if the Prevaricator can find him at this time of day, has the ſame right, is ſomwhat diſputable; becauſe it was early when ABRAHAM and LOT dividing Territorys, became ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kings: and not long after when the Sons of JACOB being all Patriarchs, by the appointment of God, whoſe Right ſure was not inferior to that of ADAM, tho he had liv'd, came under Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Wherfore the advantage of the firſt Father is for grave men a pleaſant fancy; nevertheleſs if he had liv'd till now, I hope they underſtand that the whole Earth would have bin his Demeans, and ſo the Balance of his Property muſt have anſwer'd to his Empire, as did that alſo of ABRAHAM and LOT to theirs. Wherfore this way of Deduction coms directly home again to the Balance. <hi>Paterfamilias</hi>

And thus much, however it was out of the Prevaricator's head in the place now deduc'd, he, excepting no further againſt the Balance than that it might conſiſt as well in Mony as in Land, had confeſt before.</p>
                     <p>HIS ſecond Vagary is in his deduction of Empire from increaſe of Strength, for which we muſt once more <hi>round about our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But if the People be the Sheep of their own paſtures, they are not only a flock of Sheep, but an Army of Lions, tho by ſom accidents, as I confeſt before, they be for a ſeaſon confinable to their dens. So the advantage or increaſe of Strength depends alſo upon the Balance. There is nothing in the world to ſwear this Principle out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, but the fame of PHALARIS, GELON, DIONYSIUS, AGATHOCLES, NABIS, &amp;c. with which much good do them that like it. It is proper to a Government upon the Balance to take root at home, and ſpread outwards; and to a Government againſt the Balance to ſeek a root abroad, and to ſpread inwards. The former is ſure, but the latter never ſucceſsful. AGATHOCLES for having conquer'd <hi>Africa,</hi> took not the better root in <hi>Syracuſa. Parvi ſunt arma foras, niſi ſit conſilium domi.</hi>

                     <p>THE Balance of Empire that is National, as it is ſtated in the former Chapter, ſtands in a regulated or mix'd Monarchy upon the Property or native Intereſt of the Nobility; in a Commonwealth, upon the Property or native Intereſt of the People; ſo theſe are very natural. But the Balance of abſolute Monarchy, partaking of Force as well as Nature, is a mix'd thing, and not much different from the Balance of Provincial Empire, or the manner of holding a Province or conquer'd Country. In a Province, if the Native that is rich be admitted to Power, the Power grows up native, and overtops the foren: therfore you muſt either not plant your Citizens in your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, where in time they will becom native; or, ſo planting them, neither truſt them with Power nor with Arms. Thus the provincial Balance coms to be contrary to the National. And as where Empire is native or national, the adminiſtration of it can be no otherwiſe than according to the national Balance; ſo where Empire is foren or provincial, the adminiſtration of it can be no otherwiſe than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the national Balance.

Wherfore if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by his War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Commons alter'd the Balance of <hi>Arragon,</hi> it muſt have bin one of two ways, either by ſtrengthning the Balance of the Nobility, and governing the <hi>Arragonian</hi> People by them, in which caſe their Balance, tho alter'd, remain'd yet National; or by holding both No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and People by a provincial Governor and an Army, in which caſe his Empire in that Kingdom is provincial. There is no third way; nor, putting the caſe that the Balance of <hi>Caſtile</hi> be national, and that of <hi>Arragon</hi> provincial, dos this any more create in the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> a third Balance of Empire, than did the multiplication of Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and Provinces, divers for their Balances, in the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome. England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> being united in one Prince, made, if it had bin rightly us'd, an increaſe of Strength, but not a third Balance; nor do the Kingdoms in <hi>Spain.</hi> Whether a Soverainty has many Territorys and Provinces in ſubjection, or in League, it is all one as to this point; the ſtronger Union or League will give the ſtronger Balance: and the caſe of the preſent Soveraintys in <hi>Europe</hi> being no other, the more nice than wiſe Speculation of the Conſiderer, who has not bin able to diſcern the Balance of a League from that of Empire, is a Mares neſt.</p>

I do not ſay, that becauſe it is ſo with the other Creatures, therfore it muſt be ſo with Man: but as we ſee it is with the Creatures in this part, ſo we find it to be with Man. And that ſo, and more than ſo, we find it to be with Man (who tho he <hi>be evil, gives good things to his Children,</hi> will work hard, lay up, deny himſelf, venture his Life for his little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth) is thus further demonſtrated. All civil Laws acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege that there is a common Intereſt of Mankind, and all civil Laws procede from the Nature of Man; therfore it is in the Nature of Man to acknowlege that there is a common Intereſt of Mankind. Upon this acknowlegement of Mankind, a Man that ſteals is put to death, which certainly is none of his privat Intereſt; nor is a man put to death for any other Man's privat Intereſt: therfore there is a common Intereſt of Mankind diſtinct from the parts taken ſeverally. But this, tho acknowleg'd in part by all Governments, yet thro their natural frailty is nothing ſo well provided for in ſom as in others: for if the Power be in one or a few Men, one or a few Men, we know, may be Thieves, and the rather, becauſe applying Mony that is public, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conſideration that is public, to uſes that are privat, is thieving. But ſuch Thieves will not be hang'd; in this caſe therfore the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gos not upon public but privat Intereſt. In the frame of ſuch a Government as can go upon no other than the public Intereſt, conſiſts that <hi>whole Philoſophy of the Soul</hi> which concerns Policy: and this <hi>whole Philoſophy of the Soul</hi> being throout the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> demonſtrated; for the Prevaricator to inſinuat that I have omitted it, is to ſhew what it is that he loves more than Truth. The main of this Philoſophy conſiſts in depoſing Paſſion, and advancing Reaſon to the Throne of Empire. I expected news in this place, that this were to promiſe more for the Magiſtrat or the People than has bin per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the Stoics; but two Girls, meaning no body any harm, have provok'd his Wrath, forſooth, to ſuch extravagancy by the way, that tho in all modeſty it were forbid, as he confeſſes, by their cheeks, which diſcovering the Green-ſickneſs, ſhew'd that they were paſt the rod, he has taken them up! <hi>Tantaene animis coeleſtibus irae!</hi> What he may have in School-Divinity for ſo rude a charge, I do not know; but he ſhall never be able to ſhew any Maxim for this kind of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin or <hi>Philoſophy of the Soul,</hi> either in Chevalry or the Politics. The offence of the Girls was no more, than that having a Cake (by the gift of an Uncle or Aunt, or by purchaſe, or ſuch a one perhaps as was of their own making) in common, or between them, the one had moſt accuratly divided, and the other was about to chuſe; when <note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 22, 23.</note>in coms this rude fellow: <hi>How now Gentlewomen,</hi> ſays he, <hi>What, dividing and chuſing!

                     <p>BUT wheras either office, that of dividing or chuſing, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to either of the Girls, it is not indifferent in the diſtribution of a Commonwealth, becauſe dividing is ſeparating one thing, one reaſon, one intereſt, or conſideration from another, which they that can ſo diſcern in privat affairs are call'd <hi>diſcrete,</hi> but they that can do it in public are <hi>prudent;</hi> and the way of this kind of dividing in the language of a Commonweath is Debating. But they that are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this kind of dividing or debating are few among many, that when things are thus divided and debated, are able enough to chuſe, which in the language of a Commonwealth is to reſolve. Hence it is that the Debate of the Few, becauſe there be but few that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, is the wiſeſt Debate; and the Reſult of the Many (becauſe every man has an Intereſt what to chuſe, and that choice which ſutes with every man's Intereſt, excludes the diſtinct or privat Intereſt or Paſſion of any man, and ſo coms up to the common and public Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or Reaſon) is the wiſeſt Reſult. To this end, God, who dos no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vain, has ſo divided Mankind into the Few or the natural Ariſtocracy, and the Many or the natural Democracy, that there can hardly be upon any occaſion a meeting of twenty men, wherin it will not be apparent, or in which you may not ſee all thoſe Lines which are requiſit to the face of a beautiful Commonwealth. For example, among any twenty men, occaſionally met, there will be ſom few, perhaps ſix, excelling the fourteen in greatneſs of Parts. Theſe ſix falling into diſcourſe of buſineſs, or giving their judgment upon Perſons or Things, tho but by way of mere Converſation, will diſcover their Abilitys; wherupon they ſhall be liſten'd to and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by the Fourteen; that is, the Six will acquire an Authority with, and imprint a Reverence upon the Fourteen: which Action and Paſſion in the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth were call'd <hi>Authoritas Patrum, &amp; Verecundia Plebis.</hi> Nevertheleſs if the Six indeavor to extend the Authority, which they find thus acquir'd, to Power, that is, to bring the Fourteen to terms or conditions of Obedience, or ſuch as would be advantageous to the Few, but prejudicial to the Many; the Fourteen will ſoon find, that conſenting, they hurt not only themſelves by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaging their own Intereſts, but hurt the Six alſo who by this means com to loſe their Virtue, and ſo ſpoil their Debate, which, while ſuch advantages are procurable to themſelves, will go no further upon the common Good, but their privat Benefit.

And neither any Converſation, nor any People, how dull ſoever and ſubject by fits to be deluded, but will ſoon ſee thus much, which is enough, becauſe what is thus propos'd by the Authority of the Six or of the Senat, and reſolv'd by the Fourteen, or by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is enacted by the Whole, and becoms that Law, than which, tho Mankind be not infallible, there can be nothing leſs fallible in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

                     <p>AMONG divers and weighty Reaſons why I would have that Prince look well to his file of Musketeers, this is no ſmall one, that he being upon no balance, will never be able to give Law without them. For to think that he ſuccedes to the Senat, or that the power of the Senat may ſerve his turn, is a preſumtion that will fail him. The Senat, as ſuch, has no power at all, but mere Authority of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to the People, who are the makers of their own Laws; whence the Decrees of the Senat of <hi>Rome</hi> are never Laws, nor ſo call'd, but <hi>Senatuſconſulta.</hi> It is true that a King coming in, the Senat, as there it did, may remain to his aid and advantage; and then they propoſe not as formerly to the People, but to him, who coms not in upon the right of the Senat, but upon that of the People: whence ſays JUSTINIAN; <note n="*" place="bottom">Quod Principi placuit legis habet vigorem, quum lege Regia quae de ejus imperio lata eſt, Populus ei, &amp; in eum omne imperium ſuum &amp; poteſtatem concedat.</note>

It is not in the nature of Religion that it ſhould be thought a profane ſaying, that if the Bible be in <hi>England,</hi> or in any other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the Law or Religion of the Land, it is not only becauſe God has propos'd it, but alſo becauſe the People or Magiſtrat has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it, or reſolv'd upon it; otherwiſe we muſt ſet lighter by a Nation or Government than by a privat Perſon who can have no part nor portion in this Law, unleſs he vote it to himſelf in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, without which he remains in the condition he was before, and as the Heathen, <hi>who are a Law to themſelves.</hi> Thus wheras<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant there muſt be two Partys, the Old and New Teſtament being in ſum the Old and New Covenant; theſe are that Authority and Propoſition of GOD and CHRIST, to which they that refuſe their Vote or Reſult may be under the Empire of a Clergy, but are none of his Commonwealth. Nor, ſeeing I am gon ſo far, dos this at all imply Freewil, but, as is admirably obſerv'd by Mr. HOBBS, the freedom of that which naturally precedes Will, namely, Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Debate, in which, as the Scale by the weight of Reaſon or Paſſion coms to be turn'd one way or other, the Will is caus'd, and being caus'd, is neceſſitated. When God coms in thus upon the Soul of Man, <hi>he gives both the Will and the Deed;</hi> from which like Oſſice of the Senat in a Commonwealth, that is, from the excellency of their Deliberation and Debate, which prudently and faithfully unſolded to the People, dos alſo frequently cauſe and neceſſitat both the Will and the Deed.

                        <hi>a foot in it that will ſtand, nor has more to ſay, than that</hi> Where there is one ambitious poor man, or one vicious rich man, it is impoſſible there ſhould be any ſuch Government as can be ſecure from Sedition.</p>
                     <p>WHICH, Firſt, is rather to make all Governments ineffectual, or to make all Governments alike, than to object againſt any, ſeeing That there ſhould not be <hi>one ambitious poor man,</hi> or <hi>one vicious rich man,</hi> is equally, if not more, improbable in a Monarchy than in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                     <p>SECONDLY, That one man alone, whether he be rich or poor, ſhould without a Party be able to diſturb a Commonwealth with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is an abſurdity; nor is ſuch a party, as may be able in ſom ſort to diſturb the Peace by robbing upon the Highway, or ſom ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, always able to diſturb a Government with Sedition. Wherfore this feat gos not ſo much upon the ability of any one man, rich or poor, as the Power of the Party he is able to make; and this ſtrength of the Party gos upon the nature of the Government, and the content or diſcontents thence deriving to the Few, or the Many. The Diſcontents, whether of the Few or the Many, derive from that which is, or by them is thought to be ſom bar to their Intereſt; and thoſe Intereſts which are the cauſes of Sedition are three, the deſire of Liberty, the deſire of Power, and the deſire of Riches; nor be there any more: for where the People thro want of Bread, thro Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offer'd to their Women, or Oppreſſion, riſe up againſt their Governors, it relates to the deſire of Liberty; thoſe alſo under the name of Religion make not a fourth, but com to one of the three.</p>
                     <p>NOW to ſpeak in the firſt place of the Many, and anon of the Few; the People in an equal Commonwealth have none of theſe three Intereſts: Not the deſire of Liberty, becauſe the whole Frame of an equal Commonwealth is nothing elſe but ſuch a method wherby the Liberty of the People is ſecur'd to them: Not of Power, becauſe the Power which otherwiſe they could not exerciſe, is thus eſtated in them: Nor of Riches, becauſe where the Rich are ſo bounded by an Agrarian that they cannot overbalance (and therfore neither oppreſs the People, nor exclude their Induſtry or Merit from attaining to the like Eſtate, Power, or Honor) the whole People have the whole Riches of the Nation already equally divided among them; for that the Riches of a Commonwealth ſhould not go according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of mens Induſtry, but be diſtributed by the Poll, were inequal. Wherfore the People in an equal Commonwealth having none of thoſe Intereſts which are the cauſes of Sedition, can be ſubject to no ſuch effect.</p>
                     <p>TO affirm then with the Conſiderer, <hi>that the whole of this Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is reduc'd to the want of Power to diſturb the Commonwealth,</hi> muſt needs be a miſtake, ſeeing in the Commonwealth propos'd the People have the Power, but can have no ſuch Intereſt; and the People having no ſuch Intereſt, no Party can have any ſuch Power, it being impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a Party ſhould com to overbalance the People, having their Arms in their own hands. The <hi>whole matter being thus reduc'd to the want of Power to diſturb the Government;</hi> this, according to his own Argument, will appear to be the Libration in which the Power, <hi>wherof
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49467:159"/>
the Governor is poſſeſt, ſo vaſtly excedes the Power remaining with thoſe</hi> 
                        <label type="milestone">

                        <hi>who are to obey</hi> (which in caſe of conteſt muſt be ſo ſmall a Party) <hi>that it would be deſperatly unreaſonable for them to hope to maintain their Cauſe. If the true method</hi> then <hi>of attaining to perfection in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be to make the Governor abſolute,</hi> and the People in an equal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth be abſolute, then there can be none in this Government, <hi>that upon probable terms can diſpute the Power with the Governor,</hi> and ſo this State by his own Argument muſt be free from Sedition. Thus far upon occaſion of the ambitious poor Man objected. I have ſpoken of the Many; and in ſpeaking of the Many, implicitly of the Few: for as in an equal Commonwealth, for example in <hi>England</hi> during the Peerage or Ariſtocracy, the Many depended upon or were included in the Few; ſo in an equal Commonwealth the Few depend upon or are included in the Many, as the Senat of <hi>Venice</hi> depends upon, or is included in the Great Council, by which it is annually elected in the whole or in ſom part. So what was ſaid in an equal Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the Many or the poorer ſort, is alſo ſaid of the Few or of the Richer; who, thro the virtue of the Agrarian, as in <hi>Oceana,</hi> or of other Orders ſupplying the defect of an Agrarian, as in <hi>Venice,</hi> not able to overbalance the People, can never have any Power to diſturb the Commonwealth in caſe they had ſuch an Intereſt, nor can have any ſuch Intereſt in caſe they had ſuch Power. For example in <hi>Oceana,</hi> putting the caſe that the Few were as powerful as it is poſſible they ſhould be; that is, that the whole Land was fallen into five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hands: The five thouſand, excluding the People, could get no more Riches by it, becauſe they have the whole Land already; no more Liberty by it, becauſe they were in perfect Liberty before; nor any more Power by it, becauſe thro the equality of the Balance, or of their Eſtates, they can be no more by themſelves than an equal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and that they were already with the People: but would be much leſs, the Power or Commonwealth, in which there be five thouſand Equals, being not greater, but much leſs than the Power or Commonwealth wherin the whole People are equal; becauſe the Power or Effect of a greater People is proportionably greater than the Power or Effect of a leſſer People, and the Few by this means would get no more than to be the leſſer People. So the People being no bar to the Riches, Liberty, nor Power of the five thouſand, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Liberty, Riches, and Power, being the only cauſes of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there could ariſe no Sedition in this Commonwealth by reaſon of the Nobility, who have no ſuch Intereſt if they had the Power, nor have any ſuch Power if they had the Intereſt, the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally poſſeſt of the Government, of the Arms, and far ſuperior in number. In ſum, an equal Commonwealth conſiſts but of one hereditary Order, the People, which is by election divided into two Orders, as the Senat and the Congregation in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> or the Senat and the Great Council in <hi>Venice;</hi> for the Gentlemen of <hi>Venice,</hi> as has bin often ſaid, are the People of <hi>Venice,</hi> the reſt are Subjects. And an inequal Commonwealth conſiſts of two Hereditary Orders, as the <hi>Patricians</hi> and <hi>Plebeians</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> wherof the former only had a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Capacity of the Senat: whence it coms to paſs that the Senat and the People in an equal Commonwealth having but one and the ſame Intereſt, never were nor can be at variance; and that the Senat and the People in an inequal Commonwealth having two diſtinct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Book </seg>I</label> never did nor can agree. So an equal Commonwealth cannot be ſeditious, and an inequal Commonwealth can be no other than ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious.</p>
                     <p>IF a man be reſolv'd, as the Conſiderer is, to huddle theſe things together, there is no making any thing of this kind of Policy; of which therfore it will be a folly to talk. For example, <hi>Lacedemon</hi> is either to be conſider'd as not taking in the Helots; and then in her ſelf ſhe was an equal Commonwealth void of any Sedition, or cauſe of it, how much ſoever ſhe were troubl'd with the Helots: So the Objection made by him, of her Troubles by the Helots, is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently urg'd, to ſhew that ſhe was a ſeditious Commonwealth: Or if he will needs have it, that ſhe took in the Helots, it is undeniable that ſhe took them in inequally, and ſo was inequal; whence the Troubles by the Helots muſt needs be impertinently urg'd againſt an equal Commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>AGAIN, when I allege <hi>Venice</hi> from PIERO GRADENIGO, that is, for the ſpace of about four hundred years from the preſent date, at which time the Reformation, yet in force, began, as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of an equal Commonwealth; for him to inſtance in the times before, when tho the Commonwealth, according to the intention, was as equal as now, yet being not bound by ſufficient Orders to give her ſelf Security of her native Liberty, her Dukes on the one ſide did what they pleas'd, and the inrag'd People on the other ſide baniſh'd, condemn'd to death, or murder'd them; who ſees not the Impoſture?

Again, Sir, <hi>ſhe is like a Ship ready to be boarded by Pirats, has the</hi> Turc <hi>on this Frontier, the Pope on that, the King of</hi> Spain <hi>on another.</hi> As if this were an Argument every Government muſt not be void of Sedition, ſeeing there is none except they be Ilands, whoſe Frontiers are not bounded by the Territorys of other Princes. Well, <hi>but ſince the laſt Reglement</hi> (in Engliſh, Reformation) <hi>in the time of</hi> GRADENIGO, you have had three Seditions in <hi>Venice,</hi> that of MARINO BOCCONI, that of BAIAMONTE TIEPOLO, and that of MARINO FALERIO.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>BODIN</hi> has bin long ſince beaten for this like Stockfiſh, and yet our Author will be ſerving it up for a Courtly diſh. BOCCONI would have kill'd the Duke, but was hang'd before he could do it. FEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON kill'd a Duke that had greater power here than the other in <hi>Venice,</hi> and was hang'd afterwards, therfore <hi>England</hi> was a ſeditious Government; for this muſt either be undeniable for FELTON'S ſake, or why muſt the other be ſo for BOCCONI'S? Again, FALERIO and his Complices would have deſtroy'd the Great Council, but were hang'd before they could do it. VAUX and his Accomplices would have blown up the Parlament but were hang'd before they could do it; therfore <hi>England</hi> was in this relation a ſeditious Government, elſe why was <hi>Venice?</hi> There paſſes not a month but there dy Rogues at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> is the Government therfore ſeditious? or is this one regard in which it is not? Where all that ſo invade the Government are by virtue of the ſame brought to that end, there the Commonwealth, or the Orders of it, are not the cauſe but the cure of Sedition; and ſo theſe are undeniable Arguments that <hi>Venice</hi> is not ſeditious, where, ſince the Reformation, there has not bin a cut finger upon this ſcore, ſave only thro the conſpiracy of BAIAMONTE, which indeed came to blows. Nor for this yet can <hi>Venice</hi> be call'd a ſeditious Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. You find no man accuſing <hi>Rome</hi> of Sedition, in that ſhe had a MANLIUS or a MELIUS that dangerouſly affected Monarchy, becauſe to theſe her Orders, by which they ſuffer'd Death, as ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Remedy. But <hi>Rome</hi> was a ſeditious Commonwealth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the perpetual feud that was between the Senat and the People ſprung out of her Orders, and was that to which there was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to apply. <hi>England</hi> was not a ſeditious Government becauſe it had a VAUX or a FELTON, but becauſe the Power antiently of the Nobility, and late of the People, was ſuch by the Orders of the ſame as might at any time occaſion Civil War. Put the caſe a Slave or ſom deſperat fellow has kill'd the Great <hi>Turc,</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that cannot be ſaid to be ſeditious, but in this, that thro the very nature of the Policy, the Janizarys at any time may do as much, it is undeniably ſeditious. BAIAMONTE'S Conſpiracy he will not ſay was of this nature. It was not a Diſeaſe in the Bones of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, but a thing that no ſooner appear'd, or broke out (tho it be true, there happen'd a little ſcratching firſt) than it fell off like a Scab; ſuch an accident may beſal the beſt Conſtitution, and <hi>Venice</hi> never had the like but once: if he could ſay as much of a Monarchy, he gains no advantage; yet let him ſay it, and prove it, I give him all. I omit many Falſhoods and Abſurditys in the proceding of the Prevaricator, as where he intimats the Power of the Dukes to have bin that wherby <hi>Venice</hi> gain'd I know not what, and yet to have

                        <hi>WELL; but for all this it is confeſt that there may be ſuch a thing as a ſeditious Commonwealth, in that the feud between the Senat and</hi>

                        <hi>the People of</hi> Rome <hi>could not be cur'd;</hi> What Security, <hi>ſays he,</hi> will you give us, that the like may not happen in <hi>Oceana,</hi> or that the whole body of the People being intruſted with giving a Vote, and keeping a Sword, may not by way of Counſil or Arms, fall to ſuch work as levelling the five thouſand, or bringing the Agrarian from two to one thouſand pounds a year, or leſs, as they fancy?</p>
                     <p>TO which I anſwer by a like queſtion, What ſecurity will he give me that the People of any Commonwealth ſhall not caſt themſelves into the Sea? A Prince may be mad, and do ſo, but the People are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally incapable of ſuch madneſs. If men will boaſt of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in Principles, and yet talk of nothing but effects, why may not a Man fly as well as a Bird? but if Cauſes may be regarded, let him once ſhew how the Will, ſeeing it is not free, nor mov'd without ſom Object, ſhould move the People in ſuch a manner; or for what, they having all the Liberty and all the Power that can be had, ſhould it ſtrive? Well, that is ſoon don, for <hi>the Land may com into the hands of five thouſand, and ſo the Booty may be great, and the reſiſtance ſmall.</hi> Good: The <hi>Romans</hi> being the wiſeſt of all People, went no further towards the Remedy of their Grievances, than to ſtrive for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of an Agrarian, in which they fainted too, even to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that Government. Except theſe, none have bin ſo wiſe; and if there be any ſuch thing familiar with the nature of the People, why appear'd it but once, and then vaniſh'd without effect? why did not the People for example under the late Monarchy (when the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or Freehold of the Nation, by greater ſhares, was in a ſmaller Party, and they had not only Riches, but Liberty and Power too, to whet them on) ever ſo much as think of levelling three hundred Men? for the Nobility and Clergy, in whom was the Balance, were no more. If it be reply'd that the People were not arm'd; by whom did the Barons make War with the Kings? If they were not truſted with a Vote; what was that of the Houſe of Commons? Let Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or Freehold ſtand upon what balance you will, inequal or equal, from the beginning of the world you ſhall never find a People turning Levellers. And as Reaſon is Experience in the root, ſo Experience is Reaſon in the branch, which might therfore be ſufficient in the caſe. Nevertheleſs for clearer ſatisfaction in a point of ſuch concernment, I ſhall indeavor to dig up and diſcover the root of this branch, or the reaſon of this Experience. That which in Beaſts is Inſtinct, wherof they can give no account, is in it ſelf that Wiſdom of God
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49467:161"/>
wherby he provides for them; ſo it is with the People, they are not <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>8</label> Levellers, nor know they why, and yet it is, becauſe to be Levellers were to deſtroy themſelves. For, ſeeing I muſt repeat, to repeat briefly; There is no Territory of any Extent and Populouſneſs where the Revenue of Induſtry is not twice as much as the dry Rent. This has bin demonſtrated in <hi>Oceana.</hi> The Revenue of Induſtry is in thoſe that work, that is, the People: Wherfore the Revenue of the People, where their Induſtry is not obſtructed, is twofold to that of the Nobility, holding the whole Territory in Freehold. But where their Induſtry is obſtructed, their Revenue is nothing. Civil War being of all other the greateſt Obſtruction of Induſtry, the People in taking Arms muſt venture all they have, for that, which if they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they loſe two for one; and if they obtain not, all for nothing. Wherfore a People never will, nor ever can; never did, nor ever ſhall take Arms for Levelling. <hi>But they are intruſted with a Vote;</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking away the Lands of the five thouſand, or diminiſhing the Agrari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n by way of Counſil, they need not obſtruct their Induſtry: but, preſerving the Revenue of that, may bring themſelves into the poſſeſſion of the Land too. This will they, this can they leſs do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being in Counſil they muſt propoſe ſomthing for the advantage of the Commonwealth, or of themſelves, as their end in ſuch an Action. But the Land coming to be in the poſſeſſion of five thouſand, falls not into a number that is within the compaſs of the Few, or ſuch a one as can be Princes, either in regard of their Number, or of their Eſtates; but to ſuch a one as cannot conſent to aboliſh the Agrarian, becauſe that were to conſent to rob one another: nor can they have any Party among them, or againſt their common Intereſt, ſtrong enough to force them, or to break it; which remaining, the five thouſand neither are nor can be any more than a Popular State, and the Balance remains every whit as equal, as if the Land were in never ſo many more hands. Wherfore the Commonwealth being not to be better'd by this means, the People by Counſil can never go about to level, nor diminiſh the Agrarian for the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Nor can they undertake it for the inrichment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe the Land of <hi>Oceana,</hi> as has bin demonſtrated, being level'd or divided equally among the Fathers of Familys only, coms not to above ten pounds a year to each of them, wheras every Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man coſts his Maſter twenty pounds a year; and there is not a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tager having a Cow upon the Common, but with his own Labor, at one ſhilling a day, gets twenty pounds a year; which, the Land being level'd, were impoſſible, becauſe there would be no body able to ſet a Laborer on work, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to keep a Servant: wherfore neither would, nor could the People by Counſil go about any ſuch buſineſs. So there being no poſſible cauſe of Diſagreement between the Few and the Many, the Senat and the People, there can be no ſuch effect; whence this is the <hi>Government, which being perfectly equal, has ſuch a Libration in the frame of it, that no man in or under it can contract ſuch an Intereſt or Power, as ſhould be able to diſturb the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth with Sedition.</hi> Yet after all this, the Prevaricator <hi>will only tell</hi>

                     <head type="sub">Whether Monarchy coming up to the perfection of the kind, coms not ſhort of the perfection of Government, and has not ſom flaw in it. In which is alſo treated of the Balance of <hi>France;</hi> of the Original of a landed Clergy; of Arms, and their kinds.</head>
                     <p>ON Monarchy I have ſaid, that wheras it is of two kinds, the one by Arms, the other by a Nobility; for that by Arms, as (to take the moſt perfect model) in <hi>Turky,</hi> it is not in Art or Nature to cure it of this dangerous flaw, that the <hi>Janizarys</hi> have frequent Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and perpetual Power to raiſe Sedition, or tear the Magiſtrat in pieces. For that by a Nobility, as (to take the moſt perfect Model) of late in <hi>Oceana,</hi> it was not in Art or Nature to cure it of that dangerous flaw, that the Nobility had frequent Intereſt and perpetual Power by their Retainers and Tenants to raiſe Sedition, and levy War: whence I conclude that Monarchy reaching the perfection of the kind, reaches not the perfection of Government, but muſt ſtill have ſom dangerous flaw in it.</p>
                     <p>THIS place (tho I did not intend by it to make work for a Tinker) could not be of leſs concernment, than it proves to the Prevaricator, who, as if he were oblig'd to mend all, falls firſt to patching with a Monarchy by Arms, then with a Monarchy by a Nobility; at length deſpairing, throws away each, and betakes himſelf with egregious confidence, to make out of both a new Monarchy, which is neither. By obſervation of theſe three flouriſhes, the preſent Chapter may be brought into ſome method. The firſt blow of his Hammer, or that wherby he intends the flaw or hole in Monarchy by Arms ſhall henceforth be mended and tite, is this: <hi>That the Guards of the King's</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 46.</note>
                        <hi>Perſon be not increas'd beyond the neceſſity of ſecurity; that they be not ſuffer'd to ſtagnat at Court, but be by a perpetual circulation drawn out upon ſervice; and chiefly that they conſiſt not of one intire Body united under the ſame Head, but be divided into diſtinct Partys and Commands; as we may ſee in</hi> France, <hi>where tho (in proportion to the extent of their Dominions) the King's Guards be more numerous than thoſe of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>or</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Emperors, yet being divided into diſtinct Bodys of</hi> French, Scots <hi>and</hi> Switzers, <hi>under their ſeveral Colonels and Captains, they have never bin the Authors of any the leaſt Sedition. And in</hi> Turky <hi>of late years they begin to learn the Art of poiſoning the</hi> Janizarys <hi>by the</hi> Spahys, <hi>and ſo have frequently evaded the danger of their Mutinys.</hi> Which fine work at firſt view gos upon this falſe ground, <hi>that the Foundation of Monarchy by Arms is laid upon the Princes Guards, or the Court Militia,</hi> wheras Monarchy by Arms conſiſts in no other Balance than the Princes being ſole Landlord, which, where imperfect, as it was in that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, the Empire is the moſt troubl'd, and where perfect, as in <hi>Turky,</hi> the Empire is leſs ſeditious. For that which he ſays of <hi>France,</hi> it relates to Monarchy by a Nobility; and therfore is not to be confounded, according to his method, with this, but refer'd to the next branch.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>SECONDLY, <hi>That they be not ſuffer'd to ſtagnat at Court, but be by a perpetual circulation drawn out upon ſervice;</hi> for if there be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſervice, it ſhould ſeem, men might be apt to think that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was inſtituted for Peace as well as War. I add no more than is imply'd in his words, which as to this of <hi>Turky</hi> have chanc'd well; where not the Stagnation of the <hi>Janizarys</hi> only, but of the Court it ſelf (which by the inſtitution ſhould always be in exerciſe of Arms) is the cauſe of that preſent decay, ſo perceivable in this Empire. But the Prince ſitting ſtill or ſtagnating, to what the Circulation of the <hi>Janizarys</hi> (whoſe Alienation from the Government, or Intelligence with the <hi>Timariots,</hi> muſt needs be of dangerous conſequence) could
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49467:163"/>
tend, ſhould have bin thought on: otherwiſe to expoſe the Empire to <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>9</label> danger for the ſafety of the Prince, is no cure of the Government.</p>
                     <p>BUT his chief Remedy remains: <hi>This Court Militia muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of one intire body united under the ſame head, but be divided under ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Colonels, Captains, Partys, Brigades,</hi> and diſtributed to ſeveral Quarters. As if this were a cure, there were any Army that could be mutinous: but where he ſays, <hi>not united under the ſame Head,</hi> he intimats perhaps divers Generals, and divers Armys; now ſuch are the <hi>Turkiſh Beglerbegs,</hi> and the Provinces under their Governments. That theſe therfore be kept divided, ſo that not any two of them can lay their heads together without having them cut off, nor any Son ſuccede the Father in Government, requires that there be always a ſufficient force (diſtinct from the Intereſt of the <hi>Timariots</hi> and <hi>Begler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begs)</hi> united, and ſtill ready upon occaſion of this ſervice; and the <hi>Janizarys</hi> with the <hi>Spahys</hi> or Court-Horſe being united, are no more than ſufficient for this ſervice. Wherfore if theſe alſo were ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided as therby to be weaken'd, they could not be ſufficient for this ſervice; and their diviſion, except ſuch as might weaken them, would be of no ſecurity to the Prince. That the Provinces, under this aw, are leſs apt to rebel, than the Court-Guards to mutiny, is no wonder; but the Court-Guards being cur'd by the preſcription of this Phyſician, of the poſſibility of Mutiny, which without weakening them is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, the Provinces, if Liberty, or Riches, or Power be deſirable, would never indure the yoke of this Government. Wherfore it being inavoidable in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, that either the <hi>Janizarys,</hi> or the <hi>Timariots</hi> may do what they liſt (in regard that whether of them be able to give Law to the other, muſt at the ſame time be able to give Law to the Prince; and to bring them to an equal Balance, were to make a Civil War, or at leaſt to ſow the Seed of it) the native Wound of Monarchy by Arms remains incur'd and incurable. What more may be don for Monarchy, <hi>founded upon a Nobility,</hi> coms next to be try'd. In this the Conſiderer gives his word, that <hi>there never riſes any danger to the Crown, but when either a great part of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Power is put into the hands of the Nobility, as in</hi> Germany <hi>and</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 47.</note>(where it ſhould ſeem by him, that the Electors and the Gentry do not put Power into the hands of the Emperor, or King, but the Emperor or King puts Power into the hands of the Electors or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) <hi>or when ſom Perſon or Family is ſuffer'd to overtop the reſt in Riches, Commands, and Dependence, as the Princes of the Blood and</hi> Lorrain, <hi>not long ſince, in</hi> France; <hi>and of old the</hi> MONTFORTS <hi>and</hi> NEVILS <hi>in</hi> England.

                     </p>
                     <p>HIS Putpin is pretty: <hi>The Emperor puts Power into the hands of the Electors; and the King of</hi> Poland <hi>puts Power into the hands of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen: Which Governments therfore</hi> (and all ſuch like, as when the King of <hi>England</hi> did put Power into the hands of the Barons, at ſuch a time as he was no longer able to keep it out of their fingers, by which means the antient and late Government of King, Lords and Commons, was reſtor'd) <hi>are vicious Conſtitutions, and Monarchys only in name;</hi> ſuch as he will not meddle with, and therfore let them go.

Put the caſe a man has the Gout, his Phyſician dos not bid him reduce his overtopping Toes to the Volum of the other Foot, nor to level them to equality with the reſt of their Order, but preſcribes his Remedys, and inſtitutes the Method that ſhould do this feat.

So the Prince that would have level'd them, muſt have level'd their Party; which in caſe the Controverſy be upon the Right, or pretended Right of the Nobility in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which commonly makes them hang together, may com to the <note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 49.</note>whole Order: what then? Why then, ſays he, the Prince muſt <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Nobility weighty enough to keep the People under, and yet not tall enough in any particular Perſon to meaſure with himſelf:</hi> which, abating the figure, is the ſame again; and ſo I have nothing to anſwer but the figure. Now for this, the Prince himſelf is no otherwiſe tall, than by being ſet upon the ſhoulders of the Nobility; and ſo if they ſet another upon the ſame ſhoulders (as in HENRY the 4<hi>th</hi> or the 7<hi>th,</hi> who had no Titles to the Crown, nor could otherwiſe have meaſur'd with the Prince) be he never ſo low, he coms to be tall enough in his particular perſon to meaſure with the Prince, and to be taller too, not only by thoſe old examples, but others that are younger than our ſelves, tho ſuch (the Nobility having not of late bin weighty enough to keep the People under) as derive from another Principle, that of popular Balance. A Prince therfore preſerving his Nobility weighty enough to keep the People under, muſt preſerve in them the balance of that kind of Empire: and the balance containing the Riches, which are the Power, and ſo the Arms of the Nation; this being in the Nobility, the Nobility, when willing, muſt be able to diſpoſe of the King, or of the Government. Nor under a leſs weight is a Nobility qualify'd to keep down the People, as by an Argument from the contrary. HENRY the 7<hi>th</hi> having found the ſtrength of his Nobility, that ſet him in a Throne to which he had no right, and fearing that the Tide of their Favor turning, they might do as much for another, abated the dependence of their Tenants, and cut off their Train of Retainers; which diminution of their weight, releaſing the People by degrees, has caus'd that Plain or Level into which we live to ſee the Mountain of that Monarchy now ſunk and ſwallow'd: wherfore the Balance of the Nobility being ſuch as failing, that kind of Monarchy coms to ruin; and not failing, the Nobility, if they join, may give Law to the King, the inherent diſeaſe of a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy

                     <p>THESE are points to which I had ſpoken before; but ſomthing <note place="margin">The Balance of <hi>France.</hi>
                        </note>concerning <hi>France</hi> and foren Guards was mumbl'd by the Prevaricator in a wrong place, while he was ſpeaking of <hi>Turky,</hi> where there is no ſuch thing. This, leſt I be thought to have courted oppoſition for nothing, ſhall open a new Scene; while I take the occaſion in this place to ſpeak firſt of the Balance of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, and next of the Nature and Uſe of Foren Guards.</p>
                     <p>THE whole Territory of <hi>France,</hi> except the Crown Lands, which on this account are not conſiderable, conſiſts of three ſhares or parts, wherof the Church holds one, the Nobility another; and the Preſidents, Advocats, other Officers of the Parlaments, Courts of Juſtice, the Citizens, Merchants, Tradeſmen, the Treaſures, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of the Cuſtoms, Aids, Taxes, Impoſitions, Gabels, all which together make a vaſt body, hold a third: by how equal Portions I am ſorry that I do not know, nor where to learn; but this is the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, to which the Peaſant holding nothing, but living (tho in one of the beſt Countrys of the World) in the meaneſt and moſt miſerable condition of a Laborer, or Hynd, is of no account at all.</p>
                     <p>THE Partys that hold the Balance in a Territory are thoſe of whom the Government dos naturally conſiſt, wherfore theſe are call'd Eſtates; ſo the Clergy, the Nobility, and the Commons, are the three Eſtates of <hi>France.</hi> Tho the third, becauſe the Peaſant partaking not of the Balance can (in relation to Government) be of no account, is not call'd the Commons, but only the third Eſtate: wheras the Yeomanry and Gentry in <hi>England</hi> having weigh'd as well in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance as the Church and the Nobility, the three Eſtates of <hi>England</hi> (while the Monarchy was in vigor) were the Clergy, the Nobility, and the Commons. <hi>The Conſent of Nations evinces that the Function</hi>

                        <hi>of the Clergy, or Prieſt, except where otherwiſe determin'd by Law, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the Magiſtrat. By this right</hi> NOAH, ABRAHAM, JOB, <hi>with the reſt of the Patriarchs, inſtructed their Familys, or ſacrific'd. There ſeems to have bin a kind of Commonwealth in</hi> Canaan, <hi>while</hi> MELCHISEDEC <hi>was both King and Prieſt. Such alſo was</hi> MOSES <hi>till he conſecrated</hi> AARON, <hi>and confer'd the Prieſthood upon the</hi> Levits, <hi>who are expreſly ſaid to ſuccede to the firſtborn, that is to the Patriarchs, who till then exercis'd that Function. Nor was it otherwiſe with the</hi> Gentils, <hi>where they, who had the Soverain Power, or were in eminent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, did alſo the Prieſtly Office</hi> (omnino apud veteres qui rerum potiebantur, iidem Auguria tenebant: ut enim ſapere, ſic divinare, regale ducebant, <hi>ſays</hi> CICERO; <hi>and</hi> VIRGIL, REX ANIUS, Rex idem hominum, PHOEBIQUE Sacerdos.) <hi>You find the Heros, that is Princes, in Poets, ſacrificing. The</hi> Ethiopian, Egyptian, Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian <hi>Kings did the like.

Theſe Particulars ſeem to com near to the account of DIODORUS SICULUS, by whom the Balance of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould <note place="margin">L. 1.</note>have ſtood thus: <hi>The whole Revenue was divided into three Parts, wherof the Prieſt had the firſt, the King had the ſecond, and the Nobility had the third.</hi> It ſeems to me that the Prieſts had theirs by their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Right and Title, untouch'd by JOSEPH; that the Kings had all the reſt by the purchaſe of JOSEPH; and that in time, as is uſual in like caſes, a Nobility came thro the bounty of ſucceding Kings to ſhare with them in one half. But however it came about, <hi>Egypt</hi> by this means is the firſt example of a Monarchy upon a Nobility, at leaſt diſtributed into three Eſtates by means of a Landed Clergy, which by conſequence came to be the greateſt Counſillors of State, and, fitting Religion to their uſes, to bring the People to be the moſt ſuperſtitious in the whole World.</p>
                     <p>WERE it not for this Example, I ſhould have ſaid, that the Indowment of a Clergy or religious Order with Lands, and the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them into an Eſtate of the Realm or Government, were no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tienter than the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> who introducing a like Policy, which to this day takes place throout the Chriſtian World, have bin the cauſe;</p>
                     <p>FIRST, Why the Clergy have bin generally great Counſillors to Kings, while the People are led into Superſtition.</p>
                     <p>SECONDLY, By planting a religious Order in the Earth, why Religion has bin brought to ſerve worldly ends.</p>
                     <p>AND, Thirdly, by rendring the Miter able to make War; why of latter Ages we have had ſuch a thing as War for Religion, which till the Clergy came to be a third State or Landlords, was never known in the World: For that ſom Citys of <hi>Greece,</hi> taking Arms upon the <note place="margin">Thucyd. l. 1.</note>Uſurpation or Violation of ſom Temple, have call'd it the <hi>Holy War;</hi> ſuch Diſputes having bin put upon matter of Fact, and not of Faith, in which every man was free, came not to this account. MOSES <hi>was learn'd in all the Learning of the</hi> Egyptians; but a Landed Clergy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd he not in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> nor went the Apoſtles about to lay any ſuch Foundation of a Church. Abating this one example of <hi>Egypt,</hi> till the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> who brought in the third Eſtate, a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it were inequal, conſiſted but of two Eſtates; as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether under the Kings or the Commonwealth, conſiſted of the <hi>Patricians</hi> and <hi>Plebeians,</hi> or of the Nobility and the People. And an equal Commonwealth conſiſts but of one, which is the People: for example of this you have <hi>Lacedemon</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being few, and having many Subjects or Servants, might alſo be call'd a Nobility, as in regard of their Subjects they are in <hi>Venice,</hi> and in regard of their Helots or Servants, they might have bin in <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> That, I ſay, which, introducing two Eſtates, cauſes Diviſion, or makes a Commonwealth inequal, is not that ſhe has a Nobility, without which ſhe is depriv'd of her moſt ſpecial Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and weaken'd in her Conduct, but when the Nobility only is capable of Magiſtracy, or of the Senat; and where this is ſo order'd, ſhe is inequal, as <hi>Rome.</hi> But where the Nobility is no otherwiſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Magiſtracy, nor of the Senat, than by Election of the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:49467:165"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>BUT for a Politician commend me to the Conſiderer, he will have <hi>Rome</hi> to have bin an equal Commonwealth, and <hi>Venice</hi> to be an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual one, which muſt be evinc'd by wiredrawing. For having elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as has bin ſhewn, admitted without oppoſition that the Balance of <hi>Empire is well divided into national and provincial,</hi> the humor now <note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 16. 69. 70.</note>takes him to ſpin that wedg into ſuch a thred, as by intangling of theſe two, may make them both eaſy to be broken. Hereto he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf in this manner. <hi>As Mr.</hi> HARRINGTON <hi>has well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd</hi> (p. 40.) <hi>where there are two Partys in a Republic with equal Power (as in that of</hi> Rome, <hi>the People had one half, and the Nobility had the other half) Confuſion and Miſery are there intail'd. For remedy wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or to avoid this, there can be no way but to make the Commonwealth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inequal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IN anſwer to this, there will need no more than to repeat the ſame things honeſtly. Mr. HARRINGTON ſpeaks of the national Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Empire <hi>(p.</hi> 40.) to this ſenſe: <hi>Where the Nobility holds half the Property, or about that proportion, and the People the other half</hi> (the ſhares of the Land may be equal; but in regard the Nobility have much among Few, and the People little among Many, the Few will not be contented to have Authority, which is all their proper ſhare in a Commonwealth, but will be bringing the People under Power, which is not their proper ſhare in a Commonwealth; wherfore this Commonwealth muſt needs be inequal. And except by altering the Balance, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did by the <hi>Siſacthia,</hi> or reciſion of Debts; or as the <hi>Romans</hi> went about to do by an Agrarian, it be brought to ſuch an equality, that the whole Power be in the People, and there remain no more than Authority to the Nobility) <hi>there is no remedy but the one</hi> (with perpetual feud) <hi>will eat out the other, as the People did the Nobility in</hi> Athens, <hi>and the Nobility the People in</hi> Rome. Where the Carcaſe is, there will be the Eagles alſo; where the Riches are, there will be the Power. So if a few be as rich as all the reſt, a few will have as much Power as all the reſt; in which caſe the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is inequal, and there can be no end of ſtaving and tailing, till it be brought to equality. Thus much for the national Balance; For the provincial, there Power dos not follow Property, but the contrary: This the Prevaricator having acknowledg'd, lets ſlip, to the end he may take a gripe of <hi>Venice,</hi> which (becauſe the three or four thouſand of which originally conſiſted, and now conſiſts that whole Government, having acquir'd Provinces, and increaſe of their City by later comers, do not admit theſe to participation of Power) he ſays is an inequal Commonwealth. He will be a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe, whether <hi>the Cake be dow or not;</hi> for this is to draw in a circle: and <hi>Rome,</hi> which by his former Arguments ſhould have bin equal, by this again muſt be inequal, ſeeing <hi>Rome</hi> as little admitted her Provinces into the body of the Commonwealth, as dos <hi>Venice.</hi> This claſh is but by way of Parentheſis; to return therfore to the buſineſs in preſent agitation.</p>
                     <p>THE Eſtates, be they one, or two, or three, are ſuch (as was ſaid) by virtue of the Balance, upon which the Government muſt naturally depend. Wherfore conſtitutively the Government of <hi>France</hi> (and all other Monarchys of like Balance) was adminiſter'd by an
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:49467:166"/>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Book </seg>I</label> Aſſembly of the three Eſtates; and thus continu'd till that Nation being vanquiſh'd by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> CHARLES the 7<hi>th</hi> was put to ſuch ſhifts as, for the recovery of himſelf in the greateſt diſtreſs, he could make. To which recovery, while the Eſtates could not be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally call'd, he happening to attain without them, ſo order'd his affairs, that his Succeſſors, by adding to his Inventions, came to rule without this Aſſembly; a way not ſuting with the nature of their Balance, which therfore requir'd ſom Aſſiſtance by force, and other concurring Policys of like nature, wherof the foren Guards of that Monarchy are one; the great baits alluring the Nobility another; and the emergent Intereſt of the Church a third.</p>
                     <p>TO begin with the laſt of theſe; the Church (except it be in a War for Religion, as when they join'd with the Princes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and what Party of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility were made, or they could make againſt the King of <hi>Navar)</hi> are not of themſelves ſo hot at hand, or promt to Arms: but the King being (to uſe their word) no Heretic, thro their great apprehenſion of the third Eſtate, as that which is moſt addicted to the Proteſtant Religion, may be confident they will never ſide with the People. So by this emergent Intereſt or Accident he has the Church ſure enough.</p>
                     <p>FOR the Nobility, which is exceding gallant, this Change has the greateſt baits; for wheras the Church being not ſpar'd, the third Eſtate is laden, and the Peaſant overladen with Taxes, the Nobility is not only at better eaſe in this regard, but for the greater or more conſiderable part, receives advantage by it: the King having always, whether in Peace or War, a great Cavalry, than which there is no better in the world for the Exerciſe, Entertainment, and Profit of the Nobility; Governments of Citys, Caſtles, Provinces in abundance, which he rarely diſtributes to any other. The greater Nobility are Marechals, Generals; the leſs Officers in the Armys, ſpecially of the Horſe, the Emoluments wherof they receive alſo in time of Peace; and many of this Order being Penſioners, taſte of the King's Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, without taking pains, or having any Imployment at all. By which both that <hi>France</hi> is a Monarchy by a Nobility, and how ſhe holds her Nobility, is apparent.</p>
                     <p>NOW the Church and the Nobility ſtanding thus ingag'd to the King, by which means he has two parts of the Balance to one, it is demonſtrable that the Government muſt be quiet. Nor, ſeeing the Church for the reaſon ſhewn is ſure enough, coms the Government (ſince the Proteſtant Citys and Holds were demoliſh'd) to be otherwiſe diſquieted than by the flying out of the Nobility, which, whenever it happens in any party conſiderable, either for the Number, or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, cauſes the Crown to ſhake; for it ſeldom coms to paſs upon this occaſion, but the third Eſtate, or ſom part of it, takes Arms im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly. In which place it is worthy to obſerv'd, that Wealth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſtribution of the Balance, has contrary motions. The third Eſtate in <hi>France</hi> having Riches, and thoſe laden with Taxes, com to have ſomthing to loſe, and ſomthing to ſave: which keeps them in continual fear or hope. The Nobility holding to the King, the third Eſtate has ſomthing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to loſe, which withholds them from Arms thro fear; but the Nobility flying out, the third Eſtate has ſomthing to ſave, which precipitats them into Arms thro hope: wheras the Peaſant having nothing to ſave or to loſe, to hope or to fear,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49467:166"/>
never ſtirs. The caſe ſtanding thus, the ſufficiency of the <hi>French</hi>

In this caſe, leſt the native Intereſt of the Nobility, ſince the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blys of the three Eſtates were aboliſh'd, might cool the remaining Party, or make them ſlower in the redreſs of ſuch Diſorders or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents than were requiſit, the King is wiſely provided of Foren Guards; which being always in readineſs, and not obnoxious to the native Intereſt, may upon like occaſions be of more Expedition and Truſt. Being com thus to foren Arms, which is the point I more eſpecially propos'd to my ſelf in the preſent Diſcourſe, one Objection in relation to what has bin already ſaid, ſeems to interpoſe it ſelf. Seeing <hi>France,</hi> while it is not govern'd by the Aſſembly of States, is yet of the ſame Balance it was when govern'd by the Aſſembly of States; it may be ſaid that a Government of the ſame Balance may admit of divers Adminiſtrations.</p>
                     <p>TO which I need make no other anſwer, than to put you in mind that while this Government was natural, or adminiſter'd by the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of States, it is celebrated by MACCHIAVEL to have bin the beſt order'd of any Monarchy in the world; and that what it is, or has bin of later times, you may believe your own eys or ears.</p>

All Government, as is imply'd by what has bin already ſhewn, is of theſe three kinds: <hi>A Government of Servants: A Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Subjects;</hi> or, <hi>a Government of Citizens.</hi> The firſt is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarchy, as that of <hi>Turky:</hi> The ſecond Ariſtocratical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, as that of <hi>France:</hi> The third a Commonwealth, as thoſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Holland.</hi> Now (to follow MACCHIAVEL in part) of theſe, the Government of Servants is the harder to be conquer'd, and the eaſier to be held: The Government of Subjects is the eaſier to be conquer'd, and the harder to be held. To which I ſhall preſume to add, that the Government of Citizens is both the hardeſt to be conquer'd, and the hardeſt to be held.</p>
                     <p>MY Authors Reaſons, why a Government of Servants is the hardeſt to be conquer'd, com to this, that they are under perpetual Diſciplin and Command, void of ſuch Intereſts and Factions, as have Hands or Power to lay hold upon Advantages or Innovation; whence he that invades the <hi>Turk</hi> muſt truſt to his own ſtrength, and not rely upon Diſorders in the Government, or Forces which he ſhall be ſure enough to find united.</p>
                     <p>HIS Reaſons why this Government, being once broken, is eaſily held, are, that the Armys once paſt hope of rallying, there being no ſuch thing as Familys hanging together, or Nobility to ſtir up their Dependents to further Reluctancy for the preſent, or to preſerve themſelves by complacence with the Conquerors for future Diſcontents or Advantages, he that has won the Garland has no more to do but to extinguiſh the Royal Line, and wear it ever after in ſecurity. For the People having bin always Slaves, are ſuch whoſe condition he may better, in which caſe they are Gainers by their Conqueror, but can

Hence ALEXANDER having conquer'd the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, he and his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains after him could hold it without the leaſt diſpute, except it aroſe among themſelves. Hence MAHOMET the Second having taken <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and put PALAEOLOGUS the <hi>Greec</hi> Emperor (whoſe Government was of like nature with the <hi>Perſian)</hi> together with his whole Family, to the Sword, the <hi>Turk</hi> has held that Empire without reluctancy.</p>
                     <p>ON the other ſide, the Reaſons why a Government of Subjects is eaſilier conquer'd, are theſe: That it is ſupported by a Nobility ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, ſo powerful, and of ſuch hold and influence upon the People, that the King without danger, if not ruin to himſelf or the Throne (an example wherof was given in HEN. 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>England)</hi> can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther invade their Privileges, nor level their Eſtates; which remaining, they have power upon every diſcontent to call in an Enemy, as ROBERT Count of <hi>Artois</hi> did the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> into <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Reaſons why a Government of Subjects being ſo eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, is nevertheleſs the harder to be held, are theſe: That the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility being ſoon out of countenance in ſuch a caſe, and repenting themſelves of ſuch a bargain, have the ſame means in their hands wherby they brought in the Enemy, to drive him out, as thoſe of <hi>France</hi> did both the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>FOR the Government of Citizens, as it is of two kinds, an equal or an inequal Commonwealth, the Reaſons why it is the hardeſt to be conquer'd, are alſo of two kinds; as firſt, the Reaſons why a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Citizens, where the Commonwealth is equal, is hardeſt to be conquer'd, are, that the Invader of ſuch a Society muſt not only truſt to his own ſtrength, inaſmuch as the Commonwealth being equal, he muſt needs find them united, but in regard that ſuch Citizens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Soldiers or train'd up to their Arms, which they uſe not for the defence of Slavery, but of Liberty (a condition not in this world to be better'd) they have more ſpecially upon this occaſion the higheſt Soul of Courage, and (if their Territory be of any extent) the vaſteſt Body of a well diſciplin'd Militia that is poſſible in nature: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>an example of ſuch a one overcom by the Arms of a Monarch, is not to be found in the World.</hi> And if ſom ſmall City of this Frame has happen'd to be vanquiſh'd by a potent Commonwealth, <hi>this is her Prerogative, her Towers are her Funeral Pile, and ſhe expires in her own flame, leaving nothing to the Conqueror but her Aſhes, as</hi> Saguntum <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd by</hi> Carthage, <hi>and</hi> Numantia <hi>by</hi> Rome.</p>
                     <p>THE Reaſons why a Government of Citizens, where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is inequal, is, next the former, the hardeſt to be conquer'd, are the ſame, with this difference, that tho her Peace be not perfect within, her condition is not to be better'd by any thing without. Wherfore <hi>Rome</hi> in all her ſtrife never call'd in an Enemy; and if an Enemy upon occaſion of her ſtrife, and hopes of advantage by it, came without calling, he preſented her with her moſt Soverain Cure, who had no leiſure to deſtroy her ſelf, till having no Enemy to find her work, ſhe became her own.

Nor is there any example that a Government of this kind was ever <label type="milestone">

                     <p>PROPER and Native Arms are, according to the triple nature of Government, of three kinds; Servants in Arms, as the <hi>Helots</hi> in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> the <hi>Timariots</hi> and <hi>Janizarys</hi> in <hi>Turky;</hi> Subjects in Arms, as the Horſe in <hi>France,</hi> and the Seaguards or Forces in <hi>Venice;</hi> or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens in Arms, as thoſe upon the <hi>Lexiarcha</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> of the <hi>Morae</hi> in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and the Legions in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IMPROPER or Foren Arms are of two ſorts; Auxiliarys, and Mercenarys</p>
                     <p>AUXILIARYS are ſuch as are ſupply'd by virtue of ſom League, as were thoſe of the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and thoſe of the Cantons of <hi>Swiſs</hi> (except <hi>Zuric)</hi> to the King of <hi>France:</hi> or they may be ſuch as are occaſionally lent freely, or let forth for Mony by one State to another, the latter wherof differ not much from Mercenarys.</p>
                     <p>MERCENARYS are Soldiers of Fortune that have no other Trade than their Arms, and let out themſelves for Mony; of ſuch conſiſted the greateſt part of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Strength, ſuch is the Land Force of <hi>Venice,</hi> and, notwithſtanding the antient League of <hi>France</hi> with thoſe Nations, ſuch at this day are the <hi>Swiſs</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Guards (and ſomtimes a good part of the Foot) in <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p>WHERE the Arms in bulk are proper, and conſiſting of Citizens, they have other Trades, and therfore are no Soldiers of Fortune; and yet becauſe the Commonwealth has Arms for her Trade (in regard ſhe is <hi>a Magiſtrat given for the good of Mankind, and bears not her Sword in vain)</hi> they are all educated as well in Military as Civil Diſciplin, taking their turns in ſervice of either nature according to the occaſion, and the Orders of the Commonwealth, as in <hi>Iſrael, Athens, Lacedemon,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> which had (if their Territorys permitted, and ſomtimes, as I may ſay, whether their Territorys permitted or no, as in <hi>Iſrael)</hi> the vaſteſt, the higheſt temper'd, and the beſt diſciplin'd Militia, that is to be found in the whole compaſs of Story.

                     <p>HENCE <hi>that a Commonwealth, which had not firſt broken her ſelf, or bin broken by ſom other Commonwealth, ſhould not be found to have bin conquer'd by the Arms of any Monarch, is not miraculous, but a natural effect of an apparent Cauſe.</hi> In this place, or upon this Text, Divines whom I would deſire not to be Enemys of popular Power, but to give MACCHIAVEL his due, ſhall, if they pleaſe, hear him make a <note place="margin">Arte della Guer.

Whom ſhould ſhe indeavor to make greater Lovers of Peace, than them who only can inſlave her by force? In whom ſhould there be greater Fear of God, than in ſuch as carry their Lives in their hands? This, when Lawgivers and Captains rightly cinſider'd, was the cauſe why Soldiers were eſteem'd, honor'd, follow'd, and imitated above all men in the World; wheras ſince ſuch Orders are broken, and Cuſtom is altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated from the courſe of antient Prudence, men are com to deteſt the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Camp, and fly the Converſation of ſuch as are in Arms, as the Peſtilence.</hi> Where the Arms in bulk are proper, but conſiſt of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they are the beſt next; and but the beſt next, as appears by all Examples antient and modern. The Arms with which PYRRHUS Prince of <hi>Epyrus</hi> invaded the <hi>Romans,</hi> were of Subjects; yet that Prince, tho he was not vanquiſh'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> confeſt their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and gave them over. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> being a far more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent King than was PYRRHUS, has acknowleg'd as much to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> tho a far leſs Commonwealth than <hi>Rome:</hi> So have the Princes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> to the <hi>Switzers.</hi> That the Arms of Subjects are nevertheleſs as much ſuperior to the Arms of Servants, as inferior to the Arms of Citizens, is as plain; ſeeing as ALEXAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER, with thirty thouſand Subjects, vanquiſh'd DARIUS, having innumerable Slaves; ſo thirty thouſand Chriſtians are at this day a match for any Army of <hi>Turks:</hi> and we ſee <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe Force by Sea conſiſts of Subjects, to have made him quit that Element near as fully to her Dominion or Empire, as did the <hi>Perſian</hi> to <hi>Athens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>TO Arms that are proper, but conſiſt of Servants, all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence that can be given is, that they are better than foren Arms; a proof wherof we have in thoſe of SELIMUS, wherby he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd the <hi>Mamalucs;</hi> who being but a foren Force that held <hi>Egypt</hi> in ſubjection, the Country was irrecoverably loſt, and, for the reaſons already ſhewn, as eaſily kept.</p>
                     <p>IMPROPER Arms, whether Auxiliary or Mercenary, where the Force of a Prince or of a Commonwealth conſiſts, for the bulk or greater part, of no other, are the leaſt effectual, and the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of all.

                     </p>
                     <p>TO inſtance in ſom Commonwealths, that of <hi>Carthage</hi> after her firſt War with the <hi>Romans,</hi> fell thro the Rebellion of SPENDIUS and MATHO, Ringleaders of her Mercenarys, into another that was far more dangerous. Of ſuch a Dilemma were the Arms of this State, that if HANNIBAL had conquer'd <hi>Rome,</hi> he muſt have bin King of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and not conquering <hi>Rome, Carthage</hi> was ruin'd. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Milan,</hi> truſting her ſelf to F. SFORZA and his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenarys, became the Subject of her Servant, and he her Duke. Nor is <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe Land-Forces are of the ſame kind, otherwiſe in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as to theſe, than by her Situation. To give ſom inſtances of the ſame nature in Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Father of F. SFORZA being Captain of a like mercenary Army, forc'd JOAN Queen of <hi>Naples,</hi> whom he left diſarm'd in the midſt of her Enemys, to lay her ſelf at the feet of the King of <hi>Arragon;</hi> and BRACCIO by ſuch another Treachery had plainly poſſeſt himſelf of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> had he not bin bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at <hi>Aquila,</hi> where Death intercepted his deſign. From what has bin ſaid (firſt of Government, and then of Arms) if a Government of Servants be harder to be conquer'd, and eaſier to be held, then in this foren Arms muſt needs be leaſt neceſſary, and moſt dangerous.</p>
                     <p>IF a Government of Subjects be eaſier to be conquer'd, and harder to be held, then in this foren Arms may be more neceſſary, but muſt be leſs dangerous.</p>
                     <p>BUT tho a Government of Citizens be both hardeſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, and hardeſt to be held, yet as it is again in this regard of two kinds, this cannot be ſaid of each kind alike; wherfore I muſt diſtinguiſh.</p>
                     <p>IN a Government of Citizens, if the Commonwealth be not for increaſe, but preſervation only, as <hi>Lacedemon, Carthage, Venice,</hi> foren Arms are both neceſſary and dangerous; but in a Government of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, where the Commonwealth is both for increaſe and preſervation, as <hi>Rome,</hi> foren Arms are neither neceſſary nor dangerous.</p>
                     <p>TO repeat the parts of this Concluſion, which being brief is obſcure, more fully and particularly.</p>
                     <p>THE Empire of <hi>Turky</hi> is of the harder kind to be conquer'd, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Turk</hi> needs not foren Guards to defend him, but it is of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to be held; wherfore let him take heed of intruſting his Perſon with foren Guards, who having a foren Intereſt, may have a foren Nation to aſſiſt them: and ſo the Perſon of the Prince being in their hands, they have no more to do than to extinguiſh the Royal Line; and the Empire being eaſily held, is their own thenceforth with ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Thus the <hi>Mamalucs</hi> which were at firſt foren Guards, extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Royal Line of the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> came to poſſeſs and hold that Realm without oppoſition. Who well conſiders this point, will never enough admire the Policy of the <hi>Turk</hi> in the creation (as it were) of his <hi>Janizarys,</hi> free from any national Intereſt that might make them dream of, or deſire Liberty; and yet ſo void of all foren Intereſt or Knowlege, that they know not what, or who were their Country or Parents.

                        <hi>Turk,</hi> and ſomtimes do accordingly, they have no further Intereſt in the world but what depends upon the Government; and ſo the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is ſafe, tho the Prince be in danger: wheras if they were foren Guards, or had any native Intereſt, not only the Prince, but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire too would be in danger, the reſt being Servants, and ſuch whoſe condition might be better'd by a change, but could be no worſe. Wherfore a Government of Servants muſt by no means admit of foren Guards or <hi>Mamalucs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BUT the Empire of <hi>France,</hi> where the Nobility are not only ſubject to fly out, but to call in Strangers, may have uſe of foren Guards, which not obnoxious to native Intereſt and Factions, as thoſe of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are the readieſt and beſt help at this lift; yet not dangerous, tho having the Prince in their power, becauſe by him they are ſafe from the Nobility, who, were it not for the Prince, would be ſo far from bearing or brooking foren Guards, that in caſe a Forener came in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their call, having the ſame means to help themſelves wherby they brought him in, they would ſhake the Yoke, and the ends why they call'd him in, being ſatisfy'd or repented of, drive him out again, as they did the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But if this Government being invaded or conquer'd, be ſo hard to be kept, how much harder being ſurpriz'd? Wherfore in a Government by Subjects, foren Arms may be more neceſſary, but muſt be leſs dangerous.</p>
                     <p>IN a Commonwealth for preſervation, as <hi>Lacedemon, Carthage, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> foren Arms are neceſſary: So <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> tho able to defend her ſelf by her proper Forces againſt any one City, yet the Wars in <hi>Greece</hi> going much upon Leagues and Confederats, was forc'd alſo to make uſe of her Confederats, and ſomtimes of her <hi>Helots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BUT as antiently to <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſo now to <hi>Venice,</hi> foren or merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Forces are eſſential, becauſe for Land-ſervice ſuch a Conſtitution can have no other: Yet is this courſe extremely dangerous, as appear'd by <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> who (being ever in fear of her <hi>Helots)</hi> when ſhe had acquir'd upon the matter the whole Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> came, by the Rebellion of her Confederats, not only to loſe all, but likewiſe to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For <hi>Carthage,</hi> upon the Mutiny of SPENDIUS and MATHO, ſhe eſcap'd, as at other times upon like occaſions, very narrowly. That ſuch an Accident neither has befaln <hi>Venice,</hi> nor can befal her, is to be attributed to her Situation, by which, in this regard, ſhe is ſecure: Nevertheleſs, her Progreſs or Increaſe, which by this means either cannot be great, or being great, muſt render her but the more infirm, is fully bar'd.</p>
                     <p>TO a Commonwealth for increaſe, which always takes in the whole body of the People, foren Arms (ſeeing ſhe abounds above all other kinds of Policy, with ſuch as are proper) muſt needs be the leaſt neceſſary; and they are the moſt ſafe, becauſe never admitting them, but for her mere convenience and frugality in expence of native Blood, ſhe receives no ſuch charge of them as can recoil, but muſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point blank, and as vigorouſly at her proper Intereſt, very near as her proper Arms. Thus did the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Auxiliarys, of which, join'd with the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, conſiſted a Conſular Army.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>BY thus much it ſeems</hi> that an inference from the ſucceſs of Arms to the perfection of Government, and from the perfection of Government to the ſucceſs of Arms, <hi>ſhould be no fallacious way of diſputing.</hi>

Nor are her Guards ſo void of Sedition neither; but the <hi>Switzer,</hi> if he wants his pay, dares threaten <hi>Paris:</hi> the <hi>Scot,</hi> at leaſt of late years, has not bin ſo bold; but if a Prince flys out, the Enſigns of the <hi>French</hi> Guards will one way or other be Captains, while Soldier and Officer too follows his Affections or Intereſts, which way ſoever they frame. I ſhould be glad to know when a Dragon fell from that Court, that did not bear down Stars with his Train. But the Prevaricator is ſet upon it: wheras of late years the <hi>Janizarys</hi> are known to have bin far more imbru'd in the Blood of their Princes than ever; he gives us his honeſt word, <hi>that of late years in</hi> Turky <hi>they begin to learn the art of poiſing the</hi> Janizarys (who are the Foot of the Princes Guard) <hi>by the</hi> Spahys (who are the Horſe of the ſame) <hi>and ſo have frequently evaded the danger of their Mutinys.</hi> At which rate, ſeeing every Army conſiſts of Horſe and Foot, no Army could be mutinous. If theſe had not bin meer ſlights, and ſo intended, he might have don well to have ſhewn us one Mutiny of the <hi>Janizarys</hi> appeas'd by the <hi>Spahys.</hi> But all the parts of his Politics, as was ſaid of thoſe in Rhetoric, conſiſt of Pronunciation.</p>

                     <p>MARK; the King by all means muſt have a Nobility weighty enough to keep down the People; and then he muſt have an Army to hold Gold weight with his Nobility: as if the Nobility in that caſe would keep down the People, and not fetch them up (as did the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons) into their Scale, that ſo together they might weigh down the Army; which ſooner or later is the infallible conſequence of this Phanſy, or let it be ſhewn where it was ever otherwiſe. To inſtance in <hi>France</hi> is quite contrary, where all the conſiderable Offices and Commands being in the Nobility, or the richer ſort of that Nation, the Balance of Arms and of Property are not two, but one and the ſame. There is no way for Monarchy, but to have no Army, or no other than the Nobility, which makes the regulated Monarchy, as in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> &amp;c. or to have an Army that may weigh down Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and People too; that is, deſtroy them both, which makes the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute way of Monarchy, as in <hi>Turky:</hi> the wit of man never found, nor ſhall find a third, there being no ſuch thing in Nature.</p>

For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Weakneſſes which have bin thought incident to Monarchy, are by this courſe prevented; and if there be any ſteadineſs and maturity in the Senat of a Commonwealth, this takes it all in.</p>
                     <p>TO give my Counſil without a Fee, and deal ſincerely with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicator: Let the Prince (that is, ſuch a one as his) hold himſelf contented with his <hi>Divan,</hi> or Cabinet. If this be that he means, we are agreed; but if he would have more, I can make no leſs of his words, than a hankering after ſuch Councils as I have propos'd, and that theſe are ſuch as he <hi>always thought admirable, ſuch as prevent almoſt all the Weakneſſes incident to Monarchy, and take in the ſteadineſs and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of a Commonwealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>HOW may we make this agree with that other place, where he ſays, <hi>that there is no frame of Laws, or Conſtitution of Government, which will not decay and com to ruin, unleſs repair'd by the Prudence and</hi>

                        <hi>Dexterity of them that govern? Now that this may not be expected from a Monarch, as well as from a Senat or Aſſembly of Men, he has not yet met with any conviction, but rather finds it reaſonable to think that where Debates are cleareſt, the reſult of them moſt ſecret, and the execution ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den (which are the advantages of Monarchy) there the diſorders of a

He doubted it might be true, which is affirm'd by good Authors, and commonly enough known, that for the clearneſs of Debate, and ſecreſy of Reſult, the world never ſaw any thing like the Senat of <hi>Venice;</hi> and that in all appearance they are for execution as quick with the Divan, as the Divan can be with them. Now when all this is don, to baniſh ſo generous Thoughts without ſhewing us for what cauſe, and knock under the table, is ſad news. But he ſhall ſind me, in any thing that is reaſonable, moſt ready to ſerve him. To the Queſtion then, how ſuch Councils as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd would do with a Prince; I anſwer, truly the beſt of them, I doubt, but untowardly. One, that is the popular Aſſembly, has no mean, but is either the wiſeſt in Nature, or has no brains at all.* When affairs go upon no other than the public Intereſt, this having no other Intereſt to follow, nor eys to ſee withal, is the wiſeſt Council: but ſuch ways are deſtructive to a Prince, and they will have no Nay. The Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when REHOBOAM would not hearken to their advice, depos'd him: and we know what popular Councils, ſo ſoon as they came to ſufficient Power, did in <hi>England.</hi> If a Prince put a popular Council from this Ward, he dos a great matter, and to little purpoſe; for they underſtand nothing elſe but themſelves. Wherfore the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>Spain</hi> have diſſolv'd all ſuch Aſſemblys. It is true, where a Prince is not ſtrong enough to get Mony out of them but by their conſent, they are neceſſary; yet then they are not purely of Advice and Diſpatch, but ſhare in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he cannot be medling with their Purſes, but they will be medling with his Laws. The Senat is of ſitter uſe for a Prince, and yet, except he has the way of TIBERIUS, but a tickliſh piece, as appears by MAXIMINUS, who was deſtroy'd by PUPIENUS and BALBINUS, Captains ſet up againſt him by this Order. To go to the root: Theſe things are not otherwiſe in Prudence or Choice than by direction of the Balance; where this is popular, no Remedy but the Prince muſt be advis'd by the People, which if the late King would have indur'd, the Monarchy might have ſubſiſted ſomwhat longer: but while the Balance was Ariſtocratical, as during the great Eſtates of the Nobility and the Clergy, we find not the People to have bin great or wiſe Counſillors. In ſum, if a King governs by a popular Council, or a Houſe of Commons, the Throne will not ſtand long: If he governs by a Senat, or a Houſe of Lords, let him never fear the Throne, but have a care of himſelf: there is no third, as I have ſaid often enough, but the Divan.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Whether a Commonwealth that was not firſt broken by her ſelf, was ever conquer'd by the Arms of any Monarch?</head>
                     <p>I COM in this Chapter to reſume the Diſcourſe, where I broke off in the former, making good my aſſertion, That a Commonwealth is the Government, which from the beginning of the world to this day was never conquer'd by any Monarch; for if the Commonwealths of <hi>Greece</hi> came under the yoke of the Kings of <hi>Macedon,</hi> they were firſt broken by themſelves.</p>
                     <p>WHEN I ſpeak of a Commonwealth, in relation to this point, I am no more to be argu'd againſt out of the little Citys in <hi>Aſia,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>Raguſa,</hi> and <hi>San Marino,</hi> which cannot be ſhewn to have had the command of any conſiderable Army, than I argue againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicator, where he aſſerts Monarchy to conſiſt of a mixture of Arms and of a Nobility, from the King of <hi>Yuetot,</hi> who had neither.</p>
                     <p>THIS Aſſertion in the judgment of any rational man ought not to be incounter'd, but where there was a natural poſſibility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, in regard that a City which has no Army at all, as <hi>Geneva</hi> (which yet being invaded by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> found means to defend her ſelf) or ſuch a one as is not conſiderable, ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd by ſom potent Monarch (if we could find the example) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Government no more, than if it had bin overwhelm'd by ſom Inundation, or ſwallow'd up by ſom Earthquake. And yet all that is oppos'd by the Conſiderer, amounts not to thus much. The Teſtimony he brings out of PAUSANIAS coms far ſhort; for it is <note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 53. Pauſ. Meſſen.</note>recorded (ſays the Author ſpeaking of the <hi>Lacedemonians) that being corrupted by the Bounty of</hi> CRAESUS, <hi>they were the firſt that contracted Amity with the</hi> Barbarians <hi>at the time when that King added the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torys inhabited by the</hi> Dorians <hi>upon the border of</hi> Caria, <hi>with other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths in</hi> Aſia, <hi>to his Empire.</hi> So that CRAESUS corrupted the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> with Gifts, PAUSANIAS is expreſs; but whether he obtain'd the <hi>Aſiatic</hi> Citys (likely in this caſe to have bin eaſilier cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted than the <hi>Lacedemonians)</hi> by Arms or by Purchaſe, he is not expreſs: and the preſumtion of the latter, as in other regards, ſo in this, is the ſtronger, that CRAESUS by the teſtimony of SOLON, was more potent in Gold than in Iron. Now if it were ſo (and if otherwiſe, let the Conſiderer ſhew) that theſe Commonwealths, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigl'd by the Treaſure of CRAESUS, came firſt under the <hi>Lydian,</hi> and fell with that under the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, when CRAESUS was ſubdu'd by CYRUS; all I can learn by this example is no more than that CRAESUS, for ought that is perceivable, might have bought thoſe Commonwealths as COSIMO of MEDICIS did <hi>Florence;</hi> from whom it is affirm'd by MACCHIAVEL, that <hi>there was not a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Man in the whole City that had not receiv'd ſom conſiderable Sum.</hi> So this example preſumes; but in the next, which is of <hi>Sicily,</hi> there is not ſo much as a Preſumtion in favor of the Aſſertor: the State of <hi>Sicily,</hi> before that which the <hi>Romans</hi> call the firſt <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War, being clear in Story againſt his deſign.

To him ſucceded his Son, another PETER, who thro Youth and Raſhneſs conceiving the Power exercis'd by his Predeceſſors to be no more than his due, took upon him the Government as abſolute Lord of all; and ſtanding moſt formidably upon his Guard, grew ſottiſhly profuſe of the public Mony, and committed many Abſurditys and Violences: By which means having incurr'd the hatred of the Citizens, he was baniſh'd by the Signory, with Cardinal JOHN and JULIAN his Brothers. This JOHN coming after to be Pope LEO the Tenth, requir'd the revocation of his Brother's Baniſhment, and the reſtitution of the Houſe of MEDICIS; to which finding the prevailing Party of the <hi>Florentins</hi> to be refractory, he ſtir'd up the Arms of the Emperor CHARLES the Fifth againſt them, by whoſe joint aid the City, after a long ſiege, was reduc'd to her old Ward, and ALEXANDER of MEDICIS, Nephew to the Pope and Son in law to the Emperor, ſet in the known Saddle of his Anceſtors. This is the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Action for which the Prevaricator will have a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to have bin conquer'd by the Arms of a Monarch, tho whoever reads the Story may very ſafely affirm, Firſt, That <hi>Florence</hi> never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to any ſuch Orders as could deſerve the name of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and next, That the Purſe of COSIMO had don that long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which is here attributed to the Arms of the Pope and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.

                     <p>BUT the Prevaricator neither minds what is ſaid, nor cares what he ſays; to affirm that a Commonwealth was never conquer'd by any Monarch, and that a Commonwealth has conquer'd many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, or frequently led mighty Kings in triumph, is to run upon the foil, the ſecond Propoſition being with him no more than only the converſion of the firſt.

                     <head type="sub">Whether there be not an Agrarian, or ſom Law or Laws of that nature, to ſupply the defect of it in every Commonwealth: and whether the Agrarian, as it is ſtated in <hi>Oceana,</hi> be not equal and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to all Intereſts.</head>
                     <p>IN this Chapter the Prevaricator's Devices are the moſt welfavor'd: for wheras the Agrarian of <hi>Oceana</hi> dos no more than pin the basket, which is already fill'd, he gets up into the Tree where the Birds have long ſince eaten all the Cherrys, and with what Clouts he can rake up, makes a moſt ridiculous Scarcrow. This pains he needed not to have taken, if he had not ſlighted overmuch the <hi>Lexicon,</hi> of which he allows me to be the Author; yet will have it, that he underſtood the words before, ſom of which nevertheleſs his ill underſtanding requires ſhould be further interpreted in this place, as Property, Balance, Agrarian, and Levelling.</p>
                     <p>PROPERTY is that which is every mans own by the Law of the Land; and of this there is nothing ſtir'd, but all intirely left as it was found by the Agrarian of <hi>Oceana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>PROPERTY in Mony (except, as has bin ſhewn, in Citys that have little or no Territory) coms not to the preſent account. But Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in Land, according to the diſtribution that happens to be of the ſame, cauſes the political Balance producing Empire of the like nature: that is, if the Property in Lands be ſo diffus'd thro the whole People, that neither one Landlord, nor a few Landlords overbalance them, the Empire is popular. If the Property in Lands be ſo ingroſt by the Few, that they overbalance the whole People, the Empire is Ariſtocratical, or mix'd Monarchy; but if Property in Lands be in one Landlord, to ſuch a proportion as overbalances the whole People, the Empire is abſolute Monarchy. So the political Balance is threefold, Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Ariſtocratical, and Monarchical.</p>
                     <p>EACH of theſe Balances may be introduc'd either by the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at the inſtitution of the Government, or by civil Viciſſitude, Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or Alteration of Property under Government.</p>
                     <p>EXAMPLES of the Balance introduc'd at the Inſtitution, and by the Legiſlator, are firſt thoſe in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> introduc'd by GOD or MOSES, and LYCURGUS, which were Democratical or Popular. Secondly, Thoſe in <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the <hi>Goths, Vandals, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Franks,</hi> which were Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical, or ſuch as produc'd the Government of King, Lords, and Commons. Thirdly, Thoſe in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Turky,</hi> introduc'd by NIMROD, and MAHOMET or OTTOMAN, which were pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Monarchical.</p>
                     <p>EXAMPLES of the Balance introduc'd by civil Viciſſitude, Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or Alteration of Property under Government, are in <hi>Florence,</hi>

In <hi>Rome,</hi> about the time of CRASSUS, the Nobility having eaten the People out of their Lands, the Balance alter'd from Popular, firſt to Ariſtocratical, as in the <hi>Triumvirs,</hi> CESAR, POMPEY and CRASSUS; and then to Monarchical, as when CRASSUS being dead, and POMPEY conquer'd, the whole came to CESAR. <hi>In</hi> Tarentum, <hi>not long after the War with the</hi> Medes, <note place="margin">Ariſt. Pol. L. 5. c. 3.</note>
                        <hi>the Nobility being waſted, and overcom by</hi> Iapyges, <hi>the Balance, and with that the Commonwealth, chang'd from Ariſtocratical to Popular:</hi> The like of late has diſcover'd it ſelf in <hi>Oceana.</hi> When a Balance coms ſo thro civil Viciſſitude to be chang'd, that the change cannot be attributed to human Providence, it is more peculiarly to be aſcrib'd to the hand of God; and ſo when there happens to be an irreſiſtible change of the Balance, not the old Government which God has repeal'd, but the new Government which he dictats as preſent Legiſlator, is of Divine Right.</p>
                     <p>THIS Volubility of the Balance being apparent, it belongs to Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators to have eys, and to occur with ſom prudential or legal Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Prevention; and the Laws that are made in this caſe are call'd <hi>Agrarian.</hi> So <hi>An Agrarian is a Law ſixing the Balance of a Government in ſuch a manner that it cannot alter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THIS may be don divers ways, as by intailing the Lands upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Familys, without power of Alienation in any caſe, as in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon;</hi> or, except with leave of the Magiſtrat, as in <hi>Spain:</hi> But this, by making ſom Familys too ſecure, as thoſe in poſſeſſion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too deſpairing, as thoſe not in poſſeſſion, may make the whole People leſs induſtrious.</p>
                     <p>WHERFORE the other way, which by the regulation of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes ordains only that a mans Land ſhall not excede ſom certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; for example, two thouſand Pounds a year; or, exceding ſuch a proportion, ſhall divide in deſcending to the Children, ſo ſoon as being more than one, they ſhall be capable of ſuch a diviſion, or ſubdiviſion, till the greater ſhare excedes not two thouſand pounds a year in Land, lying and being within the native Territory, is that which is receiv'd and eſtabliſh'd by the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BY Levelling, they who uſe the word ſeem to underſtand, when a People riſing invades the Lands and Eſtates of the richer ſort, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides them equally among themſelves; as for example,—No where in the World; this being that, both in the way and in the end, which I have already demonſtrated to be impoſſible. Now the words of this <hi>Lexicon</hi> being thus interpreted, let us hearken what the Prevaricator will ſay, and out it coms in this manner.</p>

                     <p>WHICH is as if one ſhould ſay upon that other Law of the like date, <hi>Judges and Officers ſhalt thou make thee in all thy gates; Hocus Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> or in the name of Wonder, how ſhould the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> make them Judges and Officers in their gates, before they had any gates to make them in? fine ſport to be play'd by an Attorny for the Clergy with Scripture, where it is plain enough that the Laws of a Commonwealth were given by MOSES to an Army, to be put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution when that Army ſhould becom a Commonwealth, as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd under JOSHUA.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>BUT no ſaying will ſerve his turn.</hi> If this Agrarian were meant as fundamental to the Government, the Proviſion <hi>(he will have it)</hi> was weak, and not proper for attaining the end propos'd, there being nothing in the nature of the Agrarian to hinder, but that the whole Country might for the ſpace of near fifty years, that is, the time between the two Jubiles, have com into the hands of one man, and ſo have deſtroy'd Balance, Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Government and all.</p>
                     <p>THIS they that boaſt of their Mathematics might have taken the pains (before they had bin ſo confident) to have demonſtrated poſſible; as how or by what means one Lot could com in fifty years to be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd ſix hundred thouſand times, and that without Uſury, which bar (the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> being no Merchants) was thought ſufficient to be given: or thus to call the Prudence of God by their impracticable Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſys in queſtion, is abominable.</p>
                     <p>I WOULD have Divines (as this Prevaricator perſuades, and it ſhould ſeem has perſuaded ſom of them) to overthrow the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for otherwiſe I will give them my word they ſhall never be able to touch that of <hi>Oceana,</hi> which, except in the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Succeſſion and Dignity of the Princes of the Tribes, and the Patriarchs, and that the Senat was for life, differs not from the former: for as to the divers working up of the Superſtructures in divers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, according to the diverſity of occaſions, it coms to no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable difference; and much, I conceive, of this carving or finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Iſrael</hi> (which had it bin extant, would perhaps have ſhewn a greater reſemblance) is loſt. For the Senats, as to their numbers, that of the 300 in <hi>Oceana,</hi> conſidering the bulk of the People, excedes not that of the Seventy in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the Succeſſion and Dignity of the Princes of the Tribes and of the Patriarchs was ordain'd for the preſervation of the Pedigrees, which (CHRIST being born) are not any more to be of

like conſequence; and that the Senators were for life, deriv'd from a <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>11</label> former Cuſtom of ſuch a number of Elders exerciſing ſom Authority in <hi>Egypt</hi> (tho not that of the Senat till it was inſtituted by God) from the deſcent of the Patriarchs into that Land, who being at their deſcent ſeventy Perſons, and governing their Familys by the right of Paternity, as the People increas'd, and they came to dy, had their Succeſſors appointed in ſuch a manner that the number of Seventy, in remembrance of thoſe Patriarchs, was diligently preſerv'd. And foraſmuch as the Patriarchs governing their own Familys (which at firſt were all) in their own right, were conſequently for life, this alſo pleas'd in the ſubſtitution of others. Theſe things rightly conſider'd, I have not vary'd from the Authority of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a tittle, there being neither any ſuch neceſſary uſe of Pedigrees, nor uninterrupted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Elders for life in <hi>Oceana;</hi> and unleſs a man will ſay, That we ought to have the like Effect where there is not the like Cauſe (which were abſurd) the Authority of a Commonwealth holds no otherwiſe than from the Cauſe to the Effect.</p>

In this manner, tho a Man, or a Commonwealth, writing out of antient Governments, have liberty to chuſe that which ſutes beſt with the occaſion, out of any; yet (whether we conſider the Wiſdom and Juſtice of the Legiſlator ſupremely good, or the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Laws) the Prerogative of Authority, where the nature of the thing admits it, muſt needs belong to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> That this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſhould go ſore with Divines, is ſtrange; and yet, if there be any feeling of their pulſe by this their Advocat or Attorny, it is as true.</p>

No, ſays the Prevaricator, it appears far otherwiſe, <hi>in that he admitted of no Mony but old Iron, a Cartload of which was worth little.</hi> Well, but in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where Silver and Gold was worth enough, my Gentleman would have it, that <hi>one man in the compaſs of fifty years might purchaſe the whole Land,</hi> tho that Country was much larger than this: and yet where, if the People had us'd Mony, they would have us'd Trade, and uſing both, ſuch a thing, thro the ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Territory, might have happen'd, he will not conceive the like to have bin poſſible. No, tho he has an example of it in LY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SANDER, who by the ſpoil of <hi>Athens</hi> ruin'd the Agrarian, firſt by the overbalance that a mans Mony came to hold to his Lot; then by eating out the Lots themſelves, and in thoſe the Equality of the Commonwealth.

Bate me this, and ſhew me in what other City increaſe of Houſes or new Foundations was ever held a Nuſance. This ſure is a Phanſy that regards not the old Folks, or antient Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>ONE of the Bleſſings that God promis'd to ABRAHAM, was, that <hi>his Seed ſhould be multiply'd as the Stars of Heaven:</hi> And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> by multiplying her Seed, came to bound her Territory with the Ocean, and her Fame with the Stars of Heaven. That ſuch a Populouſneſs is that without which there can be no great Commonwealth, both Reaſon and good Authors are clear; but whether it ought to begin in the Country, or in the City, is a ſcruple I have not known them make. That of <hi>Iſrael</hi> began in the Country, that of <hi>Rome</hi> in the City. Except there be obſtruction or impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Law, as in <hi>Turky</hi> where the Country, and in <hi>England</hi> where the City is forbid to increaſe; wherever there is a populous Country, for example <hi>France,</hi> it makes a populous City, as <hi>Paris;</hi> and wherever there is a populous City, as <hi>Rome</hi> after the ruin of <hi>Alba,</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam</hi> after the ruin (as to Trade) of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> it makes a populous Territory, as was that of the Ruſtic Tribes, and is that of <hi>Holland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BUT the ways how a populous City coms to make a populous Country, and how a populous Country coms to make a populous City, are contrary; the one happening thro ſucking, as that of the City, and the other thro weaning, as that of the Country.</p>
                     <p>FOR proof of the former: the more mouths there be in a City, the more meat of neceſſity muſt be vented by the Country, and ſo there will be more Corn, more Cattel, and better Markets; which breeding more Laborers, more Husbandmen, and richer Farmers, bring the Country ſo far from a Commonwealth of Cottagers, that where the Bleſſings of God, thro the fruitfulneſs of late years with us, render'd the Husbandman unable <hi>to diſpute Precedence with the Beggers Buſh,</hi> his Trade thus uninterrupted, in that his Markets are certain, gos on with increaſe of Children, of Servants, of Corn, and of Cattel: for there is no reaſon why the Fields adjoining to <hi>Emporium,</hi> being but of a hard ſoil, ſhould annually produce two Crops; but the Populouſneſs of the City.</p>
                     <p>THE Country then growing more populous, and better ſtock'd with Cattel, which alſo increaſes Manure for the Land, muſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably increaſe in fruitfulneſs. Hence it is that (as the <hi>Romans</hi> alſo were good at ſuch works) in <hi>Holland</hi> there is ſcarce a puddle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drain'd, nor a bank of Sand caſt up by the Sea, that is not cover'd with Earth, and made fruitful by the People; theſe being ſo ſtrangely, with the growth of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> increas'd, as coms perhaps to two parts in three: nor, the Agrarian taking place in <hi>Oceana,</hi> would it be longer diſputed, whether ſhe might not deſtroy Fiſhes to plant Men. Thus a populous City makes a Country milch, or populous by ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and wheras ſom may ſay, that ſuch a City may ſuck from foren parts, it is true enough, and no where more apparent than in <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> But a City that has recourſe to a foren Dug, ere ſhe had firſt ſuck'd that of her proper Nurſe or Territory dry, you ſhall hardly find; or finding (as in ſom Plantation not yet wean'd) will hardly
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:49467:179"/>
be able to make that Objection hold, ſeeing it will not ly ſo much againſt <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>11</label> the Populouſneſs of the place, as the contrary.</p>
                     <p>BUT a populous Country makes a populous City by weaning; for when the People increaſe ſo much, that the dug of Earth can do no more, the overplus muſt ſeek ſom other way of Livelihood: which is either Arms, ſuch were thoſe of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals;</hi> or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize and Manufacture, for which ends it being neceſſary that they lay their Heads and their Stock together, this makes populous Citys. Thus <hi>Holland</hi> being a ſmall Territory, and ſuck'd dry, has upon the matter wean'd the whole People, and is therby becom as it were one City that ſucks all the World.</p>
                     <p>BUT by this means, ſays the Conſiderer, Emporium <hi>being already too great</hi> (while indeed <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> conſidering the narrowneſs of the Territory, or the ſmalneſs of <hi>Holland,</hi> is much more populous) <hi>would immediatly grow into an exceſs of Power and Riches, very dangerous to Liberty, an example wherof was ſeen in the late Tyranny of that City:</hi> As if it were not ſufficiently known that <hi>Amſterdam</hi> contributes, and has contributed more to the deſence of the Commonwealth, or United Provinces, than all the reſt of the League, and had in thoſe late Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have bin ſcandaliz'd, reſiſted not the Intereſt of Liberty, but of a Lord. That the increaſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was always ſtudy'd by her beſt Citizens, ſhould make her Head too great for her Body, or her Power dangerous to the Tribes, was never ſo much as imagin'd; and tho ſhe were <hi>a City of Princes,</hi> her ruſtic Tribes were ever had in greateſt Eſteem and Honor; inſomuch, that a Patrician would be of no other.</p>
                     <p>BUT the Authority of antient Commonwealths is needleſs; the Prevaricator by his own Argumentation or Might, lays himſelf neck and heels.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 93.</note> FOR, ſays he, <hi>Were this Agrarian once ſettl'd,</hi> Emporium <hi>would be a City of Princes, and the Nobility ſo throly plum'd, that they would be juſt as ſtrong of wing, as wild Fowl in moulting time.</hi> There would be a City of Princes, and yet no Nobility. He is ſo faſt that I have pity on him, if I knew but which way to let him looſe. He means perhaps, that the Merchants growing rich, would be the Nobility; and the Nobility growing poor, would be Graſiers.</p>
                     <p>BUT ſo for ought I know it was always, or worſe, that is, men attain'd to Riches and Honors by ſuch or worſe Arts, and in Poverty made not always ſo honeſt Retreats. To all which Infirmitys of the State, I am deceiv'd if this Agrarian dos not apply the proper Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys. For ſuch an Agrarian makes a Commonwealth for increaſe: the Trade of a Commonwealth for increaſe, is Arms; Arms are not born by Merchants, but by Noblemen and Gentlemen. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility therfore having theſe Arms in their hands, by which Provinces are to be acquir'd, new Provinces yield new Eſtates; ſo wheras the Merchant has his returns in Silk or Canvas, the Soldier will have his return in Land. He that repreſents me as an Enemy to the Nobility, is the man he ſpeaks of; for if ever the Commonwealth attains to five new Provinces (and ſuch a Commonwealth will have Provinces enow) it is certain, that (beſides Honors, Magiſtracys, and the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues annex'd) there will be more Eſtates in the Nobility of <hi>Oceana,</hi> of fourteen thouſand pounds Land a year, than ever were, or can otherwiſe be of four; and that without any the leaſt danger to the

                     <p>ONE Argument more I have heard urg'd againſt the Populouſneſs of the Capital City, which is, That the Rich in time of ſickneſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the place, by which means the Markets com to fail, the Poor, leſt they ſhould ſtarve, will run abroad, and infect the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is furniſh'd with Laws, and Power to add ſuch as ſhe ſhall find needful. In caſe a City be in that manner viſited, it is the duty of the Country, and of the Government, to provide for them by contribution.</p>

                        <hi>HIS laſt caſt is,</hi> That the Agrarian would make War againſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and immemorial Cuſtom; which being without doubt more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than that of Reaſon, there is nothing of ſuch difficulty as to perſuade men at once, and crudely, that they and their Forefathers have bin in an Error.</p>

                     <p>BUT the caſe of the Agrarian receives equal ſtrength from each of theſe Counſillors or Opinions: from the latter, in that it gos upon grounds which <hi>Time has not innovated for the worſe, but for the better;</hi> and ſo according to the former coms not to have bin at once, and crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded, but introduc'd by Cuſtom, now grown univerſal and immemorial.

                     <p>ROTATION in a Commonwealth is of the Magiſtracy, of the Senat, of the People; of the Magiſtracy and the People; of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy and the Senat; or of the Magiſtracy, of the Senat, and of the People: which in all com to ſix kinds.</p>
                     <p>FOR example of Rotation in the Magiſtracy, you have the Judg <note place="margin">Grot.</note>of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> call'd in Hebrew <hi>Shophet.</hi> The like Magiſtracy after the Kings ITHOBAL and BAAL came in uſe with the <hi>Tyrians;</hi> from theſe, with their Poſterity the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who alſo call'd their ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats, being in number two, and for their Term Annual, <hi>Shophetim,</hi> which the Latins by a ſofter Pronunciation render <hi>Suffetes.</hi>

                     <p>THE <hi>Shophet</hi> or <hi>Judg of Iſrael</hi> was a Magiſtrat, not, that I can find, oblig'd to any certain term, throout the Book of <hi>Judges;</hi> never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, it is plain, that his Election was occaſional, and but for a time, after the manner of a Dictator.</p>
                     <p>TRUE it is, that ELI and SAMUEL rul'd all their lives; but upon this ſuch impatience in the People follow'd, thro the corruption of their Sons, as was the main cauſe of the ſucceding Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>THE Magiſtrats in <hi>Athens</hi> (except the <hi>Areopagits,</hi> being a Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory) were all upon Rotation. The like for <hi>Lacedemon</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> except the Kings in the former, who were indeed hereditary, but had no more Power than the Duke in <hi>Venice,</hi> where all the reſt of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats (except the <hi>Procuratori,</hi> whoſe Magiſtracy is but mere Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) are alſo upon Rotation.</p>
                     <p>FOR the Rotation of the Senat you have <hi>Athens,</hi> the <hi>Achaeans, Aetolians, Lycians,</hi> the <hi>Amphictionium;</hi> and the Senat of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, <note place="margin">Pol. l. 2. c. 7.</note>in that it was for life, by ARISTOTLE: Modern Examples of like kind are the Diet of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> but eſpecially the Senat of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>FOR the Rotation of the People, you have firſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where the Congregation (which the <hi>Greecs</hi> call <hi>Eccleſia;</hi> the <hi>Latins, Comitia,</hi> or <hi>Concio)</hi> having a twofold capacity; firſt, that of an Army, in which they were the conſtant Guard of the Country; and, ſecondly, that of a Repreſentative, in which they gave the Vote of the People, at the creation of their Laws, or election of their Magiſtrats, was Monthly. <note place="margin">1 Chron. 27. 1.</note>

                     <p>I MAY expect (by ſuch Objections as they afford me) it ſhould be alleg'd, that to prove an Order in a Commonwealth, I inſtance in a Monarchy; as if there were any thing in this Order monarchical, or that could, if it had not bin ſo receiv'd from the Commonwealth, have bin introduc'd by the Kings, to whom in the judgment of any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber man (the Prevaricator only excepted, who has bin huckling about ſom ſuch Council for his Prince) no leſs could have follow'd upon the firſt frown of the People, than did in REHOBOAM, who having <note place="margin">1 Kings 12.</note>us'd them roughly, was depos'd by the Congregation, or the <hi>major</hi> part. It is true, that while <hi>Iſrael</hi> was an Army, the Congregation, as it needed not to aſſemble by way of Election or Repreſentative, ſo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it did not; but that by all <hi>Iſrael</hi> aſſembl'd to this end, ſhould be meant the whole People after they were planted upon their Lots, and not their Repreſentative, which in a political ſenſe is as properly ſo call'd, were abſurd and impoſſible.

But our Tranſlation is lame in the right foot, as to the true diſcovery of the antient manner of this ſervice, which according to the Septuagint and the vulgar Latin was thus, <hi>they were keepers of the Gates of the Tabernacle</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

If Writers argue well and lawfully from what the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> was in the inſtitution by JEHOSAPHAT, to what it had more antiently bin; to argue from what the Congregation was in the inſtitution by DAVID, to what it had more antiently bin, is ſufficiently warranted.</p>
                     <p>THESE things rightly conſider'd, there remains little doubt but we have the courſes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for the firſt example of Rotation in a popular Aſſembly. Now to com from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the ſame is approv'd by ARISTOTLE, which he exemplifys in the Commonwealth of THALES MILESIUS, where the People, <note place="margin">Pol. l. 4. c. 14.</note>he ſays, aſſembl'd (<gap reason="foreign">

But the <hi>Gothic</hi> Prudence in the Policy of the third State, runs alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon the Collection of a Repreſentative by the Suffrage of the People (tho not ſo diligently regulated, by Terms and Vacations, as to a ſtanding Aſſembly were neceſſary, by Turns, Rotation, Parem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole or Courſes) as in the election of the late Houſe of Commons, and the conſtitutive Viciſſitude of the Knights and Burgeſſes, is known by ſufficient experience.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the Rotation of a Commonwealth is both in the Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and the People, I reckon it to be of a fourth kind, as in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where both the Judg and the Congregation were ſo elected.</p>
                     <p>THE fifth kind is when the Rotation of a Commonwealth is in the Magiſtracy and the Senat, as in thoſe of <hi>Athens,</hi> of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> of the <hi>Lycians,</hi> and of <hi>Venice;</hi> upon which Examples, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the influence each of them, at leaſt <hi>Athens,</hi> may have upon the following Book, than any great neceſſity from the preſent occaſion, I ſhall inlarge in this place.</p>

The next Office of this Aſſembly was to elect Judges into five Courts or Judicatorys; for the People being in the Bulk too unweildy a Body for the performance of this duty, they exercis'd the ſupreme Judicature by way of Repreſentative, into which Election was made by Lottery, in ſuch a manner that five hundred, one thouſand, or 1500 of them (according to the importance of the occaſion) being above thirty years of Age, and within the reſt of the Qualifications in that caſe provided by the Law, became the Soverain Judicatory, call'd the <hi>Heliaea.</hi> In all Elections, whether by Lot or Suffrage, the <hi>Theſmothetae</hi> were Preſidents, and order'd the Congregation.

                     <p>CHIROTONIA (as <hi>SUIDAS</hi> has it) ſignifys both <hi>Plebiſcitum,</hi> a Law made by the People, and <hi>Pſephiſma.</hi> Now, <hi>ſays he, Pſephiſma</hi> is the ordinary word us'd in the <hi>Attic</hi> Laws, and in <hi>DEMOSTHENES</hi> for <hi>Senatuſconſultum,</hi> a Law made by the Senat: <hi>whence he draws this Concluſion;</hi> As, when the People make a Law, they are ſaid to Chiroto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize; ſo may the Rulers, in like manner, in thoſe Laws that are made by themſelves alone.</p>

                     <p>THE Policy of the <hi>Achaeans</hi> conſiſted of divers Commonwealths under one, which was thus adminiſter'd.

The Quarancys in <hi>Venice</hi> are Judicatorys of the nature of the <hi>Heliaea</hi> in <hi>Athens;</hi> and as the <hi>Theſmothetae</hi> heard and introduc'd the cauſes into that Judicatory, ſo do the <hi>Avogadori</hi> and the <hi>Auditori</hi> into theſe. The <hi>Conſiglio de' Dieci</hi> in <hi>Venice</hi> is not of the Body, but an Appendix of the Commonwealth; ſo was the Court of the <hi>Ephori</hi> in <hi>Lacedemon:</hi> and as theſe had power to put a King, a Magiſtrat, or any Delinquent of what degree ſoever to death, ſo has the <hi>Conſiglio de' Dieci.</hi> This again is wrought up with the <hi>Capi de' Dieci,</hi> and the weekly Provoſt, as were the <hi>Prytans</hi> with the <hi>Proedri,</hi> and the weekly <hi>Epiſtata;</hi> and the Ballot is lineally deſcended from the Bean: yet is <hi>Venice</hi> in the whole, and in every part, a far more exquiſit Policy than either <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Lacedemon.</hi>

No more: nay I am well if it coms to ſo much. For the Prevaricator catching me up, where I ſay, that for all this the greater Magiſtracys in <hi>Venice</hi> are continually <note place="margin">Conſid. <hi>p.</hi> 93.</note>wheel'd thro a few hands, tells me, that <hi>I have confeſt it to be otherwiſe.</hi> I have indeed confeſt, that tho the Magiſtracys are all confer'd for certain terms, yet thoſe terms do not neceſſitat Vacations; that is, the term of a Magiſtracy being expir'd, the Party that bore it is capable upon a new Election of bearing it again without interval or vacation: which dos not altogether fruſtrat the Rotation of the Commonwealth, tho it renders the ſame very imperfect. This infirmity of <hi>Venice</hi> derives from a complication of Cauſes, none of which is incident to a Commonwealth conſiſting of the Many: wherfore there lys no obligation upon me to diſcover the reaſon in this place. But on the contrary, ſeeing, let me ſhew things never ſo new, they are ſlighted as old, I have an obligation in this place, to try whether I may get eſteem by concealing ſomthing.

                        <hi>RIDDLE</hi> me, Riddle me, what is this? The Magiſtracys in <hi>Venice</hi> (except ſuch as are rather of Ornament than of Power) are all annual, or at moſt biennial. No man whoſe term is expir'd, can hold his Magiſtracy longer, but by a new Election. The Elections are moſt of them made in the Great Council, and all by the Ballot, which is the moſt equal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial way of Suffrage. And yet the greater Magiſtracys are perpetually wheel'd thro a few hands.</p>
                     <p>IF I be worthy to give advice to a man that would ſtudy the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics, let him underſtand <hi>Venice;</hi> he that underſtands <hi>Venice</hi> right, ſhall go neareſt to judg (notwithſtanding the difference that is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Policy) right of any Government in the World. Now the aſſault of the Conſiderer deriving but from ſom Pique or Emulation which of us ſhould be the abler Politician, if the Council of State had the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to know either that, or who underſtands <hi>Venice,</hi> this Riddle would make the diſcovery; for he that cannot eaſily unfold this Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, dos not underſtand her.</p>
                     <p>THE ſixth kind of Rotation is when a Commonwealth gos upon it in all her Orders, Senat, People, and Magiſtracy. Such a one taking in the Many, and being fix'd upon the foot of a ſteady Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, has attain'd to perfect Equality.

THE Rotation of <hi>Oceana</hi> is of two parts, the one of the Electors <label type="milestone">

                     </p>
                     <p>SPEAKING of Electors in this ſenſe, I mean as the great Council in <hi>Venice</hi> are Electors of all other Orders, Councils or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats. But the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> taking in the whole People, cannot, as dos the Great Council of <hi>Venice</hi> (wherin they that have right are but a few) attain to this capacity at one ſtep: for which cauſe ſhe takes three ſteps; one at the Pariſhes, where every fifth Elder is annually elected by the whole People. There is no doubt but there was ſom ſuch Order in <hi>Iſrael</hi> wherby the monthly Rotation of her Congregation or Prerogative, by election of two thouſand in each Tribe, was preſerv'd. The next ſtep ſhe takes is at the Hundred, wherby election of Officers and Magiſtrats, the Troops choſen at the Pariſhes, are very near form'd. Her third ſtep is at the Tribe, where the whole body of her Deputys are in exact Form, Diſciplin and Function, headed by proper Officers and Magiſtrats, theſe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether conſiſting of one fifth part of the whole People. This Rotation being in it ſelf annual, coms in regard of the body of the People to be quinquennial, or ſuch as in the ſpace of five years gives every man his turn in the power of Election.</p>
                     <p>BUT tho every man be ſo capable of being an Elector, that he muſt have his turn; yet every man is not ſo capable of being elected into thoſe Magiſtracys that are Soverain, or have the leading of the whole Commonwealth, that it can be ſafe to lay a neceſſity that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt take his turn in theſe alſo: but it is enough that every man, who in the Judgment and Conſcience of his Country is fit, may take his turn. Wherfore upon the Conſcience of the Electors, ſo conſtituted as has bin ſhewn, it gos to determin who ſhall partake of Soverain Magiſtracy, or be at the Aſſembly of a Tribe elected into the Senat or Prerogative; which Aſſemblys are ſo triennial, that one third part of each falling every year, and another being elected, the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is therby perpetuated.</p>
                     <p>SUCH was the Conſtitution of thoſe Councils which the Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has confeſt he always thought admirable, but now the toy takes him to be quite of another mind; for, ſays he, <hi>That antient Republics have</hi>

He is ſtill admirable: One would wonder what he means; if it be that there were but three weak or unfortunat Generals in the whole courſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> how ſtrange is it to urge this as an Argument againſt Rotation, which is as ſtrong a one as can be urg'd for Rotation? If the <hi>Romans</hi> by this way of Election having experience of an able General, knew ever after where to have him; or lighting upon one they found not ſo fit for their purpoſe, could in the compaſs of one year be rid of him of courſe, without diſhonor or reproach to him, taking therby a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to com no more there; was this a proceding to favor malice? or ſuch as one as, removing the cauſe of malice, left no root for ſuch a branch or poſſibility of like effect?

One of the greateſt blows <hi>Rome</hi> ever receiv'd was by PONTIUS, Captain General of the <hi>Samnits,</hi> who having drawn <note place="margin">Liv. l. 9.</note>her Conſuls, POSTHUMIUS and VETURIUS, by Stratagem into the Straits of <hi>Caudium,</hi> a Vally of narrow entrance, and ſhut up the mouth of it by poſſeſſing himſelf of the only Paſſage, the reſt being inviron'd with inſuperable Rocks, the <hi>Samnit</hi> came to have both the Armys, and ſo upon the matter the whole ſtrength (in thoſe days) of <hi>Rome</hi> inevitably at his diſcretion. Hereupon, having leiſure, and being deſirous (in a matter of ſuch moment) of good advice, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd a Meſſenger to his Father HERENNIUS, the ableſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillor in <hi>Samnium,</hi> to know what might be his beſt courſe with the <hi>Romans</hi> now inavoidably at his mercy, who anſwer'd, <hi>that he ſhould open the Paſs, and let them return untouch'd.</hi> The young General amaz'd at this Counſil, deſir'd farther direction; wherupon HERENNIUS for the ſecond time made anſwer, <hi>that he ſhould cut them off to a man.</hi> But the General, upon the ſtrange diſagreement of ſuch opinions, having his Fathers Age (for he was very old) in ſuſpicion, took a third courſe, which <hi>neither</hi> (according to the firſt advice of wiſe HERENNIUS) <hi>making Friends, nor,</hi> according to the ſecond, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Enemys,</hi> became as he propheſy'd the utter Ruin of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Samnium.</hi> For the <hi>Romans</hi> being diſmiſt ſafe, but ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiouſly, the Senat upon their return fell into the greateſt ſtrait and conſternation that had bin known among them. On the one ſide, to live and not revenge ſuch an affront was intolerable; on the other, to revenge it was againſt the Faith of the Conſuls, whoſe neceſſity (the loſs of two Armys lying upon it) had in truth forc'd them to accept of a diſhonorable League with the <hi>Samnits.</hi> Now not the Armys, but the Senat it ſelf was in <hi>Caudium,</hi> not a man of them could find the way out of this Vale inviron'd with Rocks, but he only that could not find it out of the other; POSTHUMIUS, who having firſt ſhew'd, that neither War nor Peace could be ſo made, as to ingage the Commonwealth <hi>(injuſſu Populi)</hi> without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the People, declar'd that the Senat returning the Conſuls, with ſuch others as had conſented to ſo wicked and diſhonorable a Peace, naked, and bound to the <hi>Samnits,</hi> were free: nor ceas'd he till the Senat (therto preſt by the neceſſity of the Commonwealth) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving accordingly, He, VETURIUS, and ſom of the Tribuns were deliver'd to the <hi>Samnits;</hi> who, nevertheleſs, to hold the <hi>Romans</hi> to their League, diſmiſt them with ſafety. The Diſputes on either ſide that aroſe hereupon, and, coming to Arms, ended with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Samnium,</hi> I omit. That which as to the preſent occaſion is material, is the Reputation of the Conſuls; and VETURIUS, tho he were not the leading man, being for the reſt as deep in the Action as POSTHUMIUS, the People were ſo far from thinking themſelves deceiv'd in this choice, that the Conſuls were more honor'd in <hi>Rome</hi> for having loſt, than PONTIUS in <hi>Samnium</hi> for having won the day at <hi>Caudium.</hi>

B. 3. c. 24.</note> THE Procedings of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth being well conſider'd, two things will be found to have bin the cauſes of her diſſolution. The Contention that happen'd thro the indeavor of the People (always oppos'd or eluded by the Nobility) to introduce an Agrarian, and the damage that accru'd from the prolongation of Empire; which Miſchiefs, had they bin foreſeen in due time, the Government by application of fit Remedys might have bin of longer life and better health. The Diſeaſes which this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, from contention about the Agrarian, contracted, were acute and tumultuous; but thoſe being ſlower, and without tumult, which ſhe got by promulgation of Empire, were Chronical, and went home with her giving a warning by her example, how dangerous it is to States that would injoy their Liberty, to ſuffer Magiſtracy (how deſervedly ſoever confer'd) to remain long in the poſſeſſion of the ſame man. Certainly if the reſt of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe Empire happen'd to be prolong'd, had bin as virtuous and provident as <hi>LUCIUS QUINTIUS,</hi> they had never run into this inconvenience. Of ſuch wholſom example was the goodneſs of this man, that the Senat and the People, after one of their ordinary Diſputes, being com to ſom accord, wheras the People had prolong'd the Magiſtracy of their preſent Tribuns, in regard they were Perſons more fitly oppos'd to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Nobility, than by a new Election they could readily have found; when hereupon the Senat (to ſhew they needed not be worſe at this game) would have prolong'd the Conſulat to <hi>QUINTIUS,</hi> he refus'd his conſent, ſaying, that ill examples were to be corrected by good ones, and not incourag'd by others like themſelves; nor could they ſtir his Reſolution, by which means they were neceſſitated to make new Conſuls.

Nor is it ſo certain that increaſe is ſlower for Rotation, ſeeing neither was this interrupted by that, nor that by this, as the greateſt Actions of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Conqueſt of <hi>Carthage</hi> by SCIPIO AFRICANUS, of MACEDON by FLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINIUS, and of ANTIOCHUS by ASIATICUS, are irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Teſtimonys.</p>

                     <p>IF where Elections were the moſt expos'd to the Ambition of the Competitor, and the humors of the People, they yet fail'd not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all others that were not popular, what greater Vindication can there be of the natural integrity of popular Suffrage even at the worſt? But this, where it is given by the Ballot, is at the beſt, and free from all that preſſing for Magiſtracy in the Competitor, or Faction of the People that can any ways be laid to the former: or let the Conſiderer conſider again, and tell me by what means either of theſe in ſuch a State can be dangerous or troubleſom; or if at worſt the Orders for Election in <hi>Oceana</hi> muſt not perform that part, better than a Croud and a Sherif. Well; but putting the caſe the Elections which were not quarrel'd much withal be rightly ſtated, yet this Law for Terms and Vacations, <hi>by taking off at the end of one year ſom Officers, and all at the end of three, will keep the Republic in perpetual Minority, no man having time allow'd him to gain that Experience, which may ſerve to lead the Commonwealth to the underſtanding of her true Intereſt at home or abroad.</hi> Becauſe every man will preſs forward for Magiſtracy, therfore there ought not to be Terms and Vacations, leſt theſe ſhould keep the Commonwealth in perpetual Minority. I would once ſee an Argument that might be reduc'd to Mode and Figure. The next Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, that theſe Orders <hi>take off at the end of one year ſom Officers,</hi> which is true, and <hi>that at the end of three years they take off all,</hi> which is falſe; for wheras the Leaders of the Commonwealth are all triennial, the Orders every year take off no more than ſuch only as have finiſh'd their three years term, which is not all, but a third part. Wherfore let him ſpeak out; three years is too ſhort a term for acquiring that knowlege which is neceſſary to the leading of a Commonwealth. To let the courſes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which were monthly, and the annual Magiſtracys of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> go; if three years be too ſhort a term for this purpoſe, what was three months? A Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the late Government was rarely longer liv'd than three months, nor more frequent than once in a year; ſo that a man having bin twelve years a Parlament-man in <hi>England,</hi> could not have born his Magiſtracy above three years, tho he were not neceſſarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to any Vacation. Wheras a Parlament in <hi>Oceana</hi> may in twelve years have born his Magiſtracy ſix, notwithſtanding the neceſſity of his Vacations. Now which of theſe two are moſt ſtraiten'd in the time neceſſary to the gaining of due experience or knowlege for the leading of a Commonwealth? Nevertheleſs the Parlament of <hi>England</hi> was ſeldom or never without men of ſufficient Skill and Ability; tho the Orders there were more in number, leſs in method, not written, and of greater difficulty than they be in <hi>Oceana.</hi> There, if not the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment man, the Parlament it ſelf was upon Terms and Vacations, which to a Council of ſuch a nature is the moſt dangerous thing in the world, ſeeing Diſſolution, whether to a Body natural or political, is Death.

                     <p>THE three Regions into which each of the leading Councils is divided, are three Forms, as I may ſay, in the School of State: for them of the third, tho there be care in the choice, it is no ſuch great matter what be their Skill; the Ballot which they practis'd in the Tribe being that in the performance wherof no man can be out: and this is all that is neceſſary to their Novitiat or firſt year, during which time they may be Auditors. By the ſecond, they will have ſeen all the Scenes, or the whole Rotation of the Orders, ſo facil, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, that at one reading a man underſtands them as a Book, but at once acting as a Play; and ſo methodical, that he will remember them better. Tell me then what it is that can hinder him for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year from being a Speaker; or why for the third, ſhould he not be a very able Leader.</p>
                     <p>THE Senat and the Prerogative, or Repreſentative of the People, being each of like conſtitution, drop annually four hundred, which in a matter of ten years amount to four thouſand experienc'd Leaders, ready upon new Elections to reſume their leading.</p>
                     <p>ANOTHER thing which I would have conſider'd is, whether our moſt eminent men found their Parts in Parlament, or brought them thither. For if they brought them, think you not the military Orders of the Youth, the Diſciplin of the Tribes, the eight years Orb of the Embaſſadors, the provincial Armys of <hi>Oceana,</hi> likely to breed men of as good Parts, as to ſuch matters? Nor have Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers that familiarity with the Stars, which men without theſe Orbs will have with ſuch as are in them. He is very dull, who cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that in a Government of this frame the Education muſt be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, or diffus'd throout the whole Body. Another thing which is as certain as comfortable, is that the pretended depth and difficulty in matters of State is a mere cheat. From the beginning of the World to this day, you never found a Commonwealth where the Leaders having honeſty enough, wanted skill enough to lead her to her true Intereſt at home or abroad: that which is neceſſary to this end, is not ſo much Skill as Honeſty; and let the Leaders of <hi>Oceana</hi> be diſhoneſt if they can. In the leading of a Commonwealth aright, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Wiſdom and Honeſty are all one: and tho you ſhall find defects in their Virtue, thoſe that have had the feweſt, have ever bin, and for ever ſhall be, the wiſeſt.</p>

                  <p>BOOKS, eſpecially whoſe Authors have got themſelves Names, are Leaders; wherfore in caſe any of theſe err in Leading, it is not only lawful, but matter of Conſcience to a man that perceives it, as far as he is able, to warn others. This were Apology enough for my writing againſt Dr. <hi>HAMMOND</hi> and Dr. <hi>SEAMAN;</hi> and yet I have happen'd to be brought under a farther Obligation to this enterpriſe, their Books having bin ſent me by way of Objection againſt what I have formerly ſaid of Ordination, and am daily more and more confirm'd I ſhall make good. However, there can be no great hurt in this Eſſay, Truth being, like Veniſon, not only the beſt Quarry, but the beſt Game.</p>

                  <p>TO manage the preſent Controverſy with the more Clearneſs, I have divided my Diſcourſe into five Parts or Chapters.</p>
                  <p>THE Firſt, explaining the words <hi>Chirotonia</hi> and <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſticaly relates the Story of the Perambulation made by the Apoſtles <hi>PAUL</hi> and <hi>BARNABAS</hi> thro the Citys of <hi>Lycaonia, Piſydia,</hi> &amp;c. by way of Introduction.</p>
                  <p>THE Second ſhews thoſe Citys, or moſt of them, at the time of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulation, to have bin under popular Government. In which is contain'd the whole Adminiſtration of a <hi>Roman</hi> Province.</p>
                  <p>THE Third ſhews the Deduction of the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> from Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and of the Original Right of Ordination from the <hi>Chirotonia.</hi> In which is contain'd the Inſtitution of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> or Senat of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>MOSES,</hi> and of that at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>ROMULUS.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Fourth ſhews the Deduction of the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> from Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Ariſtocratical Government, and the ſecond way of Ordination from the <hi>Chirotheſia.</hi> In which is contain'd the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews</hi> as it ſtood after the Captivity.</p>
                  <p>THE Fifth debates whether the <hi>Chirotonia,</hi> us'd in the Citys mention'd, was (as is pretended by Dr. <hi>HAMMOND,</hi> Dr. <hi>SEAMAN,</hi> and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors they follow) the ſame with the <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> or a far different thing. In which are contain'd the divers kinds of Church-Government introduc'd and exercis'd in the age of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>I AM entring into a Diſcourſe to run much, for the Words, upon a Language not vulgar, which therfore I ſhall uſe no otherwiſe than by way of Parentheſis, not obſtructing the Senſe; and for the Things, upon Cuſtoms that are foren, which therfore I ſhall interpret as well as I can. Now ſo to make my way into the parts of this diſcourſe, that (wheras they who have heretofore manag'd it in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> might in regard of their Readers have near as well written it in <hi>Greec)</hi> I may not be above the vulgar capacity, I ſhall open both the Names wherof, and the Things wherupon we are about to diſpute, by way of Introduction.</p>

                     <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T ſom of them that believ'd, being of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Cyrene,</hi> when they came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> had the boldneſs to ſpeak of <hi>CHRIST</hi> to the <hi>Greecs,</hi> preaching the Lord <hi>JESUS,</hi> in which they made ſuch progreſs thro the Bleſſing of God upon them and their Labors, that a great number of theſe alſo believing the Goſpel, were turn'd to the Lord. The tidings of theſe things coming to the ears of the Church which was at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a man of Apoſtolical Sincerity, <hi>BARNABAS</hi> the <hi>Levite,</hi> a <hi>Cyprian</hi> born, was ſent by the Apoſtles to take a view of what was don upon the places; and if he found it to be according to the will of God, to approve of it, by authority of the Apoſtles. So great caution in receiving the <hi>Gentils</hi> to the Goſpel was not, that the thing was not greatly deſir'd by the Apoſtles; but leſt it ſhould afterwards be repeal'd or made void by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as don raſhly, or that the <hi>Gentils</hi> ſhould rely leſs upon what was don, as conceiving it needed ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Law. Wherfore <hi>BARNABAS</hi> ſo ſoon as he came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and found the <hi>Greecs</hi> by Faith, and without profeſſion of the Law, to have receiv'd the ſame Grace of God with the <hi>Jews,</hi> was very much joy'd that the number of Believers increas'd, and exhorted them to remain conſtant in their Enterprize of adhering to the Lord. For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit, and of Faith. Wherfore thro his miniſtry it came to paſs, that a multitude of other Believers were added to the former. Now <hi>Antioch</hi> being not far from <hi>Cilicia,</hi> the Neighborhood of the place invited him to ſeek <hi>PAUL,</hi> the fitteſt helper in this work, as choſen by <hi>CHRIST</hi> to preach his Name to the <hi>Gentils</hi> and Kings of the Earth. For when <hi>PAUL</hi> fled from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Diſciples had conducted him to <hi>Ceſarea</hi> of <hi>Phenice,</hi> whence he went to <hi>Tarſus;</hi> whom therfore when <hi>BARNABAS</hi> had found there, he brought to <hi>Antioch,</hi> hoping in a City both famous and populous (but with a confus'd mixture of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greecs)</hi> to receive the better fruit thro the aid of an Apoſtle more peculiarly deſign'd to this work. Theſe two being converſant a whole year in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which by the confluence both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greecs</hi> became very numerous, ſo many were added by their preaching, that wheras hitherto, not expoſing the name of <hi>CHRIST</hi> to envy, they had bin call'd <hi>Diſciples,</hi> they now began firſt at <hi>Antioch</hi> from the name of their Founder to be call'd <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> In theſe times certain Prophets came from the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Antioch,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one named <hi>AGABUS</hi> ſtanding up in the Congregation, ſignify'd by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, that there ſhould be a great Dearth thro the whole world; which came to paſs under <hi>CLAUDIUS CESAR,</hi> the Succeſſor of <hi>CALIGU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LA.</hi> At this time they at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> partly becauſe they were poor at their converſion to the Goſpel, partly becauſe they had depoſited their Goods in common, and partly becauſe they had bin ſpoil'd by the Prieſts for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> ordain'd that by the contribution of ſuch as had wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal, eſpecially among the believing <hi>Gentils,</hi> Mony ſhould be ſent to the relief of the Chriſtians dwelling in <hi>Judea;</hi> but ſo that this Contribution was not to be forc'd but free, and according to every mans ability. This Mony thus gather'd was ſent by <hi>PAUL</hi> and <hi>BARNABAS</hi> to the Elders

While all theſe were intent upon the Miniſtry of the Church, imploying their ſeveral Gifts to the Glory of God, and in his moſt acceptable Service, the Salvation of Souls, with faſting and prayer, the Holy Ghoſt being ſtir'd up by their Zeal, ſignify'd his Will by the Prophets, ſaying, Separat me <hi>BARNABAS</hi> and <hi>PAUL</hi> for the Work wherto I have call'd them, namely, to be Doctors of the <hi>Gentils,</hi> that by them I may propagat the Goſpel. The command of the Spirit was obey'd, and <hi>BARNABAS</hi> with <hi>PAUL,</hi> to the end that every one might ſee who were choſen, were ſeparated from the reſt; and when the Congregation had unanimouſly implor'd the favor of God by prayer and faſting, the moſt eminent in Authority among them laid their hands upon the Perſons ſo ſeparated, and ſent them wherever the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſhould direct them. By this impulſe therfore <hi>BARNABAS</hi> and <hi>PAUL</hi> went to <hi>Seleucia,</hi> being a Promontory of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> and thence ſail'd into the Iland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where they landed at <hi>Salamis,</hi> a famous City upon the Eaſtern part of the Iland; they preach'd not human Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the Word of God, nor that by ſtealth, but in the Synagogs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> wherof thro the Neighborhood of <hi>Syria</hi> there was ſtore.

                     <p>WHEN a Conſul had conquer'd a Country, and the <hi>Romans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to form it into a Province, it was the cuſtom of the Senat to ſend <hi>(decem Legatos)</hi> ten of their Members, who with the Conſul had power to introduce and eſtabliſh their provincial way of Government. In this manner <hi>Aſia</hi> was form'd by MARCUS AQUILLIUS Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul; afterwards ſo excellently reform'd by SCAEVOLA, that the Senat in their Edicts us'd to propoſe his example to ſucceding Magiſtrats, and the Inhabitants to celebrat a Feaſt to his Name. Nevertheleſs MITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIDATES King of <hi>Pontus</hi> (all the <hi>Romans</hi> in this Province being maſſacred in one day) came to poſſeſs himſelf of it, till it was recover'd at ſeveral times by SYLLA, MURENA, LUCULLUS and POM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEY. The <hi>Romans</hi> in framing a Country into a Province, were not accuſtom'd to deal with all the Inhabitants of the ſame in a like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but differently according to their different merit. Thus divers Citys in this were left free by SYLLA, as thoſe of the <hi>Ilienſes,</hi> the <hi>Chians, Rhodians, Lycians,</hi> and <hi>Magneſians,</hi> with the <hi>Cyzicens,</hi> tho the laſt of theſe afterwards for their practices againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> forfeited their Liberty to TIBERIUS, in whoſe Reign they were for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon depriv'd of the ſame.</p>

Now becauſe by a latter Edict of AUGUSTUS, the leſſer Magiſtracys may be born by ſuch as are above one and twenty; there remains with me theſe doubts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that being under thirty, has born Magiſtracy, may be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Cenſors into the Senat; and if he may, whether of thoſe alſo that have not born Magiſtracy, a man being above one and twenty, ſeeing at that age he may bear Magiſtracy, may not by the ſame interpretation be elected into the Senat, tho he has not born it: which is here practis'd and pretended to be neceſſary, becauſe it is ſomwhat better, they ſay, that the Senat be fill'd with the Children of good Familys, than with the lower ſort. My opinion being ask'd upon theſe points by the new Cenſors, I thought ſuch as being under thirty have born Magiſtracy, both of POMPEY'S Laws, and the Edict of AUGUSTUS, to be capable of the Senat; ſeeing the Edict allows a man under thirty to bear Magiſtracy, and the Law, a man that has born Magiſtracy, to be a Senator.

                     <p>THIS might ſerve, but there will be no hurt in being a little fuller in the diſcovery of Provincial Government.</p>
                     <p>THE Provinces ſo fram'd, as has bin ſhewn, were ſubdivided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certain Circuits call'd <hi>Dioceſes;</hi> that of <hi>Aſia</hi> had ſix, <hi>Alabandae, Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> (antiently the Senat of CRAESUS) <hi>Smyrna, Epheſus, Adramytis, Pergamum.</hi> That of <hi>Cilicia</hi> had alſo ſix, the <hi>Pamphylian, Iſaurian,</hi> and <hi>Cilician,</hi> the Metropolis wherof was <hi>Tarſus,</hi> a free City; to theſe were taken out of the Province of <hi>Aſia, Cibyra, Sinnadae, Apamea:</hi> what were the Dioceſes of the other two SIGONIUS, whom I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, dos not ſhew. At theſe in the Winter (for the Summer was ſpent commonly with the Army) the People of the Province aſſembl'd at ſet times, as at our Aſſizes, where the <hi>Roman</hi> Governors did them Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>THE Governors or Magiſtrats, to whoſe care a Province was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, were of two kinds: the firſt and chief was Conſul or Pretor, which appellations differ'd not in Power, but in Dignity, that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul being more honorable, who had twelve Lictors, wheras the Pretor had but ſix; if the annual Magiſtracy of either of theſe came to be prorogu'd, he was call'd <hi>Proconſul</hi> or <hi>Propretor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE ſecond kind of Magiſtrat in a Province was the Queſtor, Receiver or Treaſurer, who being alſo annual, was attended by Lictors of his own; if he dy'd within his year, the Conſul, Proconſul, or Pretor might appoint one for that time in his place, who was call'd Proqueſtor. The Power of the Conſul, Proconſul, or Pretor, was of two kinds, the one Civil, the other Military; the former call'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, the latter Empire.</p>
                     <p>THE Pomp of theſe aſſuming and exerciſing their Magiſtracy was reverend; the Conſul or Proconſul had Legats, ſomtimes more, but never under three, appointed him by the Senat: theſe were in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Counſillors to aſſiſt him in all Affairs of his Province; he had Tribuns, Colonels, or Field Officers, for the military part of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; he had alſo Secretarys, Serjeants, Heralds or Criers, Lictors or Inſignbearers, Interpreters, Meſſengers, Divines, Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, Phyſicians; and beſides theſe his Companions, which for the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:49467:197"/>
moſt part were of the younger ſort of Gentlemen or Gallants that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>2</label> him for his Ornament, and their own Education. Into this the ſom what like Train of the Queſtor (who by the Law was in place of a Son to the Proconſul, and to whom the Proconſul was to give the regard of a Father) being caſt, it made the Pretorian Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort or Guard always about the Perſon of the Proconſul, who in this Equipage having don his Devotions at the Capitol, departed the City, <hi>Paludatus,</hi> that is in his Royal Mantle of Gold and Purple, follow'd for ſom part of the way with the whole Train of his Friends, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him much joy and good ſpeed.</p>
                     <p>IN his Province he executed his twofold Office, the one of Captain General, the other of the ſupreme Magiſtrat. In the former relation he had an Army either receiv'd from his Predeceſſor, or new levy'd in the City; this conſiſted in the one half of the Legions (as I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhewn) and in the other of Aſſociats: for the greatneſs of the ſame, it was proportion'd to the Province, or the occaſion; to an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Province in times of Peace, I believe an Army amounted not to above one Legion with as many Auxiliarys, that is, to a matter of twelve thouſand Foot, and twelve hundred Horſe. The Magiſtracy or Juriſdiction of the Proconſul, or Pretor, was executed at the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan City of each <hi>Dioecis,</hi> which upon this occaſion was to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Pretorian Cohort with Lodging, Salt, Wood, Hay, and Stable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room at the charge of the Country. Theſe, tho CICERO would hardly receive any of them, were, towards the latter time of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, extended by the Provincial Magiſtrats to ſo great a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the People, that it caus'd divers Laws to be paſs'd in <hi>Rome (de repetundis)</hi> for reſtitution to be made to the Provinces, by ſuch as had injur'd them. Upon ſuch Laws was the proſecution of VER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RES by CICERO. When and where this kind of Court was to be held, the Conſul, Proconſul, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or Pretor, by Proclamation gave timely notice. Being aſſembl'd at the time, and the City appointed, in the Townhal ſtood a Tribunal; upon this the <hi>Sella Curulis,</hi> or Chair of State, in which ſat the Conſul, Proconſul, or Pretor, with his Preto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Cohort or Band about him, furniſh'd with all manner of Pomp, and Officers requiſit to the Ornament or Adminiſtration of ſo high a Magiſtracy. The Juriſdiction of this Court was according to the Laws made for the adminiſtation of the Province; but becauſe they could not foreſee all things (as appear'd by the Queſtions which PLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NY put upon the Laws of POMPEY, to TRAJAN) it came to paſs, that much was permitted to the Edicts of the Provincial Pretors, as was alſo in uſe at <hi>Rome</hi> with the Pretors of the City: and if any man had judg'd otherwiſe in his Province, than he ought to have don in the City, made an Edict contrary to the Law of his Province, or judg'd any thing otherwiſe than according to his own Edict, he was held guilty of, and queſtionable for a hainous Crime. But what the Law of this or that Province (which differed in each) was, would be hard particularly to ſay; only in general it was for the main very much reſembling that of <hi>Sicily,</hi> call'd <hi>Rupilia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>LEGE Rupilia, or by the Law of <hi>RUPILIUS,</hi> a Cauſe between one Citizen and another being of the ſame City, was to be try'd at home by their own Laws. A Cauſe between one Provincial and another being of divers Citys, was to be try'd by Judges whom the Pretor ſhould appoint by lot. What a privat man claim'd of a People, or a People of a privat man,

For deciſion of other Controverſys, ſelect Judges from among the Romans (not out of the Pretorian Cohort, but out of ſuch Romans, or other Citizens free of <hi>Rome,</hi> as were preſent in the ſame Court) were to be given. In criminal Cauſes, as Violence, Peculat, or Treaſon, the Law, and the manner of proceding was the ſame in the Provinces, as in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>FOR the Tributs, Cuſtoms, Taxes, levys of Men, Mony, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, ordinary or extraordinary, for the common defence of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Republic, and her Provinces, the Conſuls, Proconſuls, or Pretors, proceding according to ſuch Decrees of the Senat as were in that caſe ſtanding or renew'd upon emergent occaſions; in gathering theſe lay the Magiſtracy or office of the Queſtor: if the Proconſul were indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, or had more buſineſs than he could well turn his hand to, Courts of this nature might be held by one or more of his Legats. With matter of Religion they meddl'd not; every Nation being ſo far left to the liberty of Conſcience, that no violence for this cauſe was offer'd to any man: by which means both <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians, at leaſt till the time of the perſecuting Emperors, had the free exerciſe of their Religion throout the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces. This the <hi>Jews</hi> lik'd well for themſelves, nor were they troubl'd at the Heathens; but to the Chriſtians they always g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>udg'd the like privilege. Thus when they could no otherwiſe induce PILAT to put Chriſt to death, they accus'd Chriſt of affecting Monarchy, and ſo afrighted PILAT, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mean condition'd fellow, while they threaten'd to let TIBE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIUS know he was not <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s Friend, that he comply'd with their ends. But when at <hi>Corinth</hi> where GALLIO (a man of another temper) was Proconſul of <hi>Achaia,</hi> they would have bin at this ſport again, and with a great deal of Tumult had brought PAUL before the Tribunal, GALLIO took it not well, that they ſhould think he had nothing elſe to do than to judg of <hi>Words, and Names, and Queſtions of their Law;</hi> for he car'd no more for the Diſputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Chriſtians and the <hi>Jews,</hi> than for thoſe between the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans</hi> and the <hi>Stoics</hi> Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fore his Lictors drave them from the Tribunal, and the officious <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to ſhew their love to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul, fell on knocking them out of the way of other buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>NOW tho the Commonwealth of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> being at this time a <hi>Roman</hi> Province under the Proconſul GALLIO, injoy'd no longer her common Senat, <hi>Strategus,</hi> and <hi>Demiurges,</hi> according to the model ſhown in the former Book; yet remain'd each particular City under her antient form of Popular Government, ſo that in theſe, eſpecially at <hi>Corinth,</hi> many of the <hi>Greecs</hi> being of the ſame judgment, the <hi>Jews</hi> could not diſpute with the Chriſtians without Tumult. Of this kind was that which happen'd at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where Chriſtianity growing ſo <note place="margin">Act. 19.</note>faſt, that the Silverſmiths of DIANA'S Temple began to fear they ſhould loſe their Trade; the <hi>Jews</hi> liking better of Heatheniſm than Chriſtianity, ſet ALEXANDER, one of their pack, againſt PAUL.</p>
                     <p>THIS place (in times when men will underſtand no otherwiſe of human ſtory than makes for their ends) is fallen happily unto my hand; ſeeing that which I have ſaid of a <hi>Roman</hi> Province, will be thus no leſs than prov'd out of Scripture.

When the Chancellor had thus ſpoken, he diſmiſs'd the <hi>Eccleſia.</hi> It is LUKE'S own word, and ſo often as I have now repeated it, ſo often has he us'd it upon the ſame occaſion. Wherfore I might henceforth expect two things of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; firſt, that it might be acknowleg'd that I have good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, LUKE and the Chancellor of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for the word <hi>Eccleſia</hi> in this ſenſe; and ſecondly, that they would not perſuade us, the word <hi>Eccleſia</hi> has loſt this ſignification, leſt they condemn this place of Scripture to be no more underſtood. The manner of Provincial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being thus prov'd, not only out of profane Authors, but out of Scripture it ſelf; and the Citys that were leaſt free having had ſuch power over themſelves, and their Territorys; why, if the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> took no more of them for this protection, than was paid to their former Lords, did they <hi>not rather undertake the patronage of the World than the Empire;</hi> ſeeing <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Dantzic,</hi> while the one was tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to the <hi>Turk,</hi> the other to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> were neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſo free Eſtates, that of a King, or a Commonwealth that ſhould have put the reſt of the world into the like condition, no leſs in our day could have bin ſaid? And yet that the <hi>Romans,</hi> when the nature of the Eaſtern Monarchys ſhall be rightly conſider'd, took far leſs of theſe Citys than their old Maſters, will admit of little doubt. CICERO ſurely would not ly; he, when Proconſul of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> wrote in this manner concerning his Circuit, to his friend SERVILIUS: <hi>Two days I ſtaid at</hi> Laodicea, <hi>at</hi> Apamea <hi>five, at</hi> Sinnadae <hi>three, at</hi> Pilomelis <hi>five, at</hi> Iconium <hi>ten; than which Juriſdiction or Government there is nothing more juſt or equal.</hi> Why then had not thoſe Citys their Senats and their

Each of theſe are equally popular (for neither of them gives an advantage to any Perſon or Party) but not equally prudent ways of proceding; the Lot committing too much to Fortune, except in ſom kinds of buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as firſt in the diviſion of Lands, whence the Suffrage was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly excluded: for the Diviſions being made by three Deputys out of each Tribe, if there happen'd to fall ſom advantage or diſadvantage to any man by the Lot, it was equal or impartial; wheras if it had fallen by the Suffrage, it muſt have bin inequal, or partial. Such was the cauſe why the Lot in the Diviſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was us'd without the Suffrage. In caſe of a Crime committed by an unknown Author, but among many of whom ſom one or more muſt have bin guilty, as in the caſes of ACHAN and JONATHAN, the Lot was alſo us'd without the Suffrage, ſomwhat after the manner of Decimation in an Army, when many that are guilty throw the Dice, and he on whom the Lot falls is puniſh'd; yet with conſiderable difference, for wheras Decimation is not us'd but for puniſhment, where the Perſons are as well known as the Guilt; this uſe of the Lot in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the unknown Author of ſom known Crime, that ſom one of many being put to the queſtion (who if either by his own confeſſion, or other proof he were found guilty, was puniſh'd accordingly, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not) Men might have leſs incouragement that their Crimes would be the more hidden, or leſs puniſhable for company, or the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of it.</p>

                     <p>THERE is in the Old Teſtament no mention of laying on of Hands by way of Ordination, or Election, but only by MOSES in the deſignation of JOSHUA for his Succeſſor: and in this MOSES did firſt as ROMULUS afterwards in the Election of the Prefect or Protector of <hi>Rome,</hi> but upon a far greater exigence; for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> when ROMULUS did the like, was ſeated or plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when MOSES did this, was neither ſeated nor planted, nor indeed a Commonwealth, but an Army deſign'd to be a Commonwealth. Now between the Government that is neceſſary to an Army, and that which is neceſſary to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, there is a vaſt difference. The Government even of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys of <hi>Rome,</hi> when ſhe was a Commonwealth, was nevertheleſs Monarchical: in this regard MOSES himſelf exercis'd a kind of Dictatorian Power for his life; and the Commonwealth being not yet planted, nor having any Balance wherupon to weigh her ſelf, muſt either have bin left at his death to the care of ſom Man whom he knew beſt able to lay her Foundation, or to extreme hazard. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Ordination, which was but accidental, regarding the preſent military condition of the People, MOSES moſt prudently diſtinguiſhes from the other; in that he ſhew'd them how they ſhould manage their Commonwealth, in this he bequeaths them the Man whom he thinks the moſt likely to bring them to be a Commonwealth: of which judgment and undertaking of MOSES, JOSHUA the next illuſtrious Example, moſt worthily acquitted himſelf.</p>
                     <p>THERE is in theſe Elections another remarkable paſſage, but ſuch a one as, being ſo far from political that it is ſupernatural, dos not properly appertain to this diſcourſe, and ſo I ſhall but point at it.

MOSES <hi>was a Prophet, the like to whom has not bin in</hi> Iſrael; and has there bin an Apoſtle like PAUL in the Chriſtian Church?

If we be not to make choice of a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Inſtitution without a miraculous teſt or recommendation; either Ordination was at firſt accompany'd with ſupernatural Gifts, and from thenceforth, as I conceive, neither. Divines methinks as ſuch ſhould not be ſo much concern'd in the Ordination of the Sanhedrim, or of JOSHUA, who were Magiſtrats, as the People or the Magiſtrat: yet if theſe ſhould hence infer that their Election, Ordination, or Deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons confer'd ſupernatural Gifts, Divines would hardly allow of it; and why are the People, or the Magiſtrat oblig'd to

Thus when</hi> MOSES <hi>had from Heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and long us'd his Commiſſion to be under God the Ruler of the People, the ſeventy Elders were by God's appointment aſſum'd to aſſiſt him:</hi>

But if the Scripture be not ſilent in this point, is there not a great deal of fancy in going on to <hi>cure the Sick, to pardon Sins, to bleſs Infants, confirm the Baptiz'd, ordain Miniſters, nay, give the Holy Ghoſt, and all the Graces belonging to the paſtoral Function,</hi> from a place that has no ſuch thing in it? for if the Sanhedrim according to Scripture were not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by the <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> there is no ſuch thing to be deriv'd by the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotheſia</hi> from the Sanhedrim. The firſt <hi>Chirotonia</hi> indeed of the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim was accompany'd with miraculous indowments; wherfore if they will derive theſe Gifts and Graces from the Sanhedrim, why are they ſworn Enemies to the <hi>Chirotonia?</hi> Again, the Sanhedrim was a Civil Court or Senat; wherfore then by this Title ſhould not theſe Gifts and Graces be rather pretended to by the Civil Magiſtrat, than by Divines? what becoms of the Prieſt AARON and his Lots? is he left to the Civil Magiſtrat, while Divines derive themſelves from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral JOSHUA and his <hi>Chirotheſia?</hi> But if the Sanhedrim and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Judicatorys were otherwiſe ordain'd originally; then no Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was originally ordain'd by the <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> but only JOSHUA. It is admirable that Divines ſhould look upon God, as if in the inſtitution of a Commonwealth he had no regard at all to human Prudence, but was altogether fix'd upon their vain advantages. Who made human Prudence? or to what end was it made? Any man that underſtands the Politics, and conſiders that God was now proceding according to this Art (as in his conſtitution of the Senat, and of the People or Congregation, is moſt obvious) muſt needs ſee that this Power he indulg'd to MOSES of making his own choice of one

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>4</label> for wheras he intended Popular Government, nothing is plainer than that a People not electing their own Magiſtrats can have no Popular Government. How abſurd is it to conceive that God having already made an expreſs Law, that the People if at any time they came under Monarchy, ſhould yet have the election of their King, would now make a Law that the People being under a Commonwealth, ſhould no longer have the election of their Magiſtrats? For who ſees not that to introduce the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> as a ſtanding Ordinance, had bin to bar the People of this power? <hi>Iſrael</hi> at this time, tho deſign'd for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, had no Land, no foundation to balance her ſelf upon, but was an Army in a Wilderneſs, incompaſs'd about with Enemys. To permit to the People in this caſe, the choice of all their Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats was nevertheleſs ſafe enough, nay beſt of all: for at the election of <hi>wiſe men, and underſtanding, and known among their Tribes,</hi> ſo far as was needful to civil adminiſtration, their skill muſt needs have bin at any time ſufficient; but the Commonwealth was yet in abſolute neceſſity of a Protector, and of Dictatorian Power. Now to know who was fitteſt in this caſe to ſuccede MOSES, requir'd the Wiſdom of God, or of MOSES; and therfore was not yet ſafe to be ventur'd upon a People ſo new in their Government. For theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I ſay, MOSES us'd the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> for once, and no more; or let them ſhew me among all the Dictators, Judges, or Kings, that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded JOSHUA, any one that was choſen by the <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> and be all Dictators. It is now above three thouſand years ſince the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sanhedrim, from which time the ambitious Elders firſt, then the Talmudiſts, and of latter ages Divines have bin perpetually ſtriving for, or poſſeſſing themſelves of this ſame Oligarchical Invention of the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> pretended to be deriv'd from MOSES; tho there be neither any ſuch Precept of God or Chriſt in the Old or New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor any unanimous reſult upon the point, either by the Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts or Divines themſelves. And for the clear words quoted by the Doctor out of MAIMONIDES, they are ſuch to which I ſhall in due time ſhew MAIMONIDES to be elſwhere of a clear contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But in this Controverſy, without ſom clearer deduction of the <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> we ſhall make no happy progreſs; in this therfore I ſhall follow SELDEN the ableſt Talmudiſt of our age, or of any.</p>
                     <p>THE Commonwealth of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> (if I could ſtand to ſhew it) has ſtrange reſemblances to that of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not only in the Agrarian, which is nothing to the preſent purpoſe, but in the Senat, which to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent catching another time, I do not ſay was a Judicatory only, but not only a Senat, but a Judicatory alſo. For LYCURGUS of all other Legiſlators was in this the likeſt to God, or to MOSES, that his work was ſo exquiſitly perfected at once, and his Laws ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, that if the Senat had had no other function than to make or propoſe new Laws, there being little or nothing of that wanting, they would have had little or nothing to do. Now it being thus, and much more than thus in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Sanhedrim was not only the Senat, but the ſupreme Judicatory. And becauſe one Court in a Territory of any Extent is no where ſufficient to this end; therfore the Sanhedrim had divers branches diſtended not only to the Citys of <hi>Judea,</hi> but even to the Villages; theſe were call'd the <hi>Leſſer Sanhedrim,</hi> or the <hi>Jethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Prefectures.</hi>

                     <p>THE <hi>Jethronian</hi> Prefectures conſiſted ſom of three and twenty Elders, and others but of three. Of the former kind there were two in the gates of the Temple, and one ſitting in the gates of every City; of the latter there was one almoſt in every Village.</p>
                     <p>THE power of the <hi>Jethronian</hi> Court, conſiſting of twenty three Elders, was in matter of Judicature equal with that of the great San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim, <note place="margin">Vid.

For wheras ſacrificing was feaſting, the Prieſts injoying a fat Idleneſs, became in latter times ſo heavy, that as to the Election of the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim not only the <hi>Levits</hi> of inferior rank were upon the matter wholly laid by, but the High-Prieſt himſelf ſomtimes omitted, the reſt of the Tribes far excelling this in Learning.</p>
                     <p>THE power of the <hi>Triumvirats,</hi> or three Judges in the Villages, extended no farther than to inflict ſtripes to a certain number, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary mulcts to a certain ſum. Theſe poſſibly had the ſame recourſe upon occaſion of difficulty to the Judges in the Gates, as the Judges in the Gates had to the Sanhedrim: but their power is not ſo much to the preſent purpoſe, which regards only their manner of Election. This having bin inſtitutively exercis'd, as has bin ſhewn by the <hi>Chiroto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> or Ballot of the People, came ſooner or later (I find no man that can reſolve upon the certain time) to the <hi>Chirotheſia.</hi> For tho when a Judg in the Gates was dead, that Court elected his Succeſſor out of their Diſciples (each Court in the Gates had 99 Diſciples that were their conſtant Auditors) or out of the Triumvirats; and when an Elder of the Sanhedrim dy'd, the Sanhedrim elected his Succeſſor out of the Courts in the Gates, more particularly thoſe in the Gates of the Temple by Suffrages; yet no man was capable of being elected into any of theſe Courts that was not a Presbyter, nor was any man a <note place="margin">Mikotzi Miſna Gemara.</note>Presbyter that had not receiv'd the <hi>Chirotheſia:</hi> nor could any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> that had not firſt receiv'd it, or bin ſo ordain'd a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter himſelf: nor tho he were ſo ordain'd, could he confer the like Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, but in the preſence of two others, whether ordain'd or not ordain'd: and no Ordination could be confer'd but either this way, or <note place="margin">Abr.

Tit. San. cap. 4.</note>
                        <hi>Chirotheſia:</hi> for by his influence upon the Sanhedrim it was brought to paſs, that wheras formerly any man ordain'd might, in the manner ſhewn, have ordain'd his Diſciples; it was now agreed that no man ſhould be ordain'd without the Licenſe of the Prince, and that this Power ſhould not be in the Prince, but in the preſence of the Father of the Sanhedrim, or Speaker of the Houſe. Thus the Ariſtocracy of <hi>Iſrael</hi> becoming firſt Oligarchical, took (according to the nature of all ſuch Governments) long ſteps towards Monarchy, which ſucced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Aſmonean</hi> Family, commonly call'd the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> was for their great merit, in vindicating the <hi>Jews</hi> from the Tyranny of AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIOCHUS, confirm'd to them by the univerſal conſent and <hi>Chirotonia</hi> of the People. Nevertheleſs to him that underſtands the Orders of a Commonwealth, or has read the <hi>Athenian, Lacedemonian,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Story, it will be plain enough that but for their Ariſtocracy they needed not to have bin ſo much beholden to, or to have ſtood ſo much in need of one Family. It is true, both the merit of theſe Princes, and the manner of their free Election by the People, ſeem to forbid the name of Tyranny to this Inſtitution: but ſo it is, that let there be never ſo much Merit in the Man, or Inclination of the People to the Prince, or the Government that is not founded upon the due ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, the Prince in that caſe muſt either govern in the nature of a Commonwealth, as did thoſe of this Family, reforming the policy after the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Model; or turn Tyrant, as from their time, who liv'd in the Age of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, did all their Succeſſors, till under the <hi>Romans</hi> this Nation became a Province: From which time ſuch Indeavors and Inſurrections they us'd for the recovery of their antient Policy, that under the Emperor ADRIAN (who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at what their Ordination, being not of Prieſts, but of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats, and of a Senat pretending to Soverain Judicature and Authority, ſeem'd to aim) there came, ſays the <hi>Talmud, againſt the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>an Edict out of the Kingdom of the Wicked</hi> (meaning the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire) <hi>wherby whoſoever ſhould ordain, or be ordain'd, was to be put to death, and the School or City in which ſuch an Act ſhould be don, to be deſtroy'd: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Rabbi</hi> JEHUDA BEN BABA (leſt Ordination ſhould fail in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael) went forth, and ſtanding between two great Mountains, and two great Citys, and between two Sabbathdays journys from</hi> Oſa <hi>and</hi> Sephara, <hi>ordain'd five Presbyters.</hi> For this Feat the Rabbi is remember'd by the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> under the name of Ordinator; but the ſame, as it follows, being diſcover'd by the <hi>Roman</hi> Guards, <hi>they ſhot his Body thro with ſo many Darts, as made it like a Sive:</hi> Yet ſtaid not the buſineſs here, but ſo obſtinat continu'd the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Superſtition to which this kind of Ordination was now grown, that wheras by the ſame it was unlawful for them to ordain in a foren Land, and at home they could not be brought to abſtain, the Emperor baniſh'd them all out of their

                        <hi>ſhould happen that in all the Holy Land there remain'd but one Presbyter, that Presbyter, aſſiſted by two other</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>might ordain the ſeventy, or great Sanhedrim, and the Sanhedrim ſo conſtituted might conſtitute and ordain the leſſer Courts, I am of opinion that were there no Presbyter in the Land, yet if all the Wiſe Men of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhould agree to conſtitute or ordain Judges, they might do it lawfully enoug. But if ſo, then how coms it to paſs that our Anceſtors have bin ſo ſolicitous, leſt Judicature ſhould fail in</hi> Iſrael? <hi>Surely for no other cauſe than that from the time of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>were ſo diſpers'd that they could not upon like occaſions be brought together.</hi> Now I appeal whether the clear Words of MAI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONIDES, where he ſays, <hi>that our Maſter</hi> MOSES <hi>ordain'd the</hi> Sanhedrim <hi>by the</hi> Chirotheſia, be not more clearly and ſtrongly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in this place, than affirm'd in the other, ſince acknowleging that if the People could aſſemble, they might ordain the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> he gives it for granted, that when they did aſſemble, they had power to ordain it; and that MOSES did aſſemble them upon this occaſion, is plain in Scripture. Again, if the power of Ordination falls ultimatly to the People, there is not a ſtronger argument in Nature that it is thence primarily deriv'd. To conclude, the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Party in <hi>Iſrael</hi> is thus confeſs'd by the Author no otherwiſe neceſſary, than thro the defect of the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> of the People: which Ingenuity of the <hi>Talmudiſt,</hi> for any thing that has yet paſt, might be worthy the imitation of Divines.</p>
                     <p>IN tracking the <hi>Jews</hi> from the reſtitution of their Commonwealth after the Captivity to their diſperſion, it ſeems that the later Monarchy in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was occaſion'd by the Oligarchy, the Oligarchy by the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy, and the Ariſtocracy by the <hi>Chirotheſia;</hi> but that this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, tho erected by magnanimous and popular Princes, could be no leſs than Tyranny deriv'd from another Principle, that is, the inſufficiency of the balance: For tho from the time of the Captivity, the Jubile was no more in uſe, yet the Virgin MARY as an Heireſs, is affirm'd by ſom to have bin marri'd to JOSEPH by virtue of this Law: <hi>Every Daughter that poſſeſſes an Inheritance in any Tribe of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <note place="margin">Numb. 27. 8.</note>
                        <hi>ſhall be Wife to one of the Family of the Tribe of her Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. By which the Popular Agrarian may be more than ſuſpected to have bin of greater vigor than would admit of a well-balanc'd Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>THE ſecond Presbytery, which is now attain'd to a well balanc'd Empire in the Papacy, has infinitly excel'd the pattern, the Lands of <hi>Italy</hi> being moſt of them in the Church.

                     <p>THE Maxims of <hi>Rome</hi> are profound; for there is no making uſe of Princes without being neceſſary to them, nor have they any regard to that Religion which dos not regard Empire. All Monarchys of the <hi>Gothic</hi> Model, that is to ſay, where the Clergy by virtue of their Lands are a third eſtate, ſubſiſt by the Pope, whoſe Religion creating a reverence in the People, and bearing an aw upon the Prince, preſerves the Clergy, that elſe being unarm'd, becom a certain Prey to the King or the People; and where this happens (as in HENRY the Eighth) down gos the Throne; for ſo much as the Clergy loſes, falls out of the Monarchical into the Popular Scale. Where a Clergy is a third Eſtate, Popular Government wants Earth, and can never grow: but where they dy at the root, a Prince may ſit a while, but is not ſafe; nor is it in nature (except he has a Nobility or Gentry able without a Clergy to give balance to the People) that he ſhould ſubſiſt long or peaceably: For wherever a Government is ſounded on an Army, as in the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> there the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Tragedys under Heaven are either on the Stage, or in the Tiring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. Theſe things conſider'd, the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> being originally no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a way of Policy excluding the People, where it attains not to a balance that is ſufficient for this purpoſe, brings forth Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy or Tyranny, as among the <hi>Jews:</hi> And where it attains to a balance ſufficient to this end, produces Monarchy, as in the Papacy, and in all <hi>Gothic</hi> Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>THE Prieſts of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where (as it is deſcrib'd by SICULUS) their Revenue came to the third part of the Realm, would no queſtion have bin exactly well fitted with the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> pretended to by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divines. Suppoſe the Apoſtles had planted the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in thoſe Parts, and the Prieſts had bin all converted, I do not think that Divines will ſay, that having alter'd their Religion they needed to have deſerted their being a third Eſtate, their overbalance to the People, their Lands, their Preeminence in the Government, or any part of their Policy for that: and I am as far from ſaying ſo as themſelves.</p>

                     <p>EITHER I have impertinently intruded upon the Politics, or cannot be ſaid ſo much to meddle in Church matters, as Churchmen may be ſaid to have meddled in State matters: For if the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> be Election by the many, and the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> be Election by one, or by the Few, the whole difference between Popular and Monarchical Government falls upon theſe two words; and ſo the queſtion will be, Whether the Scriptures were intended more for the advantage of a Prince, of a Hierarchy or Presbytery, than of the People. But that God in the Old Teſtament inſtituted the <hi>Chirotonia,</hi> not only in the Commonwealth, as by the Election of the Sanhedrim, but in the Monarchy, as in the Election of the Kings, is plain: So if there remains any advantage in Scripture to Kings, to the Hierarchy or Presbytery, it muſt be in the New Teſtament. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was God's choſen People, and God was <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s choſen King: That God was pleas'd to bow the Heavens, and com down to them, was his choice, not theirs; but in that upon his Propoſition, and thoſe of his Servant MOSES, they reſolv'd to <hi>obey his Voice, and keep his Covenant,</hi> they choſe him their King. In like manner, the Church is CHRIST'S choſen People, and CHRIST is the Church's choſen King. That CHRIST taking fleſh was pleas'd to bow the Heavens, and com down in a more familiar capacity of propoſing himſelf to Mankind, was his own choice, not theirs: but in that the Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Propoſition, or thoſe of his Apoſtles ſent by him, as he was ſent by the Father, reſolv'd to obey his Voice, and keep his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſhe has choſen him her King. Whatever in Nature or in Grace, in Church or in State, is choſen by Man according to the Will of God, is choſen by God, of whom is both the Will and the Deed.

And when his Apoſtles, after his example, go and preach to all Nations, and actually gather Diſciples, they choſe their Auditors, and not their Auditors them.</hi> To make ſhort work, I ſhall anſwer by explaining his Words as they fall.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>ROMAN</hi> chuſing whether he would ſpeak to the Senat or the People, choſe his Auditors, and not they him: Nevertheleſs if it were the Conſul, they choſe him, and not he them. It is one thing to be a Speaker to a People, that have the liberty, when that's don, to do as they think fit; and another thing to be a Guide, whom the People have conſented, or oblig'd themſelves to follow: which diſtinction not regarded, makes the reſt of his Argumentation recoil upon himſelf; while he procedes thus: <hi>And they that give up their Names to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Goſpel</hi> (choſe the Preachers, as I ſhould think, of that Goſpel their Guides) <hi>one branch of this Obedience obliges them</hi> (by their own conſent it ſeems, becauſe before they gave up their Names) <hi>to obſerve thoſe that</hi> (being thus plac'd over them by their conſent) <hi>are plac'd over them by God: ſuch not only are their Civil Magiſtrats</hi> (who ſuccede to their places by, and govern according to the Laws which the People have choſen) <hi>but alſo their Paſtors, whom the Holy Ghoſt either mediatly</hi> (according to the Rules of Church Diſciplin in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) <hi>or immediatly</hi> (upon ſom ſuch miraculous Call, as the People ſhall judg to be no impoſture) <hi>has ſet over them.</hi> From which words the Doctor, not conſidering thoſe Qualifications I have ſhewn all along to be naturally inherent in them, concludes <hi>that a Biſhop is made by the Holy Ghoſt, and not by the People.</hi>

                     <p>IF he would ſtand to this yet it were ſomthing; for if the Holy Ghoſt makes a Biſhop, then I ſhould think that the Holy Ghoſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd a Biſhop, and ſo that the Election and Ordination of a Biſhop were all one. But this hereafter will appear to be a more dangerous Conceſſion than perhaps you may yet apprehend. Wherfore when all is don, you will not find Divines, at leaſt Dr. HAMMOND, to grant that the Holy Ghoſt can ordain: he may elect indeed, and that is all; but there is no Ordination without the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> of the Biſhops, or of the Presbytery.

Indeed that Election and Ordination be diſtinct things, is to Divines of ſo great importance, that loſing this hold, they loſe all: For, as I ſaid before, whatever is choſen by Man according to the Will of God, that is, according to Divine Law, whether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or poſitive, the ſame, whether in State or Church, is choſen by God, or by the Holy Ghoſt, of whom is both the Will and the Deed.

                     <p>THUS theſe Candles being ſo far from lighting the Houſe, that they dy in the Socket, GROTIUS has bin no leſs bountiful than to grant us that the People have as much right (where there is no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Creature or Law to the contrary) to elect their Churchmen, as Merchants have to elect their Seamen, Travellers their Guides, or a free People their King; which is enough a conſcience.

But they have Miracles: ſuch indeed as have neither words nor reaſon for them, had need of Miracles. And where are theſe ſame Miracles? why the Apoſtles by the <hi>Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſia</hi> or laying on of hands confer'd the Holy Ghoſt. So they did not only when they us'd that Ceremony in reference to Ordination, but when they us'd it not in that relation, as to thoſe that were newly baptiz'd in <hi>Samaria,</hi> Men and Women: now it is not probable, that <note place="margin">Acts 8.</note>theſe, who ſhould ſeem to have bin numerous, were all ordain'd, at leaſt the Women; and ſo the Miracle is to be attributed to the Hands of the Apoſtles, and not to Ordination in general. JOSHUA <hi>was full of the Spirit</hi> (not becauſe he had bin ordain'd by the <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> for ſo had many of them that crucify'd CHRIST and perſecuted the Apoſtles, but) becauſe MOSES <hi>had laid his hands upon him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>WOULD Divines be contented that we ſhould argue thus; The <hi>Chirotonia</hi> or Suffrage of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the firſt inſtitution was follow'd with miraculous Indowments, therfore whoever is elected by the People ſhall have the like? Or what have they to ſhew why the Argument is more holding as to their <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> ſeeing for above one thouſand years all the Hierarchy and Presbytery laid together have don no more Miracles than a Pariſh Clerc?</p>
                     <p>A CONTINU'D Miracle, as that the Sea ebs and flows, the Sun always runs his admirable courſe, is Nature. Intermitted Nature, as that the waters of the Red Sea were mountains, that the Sun ſtood ſtill in the Dial of AHAZ, is a Miracle. To continue the latter kind of Miracle were to deſtroy the former, that is, to diſſolve Nature. Wherfore this is a certain rule, that no continu'd external Act can be in the latter ſenſe miraculous. Now Government, whether in Church or State, is equally a continu'd external Act. An internal continu'd Act may indeed be natural, or ſupernatural, as Faith.</p>
                     <p>A NATURAL Man, being even in his own natural apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> is by the continu'd Miracle of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture convinc'd that the World had a Creator, and ſo coms to believe in that which is ſupernatural; whence it is that all Nations have had ſom Religion: and a Spiritual Man being convinc'd by the purity of CHRIST'S Doctrin, and the Miracles wherby it was firſt planted, is brought to the Chriſtian Faith. However CHRIST may require ſuch continu'd Faith or Spiritual exerciſe of his Church as is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, he requires not any ſuch continu'd Act or bodily exerciſe of his Church as is ſupernatural. But the Government of the Church is a continu'd Act, or bodily exerciſe. It ſhould be heeded that to delude the ſenſe is not to do Miracles, but to uſe Impoſture.

                        </note> CHRIST being taken up into Heaven, the firſt Ordination that we find was that of the Apoſtle MATTHIAS after this manner.</p>
                     <p>THE Ariſtocracy of the Church, that is the Apoſtles, aſſembl'd the whole Congregation of Diſciples or Believers at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being in number one hundred and twenty, where PETER (it having as it ſhould ſeem bin ſo agreed by the Apoſtles) was Propoſer; who ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in the midſt of the Diſciples, acquainted them, that wheras JUDAS was gon to his place, the occaſion of their preſent meeting was to elect another Apoſtle in his room: wherupon proceding to the Suffrage, they appointed two Competitors, JOSEPH and MAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THIAS, whoſe names being written each in a ſeveral Scrol, were put into one Urn, and at the ſame time two other Lots, wherof one was a blank, and the other inſcrib'd with the word <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> were put into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Urn; which don, they pray'd and ſaid, <hi>Thou Lord which knoweſt the hearts of all men, ſhew whether of theſe two thou haſt choſen.</hi> The Prayer being ended, they <hi>gave forth their Lots, and the Lot fell upon</hi> MATTHIAS (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) and by this <hi>Pſephiſma</hi> (the very popular word, and not only ſo, but being apply'd to the Ballot, is the very literal and original ſignification) he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the eleven Apoſtles. So you have the firſt way of Ordination in the Church, after Chriſt was taken up into Heaven, perform'd by the Election or <hi>Chirotonia</hi> of the whole Church.</p>
                     <p>NOW except any man can ſhew that MATTHIAS ever receiv'd the impoſition of hands, theſe ſeveral things are already demonſtrated. Firſt, that the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> is not only the more antient way of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but in the Church of CHRIST. Secondly, that the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> or impoſition of Hands is no way ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Ordination in the Chriſtian Church. Thirdly, that the Diſciplin of the Chriſtian Church was primitively Popular; for to ſay that in regard of the Apoſtles it was Ariſtocratical, is to forget that there is no ſuch thing, without a mixture of Ariſtocracy, that is without the Senat, as a Popular Government in Nature. Fourthly, that Ordination in the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> being exactly after this pattern, is exactly according to the Diſciplin of the Church of CHRIST. And fifthly, that Ordination and Election in this example are not two, but one and the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>THE laſt of theſe Propoſitions having bin affirm'd by Mr. HOBS, <note place="margin">§. 115.</note>Dr. HAMMOND tells him plainly, that his aſſertion is far from all truth: Let us therfore conſider the Doctor's Reaſons, which are theſe; <hi>Seeing the Congregtion,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is affirm'd by the Gentleman to have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd,

                        <hi>and Ordination by this Example muſt be diſtinct things:</hi> which in another place going about to fortify with this Argument, <hi>That it was don by Lottery, and</hi> SOLOMON <hi>ſays, The Lot is at the diſpoſing of the Lord,</hi> he utterly overthrows without and beyond help; for in this SOLOMON not denying, but rather affirming that he was choſen King by the People, plainly ſhews that Election by the People is Election by God. Where it is affirm'd, that God rais'd up Judges in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is not deny'd that the People elected them. The Doctor is at it in MAIMONIDES more than once, <hi>that the Divine Majeſty reſted upon ſuch as were ordain'd by Impoſition of Hands.</hi> But wheras it is affirm'd by MAIMONIDES more often, that <hi>when the People</hi> (Eccleſia Dei) <hi>or Congregation of</hi> Iſrael <hi>aſſembl'd, then the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, or the Holy Ghoſt reſted upon them;</hi> of this he never takes any notice. The People, whether in <hi>Iſrael, Athens, Lacedemon,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> never aſſembl'd for enacting of Laws, or Election of Magiſtrats, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sacrifice and imploring the aſſiſtance of God, to whom when their work was perform'd, they always attributed the whole Reſult or Election: and would the Doctor have Chriſtians to allow him but a Piece? For wheras God electing there had in the ſenſe both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> his choice of all, God electing here had in the ſenſe of Divines, but his choice of two, which were next this or none, but that indeed where he has not the whole he has none at all.

But to mend the Text, and bring the Diſciples into the Parentheſis, they have more ways than one; wheras the Heathen People, while the Prieſts were willing, mix'd theſe Dutys with Devotions, Divines will not ſuffer a Chriſtian People upon like occaſions to pray: for where it is ſaid, <hi>They pray'd,</hi> it went before, <hi>they appointed two,</hi> and it follows, <hi>They gave out their Lots;</hi> which antecedent and conſequent, if the People pray'd, muſt be equally underſtood of them, and ſo they could be no Parentheſis.

                     <p>TO evade this apparent Election, or <hi>Chirotonia</hi> of the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, wherby theſe Apoſtles or Ambaſſadors to the Churches of the <hi>Gentils</hi> were ordain'd, Divines have nothing to ſay, but <hi>that they were elected by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> As if the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> of the People were more excluſive to election by the Holy Ghoſt, than the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> of the Ariſtocracy, for which in the mean time they contend.

The Council of the Apoſtles, of the Elders, and of the whole Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and other Councils, not of Apoſtles, nor of the whole Church, in other times or places, us'd this form in their Acts; <hi>It ſeems good to the Holy</hi>

                     <p>THE <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> can be no otherwiſe underſtood in nature, nor ever was in the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> than Election by the few: And ſo even under the mere <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> Ordination and Election were not two, but one and the ſame thing.

                     <p>I GRANT Divines, that Ordination by this time was wholly in the Presbytery; what ſay they then to the diſtinction of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Election?

Nor was the <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> by which means this work came to effect in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> introduc'd by the prudence of God, but by the corrupt arts of Men.

How! are you ſtarting at this! are you ſolicitous for your Commonwealth! It is true, that upon carnal principles or human prudence, without Power in the People there can be no Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: but</hi> Iſrael <hi>was a Commonwealth without power in the People; where</hi> MOSES <hi>made all the Laws by the power inveſted in him by God, and created all the Magiſtrats, not by popular ſuffrage, but by his</hi> Chirotheſia. <hi>Wherfore, Men of</hi> Crete, <hi>know ye, that on whomſoever I lay my hands, the ſame is in all ſpiritual Affairs, or matters of Church-Government, to be obey'd by you, after the ſame manner that you have hitherto obey'd ſuch Magiſtrats or Prieſts as have bin ordain'd by your own Election, or</hi> Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia.

                     <p>SO much, I conceive, is now diſcover'd concerning Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as may ſhew that it was not of one, but of three kinds, each obnoxious to the nature of the Civil Government under which it was planted; in as much as the <hi>Chirotonia,</hi> or Ballot of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being firſt introduc'd pure, and without any mixture, as at the Ordination of MATTHIAS, came afterwards to receive ſom mixture of the <hi>Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſia,</hi> as in the Ordination of STEPHEN; and laſt of all by exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People, to degenerat wholly into the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, as in the Ordination of TIMOTHY: all this by the teſtimony of Scripture, and in the pureſt times, even the age of the Apoſtles.

Som Princes have not only given out that their Prieſts have bin chirotoniz'd when they were not, but that themſelves have bin chirotoniz'd when there was no ſuch matter.

Divines in this caſe commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it to be proper, or literally meant; for to impoſe a new ſenſe is to ſpoil the word; and ſpoil the word, ſpoil the Prince. LUCIAN is a Drol, and intends a Jeſt, but not ſo good a one, as that he of all others ſhould com neareſt to help up with a Hierarchy. For the <hi>Chirotonia,</hi> or Election of the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrats by the Suffrage of the People or of the Army, every man knows that it is literal: SUIDAS himſelf interpreting the word by this very example; where he affirms it to ſignify Election or Ratification by the Many.

But, ſays Dr. SEAMAM, <hi>There is difference between the Conſent of the People, and the Power of the People:</hi> which is not to underſtand the caſe in controverſy, nor to take notice that the People wherof we are ſpeaking were under Popular Government; for wherever the People are under Popular Government, between that which is don <hi>by their conſent,</hi> and that which is don <hi>(juſſu populi) by their power,</hi> there is no difference. How ſhould the People give their conſent, but by their Suffrage? or what difference, where they have Power, can there be between the Suffrage, and the Power of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> HAMMOND <hi>upon this point is far more quaint: where the Scripture ſays, that the</hi> Multitude were evil effected, <hi>and where</hi> part held with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and part with the Apoſtles, <hi>he thinks it e'en like enough: But where it is ſaid that</hi> a great Multitude of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Greecs</hi> believ'd, <hi>he ſeems to have no opinion of it: for, ſays he,</hi> It is evident that Believers were at firſt but few in every Town or City; <note place="margin">§. 134.</note>they were not whole Corporations at once converted, nor conſequently could they act in a common capacity: but as <hi>CLEMENS ROMANUS</hi> ſays, they that were by the Apoſtles conſtituted Biſhops and Deacons in ſeveral Citys and Regions, were conſtituted over thoſe that ſhould after believe, there were oft ſo few at the preſent. And then, as faſt as any did com into the Faith, they readily ſubmitted themſelves to thoſe by and under whom they did com in, and were not at all troubled <hi>(honeſt men)</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulation or deliberation about the way of electing their Teachers and Guides.</p>
                     <p>COM away, to leave the Scripture a while, and follow CLEMENS; be it ſo for diſcourſe ſake, that in thoſe days there was no where any ſuch thing as <hi>a great Multitude believing,</hi> much leſs <hi>whole States or

                        <note place="margin">§. 135.</note>ſays of that City, it was the Metropolis, not only of <hi>Judea,</hi> but many other Regions, becauſe of the Colonys thence ſent into <hi>Aegypt, Phenice,</hi> and both the <hi>Syria's;</hi> nay, to <hi>Pamphylia, Cilicia,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as far as <hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Pontus.</hi> So in reaſon the Churches in <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra, Iconium,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> where <hi>PAUL</hi> and <hi>BARNABAS</hi> ordain'd Elders, were to follow the pattern at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and there, we know, it was not by the Suffrage of the People, that an Elder was aſſum'd into the Sanhedrim, but the Prince or Head of the Sanhedrim receiv'd him in by Impoſition of Hands. It will be much more reaſonable to deduce the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of ordaining Elders from the Cuſtoms familiar to them that preach'd the Faith to them, than from the former uſages of them to whom it was preach'd, who were not to diſpute, but to believe, and receive the Inſtitutions as well as Doctrins which were brought them.</p>
                     <p>THESE, methinks, are ſtrange Arguments: The Goſpel came to us from <hi>Rome,</hi> is <hi>Rome</hi> therfore the Metropolis of <hi>England?</hi> It is true AGRIPPA being a <hi>Jew,</hi> and writing to CALIGULA in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half <note place="margin">Philo de lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ad Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note>of the <hi>Jews,</hi> not of the Chriſtians, tells him, <hi>That</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>is the Metropolis of the</hi> Jews, <hi>and of all their Colonys;</hi> ſo is <hi>London</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and of all their Colonys: but dos it follow from hence that either <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or <hi>London</hi> is the Metropolis of Chriſtendom? <hi>But the</hi> Jews <hi>had many Colonys in</hi> Aſia; <hi>and therfore the Churches of</hi> Lyſtra, Iconium, <hi>and</hi> Antioch <hi>were to follow the pattern at</hi> Jeruſalem. The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed had Synagogs in <hi>Iconium</hi> and <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> have Churches in <hi>England;</hi> but is this a good argument, The <hi>French</hi> have Churches in <hi>England,</hi> therfore the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are to follow the Orders of the <hi>French</hi> Church? The <hi>Jews</hi> withſtood the Goſpel at <hi>Iconium;</hi> for, <note place="margin">Acts 14. 4.</note>ſays the Text, <hi>the Multitude of the City was divided, and part held with the</hi> Jews, <hi>and part with the Apoſtles:</hi> therfore the believing <hi>Iconians</hi> muſt have acknowleg'd <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be their Metropolis, and were to follow the pattern of that City: And what was that?

The Apoſtles, to comply with an Oligarchy, had alter'd that Ordination, which originally (as at the Election of MAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THIAS) was popular, to Ariſtocracy; therfore being now to plant the Goſpel in a free State, they might not alter it from Ariſtocracy to Democracy: To pleaſe the <hi>Jews</hi> they might change for the worſe;

                     <p>THE right temper of a Metropolitan, to whom Popular Power is a Heathen Cuſtom, and with whom nothing will agree but Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in the Senat: But with the Apoſtles it was otherwiſe, who making no words of the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> where it was needleſs, were glad of this occaſion to chirotonize, or elect <hi>them Elders in every Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> by Popular Suffrage. But this, they will ſay, is not to com off from the haunt, but to run ſtill upon the People in a common or public capacity. Tho the Scripture ſpeaks of great Multitudes believing, believe it there is no ſuch thing: CLEMENS ſays they were very few, <hi>their Aſſemblys privat, and very ſcanty things.</hi> As privat as they were, by the judgment of Divines they were, it ſeems, to receive from their Pattern (if that were the Sanhedrim) a Form that was public e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and why might not they have receiv'd this from that public Form wherto they were accuſtom'd, rather than from a foren Policy, and one contrary to their Cuſtoms? why ſhould they ſuffer ſuch Power in new and privat, as they would not indure in their old and public Magiſtrats? Or, if they receiv'd the Scriptures, why ſhould they chuſe that Ordination which would fit them worſt, rather than that which would fit them beſt? that of TIMOTHY rather than that of MATTHIAS? Or, let their Aſſemblys have bin never ſo privat or ſcanty, yet if the Apoſtles <hi>chirotoniz'd them Elders in every Congregation,</hi> is it not demonſtrable that they did receive that of MATTHIAS, and not that of TIMOTHY?</p>

Herein lys the <hi>Arcanum</hi> or Secret of that Antipathy which is between a Clergy and a Popular Government, and of that Sympathy which is between the Miter and the Crown. A Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Clergy with the Monopoly of their <hi>Chirotheſia,</hi> has no more to do than to make a Metropolitan, by whom he governs them, and by them the People, eſpecially if he indows them with good Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; for ſo they becom an Eſtate of his Realm, and a more ſteddy Pillar of his Throne than his Nobility themſelves, who as their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is not ſo ſtrong, are of a more ſtirring nature.

                        <note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> MONARCHICAL Government is more natural, becauſe we ſee even in Commonwealths that they have recourſe to this, as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon</hi> in her Kings; <hi>Rome</hi> both in her Conſuls and Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and <hi>Venice</hi> in her Dukes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> GOVERNMENT, whether Popular or Monarchical, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually artificial; wherfore to know which is more natural, we muſt conſider what piece of Art coms neareſt to Nature: as for example, whether a Ship or a Houſe be the more natural; and then it will be eaſy to reſolve that a Ship is the more natural at Sea, and a Houſe at Land. In like manner where one man or a few men are the Landlords, a Monarchy muſt doubtleſs be the more natural; and where the whole People are the Landlords, a Commonwealth: for how can we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that it ſhould be natural to a People, that can live of themſelves, to give away the means of their livelihood to one or a few men that they may ſerve or obey? Each Government is equally artificial in effect, or in it ſelf; and equally natural in the cauſe, or the matter upon which it is founded.</p>
                     <p>A COMMONWEALTH conſiſts of the Senat propoſing, the People reſolving, and the Magiſtracy executing; ſo the Power of the Magiſtrats (whether Kings as in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> Conſuls as in <hi>Rome,</hi> or Dukes as in <hi>Venice)</hi> is but barely executive: but to a Monarch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs both the Reſult, and Execution too; wherfore that there have bin Dukes, Conſuls, or Kings in Commonwealths (which were quite of another nature) is no Argument that Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is for this cauſe the more natural.</p>
                     <p>AND if a man ſhall inſtance in a mix'd Government, as King and Parlament; to ſay, that the King in this was more natural than the Parlament, muſt be a ſtrange Affirmation.</p>
                     <p>TO argue from the <hi>Roman</hi> Dictator (an Imperfection which ruin'd that Commonwealth, and was not to be found in any other) that all Commonwealths have had the like recourſe in exigences to the like remedy, is quite contrary to the univerſal Teſtimony of Prudence or Story.</p>
                     <p>A MAN who conſiders that the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> has ſtood one thouſand years (which never any Monarchy did) and yet ſhall affirm that Monarchical Government is more natural than Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, muſt affirm that a thing which is leſs natural may be more dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and permanent than a thing that is more natural.</p>
                     <p>WHETHER is a Government of Laws leſs natural than a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Men? or is it more natural to a Prince to govern by Laws or by Will? Compare the Violences and bloody Rapes perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually made upon the Crown, or Royal Dignity in the Monarchys of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> with the State of the Government
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:49467:221"/>
under either Commonwealth, and tell me which was leſs violent, or whether that which is more violent muſt therfore be more natural.</p>

                        <hi>IN this,</hi> ſays MACCHIAVEL, <hi>Princes loſe themſelves and their Empire, that they neither know how to be perfectly good, nor intirely wicked.</hi> He might as well have ſaid, that a Prince is always ſubject to Error and Miſgovernment, becauſe he is a Man, and not a God, nor a Devil. A Shepherd to his Flock, a Plowman to his Team, is a better Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and ſo not only an abſolute Prince, but as it were a God. The Government of a better or of a ſuperior Nature, is to a worſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior as the Government of God. The Creator is another and a better Nature than the Creature; the Government in Heaven is of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor over his Creatures, that have their whole dependence upon him, and ſubſiſtence in him. Where the Prince or the Few have the whole Lands, there is ſomwhat of dependence reſembling this; ſo the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment there muſt of neceſſity be Monarchical or Ariſtocratical: But where the People have no ſuch dependence, the cauſes of that Government which is in Heaven are not in Earth; for neither is the Prince a diſtinct or better Nature than the People, nor have they their ſubſiſtence by him, and therfore there can be no ſuch effect. If a Man were good as God, there is no queſtion but he would be not only a Prince but a God; would govern by Love, and be not only obey'd but worſhip'd: or if he were ill as the Devil, and had as much power to do miſchief, he would be dreaded as much, and ſo govern by Fear. To which latter, the Nature of man has ſo much nearer approaches, that tho we never ſaw upon Earth a Monarchy like that of Heaven, yet it is certain the perfection of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Policy lys in this, that it coms neareſt to that of Hell.</p>

So if CANAAN was a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in thoſe days, it was ſuch a one as <hi>Germany</hi> is in theſe; where the Princes alſo have as much the right of the Sword as the Emperor, which coms rather (as has bin ſhewn already) to a Commonwealth. But whether it were a Monarchy or a Commonwealth, we may ſee by the preſent ſtate of <hi>Germany</hi> that it was of no very good Example; nor was MELCHIZEDEC otherwiſe made a King by God than the Emperor, that is, as an Ordinance of Man.</p>

                     <p>DIVINES, and the like ſtudious Aſſertors of Monarchy, have not laid their Principles ſo fairly, while they have conceal'd one part from the right of Paternity, or from the Government of Familys, which may be of two kinds; wheras they have taken notice but of one: For Family Government may be as neceſſarily Popular in ſom caſes, as Monarchical in others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Monarchical Family.</note> TO ſhew now the nature of the Monarchical Family. Put the caſe a man has one thouſand Pounds a year, or therabouts; he marrys a Wife, has Children and Servants depending upon him (at his good will) in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of his Eſtate for their livelihood. Suppoſe then that this Eſtate coms to be ſpent or loſt, where is the Monarchy of this Family? But if the Maſter was no otherwiſe Monarchical than by virtue of his Eſtate, then the foundation or balance of his Empire conſiſted in the thouſand pounds a year.</p>

Or do they not agree together upon ſuch Orders, to which they conſent equally to ſubmit? But if ſo, then certainly muſt the Government of this

                        <note place="margin">Government of Laws, and Government of Men.</note> YET the one Man in the Monarchical Family giving Laws, and the Many in the Popular Family doing no more, it may in this ſenſe be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſaid, That all Laws are made by Men. But it is plain that where the Law is made by one Man, there it may be unmade by one man; ſo that the Man is not govern'd by the Law, but the Law by the Man; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to the Government of the Man, and not of the Law: Wheras the Law being not to be made but by the Many, no man is govern'd by another man, but by that only which is the common intereſt; by which means this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to a Government of Laws, and not of Men.</p>

But in caſe what has bin ſaid be to all ſorts and capacitys evident, it is moſt humbly ſubmitted to Princes and Parlaments, whether, without violence or removing of Property, they can make a Popular Family of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical, or a Monarchical Family of the Popular? Or, whether that be practicable or poſſible in a Nation, upon the like balance or foundation in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, which is not in a Family? A Family being but a ſmaller Society or Nation, and a Nation but a greater Society or Family.</p>

But this is to imagin that the Steward of a Family is not anſwerable to the Maſters of it, or to them upon whoſe Eſtates (and not upon his own) he defrays the whole Charge: For otherwiſe this Stewardſhip cannot amount to Dominion, but muſt com only to the true nature of Magiſtracy, and indeed of annual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy in a Commonwealth; ſeeing that ſuch Accounts in the years end, at fartheſt, uſe to be calculated, and that the Steward, Body and Eſtate, is anſwerable for the ſame to the Proprietors or Maſters; who alſo have the undoubted right of conſtituting ſuch another Steward or Stewards as to them ſhall ſeem good, or of prolonging the Office of the ſame.</p>

From the different kinds and ſucceſſes of this Induſtry, whether in Arms, or in other Exerciſes of the Mind or Body, derives the natural equity of Dominion or Property; and from the legal eſtabliſhment or diſtribution of this Property (be it more or leſs approaching towards the natural equity of the ſame) procedes all Government.</p>

                  <p>THE Land in poſſeſſion of the Nobility and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> till HENRY 7<hi>th,</hi> cannot be eſteem'd to have overbalanc'd thoſe held by the People leſs than four to one. Wheras in our days, the Clergy being deſtroy'd, the Lands in poſſeſſion of the People overbalance thoſe held by the Nobility, at leaſt, nine in ten. In ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how this change came about, ſom would have it that I aſſume to my ſelf more than my ſhare; tho they do not find me delivering that which muſt rely upon Authority, and not vouching my Authors. But HENRY the Seventh being conſcious of infirmity in his Title, yet

finding with what ſtrength and vigor he was brought in by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <label type="milestone">

So that, this being the Militia of the Nation, a few Noblemen diſcontented could at any time levy a great Army; the effect wherof, both in the Barons Wars, and thoſe of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> had bin well known to divers Kings. This ſtate of Affairs was that which inabl'd HENRY the Seventh to make his advantage of troubleſom times, and the frequent unrulineſs of Retainers; while, under the pretence of curbing Riots, he obtain'd the paſſing of ſuch Laws as did cut off theſe Retainers, wherby the Nobility wholly loſt their Officers. Then, wheras the dependence of the People upon their Lords was of a ſtrict ty or nature, he found means to looſen this alſo by Laws, which he obtain'd upon as fair a pretence, even that of Population. Thus <hi>Farms were ſo brought to a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Verulam. H. 7.</note>
                     <hi>ſtandard, that the Houſes being kept up, each of them did of neceſſity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force a Dweller; and the proportion of Land laid to each Houſe, did of neceſſity inforce that Dweller not to be a Begger or Cottager, but a man able to keep Servants, and ſet the Plow on going. By which means a great part of the Lands of this Nation came in effect to be amortiz'd to the hold of the Yeomanry, or middle People,</hi> wherof conſiſted the main body of the Militia, hereby incredibly advanc'd; and which henceforth, <hi>like cleaner underwood leſs choak'd by their ſtaddles,</hi> began to grow exceding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But the Nobility, who by the former Laws had loſt their Offices, by this loſt their Soldiery. Yet remain'd to them their Eſtates, till the ſame Prince introducing the Statutes for Alienations, theſe alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came looſe; and the Lords leſs taken (for the reaſons ſhewn) with their Country lives, where their Trains were clip'd, by degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more reſident at Court, where greater pomp and expence by the Statutes of Alienations began to plume them of their Eſtates. The Court was yet at <hi>Bridewel,</hi> nor reach'd <hi>London</hi> any farther than <hi>Temple-Bar.</hi> The latter growth of this City, and in that, the declining of the Balance to Popularity, derives from the decay of the Nobility and of the Clergy. In the Reign of the ſucceding King were Abbys (than which nothing more dwarfs a People) demoliſh'd. I did not, I do not attribute the effects of theſe things thus far to my own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular obſervation; but always did, and do attribute a ſenſe therof to the Reign of Queen ELIZABETH, and the Wiſdom of her Council. There is yet living Teſtimony, that the ruin of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, thro the cauſes mention'd, was frequently attributed to HENRY the Seventh by Sir HENRY WOTTON; which Tradition is not unlike to have deſcended to him from the Queen's Council. But there is a difference between having the ſenſe of a thing, and making a right uſe of that ſenſe. Let a man read PLUTARCH in the Lives of AGIS, and of the GRACCHI, there can be no plainer demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Balance; yet read his Diſcourſe of Government in his Morals, and he has forgot it: he makes no uſe, no mention at all of any ſuch thing. Who could have bin plainer upon this point than Sir WALTER RALEIGH, where, to prove that the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> were not elective but hereditary, he alleges that if the

                     <hi>bin more mighty than the King, as Landlords of all</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the King himſelf their Tenant?</hi> Yet when he coms to ſpeak of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he has no regard to, no remembrance of any ſuch Principle. In Mr. SELDEN'S Titles of Honor, he has demonſtrated the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Balance of the Peerage, without making any application of it, or indeed perceiving it there, or in times when the defect of the ſame came to give ſo full a ſenſe of it. The like might be made apparent in ARISTOTLE, in MACCHIAVEL, in my Lord VERULAM, in all, in any Politician: there is not one of them in whom may not be found as right a ſenſe of this Principle as in this preſent Narrative; or in whom may be found a righter uſe of it than was made by any of the Partys thus far concern'd in this ſtory, or by Queen ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH <note place="margin">M. D. l. 1. b. 10.</note>and her Council. <hi>If a Prince,</hi> ſays a great Author, <hi>to reform a Government were oblig'd to depoſe himſelf, he might, in neglecting of it, be capable of ſom excuſe; but reformation of Government being that with which a Principality may ſtand, he deſerves no excuſe at all.</hi> It is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed obſerv'd by this Author that where by reaſon of the declination of the Balance to Popularity, the State requires Reformation in the Superſtructures, there the Prince cannot rightly reform, unleſs from So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verain Power he deſcends to a Principality in a Commonwealth: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs upon the like occaſions this fails not to be found ſo in Nature and Experience. The growth of the People of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the ruins mention'd of the Nobility and the Clergy, came in the Reign of Queen ELIZABETH to more than ſtood with the intereſt, or indeed the nature or poſſibility of a well founded or durable Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; as was prudently perceiv'd, but withal temporiz'd by her Council, who (if the truth of her Government be rightly weigh'd) ſeem rather to have put her upon the exerciſe of Principality in a Commonwealth, than of Soverain Power in a Monarchy. Certain it is, that ſhe courted not her Nobility, nor gave her mind (as do Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs ſeated upon the like foundation) to balance her great Men, or reflect upon their Power now inconſiderable; but rul'd wholly, with an art ſhe had to high perfection, by humoring and bleſſing her People. For this mere ſhadow of a Commonwealth is ſhe yet famous, and ſhall ever be ſo; tho had ſhe introduc'd the full perfection of the Orders requiſit to Popular Government, her fame had bin greater. Firſt, She had eſtabliſh'd ſuch a Principality to her Succeſſors, as they might have retain'd. Secondly, This Principality (the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <note place="margin">The great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Venice</hi> has the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Power, and the Duke the Soverain Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note>as <hi>Rome</hi> of ROMULUS, being born of ſuch a Parent) might have retain'd the Royal Dignity and Revenue to the full, both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd and diſcharg'd of all Envy. Thirdly, It had ſav'd all the Blood and Confuſion, which thro this neglect in her and her Succeſſors, has ſince inſu'd. Fourthly, It had bequeath'd to the People a Light not ſo naturally by them to be diſcover'd, which is a great pity. <hi>For</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">M. D. l. 1. c. 9.</note>
                     <hi>even as the Many, thro the difference of opinions that muſt needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound among them, are not apt to introduce a Government, as not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the good of it: ſo the Many, having by trial or experience once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to this underſtanding, agree not to quit ſuch a Government.</hi> And laſtly, It had plac'd this Nation in that perfect felicity, which, ſo far as concerns mere Prudence, is in the power of human nature to injoy. To this Queen ſucceded King JAMES, who likewiſe regardleſs of this point (into which nevertheleſs he ſaw ſo far as not ſeldom to

propheſy ſad things to his Succeſſors) neither his new Peerage, which <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>3</label> in abundance he created, nor the old avail'd him any thing againſt that dread wherin, more freely than prudently, he diſcover'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſtand of Parlaments, as now mere Popular Councils, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to popularity of Government like a Bowl down a hill; not ſo much, I may ſay, of Malice prepens'd, as by natural inſtinct, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Petition of Right, well conſider'd, is a ſufficient Teſtimony. All perſuaſion of Court Eloquence, all patience for ſuch, as but look'd that way, was now loſt. There remain'd nothing to the deſtruction of a Monarchy, retaining but the name, more than a Prince who by contending ſhould make the People to feel thoſe advantages which they could not ſee. And this happen'd in the next King, who, too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in that undoubted right wherby he was advanc'd to a Throne which had no foundation, dar'd to put this to an unſeaſonable trial; on whom therfore fell the Tower in <hi>Silo.</hi> Nor may we think that they upon whom this Tower fell, were Sinners above all men; but that we, unleſs we repent, and look better to the true foundations, muſt likewiſe periſh. We have had latter Princes, latter Parlaments. In what have they excel'd, or where are they? The Balance not conſider'd, no effectual work can be made as to ſettlement; and conſider'd, as it now ſtands in <hi>England,</hi> requires to ſettlement no leſs than the Superſtructures natural to Popular Government: and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructures natural to Popular Government require no leſs than the higheſt skill or art that is in Political Architecture. The ſum of which Particulars amounts to this, That the ſafety of the People of <hi>England</hi> is now plainly caſt upon skill or ſufficiency in Political Architecture: it is not enough therfore, that there are honeſt men addicted to all the good ends of a Commonwealth, unleſs there be skill alſo in the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe proper means wherby ſuch Ends may be attain'd. Which is a ſad, but a true account; this being in all experience, and in the judgment of all Politicians, that wherof the Many are incapable. And tho the meaneſt Citizen, not informing the Commonwealth of what he knows, or conceives to concern its ſafety, commits a hainous Crime againſt God and his Country; yet ſuch is the temper of later times, that a man, having offer'd any light in this particular, has ſcap'd well enough, if he be deſpis'd and not ruin'd.</p>
                  <p>BUT to procede: if the Balance, or ſtate of Property in a Nation, be the efficient cauſe of Government, and, the Balance being not fix'd, the Government (as by the preſent Narrative is evinc'd) muſt remain inconſtant or floting; then the proceſs in the formation of a Government muſt be firſt by a fixation of the Balance, and next by erecting ſuch Superſtructures as to the nature therof are neceſſary.</p>

Thus much in this, to ſhew, that if MOSES were a King, it dos not follow that he propos'd not his Laws to a Congregation of the People having the power of Reſult. To ſay that the Laws propos'd by MOSES were the Dictat of GOD, is not to evade, but to confirm the neceſſity of propoſing them to the People, ſeeing the Laws or Dictats of GOD or of CHRIST, can no otherwiſe be effectually receiv'd or imbrac'd by a People, or by a privat man, than by the free ſuffrage of the Soul or Conſcience; and not by Force or Rewards, which may as well eſtabliſh the Laws of the Devil.</p>

Now the Command of God to MOSES for the inſtitution of the Seventy, is this: <hi>Gather to me ſeventy men of the Elders of</hi> Iſrael—<hi>that they may ſtand with thee.</hi> Upon which words let me ask, whether had MOSES thenceforth a diſtinct or a joint political Capacity? If the Seventy ſtood with MOSES, or it were a joint Capacity, then MOSES was no King in their ſenſe; and if it were diſtinct, then lay there to MOSES no appeal, even by his own Law: for thus in the caſe of Appeals it is by him directed. <hi>If there ariſes a Controverſy too</hi>

Now the Senat, Sanhedrim, or ſeventy Elders, came in the place of MOSES, or ſtood with him; therfore their Power could be no more than was that of MOSES. So that if the Power of MOSES were never more in the point of Lawgiving, than to propoſe to the People; then the power of the Sanhedrim could be no more in the point of Lawgiving, than to propoſe to the People. Nor will it be found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that the Sanhedrim ever made any Law without the People, yet it is found in Scripture that the People made a Law without the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim, or levy'd War without them, which is all one: for where there is a power to levy War, there will be the power of making Law. And the occaſion upon which this is found, is the War levy'd againſt BENJAMIN by the Congregation conſiſting of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <note place="margin">Judg. 20.</note>thouſand. Again, If the Sanhedrim inherited the whole power of MOSES, and yet had no larger power in Lawmaking than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the People, then had MOSES never any larger power in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making than to propoſe to the People.

And wheras in the enumeration of the Patriarchs, I ſhew'd by a catalog of their Names, that the whole Tribe of BENJAMIN conſiſted of ſeven Familys; ſeven names by that account ſhould have bin caſt into the one Urn, and as many Lots into the other; one of them being inſcrib'd with the word <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſix being Blanks.

Upon this Poll was the Law made, which runs thus:</hi> To theſe the Land ſhall be divided for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, <note place="margin">V. 53, 54, 55, 56.</note>according to the number of names. To many thou ſhalt give the more Inheritance, and to fewer thou ſhalt give the leſs inheritance: To every one ſhall his Inheritance be given, according to thoſe that were number'd of him. Notwithſtanding, the Land ſhall be divided by lot: according to the names of the Tribes of their Fathers, they ſhall inherit; according to the lot ſhall the poſſeſſion therof be divided to many and few. <hi>This Law, in another place, is repeated thus:</hi> You ſhall divide the <note place="margin">Num. 33. 54.</note>Land by lot, for an inheritance among your Familys; and to many ye ſhall give the more Inheritance, and to the fewer ye ſhall give the leſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: Every man's inheritance ſhall be in the place where his Lot falls, according to the Tribes of your Fathers ye ſhall inherit.</p>
                  <p>IN the making of theſe Lots conſideration was as well had of the goodneſs of the Land, as of the meaſure. Now ſuppoſing this Law to have bin in the whole and methodically executed, the <hi>Canaanits</hi> muſt firſt have bin totally rooted out of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> which Land, in that caſe (as ſom affirm) would have afforded to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth a Root or Balance, conſiſting of <hi>three millions of Acres.</hi>

Now it is true, four Acres to a man may ſeem but a ſmall Lot; yet the <hi>Roman</hi> People, under <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> and long after, had but two. And it may very well be, that one Acre in <hi>Canaan</hi> was worth two in <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially about <hi>Rome;</hi> and four in <hi>England,</hi> tho of the beſt ſort: and if ſo it were that four Acres in <hi>Paleſtin</hi> were worth ſixteen of our beſt, ſuch a Lot, at our account, might be worth about thirty or forty pounds a year; which, for a popular ſhare, holding that rate thro the whole body of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was a large proportion. By this eſtimat, or what poſſibly could be allow'd to the Princes of the Tribes and of the Familys, their ſhare came not to a ſixth of the whole: ſo the reſt remaining to the People, the Balance of this Government muſt have bin purely popular. It is true, that in the whole this Law of MOSES for the diviſion of the Land was never executed: but that in the parts ſom ſuch courſe was taken, is plain; for example, in the diviſion to ſeven Tribes, where JOSHUA propoſes to the People in this manner: <hi>Give out from among</hi>

Thus the name of a Tribe, for example BEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JAMIN, being drawn out of one Urn, to that name a parcel was drawn out of the other Urn; for example, the Country lying between <hi>Jericho</hi> and <hi>Bethaven.</hi> This being don, and the Prince of the Tribe having choſen in what one place he would take his ſtated and agreed proportion, whether of fourteen thouſand Acres, or the like, the reſt of the Country was ſubdivided in the Lot Book, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Familys in the Tribe of this Prince; and the Parcels ſubdivided being caſt into the one Urn, the names of the Patriarchs into the other, the ſame Tribe came again by Familys. Thus every Patriarch making choice in what one part of this Lot he would take his agreed propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether of four thouſand Acres, or the like; the remainder was again ſubdivided in the Lot Book, according to the number of names in his Family: if they were more than the parcel would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh at four Acres a man, then was that defect amended by addition out of the next parcel; and if they were fewer, then the overplus was caſt into the next parcel.

                        <p>The Balance of this Monarchy.</p>

                     </note> THE Balance neceſſary to Kingly Government, even where it is regulated or not abſolute, is thus deſcrib'd by SAMUEL. <hi>This will be the manner of the King that ſhall reign over you: He will take your Fields, your Vinyards, and your Oliveyards, even the beſt of them, and give them to his Servants.</hi> That is, there being no proviſion of this kind for a King, and it being of natural neceſſity that a King muſt have ſuch an Ariſtocracy or Nobility as may be able to ſupport the Monarchy (which otherwiſe, to a People having equal ſhares in property, is altogether incompatible) it follows, that he muſt take your Fields, and give them to his Servants, or Creatures.</p>
                  <p>THIS notwithſtanding could not SAUL do, in whoſe time the Monarchy attain'd not to any balance, but was ſoon torn from him <note place="margin">2 Sam. 8. 1. 1 Chron. 11.</note>like the lap of a Garment. The Prince who gave that balance to this Monarchy, which it had, was DAVID: for beſides his other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, by which he brought the <hi>Moabits,</hi> the <hi>Syrians</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> the <hi>Ammonits,</hi> the <hi>Amalekits,</hi> the <hi>Edomits,</hi> to his Obedience, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Border to the river <hi>Euphrates; he ſmote the</hi> Philiſtins, <hi>and ſubdu'd them, and took</hi> Gath <hi>and her Towns, out of the hand of the</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins.

Now this Country which DAVID thus took, was part of <label type="milestone">

Wherfore if this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion follow'd not, but DAVID having taken this Country, did hold it in his particular Dominion or Property; then tho he took not from the People any thing wherof they were in actual poſſeſſion, yet, as to their legal Right, took he from them (as SAMUEL had forewarn'd) <hi>their Fields, their Vinyards, and their Oliveyards, even the beſt of them, and gave them to his Servants,</hi> or to a Nobility, which by this means he introduc'd.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Story of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Kings.</note>TO conclude this Chapter with the ſtory of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Kings: Till REHOBOAM, and the diviſion (thro the cauſe mention'd) of the Congregation in his time, the Monarchy of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was one, but came thenceforth to be torn into two: that of <hi>Judah,</hi> conſiſting of two Tribes, <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin;</hi> and that of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the other ten. From which time this People, thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, had little or no reſt from the flame of that Civil War, which, once kindl'd between the two Realms or Factions, could never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd but in the deſtruction of both. Nor was Civil War of ſo new a date among them; SAUL, whoſe whole Reign was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and perverſe, being conquer'd by DAVID; and DAVID in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by his Son ABSALOM ſo ſtrongly, that he fled before him. SOLOMON, the next Succeſſor, happen'd to have a quiet Reign, by ſettling himſelf upon his Throne in the death of ADONIJAH his elder Brother, and in the depoſing of the High Prieſt ABIATHAR; yet made he the yoke of the People grievous. After him, we have the War between JEROBOAM and REHOBOAM. Then, the Conſpiracy of BAASHA againſt NADAB King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which ends in the deſtruction of JEROBOAM'S Houſe, and the Uſurpation of his Throne by BAASHA, which BAASHA happens to leave to his Son ASA. Againſt ASA riſes ZIMRI, Captain of the Chariots; kills him with all his kindred, reigns ſeven days; at the end wherof he burns himſelf for fear of OMRI, who upon this occaſion is made Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by one part of the People, as is alſo TIBNI by another. The next Prize is plaid between OMRI and TIBNI, and their Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in which TIBNI is ſlain. Upon this ſucceſs, OMRI out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing all his Predeceſſors in Tyranny, leaves his Throne and Virtues to his Son AHAB. Againſt AHAB drives JEHU furiouſly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys him and his Family, gives the fleſh of his Queen JEZEBEL to the Dogs, and receives a Preſent from thoſe of <hi>Samaria,</hi> even ſeventy Heads of his Maſters Sons in Baskets. To ASA and JEHOSHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHAT, Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> belongs much Reverence. But upon this Throne ſat ATHALIAH; who, to reign, murder'd all her Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children except one, which was JOASH. JOASH being hid by the High Prieſt, at whoſe command ATHALIAH was ſom time after ſlain, ends his Reign in being murder'd by his Servants. To him ſuccedes his Son AMAZIA, ſlain alſo by his Servants. About the ſame time ZACHARIAH King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſmitten by SHAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUM, who reign'd in his ſtead: SHALLUM by MANAHIM, who reign'd in his ſtead: PEKAHA the Son of MANAHIM by PEKAH one of his Captains, who reign'd in his ſtead: PEKAH

                  <p>TO conclude this Story with the Reſemblances or Differences that are between Monarchical and Popular Government: What Parallel can there be beyond the Storys wherby each of them are ſo largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in Scripture? True it is, that AHIMELEC uſurp'd the Magiſtracy of Judg in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or made himſelf King by the men of <hi>Sichem;</hi> that the men of <hi>Ephraim</hi> fought againſt JEPTHA, and that there was a Civil War caus'd by <hi>Benjamin:</hi> yet, in a Popular Government, the very womb (as they will have it) of tumult, tho never ſo well founded that it could be ſteddy, or take any ſufficient root, can I find no more of this kind.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> the Magiſtracy of their Tribuns, throout the whole Adminiſtration of that Government, were never quiet; but at perpetual ſtrife and enmity with the Senat. It is very true; but firſt, this happen'd not from a Cauſe natural to a Popular Government, but from a Cauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to Popular Government; yea, ſo unnatural to Popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the like has not bin found in any other Commonwealth. Secondly, the Cauſe is undeniably diſcover'd to have conſiſted in a Faction introduc'd by the Kings, and foſter'd by the Nobility, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Suffrage of the main body of the People thro an Optimacy, or certain rank or number admitted not by the People or their Election, but by the value of their Eſtates, to the Legiſlative Power, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of that Nation. So the State of this People was as if they had two Houſes of Lords, and no Houſe of Commons. Thirdly, this danger muſt have bin in any other Nation, at leaſt in ours, much harder to be incur'd, than Authors hitherto have made it to be ſeen in this. And laſt of all, this Enmity, or theſe Factions, were without Blood, which in Monarchys they are not, as you ſaw well in thoſe mention'd; and this Nation in the Barons Wars, and in thoſe of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> beſides others, has felt. Or, if at length they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to Blood, this was not till the Foundations were deſtroy'd, that is, till the Balance of Popular Government in <hi>Rome</hi> was totally ruin'd; which is equally in caſes of the like nature inavoidable, be the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what kind ſoever, as of late years we have bin ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by our own ſad Experience.</p>

Let them ſhew us then that he did ſo, or indeed that he left any Succeſſor at all: for certainly if JOSHUA left no Succeſſor ſo ordain'd, or no Succeſſor at all (which is the truth of the caſe) then deſcended there upon them no ſuch Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from JOSHUA; and ſo by conſequence none from MOSES.

In this Aſſembly you have the full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the great Synagog: and <hi>when</hi> (in this Synagog) <hi>they had beaten</hi> the Apoſtles PETER and JOHN, <hi>they commanded them that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 5. 40.</note>
                     <hi>they ſhould not ſpeak in the Name of</hi> JESUS, <hi>and let them go.</hi> Upon theſe procedings there are Conſiderations of good importance; as firſt, That the Cabaliſtical Doctors themſelves did never ſo much as imagin that MOSES had indu'd the Sanhedrim alone, or ſeparatly conſider'd from the People, with any Legiſlative Power; nevertheleſs, that the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim came into the place, and ſucceded to the whole Power of MOSES, they unanimouſly held: whence, even upon their Principles, it muſt follow that in MOSES, diſtinctly and ſeparatly taken from the People, there could be no Power of making any Law. The ſecond thing remarkable in this proceding, is, That the moſt corrupt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and in her moſt corrupt Age, had not yet the face, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſom blind, of pretending to Legiſlative Power in a ſingle Council. The laſt I ſhall obſerve, is, That no poſſible ſecurity is to be given to liberty of Conſcience, but in the ſecurity of Civil Liberty, and in that only not by Laws which are otherwiſe as periſhing as flowers or fruits, but in the roots or fundamental orders of the Government. What even in theſe times muſt have follow'd, as to the liberty of Conſcience, had there bin an equal Repreſentative of the People, is apparent, in that the Captain and the Officers, imploy'd by this Synagog to apprehend <note place="margin">Acts 5. 26.</note>the Apoſtles, <hi>brought them without violence; for they fear'd the People, leſt they ſhould have bin ſton'd.</hi> It is true, there is nothing with us more cuſtomary, even in the ſolemneſt places, and upon the ſolemneſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, than to upbraid the People with giddineſs from the <hi>Hoſanna</hi> and the <hi>Crucifige</hi> of the <hi>Jews.</hi> What may be charg'd upon a multitude not under orders, the fouler Crime it be, is the fairer Argument for ſuch Orders, as where they have bin once eſtabliſh'd, the People have not bin guilty of ſuch Crimes; at leaſt, it ſhould ſeem, that in this caſe there is great ſcarcity of Witneſſes againſt them, ſeeing the Death of SOCRATES is more laid to one People, than that of all the Martyrs to Kings: yet were the falſe Witneſſes by whom SOCRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TES ſuffer'd (and by the like wherto a man in the beſt Government may chance to ſuffer) no ſooner diſcover'd, than they were deſtroy'd by the People, who alſo erected a Statue to SOCRATES. And the People who, at the Arraignment of CHRIST, cry'd, <hi>Crucify him,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mark 15. 11.</note>
                     <hi>crucify him,</hi> were ſuch as the chief Prieſts mov'd or promted, and ſuch alſo as <hi>fear'd the multitude.</hi> Now that the People which could be <note place="margin">Mat. 21.</note>promted by the chief Prieſts, or the People which could fear the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, could be no other than this pretended Repreſentative of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but indeed a Juncta of Couſins and Retainers, is that which, for ought I know, may be poſſible; and the rather, for what happen'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the Law call'd among the <hi>Jews, The Law of the Zealot,</hi> which was inſtituted by MOSES in theſe words: <hi>If thy Brother, the</hi>

So the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were wont to anſwer to MOSES, <hi>The thing which thou ſayſt is good for us to do.</hi> This ſaying of the Apoſtles being thought good by the whole multitude, the whole multitude elected ſeven men <hi>whom they ſet before the Apoſtles: and when they had pray'd, they laid their hands on them.</hi> To ſay in this place (as they do) that the Act of the People was but a Preſentation, and that the Apoſtles had power to admit or refuſe the Perſons ſo preſented, is as if one ſhould ſay, That the act of electing Parlament men by the People of <hi>England,</hi> was but a Preſentation, and that the King had power to admit or refuſe the Perſons ſo preſented. And ſeeing the <hi>Deacons</hi> henceforth had charge of the Word, to ſay, that by this choice the Deacons receiv'd not the charge of the Word, but the care to ſerve Tables, is as if one ſhould ſay, That Parlament men by their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection receiv'd only the care to levy Mony or Proviſion for the King's Table; but if upon ſuch Election they debated alſo concerning Laws, that Power they receiv'd from the King only.</p>
                  <p>BUT if this was a way of Ordination in the Chriſtian Church, and of Apoſtolical Right, then there may be a way of Ordination in the Chriſtian Church, and of Apoſtolical Right, conſiſting in part of the Orders of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Commonwealth, and in part of the Orders of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Commonwealth.</p>

                     <p>THERE is between the Diſcourſes of ſuch as are commonly call'd Natural Philoſophers, and thoſe of Anatomiſts, a large diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; the former are facil, the latter difficult. Philoſophers, diſcourſing of Elements for example, that the Body of Man conſiſts of Fire, Air, Earth and Water, are eaſily both underſtood and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, ſeeing by common Experience we find the Body of Man returns to the Earth from whence it was taken. A like Entertainment may befal Elements of Government, as in the firſt of theſe Books they are ſtated. But the fearful and wonderful making, the admirable ſtructure and great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the parts of man's Body, in which the Diſcourſes of Anatomiſts are altogether converſant, are underſtood by ſo few, that I may ſay they are not underſtood by any. Certain it is, that the delivery of a Model of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (which either muſt be of no effect, or imbrace all thoſe Muſcles, Nerves, Arterys and Bones, which are neceſſary to any Function of a well order'd Commonwealth) is no leſs than political Anatomy. If you com ſhort of this, your Diſcourſe is altogether ineffectual; if you com home, you are not underſtood: you may, perhaps, be call'd a learned Author; but you are obſcure, and your Doctrin is impracticable. Had I only ſuffer'd in this, and not the People, I ſhould long ſince have left them to their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; but ſeeing it is they that ſuffer by it, and not my ſelf, I will be yet

Now coms into my head what I ſaw long ſince upon an <hi>Italian</hi> Stage, while the Spectators wanted Hoops for their ſides. A Country fellow came with an Apple in his hand; to which, in a ſtrange variety of faces, his Teeth were undoubtedly threaten'd, when enter'd a young Anatomiſt brimful of his laſt Leſſon, who, ſtopping in good time the hand of this ſame Country fellow, would by no means ſuffer him to go on with ſo great an Enterprize, till he had firſt nam'd and deſcrib'd to him all the Bones, Nerves, and Muſcles which are naturally neceſſary to that motion: at which, the good man being with admiration plainly chopfallen, coms me in a third, who, ſnatching away the Apple, devour'd it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of them both. If the People, in this caſe wherof I am ſpeaking, were naturally ſo well furniſh'd, I had here learn'd enough to have kept ſilence: but their eating, in the political way, of abſolute neceſſity requires the aid of ſom political Anatomiſt; without which, they may have Appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THIS is that which was call'd <hi>The Agreement of the People,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in ſum of theſe Propoſitions:</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Anarchy of the Levellers</note> THAT there be a Repreſentative of the Nation conſiſting of four hundred Perſons, or not above.</p>
                     <p>WHICH Propoſition puts the Bar on the quite contrary ſide; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt example of a Commonwealth, wherin it was conceiv'd, that five hundred thouſand men, or more, might be repreſented by four hundred. The Repreſentation of the People in one man, cauſes Monarchy; and in a few, cauſes Oligarchy: the Many cannot be otherwiſe repreſented in a State of Liberty, than by ſo many, and ſo qualify'd, as may within the compaſs of that number and nature imbrace the intereſt of the whole People. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhould be eſtabliſh'd upon a Rock, not ſet upon a Precipice: a Repreſentative conſiſting but of four hundred, tho in the nature therof it be popular, is not in it ſelf a Weapon that is fix'd, but has ſomthing of the broken Bow, as ſtill apt to ſtart aſide to Monarchy. But the paucity of the number is temper'd with the ſhortneſs of the term, it being farther provided,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>THAT this Repreſentative be biennial, and ſit not above eight Months.</hi> But ſeeing a ſupreme Council in a Commonwealth is neither aſſembl'd nor diſſolv'd, but by ſtated Orders directing upwards an irreſiſtible ſtrength from the root, and as one tooth or one nail is driven out by another; how is it provided that this Biennial Council ſhall not be a perpetual Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil? Wheras nothing is more dangerous in a Commonwealth than intire Removes of Councils, how is it provided that theſe ſhall be men ſufficiently experienc'd for the management of Affairs? And laſt of all, wheras diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to Soverain Power is death, to whom are theſe after their eight months to bequeath the Commonwealth? In this caſe it is provided,</p>
                     <p>THAT there be a Council of State elected by each new Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, within twenty days after their firſt meeting, to continue till ten days after the meeting of the next Repreſentative. <hi>In which the faults obſerv'd in the former Order, are ſo much worſe, as this Council conſiſts of fewer. Thus far this Commonwealth is Oligarchy: but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>THAT theſe Repreſentatives have Soverain Power, ſave that in ſom things the People may reſiſt them by Arms.</hi> Which firſt is a flat contradiction, and next is downright Anarchy. Where the Soverain Power is not as intire and abſolute as in Monarchy it ſelf, there can be no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:49467:245"/>
at all. It is not the limitation of Soverain Power that is the cauſe of a Commonwealth, but ſuch a libration or poize of Orders, that there can be in the ſame no number of men having the intereſt, that can have the power; nor any number of men having the power, that can have the intereſt, to invade or diſturb the Goverment. As the Orders of Commonwealths are more approaching to, or remote from this Maxim (of which this of the Levellers has nothing) ſo are they more quiet or turbulent. In the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious part only, propoſing a <hi>National Religion and Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> tho without troubling themſelves much with the means, they are right in the end.</p>
                     <p>AND for the Military part, they provide,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>THAT no man (even in caſe of Invaſion) be compellable to go out of the Country where he lives, if he procures another to ſerve in his room.</hi> Which plainly intails upon this Commonwealth a fit Guard for ſuch a Liberty, even a Mercenary Army; for what one dos of this kind, may and will (where there is no bar) be don by all: ſo every Citizen by mony procuring his man, procures his Maſter. Now if this be work of that kind which the People in like caſes (as thoſe alſo of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they inſtituted their Tribuns) do uſually make, then have I good reaſon not only to think, but to ſpeak it audibly, That to ſooth up the People with an opinion of their own ſufficiency in theſe things, is not to befriend them, but to feed up all hopes of Liberty to the ſlaughter. Yet the <hi>Leveller,</hi> a late <note n="*" place="bottom">A later Pamphlet call'd <hi>XXV Querys,</hi> uſing the Balance of Property, which is fair enough, refers it to Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi>'s 15th chap. <hi>(de Repub. populi ingenio accommodanda)</hi> where the Author ſpeaks not one word of Property; which is very foul.</note>Pamphlet, having gather'd out of <hi>Oceana</hi> the Principles by him otherwiſe well inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, attributes it to the Agitators, or that Aſſembly which fram'd this wooden Agreement of the People: <hi>That then ſom of that Council aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted theſe Principles, and the reaſon of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T Railery apart, we are not to think it has bin for nothing that the wiſeſt Nations have in the formation of Government as much rely'd upon the invention of ſom one man, as upon themſelves: for wheras it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too often inculcated, that Reaſon conſiſts of two parts, the one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, the other Judgment; a People or an Aſſembly are not more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in point of Judgment, than they are void of Invention. Nor is there in this any thing at all againſt the ſufficiency of a People in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a proper Form, being once introduc'd, tho they ſhould never com to a perfect underſtanding of it. For were the natural Bodys of the People ſuch as they might commonly underſtand, they would be (as I may ſay) wooden Bodys, or ſuch as they could not uſe; wheras their Bodys being now ſuch as they underſtand not, are yet ſuch as in the uſe and preſervation wherof they are perfect.</p>
                     <p>THERE are in Models of Government things of ſo eaſy practice, and yet of ſuch difficult underſtanding, that we muſt not think them even in <hi>Venice,</hi> who uſe their Commonwealth with the greateſt prudence and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, to be all, or any conſiderable number of them, ſuch as perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the true Reaſon or Anatomy of that Government: nor is this a preſumtuous Aſſertion, ſince none of thoſe <hi>Venetians,</hi> who have hitherto written of their own form, have brought the truth of it to any perfect light. The like perhaps (and yet with due acknowlegement to <hi>LIVY)</hi> might be ſaid of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had not the right underſtanding of their Model, till about the time of <hi>ARISTOTLE</hi> it was firſt written

How egregiouſly our Anceſtors (till thoſe foundations were broken which at length have brought us round) did adminiſter the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, is ſufficiently known. Yet by one of the wiſeſt of our Writers (even my Lord <hi>VERULAM)</hi> is <hi>HENRY</hi> the Seventh parallel'd with the Legiſlators of antient and heroic times, for the inſtitution of thoſe very Laws which have now brought the Monarchy to utter ruin. The Commonwealths upon which <hi>MACCHIAVEL</hi> in his Diſcourſes is incomparable, are not by him, any one of them, ſufficiently explain'd or underſtood. Much leſs is it to be expected from a People, that they ſhould overcom the like difficultys, by reaſon wherof the wiſeſt Nations (finding themſelves under the neceſſity of a change, or of a new Government) induc'd by ſuch offers as promis'd fair, or againſt which they could find no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, have uſually acted as men do by new Clothes; that is, put them on, that, if they be not exactly fit at firſt, they may either fit themſelves to the body in wearing, or therby more plainly ſhew wherin they can be mended even by ſuch, as would otherwiſe prove but bad workmen. Nor has any ſuch offer bin thought to have more Preſumtion, much leſs Treaſon in it, than if one conſcious of his skill in Architecture, ſhould offer himſelf to the Prince or State to build a more convenient Parlament houſe. <hi>England</hi> is now in ſuch a condition, that he who may be truly ſaid to give her Law, ſhall never go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern her; and he who will govern her, ſhall never give her Law. Yet ſom will have it, that to aſſert Popular Power, is to ſow the ſeed of Civil War, and object againſt a Commonwealth, as not to be introduc'd but by Arms; which by the undeniable teſtimony of later Experience, is of all other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections the moſt extravagant: for if the good old Cauſe, againſt the deſire even of the Army, and of all men well affected to their Country, could be trod under foot without blood; what more certain demonſtration can there be, that (let the deliberations upon, or changes of Government, be of what kind ſoever which ſhall pleaſe a Parlament) there is no appearance that they can occaſion any Civil War? Streams that are ſtop'd may urge their Banks; but the courſe of <hi>England,</hi> into a Commonwealth, is both certain and natural. The ways of Nature require Peace: The ways of Peace require Obedience to the Laws: Laws in <hi>England</hi> cannot be made but by Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Parlaments in <hi>England</hi> are com to be mere popular Aſſemblys: The Laws made by popular Aſſemblys (tho for a time they may be aw'd, or deceiv'd, in the end) muſt be popular Laws: and the ſum of popular Laws muſt amount to a Commonwealth. The whole doubt or hazard of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence remains upon one queſtion, Whether a ſingle Council conſiſting but of four hundred, indu'd both with Debate and Reſult; the Keys of whoſe Doors are in the hands of ambitious men; in the croud and confuſion of whoſe Election the People are as careleſs as tumultuous, and eaſy, thro the want of good Orders, to be deluded; while the Clergy (declar'd and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat Enemys of popular Power) are laying about, and ſweating in the throng, as if it were in the Vinyard; upon whoſe Benches Lawyers (being feather'd and arm'd, like ſharp and ſudden Arrows, with a privat intereſt pointblank againſt the Public) may and frequently do ſwarm, can indeed be call'd a popular Council. This, I confeſs, may ſet the whole ſtate of Liberty upon the caſt of a Dy; yet queſtionleſs it is more than odds on the behalf of a Commonwealth, when a Government labors in frequent or long ſtruggles, not thro any certain biaſs of Genius or Nature that can be in ſuch a Council, but thro the impotence of ſuch Concluſions as may go awry, and the external force or ſtate of Property now fully introduc'd: whence ſuch a Council may wander, but never find any reſt or ſettlement, except only in that natural and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:49467:246"/>
proper Form of Government which is to be erected upon a mere Popular Foundation. All other ways of proceding muſt be void, as inevitably guilty of contradiction in the Superſtructures to the Foundation; which have amounted, and may amount to the diſcouragement of honeſt men, but with no other ſucceſs than to imbroil or retard Buſineſs: <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not capable of any other permanent Form than that only of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; tho her ſupreme Council be ſo conſtituted, that it may be Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally inclin'd. This contradiction in the Frame is the frequent occaſion of contradictory Expoſtulations and Queſtions. How, ſay they, ſhould we have a Commonwealth? Which way is it poſſible that it ſhould com in? And how, ſay I, can we fail of a Commonwealth? What poſſibility is there we ſhould miſs of it?</p>
                     <p>IF a man replys, he anſwers thus: No Army ever ſet up a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. To the contrary, I inſtance the Army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under <hi>MOSES;</hi> that of <hi>Athens</hi> about the time of <hi>ALCIBIADES;</hi> that of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the expulſion of the <hi>TARQUINS;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> But, ſay they, other Armys have not ſet up Commonwealths. True in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, divers other Armys have not ſet up Commonwealths; yet is not that any Argument why our Armys ſhould not. For in all Armys that have not ſet up Commonwealths, either the Officers have had no Fortunes or Eſtates at all, but immediatly dependent upon the mere Will of the Prince, as the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Armys, and all thoſe of the Eaſtern Countrys; or the Officers have bin a Nobility commanding their own Tenants. Certain it is, That either of theſe Armys can ſet up nothing but Monarchy. But our Officers hold not Eſtates of Noblemen able upon their own Lands to levy Regiments, in which caſe they would take home their People to plow, or make Hay; nor are they yet ſo put to it for their Livelihood, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend wholly upon a Prince, in which caſe they would fall on robbing the People: but have good honeſt Popular Eſtates to them and their Heirs for never. Now an Army, where the Eſtates of the Officers were of this kind, in no reaſon can, in no experience ever did ſet up Monarchy. Ay but, ſay they, for all that, their Pay to them is more conſiderable than their Eſtates. But ſo much more muſt they be for a Commonwealth, becauſe the Parlament muſt pay: and they have found by experience, that the Pay of a Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is far better than that of a Prince. But the four hundred being Monarchically inclin'd, or running upon the Intereſt of thoſe irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemys of Popular Power, <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> will rather pay an Army for commanding, or for ſupporting of a Prince, than for obeying. Which may be true, as was acknowleg'd before, in the way; but in the end, or at the long run, for the reaſons mention'd, muſt be of no effect.</p>
                     <p>THESE Arguments are from the Cauſe; now for an Argument to Senſe, and from the Effect: If our Armys would raiſe Mony of themſelves, or, which is all one, would make a King, why have they not made a King in ſo many Years? Why did they not make one yeſterday? Why do they not to day? Nay, why have they ever bin, why do they ſtill continue to be of all others in this point the moſt averſe and refractory?</p>
                     <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T if the caſe be ſo with us, that Nature runs wholly to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and we have no ſuch Force as can withſtand Nature, why may we not as well have golden Dreams of what this Commonwealth may be, as of the <hi>Indys,</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> or of the <hi>Sound?</hi> The Frame of a Commonwealth may be dreamt on, or propos'd two ways; the one in Theory, or notionally, in which it is of eaſy underſtanding, but of difficult practice: The other practicably, in which it is of difficult underſtanding, but of facil uſe.

                  <p>THAT every one holding above two thouſand pounds a year in Land, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> lying within the proper Territory of the Commonwealth, leave the ſaid <note place="margin">Agrarian Laws.</note>Land equally divided among his Sons; or elſe ſo near equally, that there remain to the eldeſt of them not above two thouſand pounds a year in Land ſo lying. That this Propoſition be ſo underſtood, as not to concern any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent having no more than one Son, but the next Heir only that ſhall have more Sons; in ſuch ſort, as nothing be hereby taken from any man, or from his Poſterity, but that fatherly Affection be at all points extended as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, except only that it be with more Piety, and leſs Partiality. And that the ſame Propoſition, in ſuch Familys where there are no Sons, concern the Daughter or Daughters in the like manner.</p>
                  <p>THAT no Daughter, being neither Heir nor Coheir, have above fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred pounds in Portion, or for her preferment in Marriage. That any Daughter, being an Orphan, and having ſeven hundred pounds or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in Portion, may charge the State with it. That the State being ſo charg'd, be bound to manage the Portion of ſuch an Orphan for the beſt, either by due payment of the Intereſt of the ſame; or, if it be deſir'd, by way of Annuity for Life, at the rate of one hundred pounds a year, for every ſeven hundred pounds ſo receiv'd. <hi>The manner wherof being elſwhere ſhewn, is not needful to be repeated.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Book </seg>III</label> leaſt, till a Commonwealth were firſt introduc'd. To which Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I am by no means inclining: Firſt, Becauſe the whole ſtream of this kind of Government is ſo clear and pellucid, as to abhor having any thing in the bottom which may not appear at the very top. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Becauſe an <hi>Agrarian,</hi> not brought in with the introduction of a Commonwealth, was never yet known to be brought in after the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a Commonwealth. And thirdly, Becauſe the change of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances in States, thro the want of fixation, has bin ſo ſudden, that between the Reign of HENRY the Seventh, and that of Queen ELIZABETH, being under fifty years, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Balance of Monarchical became Popular; and that of <hi>Rome,</hi> between the Lives of SCIPIO and of TIBERIUS GRACCHUS, being alſo under fifty years, of Popular became Monarchical. Nevertheleſs, if there remains any cure of Animoſity that may be ſafe, it muſt be prudent: And ſuch a cure (if we be not ſo abandon'd to mere fancy, as to ſacrifice all Prudence to it) there may be in the addition of this Clauſe;</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Additional Clauſe to the Agrarian.</note> THAT no <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law hereby given to this Commonwealth, or to be hereafter given to the ſame, or to any Province of the ſame, be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be otherwiſe binding, than to the Generation to com, or to the Children to be born ſeven years after the enacting of the Law.</p>
                  <p>UPON the addition of this Clauſe, it may be ſafely ſaid of theſe <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws, that they concern not any man living: and for Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it is well known, that to enact a Law, is no more in their regard, than to commend a thing to their choice; ſeeing they, if ſo pleas'd, can no more be deveſted of the Power to repeal any Law enacted by their Anceſtors, than we are of repealing ſuch Laws as have bin enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ours.</p>
                  <p>TO this it may be objected, That <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws, being once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted, muſt have brought Eſtates to the ſtandard of the ſame, before Poſterity can com into a capacity to judg of them. But this is the only means wherby Poſterity can com to a true capacity to judg of them: Firſt, becauſe they will have had experience of the Laws wherof they are to judg: And ſecondly, becauſe they will be void of all ſuch imaginary Intereſts as might corrupt their Judgment, and do now certainly corrupt ours.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.</note> THE Balance of the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thro the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lands at the introduction of the ſame, became Popular; and <note place="margin">Deut. 25. 28.</note>becoming Popular, was fix'd by the Law for the Jubile. <hi>That which was ſold, ſhall remain in the hands of them that bought it till the year of Jubile; and in the Jubile it ſhall go out, and he ſhall return to his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The ways in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in the Commonwealth propos'd, where the Popular Balance is not made but found, are divers; but the <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Laws in each, as to the end, which is the preſervation of the Balance, are of a like effect.</p>
                  <p>TO riſe thus from true Foundations to proper Superſtructures, the firſt ſtep from the Balance thus fix'd into the Orders of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, is not otherwiſe to be taken than by certain Diſtributions or Diviſions of the People, wherof ſom are to be perſonal, and ſom local.</p>

                  <p>THIS Dictatorian Council (as may already appear) conſiſts fundamentally of the Signory, with nine Knights elected by the Council of State, additionally of nine Knights more emergently cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the Senat, and of the four Tribuns of courſe; as will appear when I com to ſpeak of that Magiſtracy. Now if Dictatorian Power be indeed formidable, yet this in the firſt place is remarkable, that the Council here offer'd for a Dictator is of a much ſafer Conſtitution, than what among us hitherto has bin offer'd for a Commonwealth; namely, a Parlament and a Council in the interim. For here is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, but all the Councils of the Commonwealth not only remaining, but remaining in the exerciſe of all their Functions, without the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any; ſpeed and ſecrecy belonging not to any of them, but to that only of the Dictator. And if this Dictatorian Council has more in it of a Commonwealth than has hitherto among us bin either practis'd or offer'd, by what Argument can it be pretended that a Commonwealth is ſo imperfect thro the neceſſity of ſuch an Order, that it muſt needs borrow of Monarchy; ſeeing every Monarchy that has any Senat, Aſſembly, or Council in it, therby moſt apparently borrows more of a Commonwealth, than there is to be found of Monarchy in this Council?</p>

There is in a Commonwealth no other cure of theſe, than that the Anarchy may have a Council of ſom few, well choſen, and elected by themſelves, to adviſe them; which Council ſo inſtituted, is the Senat: Or that the Oligarchy have a popular Repreſentative to balance it; which both curing Tumult in the raſh and heady People, and all thoſe Corruptions which cauſe Factiouſneſs in the ſly and ſubtil Few, amount to the proper Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures of a well order'd Commonwealth.

If the Public in this caſe may not lead ſuch as deſire to be led by the Public, and yet a Party may lead ſuch as deſire to be led by a Party; where would be the Liberty of Conſcience as to the State? Which certainly in a well order'd Commonwealth, being the public Reaſon, muſt be the public Conſcience. Nay, where would be the Liberty of Conſcience in reſpect of any Party which ſhould ſo procede as to ſhew, that without taking their Liberty of Conſcience from others, they cannot have it themſelves?

                  <p>CERTAIN it is, that Religion has not ſeen corruption but by one of theſe three cauſes; ſom Intereſt therwith incorporated, ſom ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the truth of it, or by ſom complication of both. Nor was ever Religion left wholly to the management of a Clergy that eſcap'd theſe Cauſes, or their moſt pernicious Effects; as may be perceiv'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> which has brought Ignorance to be the Mother of Devotion, and indeed Intereſt to be the Father of Religion. Now the Clergy not failing in this caſe to be dangerous, what recourſe but to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat for ſafety? ſpecially ſeeing theſe Cauſes, that is, Intereſt and Ignorance (the one proceding from evil Laws, the other from the want of good Education) are not in the right or power of a Clergy, but only of the Civil Magiſtracy. Or if ſo it be that Magiſtrats are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd in duty to be <hi>nurſing Fathers and nurſing Mothers</hi> to the Church; <note place="margin">Iſa. 49. 23.</note>how ſhall a State in the ſight of God be excuſable, that takes no heed or care leſt Religion ſuffer by Cauſes, the prevention or remedy wherof is in them only?

We find not indeed that the Apoſtles either took or demanded Tithes; in which caſe the Prieſts, who were legally poſſeſt of them, might have had ſuſpicion that they, under color of Religion, had aim'd at the violation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. But putting the caſe that generally the Prieſts had bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Chriſtian Faith, whether the Apoſtles would for that reaſon have injoin'd them to relinquiſh their Tithes? Or what is there in the Chriſtian Religion to favor any ſuch ſurmiſe? To me there ſeems abundantly enough to the contrary. For if the Apoſtles ſtuck not to comply with the <hi>Jews</hi> in a Ceremony which was of mere human invention, and to introduce this, as they did Ordination by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, into the Chriſtian Church; that they would, upon a like inducement, have refus'd a ſtanding Law undoubtedly Moſaical, is in my opinion moſt improbable. So that, I conceive, the Law for Tithes now in being, may or may not be continu'd, at the pleaſure of the Lawgivers, for any thing in this caſe to the contrary. Confident I am, that the introducing of this Model in the whole, which is thought impracticable, were not to willing minds ſo difficult a work as the abolition of Tithes.</p>

Conſider, whether the threaten'd Puniſhments of this Order, tho thro unacquaintance they may at firſt ſight have ſom brow, would not, as they have don in other Commonwealths of like ſtructure, even with low ſpirits, expire in ſcorn and contemt, or thro the mere contemplation of the reward of Honor, nay of the Honor it ſelf, in which point where right has not bin don, men, under Governments of this nature, have bin much more apt to heats; as where the men of <hi>Ephraim</hi> fought againſt JEPTHA, for an affront in this kind which they conceiv'd him <note place="margin">Judg. 12.</note>to have put upon them. <hi>Wherfore paſſedſt thou over to fight againſt the Children of</hi> Ammon, <hi>and didſt not call us to go with thee?

                  <p>NOW that <hi>England,</hi> a Monarchy, has bin ſeiz'd of Provinces (one of them, while <hi>France</hi> was ſuch, being as great as any one of the <hi>Roman)</hi> is a known thing; and that the Militia propos'd by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Model, contains all the cauſes of Greatneſs that were in that of <hi>Rome,</hi> is to ſuch as are not altogether ſtrangers to the former, no leſs than obvious. Now of like Cauſes not to preſume like Effects, were unreaſonable. The ſafety therfore of the foregoing <hi>Agrarian,</hi> as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto propos'd, or that Lands be divided in their deſcent, muſt in this caſe be none at all, unleſs there be ſom ſtop alſo given in their Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation by way of purchaſe; leſt otherwiſe the ſpoil of ſom mighty Province be ſtill ſufficient to eat out the People by purchaſe.</p>

                  <p>DONATIONS and Inheritances will be fewer than to be dangerous; and as ſom fall, others will be dividing in their deſcent. But to reſume the Diſcourſe upon the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws, which, becauſe they were not till in this Propoſition complete, remains imperfect. That to <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws ſom Standard is neceſſary, appears plainly enough. This Standard in a well founded Monarchy, muſt bar receſs; and in a well founded Commonwealth muſt bar increaſe. For certain it is, that otherwiſe each of the Policys dos naturally breed that Viper which eats out the Bowels of the Mother: as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, by Pomp and Luxury, reduces her Nobility thro debt to poverty, and at length to a level with the People, upon which no Throne ever ſtood or can ſtand: ſuch was the caſe of this Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her latter Princes. And a Commonwealth by her natural ways of frugality, of fattening and cockering up of the People, is apt to bring Eſtates to ſuch exceſs in ſom hands, as eating out the reſt, bows the Neck of a free State or City to the yoke, and expoſes her to the goad of a Lord and Maſter; which was the caſe of <hi>Rome</hi> under her perpetual Dictators. But why yet muſt this Standard of Land in the preſent caſe, be neither more nor leſs than juſt two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds a year? Truly, where ſom Standard was neceſſary to be nam'd, I might as well ask why not this as well as any other? yet am I not without ſuch Reaſons why I have pitch'd upon this rather
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:49467:258"/>
than any other, as I may ſubmit to the judgment of the Reader in <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>4</label> the following computation or compariſon of the divers Effects or Conſequences of ſo many different Standards, as by the rules of proportion may give ſufficient account of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>LET the dry Rent of <hi>England</hi> (that is, at the rate a man may have for his Land without ſweating) be computed at ten Millions: This preſum'd, if you ſet the Standard at ten thouſand pounds a year, the whole Territory can com into no fewer than one thouſand hands. If you ſet it at five thouſand pounds a year, it can com into no fewer than two thouſand hands; and if you ſet it at two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds a year, it can com into no fewer than five thouſand hands. It will be ſaid, In which way you pleaſe, it will never com into ſo few hands as are capable of having it; which is certain: yet becauſe the Effects in their approaches would be ſuch as may be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd by their Extremes, I ſhall pitch upon theſe as the readieſt way to guide my Computation. The Balance in a thouſand hands might affect the Government with a hankering after Monarchy; in two thouſand hands it might uſurp it, as did the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility, and therby occaſion a feud between the Senat and the People. Theſe not only in the extremes, but with much of a like nature in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
                  <p>BUT letting theſe paſs, as alſo the numbers or compaſs neceſſary to the Rotation of ſuch a Commonwealth (none of which inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences are incident to the Standard of two thouſand pounds a year, as that wherby Lands can com into no fewer than five thouſand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors) we will ſuppoſe theſe Standards to be each of them, as to the ſafety of the Government, indifferently practicable.</p>
                  <p>YET it is recorded by Experience, and wiſe Authors, that the true cauſe whence <hi>England</hi> has bin an overmatch in Arms for <hi>France,</hi> lay in the communication or diſtribution of Property to the lower ſort; and for the ſame cauſe let it be conſider'd, if the Commonwealth upon the Standard of two thouſand pounds a year <hi>(c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Such are the advantages, ſuch is the glory of the like moderation to the public. <hi>Mony</hi> (ſays the Lord VERULAM) <hi>is like muck, not good except it be ſpread.</hi> Much rather in Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is this holding as to Land, the latter having upon the State a far ſtronger influence, at leaſt in larger Territorys, than Mony: for in ſuch, Mony, while ſcarce, cannot overbalance Land; and were Silver and Gold as plentiful as Braſs or Iron, they would be no more, nor would Land be leſs worth. And for privat men, were it not that <hi>it is eaſier to fill the belly of a Glutton than his eys,</hi> not only Virtue, but the Beatitude of Riches, would be apparently conſiſtent in a mean. But what need I play the Divine or the Philoſopher upon a Doctrin, which is not to diminiſh any mans Eſtate, not to bring any man from the Cuſtoms to which he has bin inur'd, nor from any emergent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation he may have; but regards only the Generation to com, or the Children to be born ſeven years after the paſſing ſuch a Law? Whence it muſt needs follow, that putting the caſe this <hi>Agrarian</hi> be introduc'd, it is to our Age as if there were none; and if there be no <hi>Agrarian,</hi> it is to our Age as if there was one. The difference is no more, than that in the one way the Commonwealth is at all points ſecur'd, and in the other it is left to its fortune even in the main. Of

                  <p>THESE Orders, thus ſum'd up together, render this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ordinarily able to wage War with fourſcore thouſand men; a Force which, it is known, not any Prince in Chriſtendom is able to match in Virtue, Number, or Diſciplin.

Not but that the March, the Equipage, the Waftage of ſo great an Army muſt coſt Mony; but that it will com to no account in compariſon of a lingring War made by a matter of thirty thouſand Mercenarys, the very conſumtion of a State: wheras fourſcore thouſand men ſo diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd and ſo furniſh'd, as has bin ſhewn, being once tranſported, muſt ſuddenly com to be no Charge, or make the War defray it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>BUT 'tis objected, that to reckon upon ſuch a Militia were to ſuppoſe a large Country capable of being a Commonwealth; wheras we hold them learn'd, who ſay that no Commonwealth has conſiſted of more <note place="margin">Whether a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth has conſiſted of more than one City or Town.</note>than ſom one City or Town.

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were not the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under their Commonwealth ſix hundred thouſand? What reaſon can be given why the Government that could take in ſix hundred thouſand, might not as well take in twice that number? How much ſhort came the Country, planted by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Tribes, of 150 Miles ſquare? Or how much over is <hi>England?</hi> And what reaſon can be given why a Government, taking in 150 Miles ſquare, might not as well take in twice that Compaſs? Whether was our Houſe of Commons under Monarchy not collected from the utmoſt Bounds of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Territory? And whether had the Laws by them enacted not their free courſe to the utmoſt limits of the ſame? And why ſhould that be impoſſible or impracticable to a Repreſentative of the People in a Commonwealth, which was ſo facil and practicable to a Repreſentative of the People under Monarchy?</p>
                  <p>IT is a wonder how the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> which held as it were the whole World by Provinces, ſhould be imagin'd by any man to have conſiſted but of one Town or City.</p>
                  <p>BUT to return: It is alleg'd by others, and as to Provincial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment very truly, that a Commonwealth may be a Tyranny: Nor do I think that <hi>Athens,</hi> in this point, came ſhort of any Prince: <hi>Rome,</hi> on the other ſide, was (according to the merits of the cauſe) as frequent in giving Liberty as in taking it away. The Provinces of <hi>Venice</hi> and of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> would not change their condition with the Subjects of the beſt Prince.

To render his Confutation intire, and the truth of this Aſſertion the more conſpicuous, I ſhall firſt inſert thoſe Rules or Maxims wherby a Model of a Commonwealth may be exactly prov'd or examin'd, and then ſhew how they totally enervat and overturn thoſe Arguments elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Mr. WREN towards the examination and confutation of the Model propos'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How a Model of Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may be try'd or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.</note> THE Maxims or Rules wherby a well order'd Model of Popular Government may be moſt exactly prov'd or examin'd, are ſpecially two:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> IT muſt be wholly void of any Contradiction or Inequality.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> IT muſt be ſuch in which no number of Men, having the Intereſt, can have the Power or Strength; and no number of Men, having the Power or Strength, can have the Intereſt to invade or diſturb the Government.</p>
                  <p>IT is not in the power of Nature that there ſhould be an effect, where there is not the cauſe of that effect; and in a Frame of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that is exactly according to the foregoing Maxims, there can be no cauſe of Sedition or Diſſolution. A Model of Government therfore that will hold examination by theſe Maxims, muſt (without oſtentation, or with Mr. WREN'S patience) be perfect.</p>
                  <p>NOW let us obſerve how he beſtirs himſelf to examin and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this Model. As to contradiction, he dos not ſo much as pretend that there is any Guile in it; yet will not allow it to have any truth: <note place="margin">W. p. 78.</note>
                     <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as in a Fiction the ſeveral Members may be ſo contriv'd, as not to give one another the ly, but be all contain'd within the limits of Veriſimilitude, and yet the whole remain without the leaſt ſyllable of Truth; ſo in a Model of Government.</hi> To which I anſwer, that there being a truth of Nature, and a truth of Fact, this way of Mr. WREN'S diſputing is mere equivocation. For the Model is not propos'd to ſhew the truth of Fact, or that there has bin any ſuch exactly in practice; but to ſhew the truth of Nature, or that ſuch a Model is practicable: wherfore he needed not to have alleg'd that it has not the truth of Fact, which we all know; but was to ſhew where it fails of ſuch a truth in Nature as can any way render it impracticable. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, he is gon to the Moon; and will read us a Lecture in Politics by the Planets, or the various Hypotheſes of Celeſtial Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>which may be excogitated including no abſurdity in themſelves, and yet perhaps not any one of them prove to be the true method of Nature.</hi> But may a man therfore argue in this manner? It is very hard to know certainly which are the Highways of the Planets, therfore there can be no certain knowlege which are the Highways to <hi>London.</hi> Let us e'en ſay, Becauſe the Rotation of the World may as well go upon the Heavens as upon the Earth, therfore a man may as well go upon his Head as upon his Heels; and a Commonwealth as well ſtand upon a Milkwoman's Pattins, as upon the ſtrongeſt Intereſt, or the Intereſt of the ſtrongeſt.</p>
                  <p>

                     <note place="margin">W. p. 179.</note> So much for Contradiction. Now for Inequality, ſays Mr. WREN, <hi>Tho it ſhould be allow'd Mr.</hi> HARRINGTON, <hi>that his Commonwealth has none in it, yet would it fail of attaining the perfection of Government, ſeeing there is an inequality in the Nature of man, which is not rectify'd by the Model of his Commonwealth.</hi> As if the equality of a Government was pretended to be ſuch, as ſhould make a crooked man ſtraight, a wicked man good, or a paſſionat man a Philoſopher; and it were not perfect, in being ſufficient to prevent any influence that Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Paſſion in a man or men, may have upon the Government. But for farther diſcovery of theſe Inequalitys in the Nature of man, that are not rectify'd by the Model, Mr. WREN ſends us to his eight and ninth Chapters, where he produces them in ſuch order, as I ſhall obſerve in repeating him. <hi>Whenſoever,</hi> ſays he, <hi>under Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 84.</note>
                     <hi>the number of thoſe whoſe Offences have render'd them liable to the ſeverity of Laws, is conſiderable enough to qualify them for attemt, Popular Government has no more ſecurity than any other, of being free from Sedition.</hi> It is very true: but Mr. WREN was oblig'd to ſhew how in an equal Commonwealth, or under the Model propos'd, it was poſſible that the number of ſuch men ſhould com to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enough to qualify them for ſuch an attemt. But in this kind he is no otherwiſe provided than to tell us, <hi>That of this Original and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, as to the main, was</hi> CATILIN'S <hi>attemt upon the</hi> Roman <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> So undertaking againſt <hi>Oceana,</hi> or the moſt equal Commonwealth, he is com to arguing againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> or the moſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Commonwealth; and at ſuch a time too, when being no longer capable of Liberty, but ready for bonds, there were other partys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides CATILIN'S, and others beſides ſuch as were obnoxious to the Laws, that lay in wait for her: as POMPEY and his Party, or at leaſt CESAR and his, who at length carry'd it; ſo that this feat was not ſo much perform'd by men otherwiſe <hi>liable to ſeverity of Laws,</hi> as by men puff'd up by ambition. But let theſe have bin of which ſort he will, it remains with him to ſhew, how there ſhould be of either kind enough in <hi>Oceana</hi> for a like attemt. It is known that long before this happen'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> the whole of that Commonwealth was in the hands of three men, CESAR, POMPEY, and CRASSUS: wherfore he ſhould have firſt ſhewn, which way the whole of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> might com into the hands of three, or of a few men. But leaving this untouch'd, he runs making a duſt, and a doubt where the ſoverain Power of <hi>Oceana</hi> can be; which even in <hi>Rome,</hi> as ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual as it was, is acknowleg'd to have bin in the Aſſemblys of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and in <hi>Athens,</hi> THUCYDIDES expreſly ſays, That the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainty <note place="margin">Lib. 5.</note>was in the five thouſand. Who ever doubted but where the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat Reſult is, there alſo muſt be the Soverainty? and the ultimat Reſult of <hi>Oceana</hi> is in the Prerogative Tribe, or Repreſentative of the People. Then ſays he, <hi>This Repreſentative thinking it their intereſt, may</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 84.</note>
                     <hi>diſſolve the Government, and perpetuat themſelves, and may com to think it their intereſt. For the deſire of Power being natural to man, a far greater ſhare of Power remains with every particular man, when the Soverain Power is divided among ſo many, than when the ſame Power is divided among two hundred thouſand.</hi> But I ſhew'd that this Repreſentative has the whole Soverain Power in themſelves, not divided with any other, or with the five hundred thouſand; which I ſuppoſe he means by the two hundred thouſand he mentions. Now this Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:49467:262"/>
cannot be underſtood to have the Soverain Power by overbalance of ſtrength, becauſe they are but one thouſand to five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; ſo it is plain that they have it by conſent, or by orders only: wherfore theſe Orders they have not the power, or ſtrength, nor the intereſt to break; becauſe breaking their Orders (by which only, and not by ſtrength, the Power is in themſelves) they com to divide the Power that was in themſelves, with the five hundred thouſand, as they, who, in defect of the Orders, have the far greater ſtrength, and <note place="margin">W. p. 85.</note>no legal bar. Yet ſays he, <hi>That a Repreſentative is not incapable of making ſuch an attempt as this, will (it is not improbable) eaſily find be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief with thoſe who are acquainted with the Actions of theſe laſt eighteen years.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, That becauſe a Repreſentative, by and with the People, may have both the intereſt, and the power or ſtrength to free themſelves of a broken Monarchy; therfore a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative may, without and againſt the People, have both the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and the power or ſtrength to break the Orders of the moſt equal Commonwealth. But if the Repreſentative of <hi>Oceana</hi> has not the power or ſtrength to break their Orders, and perpetuat themſelves; much leſs the Senat. True it is, if we look upon ſom other Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, a Senat might have the intereſt to do it; but not where the Senat has bin upon Rotation. To add then to Mr. WREN'S faculty of oppoſition greater ſtrength than is in it; if the Senat of <hi>Oceana</hi> would do any thing of this kind, their readieſt way were by creating of the Dictator. The Dictator being created, has ſoverain Power in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Orders of the Commonwealth: but thoſe do not perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuat their Power; this therfore cannot be don but by Force or Arms. The Arms of the Commonwealth are both numerous, and in a poſture or readineſs; but they conſiſt of its Citizens: and for the Dictator to bring the Citizen to break the Commonwealth, were for a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to command his Army to cut their own throats. It is true, the <hi>Roman Decemvirs</hi> put in for prolongation; but, tho in the moſt inequal Commonwealth, they could not make it ſtand one year, becauſe of the Citizens in Arms: And for Mercenarys there are none in <hi>Oceana;</hi> is this news? there were none in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there were none in <hi>Athens,</hi> there were none in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> there were none in <hi>Rome,</hi> while thoſe Commonwealths flouriſh'd. But were there Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenarys, as he might perhaps reckon Servants, they are unarm'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplin'd; they cannot riſe thro the vaſt bodys of Citizens in Arms both Elders and Youth; or if they would riſe, they could be nothing in their hands. The <hi>Roman</hi> Slaves, and the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Helots, being far of another and more dangerous nature, never roſe againſt their Lords but to their own deſtruction. All this while I ſay nothing of the ſecurity which is in the frame of this Dictator, beyond any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or intereſt of prolongation to be found either in the <hi>Roman</hi> Dictator or the <hi>Venetian</hi> Council of ten, each wherof having had the like power, did never diſcover any ſuch inclination. It is true, that in the time of SYLLA, the <hi>Roman</hi> Dictator began to be perpetual; but this is not to be attributed ſo much to the imperfection of the Order, as to the change of the Balance. But if the Dictator of <hi>Oceana</hi> cannot have the intereſt, or, having the intereſt, cannot have the power or ſtrength to perpetuat that Magiſtracy; much leſs can the Senat.</p>
                  <p>THE ſum of what has bin ſaid, may be thus caſt up, as to the whole Conſtitution. If Things or Perſons that have neither the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:49467:262"/>
right nor the might, may prevail againſt Things and Perſons who have both the right and the might; then may one Order of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth break the whole Syſtem: but the Might, thro the foundation or popular balance of Property, being in the whole People, and the whole Superſtructures of this Commonwealth being nothing elſe but an equal diſtribution of common Right to the whole People, who are poſſeſt of the Might; they who have the Might, have not the intereſt to break, but to preſerve the Orders; which therfore no other can have the power or ſtrength to break, or ſom other breaking, muſt but loſe that which they pretend to gain, to wit, the Right, which in this caſe muſt ſtill fall to the Might, devolving upon the People. That Mr. WREN will needs fancy the Tribes or Citys in <hi>Oceana,</hi> as thoſe in <note place="margin">W. p. 87.</note>the united Provinces, or the Cantons of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> to be diſtinct Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raintys, concerns not me, ſeeing the form of <hi>Oceana</hi> is far otherwiſe; nor indeed him, ſeeing neither do the Citys in <hi>Holland,</hi> nor the Cantons in <hi>Switzerland</hi> go about to diſſolve their Commonwealths or Leagues. The Champion having thus fail'd at the head, is contented to play low. <hi>Tho there be care taken,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that at the Aſſembly of the Hundred</hi>

He might better have ſaid, that at the Pariſh there was no care taken, that the People ſhould not elect too many of the Horſe, which being indeed the defect of the former, is in this Edition rectify'd. His laſt <note place="margin">

And what can I help that, if it ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſo to be, for a reaſon which he cannot anſwer? Nay, if ſo it be in common practice where the reaſon is nothing near ſo ſtrong, ſeeing a Pariſh Clerk, a Scrivener, an Apothecary, nay a Cobler or a Farrier, is not uncapable of being of the Common Council, nor yet of being an Alderman or Lord Mayor of <hi>London;</hi> which nevertheleſs that a Divine, a Lawyer, or a Phyſician ſhould be, were abſurd to think. Divines have a Plow from which they ought not to look back: they have above a tenth of the Territory, with which they ought to be contented; and more than all, Civil Intereſt contracted by a Clergy, corrupts Religion. For Lawyers, their Practice and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracys are not only the moſt gainful, but for life; and in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, neither is accumulation of Magiſtracy juſt or equal, nor the confounding of Executive and Legiſlative Magiſtracy ſafe. Will Mr. WREN believe one of our own Lawyers, and one of the learnedſt of them upon this point? It is the Lord VERULAM: <hi>They,</hi> ſays he, <note place="margin">Verulam de Aug.

                  <p>THUS is the Commonwealth by Mr. WREN oppos'd, by him aſſerted.

But a Militia is one thing, and a ſufficient Militia is another; where the Government conſiſts of a Nobility and of a People, what
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:49467:263"/>
ſufficient part of the Property or Revenue of the Territory can there remain to the Prince, wherby to have always in pay ſuch a Militia, as may be ſufficient to keep the Nobility and the People from joining, or to ſuppreſs them being join'd? If theſe be ſmall Armys, the like may befal them, which befel thoſe of the Kings in the Wars of the Barons. And if they be great Armys, the Prince has not wherwithal to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or content them; nay if he had, Mr. WREN tells us plainly, <note place="margin">W. p. 106.</note>
                     <hi>That Princes who keep great Armys, as Guards to their Perſons or Empires, teach us that this is to walk upon Precipices; there being no poſſibility of preventing ſuch an Army (ſpecially if they ly ſtill without imployment) from acquiring an intereſt diſtinct from that of the Prince.</hi> Wherfore (to follow Mr. WREN, and no other Leader, in his own words againſt himſelf) this Militia being great, cannot be ſo inſtituted, as to have no intereſt beſides the pay it receives from the Monarch; nor ſo as to have no hopes of being ſafe in their own ſtrength, if they ſhould withdraw themſelves from the Service and Obedience due to him: and being not great, againſt the whole Order or Orders of the Nobility and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they cannot be ſufficient.

                     <hi>to conſiſt in a mixture of Monarchy by a Nobility, and a Monarchy by Arms,</hi> has as to his Model intirely ſubverted Monarchy? In this way of diſputing, I have rather follow'd my Leader than Reaſon; the true Anſwer being that which was given in the Preface, namely, that an Army to be effectual in <hi>England,</hi> muſt be ſuch where the Officers have popular Eſtates, or where they have ſuch Eſtates as had the antient Nobility: in the latter caſe, they make a King; in the former, a Commonwealth. But Mr. WREN will have his own way; and therfore, to conclude, let me but deſire him to lay his hand upon his heart, and then tell me, whether the condition of the Nobility (to whoſe favor in my excluſion he pretends a meritorious Title) ſharing eminently and according to their rank with the People in the Commonwealth by me propos'd; or the condition of the Nobility under the inſolence and burden of a mercenary Army, ſharing equally with the People in Oppreſſion and Slavery, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the old Barons Wars for new Liberty, in the Monarchy by him propos'd; be the more deſirable. And to ſpeak a word for my Adverſary, we will ſubmit it wholly to the preſent Nobility, whether Mr. WREN or I be ſo extravagant in theſe things, that they have, or can have any other than the like choice.

                     <hi>A VVORD</hi> Concerning a Houſe of PEERS.</head>
                  <p>NO man knowing what is neceſſary to the Foundation or Being of a Popular Government, can hope or expect the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of any ſuch Form, where Monarchy is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable. They (where Monarchy is impracticable) who com firſt to diſcover it, and be convinc'd of it, if Reaſon be not altogether depos'd, are inevitable Leaders. Hence it is that our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthſmen are already renown'd throout this Nation for their invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Reaſons, even by the confeſſion of their Opponents, or ſuch as procede nevertheleſs in other ways. But where Seed is ſo well ſown and rooted, intervening Poſſeſſion and Intereſts are like ſuch Weather as holding back the Spring, yet improves the Harveſt: Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthſmen indeed may have a cold time on't, but upon the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth it muſt beſtow Fermentation. Had our incomparable Aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of public Liberty appear'd before a univerſal eviction of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity which inforces their Cauſe, it muſt have bin thro ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, as would have made them glad to do things by halves, which is the only Rock to a riſing Commonwealth of Scandal, or of Danger; the whole being ſuch againſt which there is nothing to be alleg'd, and the half what may be eaſily confuted. Theſe things conſider'd, what appearance is there but that it muſt redound to the greater advantage of our Commonwealthſmen, that we are under the force of a preſent Humor which abhors the very name of a Commonwealth? Seeing by this means one of two things muſt of neceſſity happen, and com ſhortly to public view or diſcovery: either that Monarchy is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, or that it is not practicable; I mean, in our ſtate of Affairs, or in this preſent diſtribution of the Balance. If Monarchy be found practicable, Commonwealthſmen are ſatisfy'd in their Conſciences, and ſo ready in fair ways to return, and ſubmit not only for Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake. But (let Divines cry Atheiſm, and Lawy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Treaſon) if it be once diſcover'd to common Underſtanding that Monarchy is impracticable, then in coms the Commonwealth, not by halves, but with all its Tackling, full ſail, diſplaying its Streamers, and flouriſhing with Top and Topgallant.</p>
                  <p>THE ways wherby it is at hand to be diſcover'd whether Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy be practicable or impracticable, are particularly two; the one quicker, the other ſlower: The quicker way will be by the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the ſlower by the Work.</p>
                  <p>IF the Workmen, being willing, be yet overcom by the mere obſtinacy of their Matter, it amounts to a plain confeſſion, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is impracticable. And if they give away the Libertys of the People, they are overcom by the obſtinacy of the Matter; for that is not their Work: nor any other Work than ſuch as muſt be uſeleſs, not ſo much in regard of it ſelf (tho that may be true enough) as by the want of any other Security than what the Prince had before, that
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:49467:264"/>
is, an Army. And ſuch an Army, which for ſecurity is as good as none at all, nay the very contrary, as has bin ſhewn already: nor to <note place="margin">Art of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, <hi>p. 433.</hi>
                     </note>be alter'd with better ſucceſs than theirs, who became Princes in <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> and <hi>Sicilian</hi> States.</p>
                  <p>BUT if the Workmen give not away the Libertys of the People, then muſt they ſo limit their Prince, that he can in no manner invade thoſe Libertys; and this by any other means than the full and perfect introduction of a well order'd Commonwealth, they will find to be utterly impoſſible: So either way they are overcom by the mere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of their Matter.</p>
                  <p>IF thro ſom ſecret Dictat (as when the Senat of <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viva Caeſaris)</hi> or a haſt to make riddance, this be not perceiv'd by the Workmen, it will be but the more perceivable by the Work when it coms to wearing or in practice; and the Flaws or Grievances being found inſupportable, the next Parlament, thro the mere want of any other remedy, muſt introduce a Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GOOD, and egregiouſly Prophetical! But what ſay you for all this, if we have a Houſe of Peers, and that even for the Lord's ſake, there being no other way to ſecure Liberty of Conſcience?</hi> Why I ſay, if we have a Houſe of Peers, it muſt be a Houſe of old Peers, or a Houſe of new Peers, or a Houſe of the one and the other. Moreover I ſay, Let it be which way you will, ſuch a Houſe may at ſom time, or for ſom reaſon, be perſonally affected to Liberty of Conſcience; but is a Conſtitution in it ſelf naturally averſe, and contrary to Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and therfore can be no ſecurity to the ſame, whether the Lords be Spiritual, or Temporal, or partiperpale.</p>
                  <p>LORDS Spiritual are inſpir'd with a third Eſtate, or ſhare of a Realm, which gives no toleration to any Religion, but that only aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting this point, which is Monarchy. Setting this Oracle, and ſom like Reaſons of State aſide, we may think that every Soverainty (as ſuch) has Liberty of Conſcience: This a King having, cannot give; and a People having, will not loſe. For Liberty of Conſcience is in truth a kind of State, wherin a man is his own Prince: but a Houſe of Peers ſets up another Prince; it cannot ſtand without a King. If the Balance be in the Lords, as before HENRY the Seventh, yet muſt they have a King to unite them, and by whom to adminiſter their Government; and if the Balance be not in the Lords, they ſtand or fall with the King, as the Houſe of Peers in the Long Parlament: and the King falling, their Government devolves to the People. Again, a Houſe of Peers having the overbalance, ſignifys ſomthing; in which caſe it has not bin known to be for Liberty of Conſcience: and not having the overbalance, ſignifys nothing; in which caſe it cannot ſecure the Liberty of Conſcience. Thus a Houſe of Peers, whether ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or nothing, is no way for the Liberty of Conſcience, but every way for a King: and a King is a defender of the Faith. The Faith wherof a King is defender, muſt be that which is, or he ſhall call his own Faith; and this Faith it concerns his Crown and Dignity, that he defend againſt all other Faiths. True it is, that a King for a ſtep to a Throne, may uſe what is readieſt at hand: Otherwiſe where there is Liberty of Conſcience, to aſſert Civil Liberty by Scripture can be no Atheiſm; which lames a Prince of one Arm. But where Liberty of Conſcience is not at all, or not perfect, Divines, who (for the greater part) are no fair Huntſmen, but love dearly to be poaching or club<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:49467:265"/>
with the ſecular Arm (tho if we, who deſire no ſuch Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, might proſecute them for abuſing Scripture, as they have don this thouſand years, to all the ends, intents, and purpoſes of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, they would think it a hard caſe) Divines, I ſay, not only brand the Aſſertors of Civil Liberty with Atheiſm, but are ſom of them ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in Contrivances, and quaint in Plots to give a check or remove to this or that eminent Patriot, by the like pretences or charges; which ſucceding accordingly by the power of a Parlament, they may at length com to have a Parlament in their power. Where there is no Liberty of Conſcience, there can be no Civil Liberty; and where there is no Civil Liberty, there can be no ſecurity to Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: but a Houſe of Peers is not only a neceſſary, but a declar'd check upon Civil Liberty; therfore it can be no ſecurity to Liberty of Conſcience. And ſo much for this particular.</p>
                  <p>NOW to make upon the other parts propos'd, and in a mere civil ſenſe, ſom farther conjecture.</p>
                  <p>WHEN a Houſe of Peers ſets up a Houſe of Commons, as in the Barons Wars, they will govern the Commons well enough for their own purpoſe, and not ſeldom the King too.</p>
                  <p>BUT we are to ſpeak of a thing without any example, a Houſe of Peers ſet up by a Houſe of Commons; nor, in the want of example, are we thought worthy by our Adverſarys to be furniſh'd with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: ſo the guidance of our Diſcourſe upon this point is committed to Mother Wit, a notable Goſſip, but not ſo good a Politician.</p>
                  <p>NEVERTHELESS, if this Houſe conſiſts of old Peerage on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we have direction enough to know how that will be; for either the ſingle Perſon, or the Commons will be predominant in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: if the Commons be ſo, then it will be with the Peers, as it was before their laſt Secluſion; that is, while they do as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons would have them, they may ſit; otherwiſe they are ſent home. And if the ſingle Perſon be predominant, it can be no otherwiſe than by an Army; in which caſe the old Peers being not in Arms, nor having any help that way, are as much under the Yoke as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. By which it may be apparent, that it is the great intereſt of the preſent Peerage, that there be a well order'd Commonwealth; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Commons being in bondage, the Lords, whom that leaſt becoms, are but equal with them: and being free, the Lords are not the head, but at the foot of them; wheras in an equal Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that the Nobility be not at the head, or have not the leading, is quite contrary to all Reaſon and Experience.</p>
                  <p>IF the Houſe conſiſts of new Peers only, it muſt conſiſt of the chief Officers in the Army; which immediatly divides the Government into two diſtinct Governments: the one in the Houſe of Commons, whoſe Foundation is the Body of the People; the other in the Houſe of Peers, whoſe Foundation is the Army. This Army if it remains firm to the Peers, they not only command the Commons, but make and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make Kings as they pleaſe; or as ambitious Partys and Perſons among themſelves are diligent or fortunat: But if the Army (as is moſt and more than moſt likely) coms off to the Commons, the Peers are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and the Commons introduce a Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>IF the Houſe conſiſts of new Peers and old, the old Peers while they like it, are Cyphers to new Figures; and when they like it not, may go home again: Nor whether they ſtay or go, is this caſe ſo different
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:49467:265"/>
from the former, as to be any greater obſtruction to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                  <p>TO hate the very name of a Commonwealth, or not to ſee that <hi>England</hi> can be no other, is as if men were not in earneſt. It is ask'd of the Commons what the Protector ſhall be, and he can be nothing but what they will. It is ask'd of the Commons what the other Houſe ſhall be, and it can be nothing but what the Commons will. The Commons are ask'd whoſe the Army, whoſe the Militia, whoſe the Negative Vote is; nor can theſe be otherwiſe determin'd than as they pleaſe. The Commons are ask'd whether they will make ſuch a War, whether they will pay ſuch a Debt, whether they will advance ſuch a Sum; all which are intirely at their diſcretion: therfore actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and poſitively <hi>England</hi> is a Commonwealth. Nay, and that there remain not the leaſt doubt, whether it be ſafe for any man to ſay thus much, the preſent Government has either no legal denomination at all, or is legally denominated the Commonwealth: the queſtion of the future ſtate of it coms not one whit upon the matter, which is already granted, but upon the form only. A Commonwealth for the matter makes it ſelf; and where they will not beſtow upon it the Form ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, fails not of coming to ruin, or, at leaſt, to diſgrace the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: Or, to ſpeak more properly and piouſly, a Commonwealth is not made by Men, but by God; and they who reſiſt his holy Will, are Weapons that cannot proſper.</p>

                  <p>THE way of Dialog being not faithfully manag'd, is of all others the moſt fraudulent; but being faithfully manag'd, is the cleareſt and moſt effectual for conveying a mans ſenſe into the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his Reader. There is nothing in this World, next the favor of God, I ſo much deſire as to be familiarly underſtood; which becauſe great men have thought below them, has prov'd hitherto but the ruin of themſelves, and the detriment of the Public: for which reaſon, having try'd all other means, I now add this. My work, if I be not given over to utter blindneſs, is the ſame with, or neareſt, that of the Nation; and the Work of the Nation being not underſtood, is in extreme danger of utter ruin.</p>

                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>Why really, notwithſtanding the tumult of theſe extravagant Changes, your laſt Diſcourſe had ſo much of my attention then, and has had ſuch a digeſtion with me ſince, that I feel it running in my Veins.</p>

                     <p>My thoughts, PUBLICOLA, are quite of another ſtrain; ſomtimes I fancy I ſee <hi>England</hi> graſping at Empire, like <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf.</p>

                     <p>The Heraldry of them is of as high a pitch as the Policy; but I would have them be a little lower in ſom things.</p>

                     <p>For all that, I could be contented to ſee you raiſe your Structure by your own ſtrength, and without the help of other Authors.</p>

                     <p>That I dare ſay you may, when you pleaſe.</p>

                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>I muſt ſee it then, before I loſe the covert of theſe reverend Elms.</p>

                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>You take care that the Building ſhould be well ſituated; and for the Foundation, I may preſume by what has already paſt between you and me, that we are long ſince agreed.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>That the threefold Balance, or Diſtribution of Property is the cauſe of the triple way of Government, I fully conſent with you; as alſo, that the Balance now in <hi>England</hi> is in the People plainly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively both of a King and Lords.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>You are not of them that grant this, and then ask which way a Commonwealth ſhould be introduc'd in <hi>England.</hi>

                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>Why truly yes; ſeeing not only the People are ſo wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the means, but their Leaders ſo averſe to it.</p>

                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>Think you that a Plant grows the worſe for not underſtanding the manner of its Vegetation?</p>

                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>A Plant is not a free Agent; but among Men who are free Agents, the Introduction of Government ſeems to be Arbitrary.</p>

                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>

                     <p>It is true, that if they can have nothing elſe, they muſt at length have a Commonwealth; but tho they can have nothing elſe to be holding, yet they will be trying other things.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>There is all the miſchief.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>And enough to ruin the Nation.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>To hurt it very ſore, but not to ruin it; nor yet to evade a Commonwealth, except they expoſe us to foren Invaſion.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>I am glad of your Confidence.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>You may let it paſs for Confidence, if you pleaſe; but if there be no other way except that only of Invaſion, wherby the preſent Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance can receive a change ſudden enough to admit of any other Form, the reaſon why we muſt have a Commonwealth is coercive.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>And putting the caſe it be the Will of God to defend us from foren Invaſion, how long will it be ere they ſee at home the coercive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Reaſon, or, which is all one, that all Power is in and from the People?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>Good VALERIUS, how long is it ſince this was both ſeen and declar'd in Parlament?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>Perhaps as they meant, it might be admitted as a Principle even in Monarchy.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>This with your pardon you will revoke, ſeeing you well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that this their Declaration of Power in the People, has bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of King and Lords, and that in expreſs terms.</p>
                  </sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>Why then, there is not ſuch a difference between the growing of a Plant and of a Commonwealth, as you thought; ſeeing a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth knowing as little, dos no leſs.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>This of all others is to me a Conſideration fulleſt of comfort.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>It will in time procede accordingly, thro a mere neceſſity of nature, or by feeling; but your deſire, I ſuppoſe, is to know how it ſhould be rationally introduc'd, or by ſeeing, and that with more eaſe and greater ſpeed.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>If it might pleaſe God, I would live to have my ſhare of it, tho I fear I never ſhall.</p>

                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>You carve for your ſelf ill: for by hope a man injoys even that which he never coms to attain; and by fear he is depriv'd even of that which he coms not to loſe.</p>

                     <p>VALERIUS, could I as eaſily have advis'd men how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, as what to do, there had bin a Commonwealth ere this.</p>

                     <p>Nay, I am not likely to trouble you much upon this point: but as you were intimating juſt now, there are Royaliſts who derive the original Right of Monarchy from the conſent of the People.</p>

                     <p>Why as I was about to ſay, The Power of the People may be politically brought into exerciſe three ways: by a ſingle Perſon; by an Aſſembly conſiſting of a few; or by an Aſſembly conſiſting of many.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>Or by a mixture.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, I pray let that alone yet a while: for which way ſoever you go, it muſt com at length to ſom mixture, ſeeing the ſingle Perſon you nam'd but now, without his <hi>Divan</hi> or Council to debate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to him, would make but bad work even for himſelf. But as the Government coms to be pitch'd fundamentally upon one of theſe three, ſo it differs not only in name, but in nature.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>I apprehend you, as Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, and Democracy.</p>

                     <p>Nay, you are out with your Learning, when you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it me. But in Countrys where there is not a Nobility ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently balanc'd or inrich'd, there can be none of your Ariſtocracy; and yet there may (as long as it will laſt) be a Government in a few.</p>

                     <p>I thought you would com to it; and yet ſeeing I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, I will be ſparing. But with your pardon, you have diſorder'd my Diſcourſe, or by this time I had ſhew'd, that if the Power of the People be committed to a ſingle Perſon, the common Intereſt is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to that of a Family; and if it be committed to a few, it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Intereſt of a few Familys.</p>

                     <p>I am not ſorry that you are of that mind. For there is no ſuch thing as a Commonwealth, or, as you ſay, Democracy in nature, if it be not pitch'd upon a numerous Aſſembly of the People.</p>

                     <p>Why, an Aſſembly ſuch for number as can neither go upon the intereſt of one ſingle Perſon or Family, nor the intereſt of a few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Familys.</p>

                     <p>Commonwealths for the Conſtitution of their Popular Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blys, have had two ways.

                     <p>As well! Nay PUBLICOLA, if they debate no better in your Commonwealth than they did in that, you may know what will becom of it. And to tell you true, I do not think that a thouſand men can debate any whit more orderly and maturely than five thouſand.</p>

                     <p>So there muſt be a Senat, which amounts to thus much; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Senat there can be no Commonwealth, and with a Senat there will always be Practices upon the Liberty of the People.</p>

                     <p>What is it then that any Government can be ſufficiently founded or balanc'd upon, but ſuch an Intereſt as is ſufficiently able to bear it?</p>

                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>Good Sir, a Government ought to be founded upon Juſtice, I take it.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>Right: and is not that Government which is founded upon an Intereſt not ſufficiently able to bear it, founded upon Injuſtice?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>I ſuſpect whither this will go. A Government founded upon the overbalance of Property, is legitimatly founded, and ſo upon Juſtice; but a Government founded upon the underbalance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, muſt of neceſſity be founded upon Force, or a ſtanding Army. Is not this that which you mean by Intereſt ſufficient or not ſufficient to ſuſtain a Government?</p>

                     <p>Good PUBLICOLA, let us keep to the point in hand. You ſay, That the ſecurity of Liberty lys not in the People, but in the form of their Government; ſo I am yet to expect when you will ſhew, what there is in your form, why it muſt be impoſſible for the People under it to reſtore Monarchy, or to perſecute for Conſcience.</p>

                     <p>See you not, that to do either of theſe under ſuch a form, muſt be pointblank againſt their Intereſt?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>But ſo either of theſe is now, and yet in this poſture you will confeſs that they would do both.</p>

                     <p>Mark how I am us'd. I ſpeak of a Form ſupported by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſufficiently able to bear it, and of an Intereſt contain'd under a Form ſufficiently able to ſecure it; and you inſtance in a Poſture which is no form at all, but ſuch a confuſion among, and force upon the People, as creates an Intereſt in them to rid themſelves which way they can of ſuch a miſery.</p>

                     <p>Riſes me up one of the Senators, and ſays, <q>Mr. Speaker, this Nation has bin long in labor, but now thro the mercy of God, the Child is not only com to the Birth, but there is alſo ſtrength to bring forth: In the number of Counſillors there is ſtrength; the number of this Houſe is good (far better than has uſually bin of late) and their Election has bin very free and fair. Here is alſo, I know not how (but the Inventions of men are overrul'd by the Providence of God) an extraordinary and exceding great confluence of honeſt men, who are not ſo well here; and if you determin any thing that is good for your Country, will go home and pray for you. Now, Sir (to be brief) ſince our Government conſiſted of King, Lords, and Commons, the antient, the only, the moſt happy Government that this Nation, nay, that the World ever knew, it is but too well known, that we have had no Government at all: wherfore my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is, that we propoſe, as they call it, to theſe honeſt men (who you need not doubt will receive it with glad hearts) the reſtitution of Right, and of the Government in this Nation by King, Lords, and Commons.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſure as you live, PUBLICOLA, thus much being ſaid, your whole Senat will immediatly agree to propoſe it to the Repreſentative: and thus much being propos'd to the Repreſentative, thoſe People will throw up their Caps for joy, and immediatly return to their Houſes.</p>

                     <speaker>Pub.</speaker>
                     <p>But VALERIUS, thus much has bin ſaid in Parlament when the Houſe was fuller; when they who were for this Reſtitution were back'd by a ſingle Perſon in actual poſſeſſion of the Throne; when over and above the zeal of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> there were Partys that knew no other means of ſelfpreſervation; as without, Divines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laboring the Oak of every Pulpit; and within, Laywers, Officers, and Penſioners: yet was it ſo far from being carry'd, that the ſingle Perſon has bin forc'd to diſſolve Parlaments, and that thro apparent danger of being overrun by the Principles of a Commonwealth not in being. But if this were ſo when a Commonwealth could ſcarce be hop'd, what will it be when the Commonwealth ſhall be in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as cannot be withſtood? for the Senat can never com to propoſe any thing to the People without firſt agreing upon debating what it is they will propoſe; nor is it poſſible that ſuch Debate ſhould be brought to any end, but by reaſons therto conducing: now it muſt not only be impoſſible to find reaſons for the reſtitution of Monarchy, but the reaſons why Monarchy ought not to be reſtor'd muſt be obvious; not only in regard that it is quite contrary to the intereſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of theſe Aſſemblys, but to the intereſt ten to one of every particular man in either of theſe Aſſemblys: nor are or have the reaſons bin leſs obvious, or leſs ventilated in Parlament, why Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy as to this Nation is impoſſible in it ſelf.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THAT which gives the being, the action, and the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to a Creature or Thing, is the Form of that Creature or Thing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. THERE is in Form ſomthing that is not Elementary but Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. THE contemplation of Form is aſtoniſhing to Man, and has a kind of trouble or impulſe accompanying it, that exalts his Soul to God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. AS the Form of a Man is the Image of God, ſo the Form of a Government is the Image of Man.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. MAN is both a ſenſual and a philoſophical Creature.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. SENSUALITY in a Man is when he is led only as are the Beaſts, that is, no otherwiſe than by Appetit.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. PHILOSOPHY is the knowlege of Divine and Human Things.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. TO preſerve and defend himſelf againſt Violence, is natural to Man as he is a ſenſual Creature.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. TO have an impulſe, or to be rais'd upon contemplation of natural things to the Adoration or Worſhip of God, is natural to Man as he is a Philoſophical Creature.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. FORMATION of Government is the creation of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Creature after the Image of a Philoſophical Creature; or it is an infuſion of the Soul or Facultys of a Man into the body of a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>

THE Spirit of a Nation (whether refin'd or not refin'd) can neither be wholly Saint nor Atheiſt: Not Saint, becauſe the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the People is never able in matters of Religion to be their own Leaders; nor Atheiſts, becauſe Religion is every whit as inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible a Character in man's Nature as Reaſon.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. LANGUAGE is not a more natural intercourſe between the Soul of one man and another, than Religion is between God and the Soul of a man.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. AS not this Language, nor that Language, but ſom Language; ſo not this Religion, nor that Religion, yet ſom Religion is natural to every Nation.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. THE Soul of Government, as the true and perfect Image of the Soul of Man, is every whit as neceſſarily religious as rational.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. THE Body of a Government, as conſiſting of the ſenſual part of Man, is every whit as preſervative and defenſive of it ſelf as ſenſual Creatures are of themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. THE Body of a Man, not actuated or led by the Soul, is a dead thing out of pain and miſery; but the Body of a People, not actuated or led by the Soul of Government, is a living thing in pain and miſery.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. THE Body of a People, not led by the reaſon of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is not a People, but a Herd; not led by the Religion of the Government, is at an inquiet and an uncomfortable loſs in it ſelf; not diſciplin'd by the conduct of the Government, is not an Army for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it ſelf, but a Rout; not directed by the Laws of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has not any rule of right; and without recourſe to the Juſtice or Judicatorys of the Government, has no remedy of wrongs.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. IN contemplation of, and in conformity to the Soul of man, as alſo for ſupply of thoſe his Neceſſitys which are not otherwiſe ſupply'd, or to be ſupply'd by Nature, Form of Government conſiſts neceſſarily of theſe five parts: The Civil, which is the Reaſon of the People; the Religious, which is the Comfort of the People; the Military, which is the Captain of the People; the Laws, which are the Rights of the People; and the Judicatorys, which are the Avengers of their Wrongs.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. THE parts of Form in Government are as the Offices in a Houſe; and the Orders of a Form of Government are as the Orders of a Houſe or Family.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. GOOD Orders make evil men good, and bad Orders make good men evil.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. OLIGARCHISTS (to the end they may keep all others out of the Government) pretending themſelves to be Saints, do alſo pretend that they in whom Luſt reigns, are not fit for Reign or for Government. But <hi>Libido dominandi,</hi> the Luſt of Government, is the greateſt Luſt, which alſo reigns moſt in thoſe that have leaſt right, as in Oligarchiſts: for many a King and many a People have and had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Right, but an Oligarchiſt never; whence from their own argument, the Luſt of Government reigning moſt in Oligarchiſts, it undeniably follows that Oligarchiſts of all men are leaſt fit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. AS in Houſes not differing in the kinds of their Offices, the Orders of the Familys differ much; ſo the difference of Form in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Governments conſiſts not in the kinds or number of the Parts,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:49467:280"/>
which in every one is alike, but in the different ways of ordering <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>V</label> hoſe parts. And as the different Orders of a Houſe ariſe for the moſt part from the quantity and quality of the Eſtate by which it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray'd or maintain'd, according as it is in one or more of the Family as Proprietors, ſo is it alſo in a Government.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. THE Orders of the Form, which are the manners of the mind of the Government, follow the temperament of the Body, or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the Lands or Territorys, and the Intereſts thence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. THE Intereſt of Arbitrary Monarchy is the abſoluteneſs of the Monarch; the Intereſt of Regulated Monarchy is the greatneſs of the Nobility; the Intereſt of Democracy is the felicity of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for in Democracy the Government is for the uſe of the People, and in Monarchy the People are for the uſe of the Government, that is, of one Lord or more.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THOSE Naturaliſts that have beſt written of Generation, do obſerve that all things procede from an Eg, and that there is in every Eg a <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> or a part firſt mov'd, as the purple Speck obſerv'd in thoſe of Hens; from the working wherof the other Organs or fit Members are delineated, diſtinguiſh'd, and wrought into one Organical Body.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A NATION without Government, or fallen into privation of Form, is like an Eg unhatch'd; and the <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> or firſt mover from the corruption of the Former to the generation of the ſucceding Form, is either a ſole Legiſlator or a Council.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A SOLE Legiſlator, proceding according to Art or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, produces Government in the whole piece at once and in perfection. But a Council (proceding not according to Art, or what in a new caſe is neceſſary or fit for them, but according to that which they call the Genius of the People ſtill hankering after the things they have bin us'd to, or their old Cuſtoms, how plain ſoever it be made in reaſon that they can no longer fit them) make patching work, and are Ages about that which is very ſeldom or never brought by them to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but commonly coms by the way to ruin, leaving the nobleſt Attemts under reproach, and the Authors of them expos'd to the greateſt miſerys while they live, if not their Memorys when they are dead and gon to the greateſt infamy.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. IF the <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> or firſt mover in generation of the Form be a ſole Legiſlator, his proceding is not only according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but according to Art alſo, and begins with the Delineation of diſtinct Orders or Members.</p>

DELINEATION of diſtinct Organs or Members (as to the Form of Government) is a diviſion of the Territory into fit Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts once ſtated for all, and a formation of them to their proper Offices and Functions, according to the nature or truth of the Form to be introduc'd.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. PRECINCTS in abſolute Monarchy are commonly call'd <hi>Provinces;</hi> and as to the delineation or ſtating of them, they may be equal or inequal. Precincts in regulated Monarchy, where the Lords or Nobility as to their Titles or Eſtates ought not to be equal, but to differ as one Star differs from another in Glory, are commonly call'd <hi>Countys,</hi> and ought to be inequal. Precincts in Democracy, where without equality in the Electors there will hardly be any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in the Elected; or where without equality in the Precincts, it is almoſt, if not altogether impoſſible there ſhould be equality in the Commonwealth, are properly call'd <hi>Tribes,</hi> and ought by all means to be equal.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. EQUALITY or Parity has bin repreſented an odious thing, and made to imply the levelling of mens Eſtates; but if a Nobility, how inequal ſoever in their Eſtates or Titles, yet to com to the truth of Ariſtocracy, muſt as to their Votes or participation in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be <hi>pares regni,</hi> that is to ſay Peers, or in parity among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: as well likewiſe the People, to attain to the truth of Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, may be Peers, or in parity among themſelves, and yet not as to their Eſtates be oblig'd to levelling.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. INDUSTRY of all things is the moſt accumulative, and Accumulation of all things hates levelling: The Revenue therfore of the People being the Revenue of Induſtry, tho ſom Nobility (as that of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or that of <hi>Lacedemon)</hi> may be found to have bin Levellers, yet not any People in the World.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. PRECINCTS being ſtated, are in the next place to be form'd to their proper Offices and Functions, according to the truth of the Form to be introduc'd; which in general is to form them as it were into diſtinct Governments, and to indow them with diſtinct Governors.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. GOVERNMENTS or Governors are either Supreme or Subordinat. For abſolute Monarchy to admit in its Precincts any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or Governors that are not ſubordinat but ſupreme, were a plain contradiction. But that regulated Monarchy, and that Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy may do it, is ſeen in the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and in the Cantons of <hi>Switzerland:</hi> Nevertheleſs theſe being Governments that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd this not from the Wiſdom of any Legiſlator, but from accident, and an ill diſpoſition of the matter, wherby they are not only incapable of Greatneſs, but even of any perfect ſtate of Health, they com not under the conſideration of Art, from which they derive not; but of Chance, to which we leave them. And, to ſpeak according to Art, we pronounce that, as well in Democracy and in regulated as in abſolute Monarchy, Governors and Governments in the ſeveral diviſions ought not to be Soveraintys, but ſubordinat to one common Soverain.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. SUBORDINAT Governors are at will, or for life, or upon Rotation or Changes.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. IN abſolute Monarchy the Governors of Provinces muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be at will, or upon Rotation, or elſe the Monarch cannot be abſolute. In regulated Monarchy the Governors of the Countys may be for life or hereditary, as in Counts or Lords; or for ſom certain
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:49467:281"/>
term and upon rotation, as in Viſcounts or Sherifs. In Democracy <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>V</label> the People are Servants to their Governors for life, and ſo cannot be free; or the Governors of the Tribes muſt be upon rotation and for ſom certain term, excluding the Party that have born the Magiſtracy for that term from being elected into the like again, till an equal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval or Vacation be expir'd.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. THE term in which a man may adminiſter Government to the good of it, and not attemt upon it to the harm of it, is the fitteſt term of bearing Magiſtracy; and three years in a Magiſtracy deſcrib'd by the Law under which a man has liv'd, and which he has known by the carriage or practice of it in others, is a term in which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attemt upon his Government for the hurt of it, but may adminiſter it for the good of it, tho ſuch a Magiſtracy or Government ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of divers Functions.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. GOVERNORS in ſubordinat Precincts have common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three Functions; the one Civil, the other Judicial, and the third Military.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. IN abſolute Monarchy the Government of a Province conſiſts of one <hi>Beglerbeg,</hi> or Governor for three years, with his Council or <hi>Divan</hi> for Civil matters, and his Guard of <hi>Janizarys</hi> and <hi>Spahys,</hi> that is, of Horſe and Foot, with power to levy and command the <hi>Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots</hi> or Military Farmers.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. IN regulated Monarchy the Government of a County con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of one Count or Lord for Life, or of one Viſcount or Sherif for ſom limited term, with power in certain Civil and Judicial matters, and to levy and command the <hi>Poſſe Comitatus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">17. IN Democracy the Government of a Tribe conſiſts of one Council or Court, in one third part elected annually by the People of that Tribe for the Civil, for the Judicial, and for the Military Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame; as alſo to preſide at the Election of Deputys in that Tribe towards the annual ſupply in one third part of the common and ſoverain Aſſemblys of the whole Commonwealth, that is to ſay, of the Senat and of the Popular Aſſembly; in which two theſe Tribes, thus delineated and diſtinguiſh'd into proper Organs or fit Members to be actuated by thoſe ſoverain Aſſemblys, are wrought up again by connexion into one intire and organical Body.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. A PARLAMENT of Phyſicians would never have found out the Circulation of the Blood, nor could a Parlament of Poets have written VIRGIL'S <hi>Aeneis;</hi> of this kind therfore in the formation of Government is the proceding of a ſole Legiſlator. But if the People without a Legiſlator ſet upon ſuch work by a certain Inſtinct that is in them, they never go further than to chuſe a Council; not conſidering that the formation of Government is as well a work of Invention as of Judgment; and that a Council, tho in matters laid before them they may excel in Judgment, yet Invention is as contrary to the nature of a Council as it is to Muſicians in conſort, who can play and judg of any Ayr that is laid before them, tho to invent a part of Muſic they can never well agree.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. IN Councils there are three ways of Reſult, and every way of Reſult makes a different Form. A Council with the Reſult in the Prince makes abſolute Monarchy. A Council with the Reſult in the Nobility, or where without the Nobility there can be no Reſult, makes Ariſtocracy, or regulated Monarchy. A Council with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:49467:282"/>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>V</label> in the People makes Democracy. There is a fourth kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult or Council which amounts not to any Form, but to Privation of Government; that is, a Council not conſiſting of a Nobility, and yet with the Reſult in it ſelf, which is rank Oligarchy: ſo the People, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never going any further than to elect a Council without any Reſult but it ſelf, inſtead of Democracy introduce Oligarchy.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. THE ultimat Reſult in every Form is the Soverain Power. If the ultimat Reſult be wholly and only in the Monarch, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is abſolute. If the ultimat Reſult be not wholly and only in the Monarch, that Monarchy is regulated. If the Reſult be wholly and only in the People, the People are in Liberty, or the Form of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is Democracy.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. IT may happen that a Monarchy founded upon Ariſtocracy, and ſo as to the Foundation regulated, may yet com by certain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients or Intruſions (as at this day in <hi>France</hi> and in <hi>Spain)</hi> as to the Adminiſtration of it to appear or to be call'd abſolute; of which I ſhall treat more at large when I com to ſpeak of <hi>Reaſon of State,</hi> or of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. THE ultimat Reſult in the whole body of the People, if the Commonwealth be of any conſiderable extent, is altogether impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable; and if the ultimat Reſult be but in a part of the People, the reſt are not in Liberty, nor is the Government Democracy.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. AS a whole Army cannot charge at one and the ſame time, yet is ſo order'd that every one in his turn coms up to give the Charge of the whole Army; ſo tho the whole People cannot give the Reſult at one and the ſame time, yet may they be ſo order'd that every one in his turn may com up to give the Reſult of the whole People.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. A POPULAR Aſſembly, rightly order'd, brings up every one in his turn to give the Reſult of the whole People.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. IF the popular Aſſembly conſiſts of one thouſand or more, annually changeable in one third part by new Elections made in the Tribes by the People, it is rightly order'd; that is to ſay, ſo conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted that ſuch an Aſſembly can have no other Intereſt wherupon to give the Reſult, than that only which is the Intereſt of the whole People.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. BUT in vain is Reſult where there is not Matter to reſolve upon; and where maturity of Debate has not preceded, there is not yet Matter to reſolve upon.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. DEBATE to be mature cannot be manag'd by a Multitude; and Reſult to be popular cannot be given by a Few.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. IF a Council capable of Debate has alſo the Reſult, it is Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy. If an Aſſembly capable of the Reſult has Debate alſo, it is Anarchy. Debate in a Council not capable of Reſult, and Reſult in an Aſſembly not capable of Debate, is Democracy.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. IT is not more natural to a People in their own affairs to be their own chuſers, than upon that occaſion to be provided of their Learned Counſil; in ſo much that the ſaying of PACUVIUS, That <hi>either a People is govern'd by a King or counſil'd by a Senat,</hi> is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally approv'd.</p>

Secondly, A Senat elected for life, as that of <hi>Sparta,</hi> which will be a ſpecies of Nobility, and will have a kind of <hi>Spartan</hi> King, and a Senat upon rotation; which being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtituted is quiet, and never pretends more than to be the learned Council of the People.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. THIRDLY, Three hundred Senators, for example, change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in one third part of them annually by new Elections in the Tribes, and conſtituted a Senat to debate upon all Civil matters, to promulgat to the whole Nation what they have debated, this Promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to be made ſom ſuch convenient time before the Matters by them debated are to be propos'd, that they may be commonly known and well underſtood, and then to propoſe the ſame to the Reſult of the Popular Aſſembly, which only is to be the Teſt of every public Act, is a Senat rightly order'd.</p>
                     <p>FORM of Government (as to the Civil part) being thus completed, is ſum'd up in the three following Aphoriſms.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. ABSOLUTE Monarchy (for the Civil part of the Form) conſiſts of diſtinct Provinces under diſtinct Governors, equally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat to a <hi>Grand Signor</hi> or ſole Lord, with his Council or Divan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating and propoſing, and the Reſult wholly and only in himſelf.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. LIBERTY of Conſcience in part is, where a man according to the dictats of his Conſcience may have the free exerciſe of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but if it be not the National Religion, he is therby incapable of Preferment or Imployment in the State.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. WHERE the Form admits not of the free exerciſe of any other Religion except that only which is National, there is no Liberty of Conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. MEN who have the means to aſſert Liberty of Conſcience, have the means to aſſert Civil Liberty; and will do it if they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in their Conſciences.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. MEN participating in Property, or in Imployment Civil or Military, have the means to aſſert Liberty of Conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. ABSOLUTE Monarchy, being ſole Proprietor, may admit of Liberty of Conſcience to ſuch as are not capable of Civil or Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Imployment, and yet not admit of the means to aſſert Civil Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as the <hi>Greec</hi> Chriſtians under the <hi>Turk,</hi> who, tho they injoy Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, cannot aſſert Civil Liberty, becauſe they have neither Property nor any Civil or Military Imployments.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. REGULATED Monarchy, being not ſole Proprietor, may not admit naturally of Liberty of Conſcience, leſt it admits of the means to aſſert Civil Liberty, as was lately ſeen in <hi>England</hi> by pulling down the Biſhops, who, for the moſt part, are one half of the Foundation of regulated Monarchy.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. DEMOCRACY being nothing but intire Liberty; and Liberty of Conſcience without Civil Liberty, or Civil Liberty without Liberty of Conſcience being but Liberty by halves, muſt admit of Liberty of Conſcience both as to the perfection of its preſent being, and as to its future ſecurity: As to the perfection of its preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the Reaſons already ſhewn, or that ſhe do not injoy Liberty by halves; and for future ſecurity, becauſe this excludes abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, which cannot ſtand with Liberty of Conſcience in the whole, and regulated Monarchy, which cannot ſtand ſafely with it in any part.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. IF it be ſaid that in <hi>France</hi> there is Liberty of Conſcience in part, it is alſo plain that while the Hierarchy is ſtanding this Liberty is falling, and that if ever it coms to pull down the Hierarchy it pulls down that Monarchy alſo: wherfore the Monarchy or Hierarchy will be beforehand with it, if they ſee their true Intereſt.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. THE ultimat Reſult in Monarchy being that of one Man, or of a few Men, the National Religion in Monarchy may happen not to be the Religion of the major part of the People; but the Reſult in Democracy being in the major part of the People, it cannot happen but that the National Religion muſt be that of the major part of the People.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. THE major part of the People, being in matters of Religion inable to be their own Leaders, will in ſuch caſes therfore have a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic leading; or, being debar'd of their Will in that particular, are debar'd of their Liberty of Conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. WHERE the major part of the People is debar'd of their Liberty by the minor, there is neither Liberty of Conſcience nor Democracy, but Spiritual or Civil Oligarchy.</p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>VI</label> Conſcience by the Minor, there is a National Religion.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. NATIONAL Religion is either coercive, or not coercive.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. RELIGION is not naturally ſubſervient to any corrupt or worldly Intereſt, for which cauſe to bring it into ſubjection to Intereſt it muſt be coercive.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. WHERE Religion is coercive, or in ſubjection to Intereſt, there it is not, or will not long continue to be the true Religion.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. WHERE Religion is not coercive, nor under ſubjection to any Intereſt, there it either is (or has no obſtruction why it may not com to be) the true Religion.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. ABSOLUTE Monarchy pretends to Infallibility in matters of Religion, imploys not any that is not of its own Faith, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes its Apoſtats by death without mercy.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. REGULATED Monarchy coms not much ſhort of the ſame pretence; but conſiſting of Proprietors, and ſuch as if they diſſent have oftentimes the means to defend themſelves, it dos not therfore always attain to the exerciſe of the like power.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. DEMOCRACY pretends not to Infallibility, but is in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion no more than a Seeker, not taking away from its People their Liberty of Conſcience, but educating them, or ſo many of them as ſhall like of it, in ſuch a manner or knowlege in Divine things as may render them beſt able to make uſe of their Liberty of Conſcience, which it performs by the National Religion.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. NATIONAL Religion, to be ſuch, muſt have a National Miniſtry or Clergy.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. THE Clergy is either a landed or a ſtipendiated Clergy.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. A LANDED Clergy, attaining to one third of the Territory, is Ariſtocracy; and therfore equally incompatible with abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and with Democracy: but to regulated Monarchy for the moſt part is ſuch a Supporter, as in that caſe it may be truly enough ſaid, that NO BISHOP, NO KING.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. THE Soverainty of the Prince in abſolute Monarchy, and of the People in Democracy, admitting not of any Counterpoiſe, in each of theſe the Clergy ought not to be landed; the Laborer never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs being worthy of his hire, they ought to be ſtipendiated.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. A CLERGY well landed is to regulated Monarchy a very great Glory; and a Clergy not well ſtipendiated is to abſolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy or to Democracy as great an Infamy.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. A CLERGY, whether landed or ſtipendiated, is either Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchical or Popular.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. AS the Matter of a Ship or of a Houſe is one thing, the Form of a Ship or of a Houſe is another thing, and the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration or Reaſon of a Ship or of the Houſe is a third thing; ſo the Matter of a Government or of a State is one thing, the Form of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or of a State is another, and the Adminiſtration of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which is what's properly and truly call'd <hi>Reaſon of State)</hi> is a third thing.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. ADMINISTRATION of Government, or Reaſon of State, to ſuch as propoſe to themſelves to play upon the ſquare, is one thing; and to ſuch as propoſe to themſelves to pack the Cards, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>REASON of State</hi> is that in a Kingdom or a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which in a Family is call'd THE MAIN CHANCE.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. THE Maſter of a Family that either keeps himſelf up to his antient bounds, or increaſes his Stock, looks very well to the main Chance, at leaſt if his play be upon the ſquare, that is, upon his own Abilitys, or good Fortune, or the Laws; but if it were not upon the ſquare, yet an Eſtate however gotten, is not for that a leſs Eſtate in it ſelf, nor leſs deſcending by the Law to his Succeſſors.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. IF a People thro their own Induſtry, or the prodigality of their Lords, com to acquire Liberty; if a few by their Induſtry, or thro the folly or ſlothfulneſs of the People, com to eat them out, and make themſelves Lords; if one Lord by his Power or his Virtue, or thro their Neceſſity, their Wiſdom, or their Folly, can overtop the reſt of theſe Lords, and make himſelf King, all this was fair play and upon the ſquare.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>REASON of State,</hi> if we ſpeak of it as fair play, is foren or domeſtic.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>REASON of State,</hi> which is foren, conſiſts in balancing foren Princes and States in ſuch a manner, as you may gain upon them, or at leaſt that they may not gain upon you.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>REASON of State,</hi> which is domeſtic, is the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Government (being not uſurp'd) according to the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Superſtructures of the ſame if they be good, or ſo as not being good that they may be mended, or ſo as being good or bad they may be alter'd; or, the Government being uſurp'd, the <hi>Reaſon of State</hi> then is the way and means wherby ſuch a Uſurpation may be made good or maintain'd.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>REASON of State,</hi> in a Democracy which is rightly founded and rightly order'd, is a thing of great facility, whether in a foren or in a domeſtic relation. In a foren, becauſe one good Democracy, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two or three of the greateſt Princes, will eaſily give the Balance abroad at its pleaſure; in a domeſtic, becauſe it conſiſts not of any
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:49467:286"/>
more than giving ſuch a ſtop in accumulation that the State coms not <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>X</label> to be Monarchical: which one Reaſon of State being made good, all the reſt gos well; and which one Reaſon of State being neglected, all the reſt coms in time to infallible ruin.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. REASON of State in a Democracy, which is not right in its Foundations, may flouriſh abroad, and be one: but at home will lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh or be two Reaſons of State, that is, the Reaſon of the State or Orders of the Nobility, which is to lord it over the People; and the Reaſon of the popular State or Order, which is to bring the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to equality: which two Reaſons of State, being irreconcilable, will exerciſe themſelves againſt one another, firſt by Diſputes, then by Plots, till it coms at laſt to open Violence, and ſo to the utter ruin of the Commonwealth, as it happen'd in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. REASON of State in an abſolute Monarchy (whether Foren or Domeſtic) is but threefold; as firſt, to keep its Military Farmers or <hi>Timariots</hi> to the firſt Inſtitution; next to cut him that grows any thing above his due Stature, or lifts up his head above the reſt, by ſo much the ſhorter; and laſt of all to keep its Arms in exerciſe.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. IN Ariſtocratical Monarchy Reaſon of State (as to the whole) is but one thing, that is, to preſerve the Counterpoiſe of the King and the two or the three, or the four Eſtates: For in ſom Countrys, as in <hi>Poland,</hi> there are but two Eſtates, the Clergy and the Nobility; in others, as in <hi>Sweden,</hi> there are four, the Nobility, the Gentry, the Clergy, and the Commons; in moſt others there are but three, the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal, and the Commons.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. IN Ariſtocratical Monarchy Reaſon of State (as to the parts) is a multifarious thing, every State having its peculiar Reaſon of State, and the King alſo his Reaſon of State: with the King it is to balance the Nobility, that he may hold them under; Reaſon of State with the Nobility is to balance the King, leſt he ſhould grow abſolute; Reaſon of State both with the King and the Nobility is to keep down the People; and Reaſon of State with the People is to drive at their Liberty.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. IN Forms that are pure, or in Governments that have no more than an abſolute Prince or one State, as abſolute Monarchy and equal or pure Democracy, there is but one Reaſon of State, and that is to preſerve the Form intire. In Forms that are mix'd (as in an inequal Commonwealth where there are two Eſtates, and in Ariſtocratical Monarchy where there is a King and two if not three Eſtates) there are ſo many Reaſons of State to break the Form, that there has not bin any inequal Commonwealth which either the People have not brought to Democracy, or the Nobility to Monarchy. And ſcarce was there any Ariſtocratical Monarchy, where (to omit the Wars of the Nobility with their King, or among themſelves) the People have not driven out the King, or where the King has not brought the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into Slavery. Ariſtocratical Monarchy is the true Theatre of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedientmongers and Stateemperics, or the deep Waters wherin that Leviathan the Miniſter of State takes his paſtime.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. THE Complaint that the Wiſdom of all theſe latter times in Princes Affairs conſiſts rather in fine deliverys and ſhiftings of Dangers or Miſchiefs when they are near, than in ſolid and grounded courſes to keep them off, is a Complaint in the Streets of Ariſtocratical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; and not to be remedy'd, becauſe the Nobility being not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

                     <p n="17">17. AN Abſurdity in the form of the Government (as that in a Monarchy there may be two Monarchs) ſhoots out into a miſchief in the Adminiſtration, or ſom wickedneſs in the Reaſon of State, as in ROMULUS'S killing of REMUS, and the monſtrous Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. USURPATION of Government is a Surfeit that converts the beſt Arts into the worſt: <hi>Nemo unquam imperium flagitio acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum bonis artibus exercuit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. AS in the privation of Virtue, and in Beggery, men are Sharks or Robbers, and the reaſon of their way of living is quite contrary to thoſe of Thrift; ſo in the privation of Government, as in Anarchy, Oligarchy, or Tyranny, that which is Reaſon of State with them is directly oppoſit to that which is truly ſo: whence are all thoſe black Maxims ſet down by ſom Politicians, particularly MACCHIAVEL in his <hi>Prince,</hi> and which are condemn'd to the fire even by them who, if they liv'd otherwiſe, might blow their fingers.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. WHERE the Government from a true Foundation riſes up into proper Superſtructures or Form, the Reaſon of State is right and ſtreight; but give our Politician peace when you pleaſe, if your Houſe ſtands awry, your Props do not ſtand upright.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. TAKE a Jugler, and commend his Tricks never ſo much, yet if in ſo doing you ſhew his Tricks you ſpoil him; which has bin and is to be confeſs'd of MACCHIAVEL.</p>

The firſt way is tyrannical. In the ſecond, one Commonwealth under the League is no more than another, and each one as to her ſelf has a Negative: which kind of Union is not only obſtructive, but tends (as we have ſeen both in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> towards Diviſion. In the third way, the Commonwealth u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting other Commonwealths, retains to her ſelf the leading of the whole League, leaving to each of the reſt her own Laws, and her own Liberty.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. TILL a Commonwealth be firſt fram'd, how ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth ſhould make an effectual Union with another Nation, is not poſſible to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. THE new, unpractis'd, and heretofore unheard Union (as it is vulgarly ſpoken) with <hi>Scotland,</hi> by uniting Deputys of divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not in a Council apart, or by way of States General, as in the United Provinces, but in the ſtanding Councils of ſom one Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in the League, is deſtructve to Liberty both in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

WHERE Countrys are divers in their Laws, and yet are to receive Laws one from the other, neither the Commonwealth giving Law, knows what to give, nor the Commonwealth receiving Law, underſtands what ſhe receives: in which caſe the Union returns to Force or Confuſion.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. THE beſt way of holding a Nation different or not different in Laws, is the <hi>Roman,</hi> that is, by way of Province.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. A PROVINCE, eſpecially if ſhe has ſtrong holds, may by defraying of a ſmall Guard, be kept to a juſt League, and for the reſt injoy her own Laws, her own Government, and her perfect Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Other ways of Union will be found more chargeable, and leſs effectual, on both ſides; for if <hi>England</hi> has no Army in <hi>Scotland, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will receive no Law from <hi>England;</hi> and if <hi>England</hi> has an Army there, her hold conſiſts not in the Union, but in the Force. The like is to be underſtood of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="57">57. IF a Country be very ſmall, and not able to ſubſiſt of it ſelf, as <hi>Wales,</hi> it may be ſafely united and held: but the advantage that <hi>Wales</hi> has in participation of all Magiſtracys and Offices, is not that which <hi>England</hi> is able to afford to ſuch a Country as <hi>Scotland,</hi> without ſubjecting her neck to the yoke.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. THE order of a Commonwealth requires, that it conſiſts, firſt, of a Civil; ſecondly, of a Religious; thirdly, of a Military; and fourthly, of a Provincial part. The manner of uniting Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or different Nations, pertains to the laſt part; and in the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Commonwealth, to begin with that firſt, which is naturally laſt, is to invert the Order, and by conſequence the Commonwealth it ſelf, which indeed is nothing but Order.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. WHERE there can be any other Government, there can be no Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. WHERE there can be a Commonwealth, what tumults ſoever there happen, and which ſoever prevail, there can be no other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that is to ſay, without foren Invaſion, which throout I muſt be underſtood to except.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. IF Sir GEORGE BOOTH had prevail'd, he muſt either have introduc'd a Commonwealth, or have reſtor'd the King.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. IF the King were reſtor'd, he muſt either govern by an Army, or by Parlaments.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. A KING governing now in <hi>England</hi> by an Army, would for the ſame Cauſes find the ſame Effects with the late Protector.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. A KING governing now in <hi>England</hi> by Parlaments, would find the Nobility of no effect at all.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. A PARLAMENT, where the Nobility is of no effect at all, is a mere Popular Council.</p>

66. A MERE Popular Council will never receive Law from a King.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. A MERE Popular Council giving Law to a King, becoms therby a Democracy, or equal Commonwealth; or the difference is no greater than in the imperfection of the Form.</p>
                  <p n="68">68. A COMMONWEALTH or Democracy to be perfect in the Form, muſt conſiſt eſpecially of ſuch an Aſſembly, the Reſult wherof can go upon no Intereſt whatſoever, but that only which is the common intereſt of the whole People.</p>
                  <p n="69">69. AN Aſſembly conſiſting of a few, may go upon the Intereſt of one man, as a King; or upon the Intereſt of one Party, as that of Divines, Lawyers, and the like; or the Intereſt of themſelves, and the perpetuation of their Government.</p>
                  <p n="70">70. THE Popular Aſſembly in a Commonwealth may conſiſt of too few, but can never conſiſt of too many.</p>
                  <p n="71">71. IN every Commonwealth there has bin a Popular Aſſembly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This in <hi>Iſrael</hi> at leaſt conſiſted of twenty four thouſand, upon a month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rotation. In <hi>Athens, Lacedemon, Rome,</hi> it conſiſted of the whole Citizens, that is, of all ſuch as had a right in the Commonwealth, whether they inhabited in City or Country. In <hi>Venice</hi> it conſiſts of about two thouſand. In the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> only, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains eighteen or nineteen Soveraintys, the Popular or reſolving Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blys conſiſt at leaſt of five hundred Perſons: theſe in the whole Union, may amount to five or ſix thouſand; in <hi>Switzerland</hi> I believe they com to a greater number. And the moſt of theſe Aſſemblys have bin perpetually extant.</p>
                  <p n="72">72. IF the Popular Aſſembly conſiſts of ſo few, and ſo eminent Perſons as are capable of any orderly Debate, it is good for nothing but to deſtroy the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p n="73">73. IF the Popular Aſſembly conſiſts of ſo many, and for the greater part of ſo mean Perſons as are not capable of Debate, there muſt be a Senat to help this defect.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. THE Reaſon of the Senat is, that a Popular Aſſembly rightly conſtituted, is not capable of any prudent debate.</p>
                  <p n="75">75. THE Reaſon of the Popular Aſſembly is, that a Senat right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtituted for Debate, muſt conſiſt of ſo few and eminent Perſons, that if they have the Reſult too, they will not reſolve according to the Intereſt of the People, but according to the Intereſt of themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="76">76. A POPULAR Aſſembly without a Senat cannot be wiſe.</p>
                  <p n="77">77. A SENAT without a Popular Aſſembly will not be honeſt.</p>
                  <p n="78">78. THE Senat and the Popular Aſſembly being once rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, the reſt of the Commonwealth will conſtitute it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="79">79. THE <hi>Venetians</hi> having ſlain divers of their Dukes for their Tyranny, and being aſſembl'd by ſuch numbers in their great Council as were naturally incapable of Debate, pitch'd upon thirty Gentlemen who were call'd <hi>Pregati,</hi> in that they were pray'd to go apart, and, debating upon the Exigence of the Commonwealth, to propoſe as they thought good to the great Council: and from thence firſt aroſe the Senat of <hi>Venice</hi> (to this day call'd the <hi>Pregati)</hi> and the <hi>Great Council,</hi> that is, the Senat and the Popular Aſſembly of <hi>Venice.</hi> And from theſe two aroſe all thoſe admirable Orders of that Commonwealth.</p>

80. THAT a People of themſelves ſhould have ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as when they of <hi>Venice</hi> did inſtitute their <hi>Pregati</hi> or Senat, is rare.</p>

                  <p n="82">82. THE diffuſive body of the People is not in a natural capacity of judging; for which cauſe the whole judgment and power of the diffuſive Body of the People muſt be intirely and abſolutely in their collective Bodys, Aſſemblys or Repreſentatives, or there can be no Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p n="83">83. TO declare that the Aſſemblys or Repreſentatives of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have power in ſom things, and in others not, is to make the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Body, which is in a natural incapacity of judging, to be in a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal capacity of judging.</p>
                  <p n="84">84. TO bring a natural incapacity of judging to a political capacity of judging, is to introduce Government. To bring a natural incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of judging to ſuch a collective or political capacity of judging, as yet neceſſarily muſt retain the Intereſt of the diffuſive Body, is to introduce the beſt kind of Government. But to lay any appeal whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever from a political capacity of judging, to a natural incapacity of judging, is to fruſtrat all Government, and to introduce Anarchy. Nor is Anarchy, whether impos'd or obtruded by the Legiſlator firſt, or by the People, or their Demagogs or Incendiarys afterwards, of any other kind whatſoever than of this only.</p>
                  <p n="85">85. TO make Principles or Fundamentals, belongs not to Men, to Nations, nor to human Laws. To build upon ſuch Principles or Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals as are apparently laid by GOD in the inevitable neceſſity or Law of Nature, is that which truly appertains to Men, to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to human Laws. To make any other Fundamentals, and then build upon them, is to build Caſtles in the Air.</p>
                  <p n="86">86. WHATEVER is violent, is not ſecure nor durable; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſecure or durable, is natural.</p>
                  <p n="87">87. GOVERNMENT in the whole People, tho the major part were diſaffected, muſt be ſecure and durable, becauſe it waves Force, to found it ſelf upon Nature.</p>
                  <p n="88">88. GOVERNMENT in a Party, tho all of theſe were well affected, muſt be inſecure and tranſitory, becauſe it waves Nature, to found it ſelf upon Force.</p>
                  <p n="89">89. COMMONWEALTHS, of all other Governments, are more eſpecially for the preſervation, not for the deſtruction, of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>

THE Frame of a Commonwealth having firſt bin propos'd and conſider'd, Expedients (in caſe ſuch ſhould be found neceſſary for the ſafe, effectual, and perfect introduction of the ſame) may with ſom aim be apply'd or fitted; as to a Houſe, when the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del is reſolv'd upon, we fit Scaffolds in building. But firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon Expedients, and then to fit to them the Frame of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, is as if one ſhould ſet up Props, and then build a Houſe to lean upon them.</p>
                  <p n="95">95. AS the chief Expedients in the building of a Houſe are Axes and Hammers; ſo the chief Expedient in the building of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a ſtanding Army.</p>
                  <p n="96">96. AS the Houſe which, being built, will not ſtand without the perpetual noiſe or uſe of Axes and Hammers, is imperfect; ſo is the Government which, being form'd, cannot ſupport it ſelf without the perpetual uſe of a ſtanding Army.</p>
                  <p n="97">97. WHILE the Civil and Religious parts of a Commonwealth are in forming, there is a neceſſity that ſhe ſhould be ſupported by an Army; but when the Military and Provincial parts are rightly form'd, ſhe can have no farther uſe of any other Army. Wherfore at this point, and not till then, her Armys are by the practice of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, upon ſlighter occaſions, to have half pay for life, and to be disbanded.</p>
                  <p n="98">98. WHERE there is a ſtanding Army, and not a form'd Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, there the Army of neceſſity will have Dictatorian Power.</p>
                  <p n="99">99. WHERE an Army ſubſiſts upon the Pay or Riches of a ſingle Perſon, or of a Nobility, that Army is always monarchical. Where an Army ſubſiſts not by the Riches of a ſingle Perſon, nor of a Nobility, that Army is always popular.</p>
                  <p n="100">100. THE <hi>Engliſh</hi> Armys are popular Armys.</p>
                  <p n="101">101. WHERE Armys are popular, and exerciſe Dictatorian Power in depoſing ſingle Perſons, and monarchical Aſſemblys, there can be no greater, nor needs any other Expedient for the introduction of a Commonwealth. Nevertheleſs to this may be added ſom ſuch moderat Qualifications as may prune the Commonwealth, not lop off her Branches. Whom theſe will not ſatisfy, it is not a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but a Party, that can.</p>
                  <p n="102">102. IF the late King had freely permitted to the People the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Power inevitably devolv'd upon them by the change of the Balance, he had not bin deſtroy'd.

                        </head>
                        <p>THAT the People in every City, and in every Province or County within theſe three Nations, elect to every City, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or County of the ſame, a matter of twenty, thirty, or forty Magiſtrats for life. That theſe Magiſtrats being ſo elected, be the Senat of that reſpective City, Province or County.</p>
                        <p>THAT the Senats, thus elected, thenceforth have and injoy the Soverain Power within their reſpective Juriſdiction, for ever. That every Senat annually elect two or four Burgomaſters or Conſuls, to be Preſidents of the ſame. That they alſo elect ſeven Magiſtrats, or preſent fourteen perſons to the Governor of the Province; and that he elect ſeven. That the ſeven ſo elected be Judges, or have the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power of the Laws for their term, and within their reſpective Juriſdiction.</p>
                        <p>THAT in caſe of Affairs of more public and general concern, as War or Peace, levy of Men or Mony, and the like, the Governor of the Province give information of the things to be conſider'd, to the Nobility, and to the Senats of that Province; therwith appointing a time and place for the Aſſembly of the States Provincial. That each of the Senats, having debated the matter propos'd, delegat one Conſul, with ſom other Senators well inform'd and inſtructed with their Will and Pleaſure, to the Aſſembly of the States Provincial. That the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the ſame Province delegat ſom of their Order likewiſe to the Provincial States. That the Delegats both of the Nobility and of the Senats, give the Vote of their Principals according to inſtruction;
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:49467:295"/>
and that neither the Nobility, nor any Senat or Soverainty be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bound, than by their own Vote.</p>
                        <p>THAT the Provincial Eſtates elect one Magiſtrat for life, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pleaſure, to be Provincial Governor: That they elect one or more other Magiſtrats for life, or during pleaſure, to be States General.</p>
                        <p>THAT the States General being elected, and well inſtructed by their Provinces, have the direction of the whole League: That each give not his own Vote, but the Vote of his Province; and that no Province be otherwiſe bound, than by her own Vote.</p>
                        <p>IF theſe Models (in which I claim to be the firſt that has laid the whole, and the higheſt Myſterys of the antient Commonwealths, to the loweſt capacity of vulgar Debate) be not all in the mouths of great men, and in Pamphlets, for <hi>Chimeras</hi> or <hi>Utopias,</hi> it is great chance: Yet contain they no leſs than the whole Revolution of Popular Prudence. Nor is it more certain, that no one of them would fit the preſent ſtate of this Nation, than that he or they, whoſe Contemplation and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding is not well vers'd in the moſt, or in the beſt of theſe, ſhall never fit a Model of Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Government to the preſent ſtate of this Nation, or of any other. In which aſſurance, I com to fulfil my promiſe in the <hi>Second Part,</hi> or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a Model as is fitted to the preſent ſtate of this Nation.</p>

                     <head>THE SECOND PART, Propoſing a MODEL of A COMMONWEALTH Fitted to the Preſent State of this Nation.</head>
                     <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T ſo it is ever, that the Humors or Intereſts of predominant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys hold themſelves to be National: and that which fits them, can never fit a Nation; nor that which fits a Nation, ever fit them. This in the introduction of Government, is always the main difficulty. But where Partys are no better founded, or fitted for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, than now in <hi>England,</hi> they are rather to be ſlighted than conſider'd, as thoſe, the ſtouteſt wherof have but given this Example to the reſt, that they who in this ſtate of Affairs ſhall obſtruct an equal and well order'd Government, ſhall but ruin themſelves. For which cauſe it is propos'd:</p>

That the Propoſers for the Senat open to the People the occaſion, motives, and reaſons of the Senat for the Law to be propos'd; and that the ſame being don, they put the Law or Propoſition by diſtinct clauſes to the Ballot of the People. That if any material Clauſe or Clauſes of the Propoſition, or Law ſo propos'd, be rejected by the People, the Clauſe or Clauſes ſo rejected may be review'd, alter'd, and propos'd again to the third time, if the Senat think fit, but no oftner.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. THAT what is thus propos'd by the Senat, and reſolv'd by the People, be the Law of the Land, and no other, except what is already receiv'd as ſuch, or reſerv'd to the Dictatorian Council.</p>

THAT every Magiſtracy, Office, or Election throout this whole Commonwealth, whether annual or triennial, be underſtood of courſe or conſequence to injoin an interval or vacation equal to the term of the ſame. That the Magiſtracy or Office of a Knight, and of a Burgeſs, be in this relation underſtood as one and the ſame; and that this Order regard only ſuch Elections as are National or Domeſtic, and not ſuch as are foren, or contain'd in the Provincial part of this Model.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. THAT for an Exception from this Rule, where there is but one Elder of the Horſe in one and the ſame Pariſh, that Elder be eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible in the ſame without interval; and where there be above four Elders of the Horſe in one and the ſame Pariſh, there be not above half, nor under two of them eligible at the ſame Election.</p>

                     <p>THE uſe of the Ballot, being as full of prolixity and abſtruſeneſs in writing, as of diſpatch and facility in practice, is preſum'd throout all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections and Reſults in this Model, and for the reſt refer'd rather to practice than writing. There remain the Religious, Military and Provincial parts of this Frame: But the Civil part being approv'd, they follow, or being not approv'd, may be ſpar'd.</p>

                        <head>CONCLUSION; or, the uſe of theſe PROPOSITIONS.</head>
                        <p>THESE Propoſitions are ſo laid out to debate or examination, that a man having the mind to weigh, diſcourſe upon, or object againſt this Model, may do it in the parts with the greateſt convenience.</p>
                        <p>ANY examination of, or objection againſt the whole, or any part in print or in writing, the Author holds himſelf bound to acknowlege or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: But as to mere diſcourſe upon matters of this compaſs, it is uſually narrow; beſides that in writing a man muſt put himſelf upon better aim than he can be oblig'd to take in diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>ANY one objection lying in writing againſt any one Order in this part of the Model, after ſuch manner as to ſhew that the Part or Order ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded ought to be expung'd, alter'd, or amended, unleſs it may be expung'd, alter'd, or amended accordingly, deſtroys the whole.</p>
                        <p>AND any one or more Objections ſo lying againſt any one or more of theſe Orders or Propoſitions, that therby they may be expung'd, alter'd or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, muſt in the whole or in part make a better Model.</p>
                        <p>IN this caſe therfore, or in caſe no Objection lys, the uſe of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions will be ſuch, as therby any Man or any Aſſembly of men, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or debating upon them in order, may find or make a true Model of a well order'd Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>AND that an Aſſembly can never make or frame a Model of any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment otherwiſe than in ſom ſuch manner, is provable firſt by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration from the effect; and ſecondly by a demonſtration from the cauſe.</p>
                        <p>THE demonſtration from the Effect is, that an Aſſembly no otherwiſe frames a Law or Order, than by having it firſt pen'd by ſom one man, and then judging upon it; and the Model of a Commonwealth muſt conſiſt of many Laws or Orders.</p>
                        <p>THE demonſtration from the Cauſe is, that wheras Reaſon conſiſts of two parts, the one Invention, and the other Judgment, a Man may be as far beyond any Aſſembly for Invention, as any Aſſembly can be beyond a Man for Judgment; or which is more, that the formation of a Model of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment requires a ſtrong faculty of Invention, and that an Aſſembly is naturally void of all manner of Invention.</p>

                  <p>TO the end that the People may be moſt equally repreſented, or that the Parlament may be Freeſt,</p>
                  <p>LET there be a new Diviſion of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> with as much equality as may ſtand with convenience, into fifty Shires.</p>
                  <p>LET every Shire elect annually two Knights to be of one Houſe, and ſeven Deputys to be of another Houſe of Parlament, for the term of three years. For the firſt year only, let the Deputys in each Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion be elected triple, that is, ſeven for the term of one year, ſeven for the term of two years, and ſeven for the term of three years.

                  <p>THE Houſe of Knights and the Houſe of Deputys being aſſembl'd, let the Houſe of Knights debate and propoſe.</p>

                  <p>PROMULGATION being thus made, let the Houſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putys meet, and give their Reſult upon the Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>LET what was thus propos'd by the Senat or Houſe of Knights, and reſolv'd by the People or Houſe of Deputys, be the Law.</p>
                  <p>IN this Conſtitution theſe Councils muſt of neceſſity contain the Wiſdom, and the Intereſt of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>IN this method, Debate muſt of neceſſity be mature.</p>

IF it be according to the Wiſdom and the Intereſt of the Nation upon mature debate that there be a King, let there be a King.</p>
                  <p>IF it be according to the Wiſdom and the Intereſt of the Nation upon mature debate, that there be a Commonwealth; two Aſſemblys in this Order are actually a Commonwealth, and ſo far a well order'd Commonwealth, that they are capacitated and inclin'd to reach to themſelves whatever furniture ſhall be further neceſſary in more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Orders, which alſo is at hand.</p>
                  <p>TILL this or the like be don, the Line of the late King and the People muſt be fellowſufferers; in which caſe the impatience of the People muſt be for the reſtitution of that Line at all adventures.</p>
                  <p>BUT this or the like being once don, immediatly the Line of the late King and the People becom Rivals, in which caſe they will never reſtore Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>WILL never, may ſom ſay? But if the Senat and the Popular Aſſembly be both Royaliſts, they both will and can reſtore Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>

                  <p>IN the preſent caſe of <hi>England,</hi> Commonwealthſmen may fail thro want of Art, but Royaliſts muſt fail thro want of Matter; the former may miſs thro impotence, the latter muſt thro impoſſibility.

                  <head>THE HUMBLE PETITION OF DIVERS Well affected Perſons, Deliver'd the 6<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>July,</hi> 1659. With the PARLAMENT'S Anſwer therto.</head>
                  <opener>TO THE SUPREME AUTHORITY, THE Parlament of the Commonwealth of <hi>England; The Humble Petition of divers well affected Perſons,</hi>
                  </opener>
                  <p>SHEWS,</p>
                  <p>THAT your Petitioners have for many years obſerv'd the breathings and longings of this Nation after Reſt and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that upon miſtaken grounds they have bin ready even to ſacrifice and yield up part of their own undoubted right, to follow after an appearance of it.</p>
                  <p>AND your Petitioners do daily ſee the bad effects of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd Diſtractions, in the ruins and decays of Trade foren and domeſtic; and in the advantages that are taken to make Confederacys to involve the Nation in Blood and Confuſion, under pretence of procuring a Settlement.</p>
                  <p>THAT it has bin the practice of all Nations, on the ſubverſion of any form of Government, to provide immediatly a new Conſtitution ſutable to their condition; with certain Succeſſions and Deſcents, that ſo both their Lawgivers and Magiſtrats might uſe their ſeveral Truſts, according to the eſtabliſh'd Conſtitution; and the Peoples minds be ſettl'd ſecure, and free from attemts of introducing ſeveral forms of Government, according to the variety of their Fancys, or corrupt Intereſts.</p>
                  <p>THAT God has preſerv'd this Nation wonderfully without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample many years, ſince the diſſolution of the old form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by King, Lords and Commons; there having bin no fundamental Conſtitutions of any kind duly ſettl'd, nor any certain Succeſſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:49467:301"/>
for the Legiſlative Power; but even at this inſtant, if by any ſudden ſickneſs, deſign, or force, any conſiderable numbers of your Perſons ſhould be render'd incapable of meeting in Parlament, the Commonwealth were without form of ſucceſſive Legiſlature or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, and left to the mercy of the ſtrongeſt Faction. Yet we have reaſon to remember in theſe years of unſettlement, the inexpreſſible ſufferings of this Nation in their Strength, Wealth, Honor, Liberty, and all things conducing to their welbeing; and we have like reaſon now ſadly to apprehend the impending ruin. And we cannot diſcern a poſſibility of your Honors unanimous and expeditious procedings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Countrys preſervation, and relief from its heavy preſſures, while your minds are not ſettl'd in any known Conſtitution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or fundamental Orders; according to which, all Laws ſhould be made: but divers or contrary Intereſts may be proſecuted on different apprehenſions of the Juſtice and Prudence of different forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, tho all with good intentions.</p>
                  <p>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R Petitioners therfore conceiving no remedy ſo effectual againſt the preſent Dangers, as the ſettlement of the Peoples minds, and putting them into actual ſecurity of their Propertys and Libertys, by a due eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Conſtitution under which they may evidently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend their certain injoyment of them; and therupon, a return of their Trade and free Commerce, without thoſe continual fears that make ſuch frequent ſtops in Trade, to the ruin of thouſands.</p>
                  <p>AND your Petitioners alſo obſerving, that the Intereſt of the late King's Son is cry'd up, and promoted daily, upon pretence, that there will be nothing but Confuſion and Tyranny, till he com to govern; and that ſuch as declare for a Commonwealth, are for Anarchy and Confuſion, and can never agree among themſelves, what they would have.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. THAT the Conſtitution of the Civil Government of <hi>England</hi> by King, Lords, and Commons, being diſſolv'd, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever new Conſtitution of Government can be made or ſettl'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any rule of Righteouſneſs, it can be no other than a wiſe Order or Method, into which the free Peoples Deputys ſhall be form'd for the making of their Laws, and taking care for their common ſafety and welfare in the execution of them: For, the exerciſe of all juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over a free People, ought (under God) to ariſe from their own Conſent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. THAT the Government of a free People ought to be ſo ſettl'd, that the Governors and Govern'd may have the ſame Intereſt in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

3. THAT there cannot be a Union of the Intereſts of a whole Nation in the Government, where thoſe who ſhall ſomtimes govern, be not alſo ſomtimes in the condition of the Govern'd; otherwiſe the Governors will not be in a capacity to feel the weight of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor the Govern'd to injoy the advantages of it: And then it will be the intereſt of the major part to deſtroy the Government, as much as it will be the intereſt of the minor part to preſerve it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. THAT there is no ſecurity that the Supreme Authority ſhall not fall into Factions, and be led by their privat Intereſt to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves always in power, and direct the Government to their privat ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, if that Supreme Authority be ſettl'd in any ſingle Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly whaſoever, that ſhall have the intire power of propounding, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating and reſolving Laws.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. THAT the Soverain Authority in every Government, of what kind ſoever, ought to be certain in its perpetual Succeſſions, Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Deſcents; and without poſſibility (by the judgment of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Prudence) of a death or failure of its being, becauſe the whole form of the Government is diſſolv'd if that ſhould happen, and the People in the utmoſt imminent danger of an abſolute Tyranny, or a War among themſelves, or Rapin and Confuſion. And therfore where the Government is Popular, the Aſſemblys in whom reſide the Supreme Authority, ought never to dy or diſſolve, tho the Perſons be annually changing: neither ought they to truſt the Soverain care of the ſtrength and ſafety of the People out of their own hands, by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Vacation to themſelves, leſt thoſe that ſhould be truſted be in love with ſuch great Authority, and aſpire to be their Maſters, or elſe fear an Account, and ſeek the diſſolution of the Commonwealth to avoid it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. THAT it ought to be declar'd as a Fundamental Order in the Conſtitution of this Commonwealth, that the Parlament being the Supreme Legiſlative Power, is intended only for the exerciſe of all thoſe Acts of Authority that are proper and peculiar to the Legiſlative Power; and to provide for a Magiſtracy, to whom ſhould appertain the whole Executive Power of the Laws: and no Caſe either Civil or Criminal to be judg'd in Parlament, ſaving that the laſt Appeals in all Caſes, where Appeals ſhall be thought fit to be admitted, be only to the Popular Aſſembly; and alſo that to them be refer'd the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Magiſtrats in Caſes of Maladminiſtrations in their Offices.</p>
                  <p>AND in proſecution of theſe Principles,</p>
                  <p>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R Petitioners humbly propoſe for the ſettlement of this Commonwealth, that it be ordain'd,</p>

                  <p n="2">2. THAT about the number of twelve perſons of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Fidelity and Integrity, may be authoriz'd and impower'd, for ſom certain number of years next inſuing, to ſeize, apprehend, and in ſafe cuſtody to detain any perſon or perſons whatſoever, till he or they be in due form of Law deliver'd, as is hereafter ſpecify'd, that ſhall move or propoſe in either of the ſaid Aſſemblys of Parlament the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Kingly Government, or the introduction of any ſingle Perſon to be chief Magiſtrat of this Commonwealth, or the alteration of that part of the fundamental Order herein contain'd, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the equal freedom and protection of religious perſons of different perſuaſions; but for no other matter or cauſe whatſoever. And when it ſhall happen that any perſon or perſons ſhall be arreſted or ſeiz'd for any of the cauſes aforeſaid, in manner aforeſaid, then a Commiſſion of Oyer and Terminer may iſſue forth in due form of Law to the ſaid twelve, or any ſix of them, to procede in due form of Law, within one month after the apprehenſion of any ſuch perſon or perſons, to the arrainment and public trial of every ſuch perſon or perſons; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the legal conviction of him or them by the teſtimony of two ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Witneſſes of any of the Treaſons herein declar'd, to condemn to the pains of death, and to cauſe the ſame Judgment to be duly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted: and the Keeper or Keepers of the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> that ſhall be for the time being, may be authoriz'd and requir'd from time to time during the term of years, to iſſue out Commiſſions to the ſaid twelve or any ſix of them, authorizing them to procede as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>AND if your Honors ſhall further judg it convenient, the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Orders of the Government may be conſented to or ſubſcrib'd by the People themſelves, if their expreſs Pact ſhall be eſteem'd any additional ſecurity; other Nations, upon the like occaſions of expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Kings, having taken the Peoples Oaths againſt their return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And the ſame may be proclaim'd as often as our Anceſtors provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the proclaiming of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and any further ſecurity alſo added, if any can be found among men, that has a foundation in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
