         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His whole Chapter,<note place="margin">Coherence.</note> upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſall,
we ſhall finde it a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
againſt thoſe old ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of God, and his people,
the <hi>Philiſtins:</hi> So much the
firſt <hi>verſe</hi> thereof acquaints us
with. <hi>The word of the Lord
that came to</hi> Jeremiah <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
againſt the</hi> Philiſtins, <hi>&amp;c.
The word of the Lord.</hi> And what <hi>Word</hi> was this? A
word of <hi>threatning,</hi> denouncing againſt them a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a terrible judgement, the <hi>Sword,</hi> the ſword of a
forraigne enemy; ſo you have it, <hi>verſe 2. Thus ſaith
the Lord, behold waters riſe up out of the North, and ſhall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:124124:4"/>
be an overflowing flood, and ſhall overflow the Land,</hi> &amp;c.
What <hi>Waters</hi> were theſe? Why, the <hi>Armie</hi> of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi>
or <hi>Babilonians,</hi> which comming out of the North
ſhould overrunne, overflow, and drowne that whole
Land with a ſanguinarie deluge, a deluge of blood: ſo
the third <hi>verſe</hi> explaines it. <hi>At the noyſe of the ſtamping
of the hoofes of the ſtrong Horſes, at the ruſhing of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>the Fathers ſhall not looke backe unto their
Children for feebleneſſe of hands.</hi> Such ſhould be the
feare and terrour that ſhould ſurprize them, that it
ſhould even take away all naturall affections. So oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in warre it commeth to paſſe, where every one
is put to ſhift for himſelfe, the Father forgetteth the
Childe, and the Husband the Wife. So ſharpe is this
Sword, that it cuts in ſunder even the ſtraiteſt bonds,
and neereſt relations.</p>
            <p>This is the judgement here threatned againſt this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
this people. For the further confirmation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that the <hi>Jewes,</hi> (for whoſe ſake this Prophecie was
penned, and to whom it was directed) might not make
any doubt of it, the Prophet here in the cloſe of the
Chapter, the <hi>verſes</hi> I have now ſingled out, breaketh
forth into a moſt emphaticall <hi>Apoſtrophe,</hi> turning his
ſpeech to the <hi>Sword</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>parlying with it</hi> (as it were)
<hi>about a ceſſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this <hi>Parlie</hi> two particulars are to be taken notice
of;<note place="margin">Diviſion.</note> An <hi>Expoſtulation,</hi> and a <hi>Revocation.</hi> An <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation,</hi>
verſe 6. <hi>O thou Sword of the Lord, how long,</hi> &amp;c.]
A <hi>Revoctaion</hi> correcting and anſwering that <hi>Expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
ver. 7. <hi>How can it be quiet</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>In each of theſe, take we notice againe of two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:
In the former, the <hi>Thing</hi> expoſtulated with,
and the <hi>matter</hi> of the expoſtulation. The <hi>thing</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated
with: the <hi>Sword;</hi> the <hi>Sword of the Lord.]</hi>
The <hi>matter</hi> touching which he expoſtulates with that
<hi>Sword,</hi> is a <hi>Ceſſation. O thou Sword of the Lord, how
long will it be ere thou be quiet?</hi> In the latter, a <hi>Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:124124:4"/>
and a <hi>Reaſon.</hi> A <hi>Reſolution</hi> by way of anſwer to
his former <hi>Expoſtulation, How can it be quiet?]</hi> A
<hi>Reaſon</hi> of that <hi>Reſolution, ſeeing the Lord hath given it
a charge againſt</hi> Aſhkelon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee the Particulars; I ſhall touch upon them
as briefly as I may, beginning with the firſt, which
ſhall ſerve as a key to let us in to all the reſt: The <hi>thing</hi>
which the Prophet here parlies, and expoſtulates with,
<hi>The Sword,</hi> the <hi>Sword of the Lord. O thou Sword of the
Lord.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sword,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Explication.</note> what properly and litterally it is, I
ſhall not need to tell you. It were much to be wiſhed
that it were not ſo well knowne amongſt us as at this
day it is. Improperly the <hi>Sword</hi> ſtill points out ſome
<hi>Judgement:</hi> Generally, any notable judgement. In
this ſenſe underſtand we the word, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 7. 12.
where the Pſalmiſt ſpeaking of the wicked man, he
tells us <hi>that if he turne not, God will whet his ſword.]</hi> i. e.
prepare for him, and execute upon him ſome terrible
judgement: In the ſame ſenſe the Plague of <hi>Peſtilence</hi>
is ſometime called the <hi>Sword,</hi> So you have it, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
21. 27. where, ſpeaking of the ceſſation of the
<hi>Peſtilence,</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>The Lord commanded the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
and hee put up his ſword againe into the ſheath.]</hi>
Every notable, terrible judgement is a <hi>Sword.</hi> More
raſtrainedly, and peculiarly, the judgement of <hi>Warre.</hi>
This in phraſe of Scripture is moſt commonly known
by the name of the <hi>Sword.</hi> And will you know the
reaſon of it? <hi>Illiricus</hi> gives it fitly. The <hi>Sword</hi> it is
<hi>Precipium organum belli:</hi> It is one of the chiefeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of uſe and ſervice in the warres. In this
ſenſe underſtand the word in the Text. <hi>O thou Sword.]</hi>
the <hi>Sword</hi> of a forraigne Enemy, the Armie of the
<hi>Caldeans</hi> or <hi>Babilonians,</hi> that ſhould come up againſt the
<hi>Philiſtins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>Sword</hi> the Prophet here calls the <hi>Sword of
the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
               <hi>O thou Sword of the Lord.] Such is the Sword,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124124:5"/>
the judgment of warr, it is Gods Sword.</hi> So we find it in
Scripture not unfrequently called. Ezek. 21. 3. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
J am againſt thee, and I will draw forth my Sword
out of his ſheath,</hi> ſaith the Lord.] Iſa. 34. 5. <hi>My
Sword ſhall be bathed.]</hi> Againe v. 6. <hi>The Sword of the
Lord is filled with bloud.]</hi> Jer. 12. 12. <hi>The Sword of
the Lord ſhall devoure from one end of the Land to the
other.]</hi> The <hi>Sword of the Lord,</hi> though in the hand of
<hi>Man. The Sword of the Lord and of</hi> Gideon, ſay they,
<hi>Judg.</hi> 7. 20. mark it, though in <hi>Gideons hand,</hi> yet <hi>Gods
Sword.</hi> Such was the <hi>Sword</hi> in the Text, <hi>The Sword of
the Lord,</hi> though put into the hand of the <hi>Babylonians.</hi>
So the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> explaines it, Ezek. 30. 25. <hi>When
I ſhall put my Sword into the hand of the King of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell.]
In whoſe hands ſoever, it is Gods Sword. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as the Sword of <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> in whoſe hands ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it be found, yet ſtill it is the <hi>Kings Sword:</hi> In ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
whereof, it uſeth where he cometh
in Perſon, to be delivered into his hand. Thus this
Sword, in whoſe hand ſoever, ſtill it is <hi>Gods Sword. The
Sword of the Lord.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A truth which I might make good (if need were)
upon theſe two Swords, the <hi>Forraigne</hi> Sword, and the
<hi>Civill</hi> or <hi>Domeſticke</hi> Sword. <hi>Ecce duo gladij, Loe here
are two Swords,</hi> as the Diſciples once ſaid to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 38. The <hi>Forraigne</hi> Sword, the Sword
of a Forraigne Enemy: The <hi>Civill</hi> or <hi>Homebred</hi> Sword

the former, the Text is expreſſe. <hi>O thou Sword of the

ſhall goe. 2. How farre it ſhall advance. 3. How long
it ſhall ſtay.</hi> 4. And laſtly, <hi>What execution it ſhall do.</hi>
In all which reſpects it may be well called, <hi>The Sword
of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It hath a <hi>Charge</hi> from God <hi>whither it ſhall goe;</hi> to
what place, to what Kingdome, what part of that
Kingdome: ſo much we may reade in the Text. <hi>The
Lord</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>had given the Sword a charge
againſt</hi> Paleſtina, the land of the <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> and that
not only againſt the Country in generall, but againſt
ſome particular places in it. <hi>The Lord hath given it a
charge againſt</hi> Aſhkelon, <hi>and againſt the Sea coasts.]
Aſhkelon,</hi> one particular City of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
City, <hi>paulò remotior</hi> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> notes upon it) a
little more remote from the Sea <hi>Coaſts,</hi> viz. <hi>Tyre</hi> and
<hi>Sidon,</hi> of which the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>v</hi> 4. Maritine
Townes bordering upon the Sea. Now the Sword had
a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> againſt each of theſe. Not only a generall,
but a particular <hi>Charge:</hi> ſo hath it where ever it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
a <hi>Charge</hi> not onely to goe to ſuch a Country,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:124124:6"/>
but ſuch a part of that Country. A charge given it by
God.</p>
            <p>2. As a Charge whither it ſhall goe, ſo <hi>How farre
it ſhall advance:</hi> Whether it ſhall goe to one part of
the Land, or through it: ſo much we may picke out
of that threatning. <hi>Ezek. 14. 17. If I bring a Sword
upon that Land</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and ſay, Sword goe
through the Land.</hi> This Sword, how well backed ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
it can advance no further then it hath a charge, a
command to doe, and ſo farre it ſhall goe. This alſo
we may reade in the Text. The <hi>Sword of the Lord</hi>
had a charge againſt <hi>Aſhkelon, and againſt the Sea coaſts,]</hi>
it ſhould not only touch the skirts of the Kingdom, but
the inland part alſo.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>How long it ſhall ſtay</hi> where it cometh; whether
it ſhall be only <hi>Tranſiens gladius,</hi> a <hi>tranſient Sword,</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
through the Land, or elſe <hi>Permanent,</hi> ſtaying and
abiding, making it the Seat of a warre. So much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
we may learne from the Text, where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
treating and <hi>Parlying</hi> with the Sword about a <hi>Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
How long will it be ere thou ceaſe?</hi> &amp;c.] In
the next verſe he corrects and anſwers himſelfe, <hi>How
can it ceaſe ſeeing the Lord hath given it a charge?]</hi>
a <hi>Charge, viz.</hi> how long it ſhall continue, and abide wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
and ſpoyling in that Land.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>What Execution it ſhall doe.</hi> This alſo the Sword
hath in charge from God: whether it ſhall <hi>ſip</hi> and <hi>taſte</hi>
of blood, or els be <hi>bathed</hi> and made <hi>drunke</hi> with blood.
Expreſſe and emphaticall is that of the Prophet <hi>Iſai,</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.
34. 5. <hi>My Sword</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ſhall be bathed or
made drunke in Heaven.]</hi> A notable expreſſion. <hi>The
Sword is never made drunke upon Earth, but it is first
made drunke in Heaven.</hi> Firſt made drunke in Heaven
in the <hi>Decree</hi> and <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of God, before it be made
drunke upon Earth in doing <hi>Execution,</hi> which is but
the Execution of that Decree. When God ſends a
Sword againſt a Nation, he giveth it a particular <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:124124:7"/>
and that not onely againſt ſuch or ſuch a place,
but againſt ſuch and ſuch particular perſons. So much
is intimated in that full expreſſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 12. where
the Lord denouncing vengeance againſt thoſe rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ones, which had ſtopped their eares againſt his
Call, he tels them he would <hi>number them to the Sword.
Therefore will I number you to the Sword]</hi> marke it:
where God giveth over a people to the Sword, he doth
it not by the groſſe, but by number and tale. <hi>Such as
are appointed to the Sword goe to the Sword,</hi> as the
Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> hath it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 2. They, and none
but they. God giving over whom he pleaſeth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting
whom he pleaſeth. The one ſhall not eſcape,
the other ſhall not be touched. It is the Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to King <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> that notwithſtanding hee
ſhould fall into the hand of his Enemies, yet he ſhould
not periſh by the <hi>Sword, Thou ſhalt not die by the
Sword,</hi> Jer. 34. 4. The like protection he giveth to
<hi>Ebedmelech the Black-moore,</hi> Jer. 39. v. laſt. <hi>Thou ſhalt
not fall by the Sword.]</hi> The Sword when it is ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a people, it is not left to the caſualty of <hi>Chance</hi>
or <hi>Fortune,</hi> nor yet to the will of him that uſeth it.
God himſelf giveth it a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> a <hi>Charge;</hi> a charge,
as whither it ſhall go, and how farr it ſhall go, and how
long it ſhall ſtay, ſo what blood it ſhall draw. And in
all theſe reſpects well may it be called, <hi>The Sword of the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe let me adde yet one thing more. The
Sword where ever it goeth, <hi>it goeth upon Gods errand,
to avenge his quarrell.</hi> This is that which the Lord
telleth his people, <hi>Lev. 26. 25. I will bring a Sword upon
you that ſhall avenge the quarrell of my Covenant.]</hi> Marke
it; The Sword is never unſheathed, it never goeth
forth upon any ſervice, but it is in Gods quarrell; to
take vengeance for ſome wrong, ſome affront, ſome
indignity offered to him, or to his people. To ſuch
a purpoſe the Sword in the Text ſerved. It was to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:124124:7"/>
goe forth to avenge the quarrell of God againſt the
<hi>Philiſtins,</hi> thoſe inveterate enemies to him and his
people, to take vengeance upon them for all the wrongs
and injuries that they had done to the <hi>Arke</hi> of God,
and to the people of God. Never doth the Sword goe
forth but upon ſome ſuch quarrell. God hath firſt a
<hi>Controverſie with a Land,</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi>
ſpeakes, <hi>Hoſ,</hi> 4. 1.) before he ſend the ſword to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
it. The <hi>Quarrell</hi> is his, and therefore the <hi>Sword</hi>
may well be called, <hi>His Sword. [O thou Sword of the
Lord.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A uſefull Point;<note place="margin">Application.</note> and ſo let it be to every of us. That
is the buſineſſe I mainly intend at the preſent, it being
moſt ſutable to the day, and occaſion, which calls rather
for <hi>Application,</hi> then <hi>Doctrine.</hi> That it may be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place bring we home this generall Truth
to the particular caſe of this Kingdome,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> in the bowels
whereof there is a <hi>Sword,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Information.</note> a ſharpe Sword, wandring
and forraging, waſting and ſpoiling; It may be at
this very inſtant <hi>eating of Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>drinking of blood.</hi>
A Sword not unlike that in the Text, which begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
at <hi>Aſhkelon,</hi> reacheth to <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the in-land parts of the Kingdome, extendeth
to the <hi>Sea Coaſts,</hi> ſome whereof have already felt of
it, and the reſt being in daily expectation of it. Now
this <hi>Sword</hi> know we it to be, as it is, <hi>The Sword of the
Lord,</hi> and ſo looke we upon it; which till we doe,
we are not capable of making a right uſe of it. It is
ſo in all judgements, all corrections; till we come to ſee
God in them, wee ſhall never make a ſanctified, a
Chriſtian uſe of them. It is ſo in this great, and ſoare
judgement, (for ſo indeed it is, no judgement pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
deeper, <hi>The Sword reacheth: unto the ſoule,</hi> ſaith
the Prophet <hi>Jeremie, Jer.</hi> 4. 10.) Now that we may
make a right uſe of it, that uſe which God would
have us to make, give way to this conviction, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:124124:8"/>
this to be Gods Sword.</p>
            <p>True, it is in the hands of men, managed (as we
thinke) by them, but alas what are they? <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

            <p>And ſo looke we upon this Sword which is abroad,
and at worke in ſome parts of this Kingdome already,
know we it to be <hi>Gods Sword;</hi> A Sword which hee
hath both called for, and ſent; having given it a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
a <hi>Charge</hi> whither to goe. He that here gave
the Sword a charge againſt <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> againſt <hi>Aſhkelon,</hi>
and the <hi>Sea Coaſts,</hi> hath now given it a charge againſt
<hi>England,</hi> and againſt the ſeverall places where either
it hath come, or ſhall come. Looke we not then too
much at ſecondary cauſes, at the <hi>Malignancie</hi> of what
ever <hi>spirits</hi> we conceive to have beene <hi>Incendiaries</hi> in
the State. Alas what are they? <hi>Inſtruments, Bellowes,</hi>
which may blow up, but cannot kindle a fire. Nor
yet attribute we too much to thoſe imaginary obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of <hi>fatall Revolutions,</hi> or <hi>Ominous Conjunctions</hi>
of thoſe heavenly Bodies. So farre the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(upon what ground I know not.) A Chriſtian
muſt goe further, not ſtaying his thoughts upon earth,
nor yet terminating his ſight in the viſible Heavens,
but looking through all, let him behold this <hi>Sword,
furbiſhed</hi> and <hi>bathed in the higheſt Heavens,</hi> the Heaven
of Heavens. So much God taught the people of the
<hi>Jewes</hi> by a ſigne from Heaven, by that prodigious
<hi>Comes,</hi> that <hi>flaming Sword</hi> hanging perpendicularly,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:124124:8"/>
with the point downwards, over the City <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>
for a yeare together before the deſtruction of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſhewing them from whence the Sword ſhould
come againſt them. I am not over-credulous of a
flying report which informes us of a like prodigie in
this Nation, a like Sword, hanging after a like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
not many yeares ſince over the head of that place,
that <hi>City,</hi> which at this preſent is made the ſeate of
the Warre. Sure I am, from thence it is, that the <hi>Sword</hi>
drops upon the head of a place, a Citie, a Kingdom.
It is that which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of all <hi>affliction,</hi> all
<hi>trouble, It cometh not forth of the Duſt, neither doth it
spring out of the ground, Job</hi> 5. 6. Apply we it to
this great <hi>Affliction,</hi> this great <hi>Trouble, The Sword
cometh not out of the duſt, neither doth it ſpring out of the
ground.</hi> Certainely the Originall of it is from Heaven.
However in the hand of Man, yet it is the <hi>Sword</hi> of the
Lord.</p>
            <p>And is it ſo?<note place="margin">

this Sword. <hi>The Lyon hath roared who will not

God, the <hi>Lord of Hoaſtes</hi> hath drawne his Sword,
who ſhall not tremble at it? <hi>The Sword of the Lord.</hi>
And what a Sword is his? Why a <hi>fore</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> and

And being ſo, who or what ſhall oppoſe this Sword?
How ſhall it be diverted? how ſhall it be ſtayed, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted?
This it is which the Prophet here chiefly drives
at in the Text, where (as I told you) he ſeemes to
<hi>Parlie</hi> with the <hi>Sword</hi> which was coming againſt the
<hi>Philiſtims,</hi> treating with it about a <hi>ceſſation. O thou
Sword of the Lord, how long will it be ere thou be quiet?
Put up thy ſelfe into thy ſcabbard,</hi> &amp;c,] (Here give me
leave to returne a little to the Text, interweaving
<hi>Explication</hi> with <hi>Application,</hi> that the one may be as
the Woofe, the other as the Warpe.) This the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:124124:9"/>
ſpeaketh not in his own perſon, out of any <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration,</hi>
or ſpeciall <hi>affection</hi> that he bare towards
this people, being enemies to God and his people,
but rather (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Calvin</hi> noteth upon it) perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Philistines</hi> themſelves, who, when they ſaw
the Sword coming towards them, or buſie amongſt
them, they would then begin (to uſe his words)

and indeavouring either the diverting, or qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting
of it. But the Prophet tells them, all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
and indeavours in this caſe ſhould be bootleſſe:
This Sword being <hi>the Sword of the Lord,</hi> and having a
<hi>charge</hi> from him, it would not be <hi>bribed,</hi> it would
not be perſwaded, nor yet oppoſed, or by any meanes
taken off, or quieted, till it had done the Execution
for which it was ſent. <hi>How can it be quiet ſeeing the
Lord hath given it a charge againſt</hi> Aſhkelon, <hi>&amp;c. There
hath he appointed it.] Appointed it.</hi> In this word <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
findeth a ſpeciall emphaſis, and therefore renders
it not <hi>precepit ei,</hi> but <hi>Conteſtatus eſt ei.</hi> Not only, <hi>hee
commanded,</hi> or <hi>appointed</hi> the Sword unto that ſervice,
but he bound it to it by a kind of <hi>ſolemne Conteſtation,</hi>
laying a ſolemne <hi>Charge</hi> upon it, binding it as it were
by a <hi>Militarie Oath,</hi> or <hi>before witneſſe,</hi> as the word
(<hi>Tegnatha</hi>) may ſeeme properly to ſignifie, <hi>viz.</hi> to
goe thither, and not to returne or be quiet, till it had
done the worke for which it was ſent; untill it had
over-runne, and utterly overthrowne that whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>And O who knowes whether the Lord hath given
ſuch a Charge to this Sword of his which is now come
amongſt us? The Sword it ſelfe, that is unſheathed,
and drawne; I, but the <hi>Charge,</hi> the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> which
it bringeth with it, that is as yet in part <hi>ſealed.</hi> The
<hi>Lambs Booke</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> it was <hi>ſealed</hi> with <hi>ſix
ſeales,</hi> Rev. 6. which were not to be opened all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:124124:9"/>
but one after another, ſome of them not yet
opened. Wee may ſay the like of this <hi>Commiſſion</hi>
which the Sword hath brought with it, <hi>God hath ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it with divers ſeales,</hi> ſome whereof are opened al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
in thoſe ſad effects and conſequences which
it hath already produced; but who knowes what is
yet behind? How farre the Sword hath already gone,
and what it hath done, we ſee or heare of; but how
farre it may yet goe, how long it ſhall continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, what execution it ſhall doe, who can tell?
Certainely the <hi>Charge</hi> which God hath given it, it
will obſerve, and who ſhall ſay unto it, bee quiet?
how ſhall it be oppoſed? how ſhall it be ſtayed?</p>
            <p>Alas, in this caſe, all carnall wayes and meanes,
whether <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Policie,</hi> will be to little, to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
If God have given the Sword a charge againſt
<hi>Aſhkelon,</hi> it is not all their Land forces, their <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires</hi>
and <hi>fortifications,</hi> that ſhall keepe it from entring.
If he hath given it a charge againſt the <hi>Sea-coaſts,</hi> it
is not all their Navall ſtrength, their <hi>wooden-walles,</hi>
their Sea Forces, ſhall be able to keepe it off. If hee
hath given it a charge to goe through a Land, it is not
an Armie of <hi>Anakims,</hi> or <hi>Zanzummims,</hi> ſuppoſe
every one a <hi>Goliath,</hi> that ſhall be able to ſtop the courſe
of it.</p>
            <p>This I ſpeake, not to diſhearten, or diſcourage any,
in theſe times of common danger, from uſing any
lawfull wayes and meanes, for the ſecuring of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or the places where they live from forraigne,
or home-bred outrages. This we may doe, this we
ought to doe. But withall know we, that when we
have done what we can doe, yet, if the Sword come

In the feare of God then, let us no longer delude or
flatter our ſelves, ſuffer not <hi>vaine thoughts to lodge

probable hopes, or carnall confidences whatever.
Think not to ſay, the Sword is yet a farre off, in the
remote parts of the Kingdome; Alas, we ſee, or heare
what progreſſe it hath already made; how like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it hath runne from one corner of the Land to the
other; how it hath viſited parts as diſtant from the
firſt breaking of it forth, as thoſe wherein we at the
preſent are. And who knoweth whether God hath
given it a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to goe through the Land? If ſo,
be we aſſured it will find a time to viſit us alſo. If the
Sword come to <hi>Aſhkelon,</hi> it can ſoone viſit the <hi>Sea coaſt.</hi>
Feede not our ſelves with <hi>poſſibilities;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor yet with the ſuppoſall of any ſpeciall <hi>ſecurity in

yet, if the Sword have a charge againſt it, all

Aſhkelon, ſaith the Text. <hi>Aſhkelon,</hi> one of
the chiefe Cities of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> if not the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis,</hi>
the <hi>head City,</hi> yet one of the chiefe, an
Imperiall City, the ſeate of their Kings, where they
were wont to keepe their ordinary reſidence. So
much wee may collect from that of the Prophet
<hi>Amos, Amos</hi> 1. 8. where the Lord threatning ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
againſt divers Cities in that Kingdome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other he tells them, that he would <hi>Cut off him
that held the Scepter from</hi> Aſhkelon. There was the
Kings Court; A Royall City, a populous and ſtrong
City, yet the Sword hath a <hi>Charge</hi> againſt it. It is
not the multitude of people, nor yet the ſtrength whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Naturall or Artificiall Fortifications, that
ſhall be able to keepe out the Sword, if the Lord
give it a charge to enter. This is the leſſon which the

the world are very ready to doe. But alas upon what
ground? If God once give the Sword a charge againſt
them, it is not Greatneſſe, it is not Honour, it is not
Eſtate ſhall buy, or beare off the blow. I remember
what the Lord ſaith to <hi>Job</hi> concerning <hi>Behemoth,</hi> the

True, it is put into his hand, but yet not his Sword.
Remember, Man is but the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> the <hi>Executioner</hi>
in this ſervice. Which yet maketh this judgment the
more terrible, becauſe <hi>Man</hi> hath ſo much an hand in

24. 14. <hi>Peſtilence</hi> is Gods owne more Immediate
ſtreake: In warre (though that be his worke alſo,

what the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> ſaith of the <hi>wicked man,</hi> Prov. 12.
10. <hi>The mercies (the tender mercies, the bowels) of
the wicked are cruell.</hi> And if their <hi>Mercies</hi> be <hi>cruell,</hi> how
great is their <hi>Cruelty?</hi> As our Saviour ſaith of the Eye

               <note place="margin">Mat. 6 23.</note> So, if the very bowels (the

how great is <hi>that cruelty?</hi> In this regard it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
warre is the more dreadfull judgement,
more terrible then either <hi>Famine</hi> or <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> both
which ordinarily are attendants upon the <hi>Sword.</hi> Man
hath an hand in the one, not ſo in the other. Yet know
we, and know it to our comfort, man hath not ſo an
hand, but that God hath an hand in it too, I, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

hand of man, as to leave the managing and handling of

God himſelfe the <hi>principall agent,</hi> ruling, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling,
handling that Sword which he puts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

readeth that of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Ezek. 21.
11. Where the Prophet ſpeaking of <hi>that ſharpe

True it is, nothing more hazardous then Warre.

for the quieting and ſtilling of that <hi>Sword,</hi>
which is now abroad in the Kingdome, at leaſt for
the keeping of the dint from our ſelves. <hi>Love to

<hi>Apply we our ſelves to God</hi> for both. The Sword
is his: For the quieting of it, apply we our ſelves

as that hee intended to <hi>make warre</hi> upon
them (ſo much the word ſignifieth, <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Came with one accord to him,</hi> and having made a

There is none of us, but muſt needs take notice
of a like diſpleaſure conceived in Heaven againſt
us of this Nation, God himſelfe being <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
<hi>hoſtily minded</hi> againſt us, <hi>making warre</hi> upon us.
(This he may doe upon, and againſt his owne

vexed his holy Spirit, and therefore was hee turned to
be their enemie, and he fought againſt them,</hi> Iſa. 63. 9.
The like he doth againſt us at this day, having drawne
his Sword already, nay already <hi>Bathed it in blood.</hi>) Now
in this caſe what ſhall wee doe? why, apply wee our

peace with him.</p>
            <p>Not but that wee both may and ought in this
caſe to apply our ſelves unto <hi>Men</hi> alſo, ſeeking in
humble wiſe to them, for the quieting of this
Sword, that it may upon honourable and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
tearmes bee put into the Sheath againe, by
thoſe hands into which at the preſent GOD hath
put it. A motion (as wee underſtand) now
on foote in diverſe parts of the Kingdome, and
accurſed bee hee that ſhall not bee willing to lend
his beſt indeavours to the furtherance of ſo good
a deſigne. This wee may doe, this wee ought to
doe. But alas all this will bee to little purpoſe,
unleſſe peace bee made in Heaven firſt. This
Sword, it is the <hi>Sword of the LORD,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unleſſe hee command it into the Scabbard,
all our <hi>Petitions</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> to men will bee
of little availe. Vnleſſe hee give the word, it is
not all the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Policie</hi> in the world that can
put it up, or make it quiet. However, ſhould it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:124124:15"/>
be perſwaded into the ſheath for a time, yet, unleſſe
Peace be made in Heaven, and that a firme Peace,
it will not abide there, it will be like <hi>Joabs Sword,</hi>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 8. ready to <hi>fall out of the ſheath</hi> alone.
And therefore let it bee the joint deſigne of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of us to ſeeke, and indeavour a <hi>Pacification</hi> in
Heaven, to make peace with God, and that for the

for our ſelves.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Meanes.</note> To which purpoſe (in the firſt place) <hi>Humble
wee our ſelves before that GOD whom wee have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked.</hi>
If any thing will move GOD to put up
his Sword, ſurely it will be this. Man that hath
but any drop of mercy and compaſſion in his bowels,
if his enemie fall downe at his feete, caſt away his
Armes and beg for <hi>Quarter,</hi> ſo ſubmitting himſelfe
wholy to his mercy, if hee may ſhew mercy, hee
will not deny it. Surely, with the LORD our
GOD there is <hi>mercy.</hi> It was <hi>Davids</hi> reaſon why
hee would rather fall into the hands of <hi>GOD</hi> then
of <hi>Man, His mercies are great:</hi> With him there
are bottomleſſe <hi>Bowels</hi> of unexpreſſable, unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
mercy: All the <hi>Mercy</hi> that is to be found dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
through the <hi>Bowels</hi> of all the mercifull Men
and Women in the world, is but a drop, not a drop
to that Ocean. And ſhall wee fall downe before
him, humbling our ſelves at his foote-ſtoole, and
ſhall hee not have compaſſion on us? O try, and ſee
what this courſe will doe. If this will not ſave us,
we are, in the outward appearance, but loſt men and
women; Our condition being ſuch as wee may
well ſay with <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> in that great ſtrait, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
20. 12. <hi>Wee know not what to doe, but our eyes are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thee O LORD.</hi> In this caſe, that we may
prevaile with God, that his Bowels may be ſtirred
with compaſſion towards us, O let us fall downe at
his foot-ſtoole <hi>Humbling</hi> our ſelves in the <hi>Confeſſion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:124124:16"/>
of our owne ſinnes and the ſinnes of the Nation, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the Righteouſneſſe of Gods judgements againſt
us.</hi> This is the way which the LORD puts his
owne people upon, promiſing them that by this
meanes they ſhould be able to divert, and turne the
edge of the Sword. See it, <hi>Levit. 26. 40. If they
ſhall confeſſe the iniquity of their Fathers, with the Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
which they treſpaſſed againſt mee; And that alſo
they have walked contrary unto mee, and that I have
alſo walked contrary unto them,</hi> &amp;c <hi>If then their
uncircumciſed hearts bee humbled, and they then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the puniſhment of their iniquity;</hi> What then?
<hi>Then will I remember my Covenant with</hi> Jocob,
&amp;c. <hi>and I will remember the Land.</hi> Wee heere
ſee both the <hi>Counſell,</hi> and the <hi>promiſe.</hi> Take wee
the one, and reſt upon the other. Confeſſe wee
our owne ſinnes, with the ſinnes of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
(which GOD by way of temporall
judgements, both in Juſtice may, and often doth
viſit upon Poſterity.) Withall <hi>Accept wee the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of our iniquity,</hi> acknowledging GOD to
be Juſt and Righteous in what ever hee hath
done or ſhall doe againſt us. So doing, doubt
wee not but GOD will yet <hi>Remember his

will yet <hi>remember the Land, returning</hi> and <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
and <hi>leaving a Bleſſing behinde him,</hi> Joel 2 14</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thus Humbling our ſelves for thoſe

the Cauſes of this Evill, Indeavour wee (in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

wee cannot expect that the ſtorme of GODS
wrath ſhould ceaſe, or the growen Sea of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
diſtempers amongſt us ſhould be quieted. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of us then indeavour this great worke; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerving our <hi>stations.</hi> Publick perſons in their
places, and private perſons in theirs. Every
one beginning at home, at his owne heart, owne
life. See what is to bee found there that may
bee charged with the maintenance of this preſent
Warre; and finding it out, diſcharge it: Which having
done,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Then (in the next place) <hi>Strike wee a
New Covenant with our GOD.</hi> Certainely, they
have not beene much miſtaken who have both
thought and ſaid, <hi>That it is a Covenant buſineſſe which
the Sword cometh about.</hi> I meane not ſo much the
<hi>Formality,</hi> as the <hi>Reality</hi> of a <hi>Covenant.</hi> To <hi>avenge
an Old Covenant</hi> which hath bene broken, to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a New Covenant</hi> which may be kept. And is
it this that the Sword cometh about? Why let
us, in the feare of GOD, give it what it would
have, that it may depart from us. Every of us
in our particulars bewaile our frequent breaches of
former Covenants, made in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> renewed in
the <hi>Supper of the LORD:</hi> and this day ſtrike wee
a <hi>New Covenant</hi> with and before the LORD:
Withall indeavouring (as much as in us lyeth)
the renewing of a <hi>Nationall Covenant,</hi> that the
whole Kingdome may be bound and engaged to a
Cloſer <hi>cleaving to the LORD,</hi> and walking
with him, in an <hi>univerſall ſubjection to all his
Ordinances, an univerſall obedience to all his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:124124:17"/>
Surely this will bee found the beſt, and onely
way to procure mercy (if it may bee) for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
However, it will be a ſure way to procure
ſecurity, and ſafety to our ſelves; either to keepe
off the Sword, that it ſhall not come nigh us, not
touch us. It is <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his ſpeech in <hi>Job,</hi> Job 5.
15. <hi>The LORD ſaveth the Poore from the Sword.]
The Poore;</hi> what the <hi>Worlds Poore,</hi> ſuch as are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<hi>Poore?</hi> Not ſo, (alas, they are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made a forlorne hope, ſacrificed to the fury of
the Sword, to dull, and blunt the edge of it:) But
<hi>GODS Poore, the Poore in Spirit,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themſelves before the LORD,</hi> (as the Geneva
gloſſe explaines it.) Or if it doe touch us, yet it
ſhall not hurt us. It ſhall be unto us but as our <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Fathers Red Horſe,</hi> (ſo it is called in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
Chap. 6. ver. 4.) ſent by him to bring
us home to himſelfe; to convey us into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, For which (in the fourth and laſt
place, to cloſe up all, time and ſtrength being
ſpent) having done as afore-ſaid, then <hi>Let us make
the LORD our truſt.</hi> Another meanes, and a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
one, to ſecure us from the <hi>Sword, To truſt in
GOD.</hi> Not in <hi>Man:</hi> not in <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Policie.</hi>
Theſe wee may uſe, but truſt not in them; Which
if wee doe, it will be the next way to betray us.
It is that which the LORD threatens againſt the
<hi>Jewes,</hi> Jer. 5. 15, 17. <hi>Loe I will bring a Nation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you from farre,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And they ſhall impoveriſh
(or Plunder) thy fenced Cities wherein thou tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtedſt,
with the Sword.</hi> The next way to have a
Kingdome, a City, a Towne ſacked, and plundered,
is to truſt in the ſtrength of it. But make wee the
LORD our ſtrength, our truſt. So doing (if good
for us) hee will ſecure us, wee ſhall not feele of
the Sword, or not fall by it. It is that which the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:124124:17"/>
LORD promiſeth to <hi>Ebedmelech,</hi> Jerem. 39. 8.
<hi>I will ſurely deliver thee, and thou ſhalt not fall by the
Sword:</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe thou haſt put thy truſt in mee,
ſaith the LORD.</hi> What he there promiſeth to him
in particular, <hi>David</hi> upon the ſame ground in Gods
Name promiſeth to all Gods people, <hi>Pſalm. 37.
ver.</hi> ult. <hi>The LORD ſhall deliver them from the
wicked, and ſave them, becauſe they truſt in him.</hi>
No ſuch way to engage GOD to worke delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
for us in any ſtrait, as this, <hi>To truſt in him.</hi>
This will <hi>David</hi> doe in his greateſt ſtraites, when
<hi>The foundations were deſtroyed,</hi> (as hee ſpeaketh,
<hi>Pſalm. 11. 3.) or out of courſe,</hi> all things out of
courſe in the Kingdome, ſo as ſeemingly there was
little hope of ſafety left for <hi>David;</hi> his <hi>Enemies</hi>
by way of <hi>inſulting,</hi> or his <hi>Friends</hi> by way of <hi>advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi>
they <hi>ſaid unto his ſoule, Flye yee as a Bird to your
Mountaine,</hi> ver. 1. willing him to betake himſelfe,
and his Family, to ſome place of ſecurity, and no
longer to reſt upon the promiſe; but what courſe
doth he reſolve to runne? Why, <hi>In the LORD
put I my truſt,</hi> ver. 1. The caſe at preſent is ours:
The <hi>Foundations</hi> in this Kingdome are <hi>out of courſe,</hi>
the dreadfull Commotions in it threatning ruine to
it. In this caſe <hi>Carnall reaſon</hi> will be dictating, and
ſuggeſting unto us, as they to him, <hi>Flye wee as a
Bird to our Mountaine,</hi> &amp;c. Seeke we out ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Refuge</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> for our ſelves, and ours. But
truſt we not to this counſell. <hi>In the Lord put wee our
truſt:</hi> ſo doing, doubt not of ſecurity. It is <hi>Davids</hi>
ſpeech, which he ſpake out of his owne experience,
and I ſhall conclude with it: <hi>The Lord is a Buckler to
all thoſe which truſt in him,</hi> Pſal. 18. 30.</p>
