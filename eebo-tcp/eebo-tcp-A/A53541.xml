         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Extravagant
POET.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>Pon a certain
time, as I
went out of
my <hi>Lodging</hi>
in a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with a
deſign to go
a Walking, meerly for a little
Divertiſement, and to paſs away
a few Melancholly Love-fits; it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31072:3"/>
was my Fortune, to light into a
little blind Tavern; and being ſet
down upon a Bench, I began to
ſay to my ſelf (after a languiſhing
manner, with a deep and far-fetcht
ſigh): <hi>Ah, my dear</hi> Colombine, <hi>thou
art the only Object of my Affections,
and ever ſhall be ſo, in ſpight of all
the rigour of my hard fate.</hi> But
having no ſooner uttered theſe
words, but the Boy of the Houſe
(who heard me ſpeak ſuch words
as theſe) began to take me for a
Poet; and asked me, Whether I
were not an Acquaintance of ſuch
a Perſon, who did very often Eat
at that Houſe? And withal told
me, That he had made moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Verſes: of which, he told
me, That he had given him a very
fine one to preſent to his Miſtriſs:
And ſo, as ſoon puts a paper, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
enough, into my hand, which
lookt as if it had been bound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Bacon; but with this charge,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31072:3"/>
That I ſhould not Foul it. So ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it into my hand, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it, I found it to be an Elogy
upon a General of the Army:
which made me as ſoon to Reply,
(without any ſhew of Laughter
to the Boy, whoſe name was <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caret)</hi>
That thoſe Verſes were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
agreeable to the ſubject that
they were compoſed for; and
that (without all doubt) they
were the Works of ſome great
Perſonage.</p>
            <p>Yes indeed, replyed <hi>Caſcaret:</hi>
And I will aſſure you, I have a
great deal of kindneſs for him,
and ſhould be very ſorry to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
him in any thing, or to
draw him any Wine that ſhould
be Flat, or Troubled; or any thing
but the very Beſt in the Houſe was
ſtill, and ſo ſhould alwayes be at
his Service.</p>
            <p>All this is very well, I replyed:
But is not this perſon (whom you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31072:4"/>
ſo much applaud) gotten into
your Debt for his Dyet.</p>
            <p>Yes, a little (ſaid the Boy) but
that ſignifies but little; for I have
a very good Pledge for it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I fear it the leſs. And at the
ſame time (by me) pulls out of a
Cupboard, a great bundle of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
in which were written ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Verſes; but the greateſt part ſo
imperfect, and ſo much clothered
or defaced with one thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that one could make very
little Sence of any of them.</p>
            <p>There were Inſcriptions of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things; as namely, An <hi>Elogy</hi>
for <hi>Dorothy;</hi> A <hi>Complaint</hi> of <hi>Damon
a Coeliſte;</hi> A <hi>Crostick</hi> upon the
Name of—An Heroick <hi>Poem</hi>
for Monſieur <hi>Rondeau.</hi> At the
End; <hi>Rimes, Epigrams, Sonnets,
Epithetes, Stanzes, Madrigalls,</hi> and
a many of other things; but not
one of all, that was there, was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed:
But ſome were begun in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31072:4"/>
the Middle, others at the End,
where they ſhould have Finiſhed
their Diſcourſe: All which made
me very much admire the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Poet, and the great
Judgment of <hi>Caſcaret,</hi> the Boy of
the Tavern.</p>
            <p>But (as I was going out of the
Houſe) it was my hap to eſpy
(at a great diſtance in the Street)
a man all alone Talking very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
to himſelf, and ſometimes
Laughing, nodding with his Head,
and ſometimes making Motions
with his Arms; inſomuch, that
few Parts about him were idle. He
was clad in a White-Sattin Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet,
pinck't; his Breeches of
Black Cloath, called <hi>Drap de Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
a <hi>Roupille,</hi> or Upper-Garment,
like a Cloak, was made of a Mask-colour'd
Searge, (made at a Place
in <hi>France,</hi> called <hi>d' Aumale);</hi> a
Gray Hat, called a <hi>Caſtor;</hi> Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Silk Stockins, and a pair of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31072:5"/>
very light Shooes; which made
me for to behold him with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
not knowing what to
judge of ſo ſtrange a Perſonage.
But <hi>Caſcaret,</hi> who had Brought or
Conducted me to the Door, told
me, That that was the Poet, of
whom he had informed me;
which cauſed me for to go in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
to the intent that I might
have a little Conference with
him, becauſe by this time he was
already at the Door: So we Kiſſed
each other. But I found him to
be ſo very troubleſome at that
time, that I could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſpeak two Words together to
him, without an Interruption:
Yet, notwithſtanding all this, I u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all poſſible Means to get my
ſelf acquainted with him, that I
might divert my ſelf a little ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in his Company; for which
cauſe we obliged each other for a
Rendezvouz the next Morning,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31072:5"/>
in the ſame Place: So, both Parties
being agreed, he told me, That
he ſlept but very little, that he
might the better mind the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
of thoſe Works he had
to do, the Compoſition being
great; therefore, he ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Early.</p>
            <p>So coming next Morning to the
Place appointed, I found my Poet
up Early enough, and ſtaying for
me: And ſo, this rare Perſonage
having laid many of his <hi>Galema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys</hi>
upon the Table, upon a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
ſuch as it was, in as great
State as could be, I was Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
into the Room where they
were; but ſeeing them to be of
no greater Value, than thoſe
which I had already ſeen in the
Hands of <hi>Caſcaret,</hi> I thought it
convenient for that time, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
my Thoughts, and to make
inquiry after ſome Verſes, which
would aſſwage the Cruelty of a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31072:6"/>
Cruel Miſtriſs; making the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of an Unhappy and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Lover. Upon which, he
promiſed me, that the ſame Day
before Night, I ſhould not fail to
have them finiſhed in their laſt
Perfection: Telling me withal,
That he was, one of the Nimbleſt
of all <hi>Parnaſſus</hi>'s Diſciples; for he
hath been ſometimes ſo incumbred
with ſo much Buſineſs of this
kind, that to give every one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in a very ſhort time, he hath
been obliged to make many, far
beyond the Imaginations of the
greateſt Potentates: For within
theſe Four Dayes, he had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
above Thirty Thouſand
of all ſorts, which were to be
ſent to great Perſonages, into
ſtrange Countries. And ſo ſwore
by the Faith of a Poet, that I
ſhould receive of him all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
that could be promiſed
by a Perſon, who made the choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31072:6"/>
and beſt Works, that were
to be made: For he wrought by
the ſame Rule and Order, that
the beſt Compoſers, and moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
Authors, both Antient
and Modern, wrought by; and
therefore, when I ſhould know
him well, I would have a very
great Eſteem for him.</p>
            <p>But Hunger called for a Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt;
which was as ſoon called
for, and a Ragou made, that we
might break Faſt together: But
whil'ſt the Poet was a babling
about his Galemafreys, our Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gou
was grown cold: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Poet runs away to the
Kitchin, and brings ſome Fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Shovel; but inſtead of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Fire into the Chafing-Diſh,
he threw it into the Diſh,
to the Meat; which cauſed me
to burſt out into a Laughter. But
he told me, That the great Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
he had in his mind, did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31072:7"/>
him from taking notice of
ſuch ſmall things as this was. So
that, by this firſt Interview that
we had the one with the other,
the Poet gave me many Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of his great Love to me,
without knowing of me: But we
made our Reciprocal Promiſes of
giving one another a Viſit: he gave
me a Note of his Name, and
Place of his Abode, in print; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which we parted at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>But ſome Dayes after, having
a Fantaſie to go to this <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi>
I found his Hoſtis, but not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
who told me, That he was
gone to walk abroad, that he
might ruminate and collect ſome
pretty Fanſies together, for the
Compoſing of a Book of Songs;
for which he was Paid in part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand,
by thoſe that had Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
him. But I anſwered the
Woman; For all that I can ſee, the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31072:7"/>
Works that he makes ought to be
very Excellent, that he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to put them to publick
View, and to paſs the Cenſures
of all Men, without Controul or
Moleſtation. To which ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered;
That there were a great
many good Poets, that were not in
nothing nigh ſo good an Eſteem
as he was; for his Company is
alwayes almoſt every Day deſired,
and ſought after by many honeſt
Men, and thoſe of Faſhion too:
For it is he, that furniſhes the
Blind, and the Lame with all their
New Tunes and Ayres, which
are ſo much praiſed and extolled
in all your Victualling-Houſes, as
well as in your great Taverns,
and other Places of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But as ſhe was going to
tell me more, in comes our Poet;
who with a hundred Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Reverences, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
laſt Point of Impertinent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31072:8"/>
he Conducted me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Chamber; where he made
as many more Ceremonies, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and winding a great many
Papers over, in teſtimony of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Buſineſs upon his
Hands; and that he was as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
about it, as a Poltron, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Cowardly Fellow, that was
very earneſt to go Fight. And
ſo, taking of his Ink-Horn, but
not finding of a Pen at Hand, as
he look't for, he takes a Pen-Knife,
and cuts and points one of
his Nailes, which was of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
Length, reſembling more
the Beak of a Horn, than the
Nail of a Man: This he cleft at
the End, in form of a Pen, and
run it into his Ink-Horn, till he
had made it moiſt; and then
takes out a piece of Paper, already
made foul, and tumbled; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
writes Five or Six Verſes,
which he very much praiſed and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31072:8"/>
applauded them, in the Reading
of them over and over ſeveral
times. The Firſt of which was
this, ſo near as I do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Charmante, mais ſier Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</l>
               <l>Thou Charmeſt me, but O Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Sister!</l>
            </q>
            <p>So, ſeeing no Hopes of getting
any thing better from this my
<hi>Extravagant Poet,</hi> I took his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and bid him the Good Night;
and ſo went away ſtraight to my
Lodging: But being arrived at
my Lodging, I was much aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to find my Poet there as ſoon
as my ſelf, quite out of Breath,
and blowing as if he had been out
of is Wits, puffing, and looking
as if he had been a Book-Seller,
that had loſt his Book; his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31072:9"/>
was ſo very great, making
all the Petitions and Requeſts, that
might be, to me, that I would
but give him the Paper again
that he had given me, to copy
out ſome Verſes of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
which were written on
the Back-Side of my Paper, which
he had Compoſed for me: Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
me, That it was impoſſible
for him ever to get them into his
Memory again, if once raſed out
thence. So, conſidering his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Importunity, I granted his
Requeſt, and gave him his Paper
again: But as ſoon as he once had
gotten it into his Hands again,
it was impoſſible for me to be
gone from him, he did ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
me with one thing or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
one time with the ſtrange
Strength of Imagination, or elſe
all was loſt that he had ſo long
and often occupied his Senſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and a deal of ſuch like
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31072:9"/>
Stuff. But as I had read in the
Paper, that he was ſo very much
troubled about, and found the
thing that he ſo much wanted, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to begin thus:</p>
            <l>Le beau berger Philemon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Or in Engliſh:</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Philemon,</hi> the brave Shepherd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>So that, by This, &amp; what I had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from his <hi>Hoſtis,</hi> obliged me
to believe him to be a new Bridge
<hi>Poet,</hi> which was almoſt capable of
making me break my Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with him; and to rally no
more with him, and his Folly; as
finding him to be none of what I
expected him, that is to ſay, an
Author of ſome Fame and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
But yet however, for
my Humors ſake, I was reſolved
to make him ſome Viſits, although
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31072:10"/>
it was but for Divertiſement:
Thereby hoping, that what by the
Sight and Diſcourſe of him, I
might find a Remedy againſt ſome
Fits of the Melancholly, which I
was very ſubject to; ſo that, when
I was minded to divert my ſelf a
little, I might make my Poet's
Lodgings ſerve me inſtead of an
Academy: the which, I did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often, for thoſe Reaſons above
ſaid. But by Chance coming one
Morning, and finding of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Door,
as it were by the Latch,
I went in without knocking, he
being ſtill in his Bed; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my Approaches near to his
Bed-ſide, perceiving his Eyes to
be wide open, I gave him a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
with a <hi>Good Morrow, Sir;</hi>
and ſo ſet my ſelf down upon a
lame Stool, that ſtood by his Beds-Head,
waiting when he would
return me any Anſwer; and ſo,
ſtaying above half an Hour by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31072:10"/>
him, without his perceiving of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one to be by him; making
it my only Delight, in watching
of his Motions to hear him mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
and mutter ſome Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Teeth, not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
at all; and then again,
ſometimes he would ſqueeze out
a Noiſe much like unto a Swarm
of <hi>Bees,</hi> coming out of their Hives
in a Confuſion: but yet betwixt
whiles, I could hear a Voyce a
little more Intelligible; but after
ſuch a Broken Faſhion, that there
was not the leaſt Order or Method
in any Subject that he ſpake of;
yet he would ſometimes ſpeak (it
may be) two or three Words to
ſome very good Sence, fetched
from ſome, as good Sentences:
but as ſoon again quitting of that
Subject, and entring into another.
<hi>This</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>may very well paſs,
and take its Turn upon the Theatre.</hi>
But as ſoon he Contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31072:11"/>
and ſayes: <hi>But, What will or
ſhall I do, or not do?</hi> And again,
with another Contradiction, he
ſayes: <hi>And, Why not? My Veins
are ſtrong enough: And, What Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Fervency is there to be ſeen in
another, that is not in me? Or,
What do you find more, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
in any of all theſe, than in
my ſelf? As namely, theſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
<hi>De Corneille, de L'Eſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ille,
de La Serre, Boyer, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac,
Beys, Deſportes, Molierr,
Hardy, Malherbe, La Calprene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
Ronſard, de Ouvillr, Boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robert,
Chevalier Montfleury,
Triſtau, Bourſault, Scudry, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
Racyne, Boileau, de Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligny;</hi>
and many others, whoſe
Compoſitions or Works ſerves only
to be gazed at by Five or Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Perſons at a time; who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Place, in the</hi> Hoſtel de Bourgogn,
<hi>or elſewhere;</hi> (which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31072:11"/>
ſome great Houſe, which
now ſerves for a Play-Houſe) <hi>and
mine, which are produced with no
leſs Boldneſs and Courage than theſe,
and will draw no fewer Spectators,
than all Paſſengers; although they
were ſo many in number, that a good
large Park would have much ado to
hold them all. Therefore, come let
us put all to the Hazard; put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
our Deſerts, and we may be
admired by all: For I will ſooner
lye down, and Dye, than not to have
my Name appear in Red Letters,
in the Corners of every Street; as
well as any of all theſe, ſo very much
eſteemed Authors, which are ſo much
boaſted of in the World. Come, I
have employed ſo many Years alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in the Compoſing of Strains, and
the Songs of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> But as it is the
uſual Saying, Paris</hi> was not all
built in one Day; <hi>therefore, come
this may ſerve very well for a Piece
of Three Acts. However, not ſo
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31072:12"/>
now; for we must ſuffer one to be
a little Ridiculous, and to make Sport:
But theſe others are Heroical; and
therefore, proper to be inſerted in
ſome Great Work. Thoſe there, are</hi>
Alexandrians; <hi>and therefore, ſtrong
enough. But let us ſee, what we
ſhall do; but look here, this cannot
be bad for a Satyr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſpake all theſe Words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
touching any one bit of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
making only ſome Signs with
his Fingers; with which he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
touch'd his Fore-head ſo
hard, as if he had been going to
cleave his Brains aſunder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But having ended his Diſcourſe,
he pulls out a Tinder Box from
under his Beds-Head, with which
he ſtruck Fire, and lighted a Wax-Candle,
or Size: But it ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that a little Spark of Fire
fell on his Hand, and burnt him
a little, with which he let all fall
to the ground: But I ſtooped to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31072:12"/>
take up his Light, and gave it to
him into his hand; but in ſo
doing, I perceived him to be a
little ſurprized at the Sight of me;
by which means I came to know,
that he had thought himſelf all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in his Chamber, all this time:
But ſo ſoon as he perceived me to
be there, he begun to ask me,</hi> What I
made there ſo late in his Quarters? <hi>I
told him again,</hi> That I needed but to
go to Bed, to make it Early in the
Morning; for it is but just now the
Clock hath ſtruck Seven: Beſides, the
Day being ſo much advanced, I am
ſubject to admire you, for looking
after any other Light; being aſſured,
that you cannot doubt, but that the
one Light, will infallibly extinguiſh
the other. You are in the right of
it, <hi>(ſayes the Poet);</hi> but this may
ſerve to ſeal my Letters, when I have
written them; therefore, pray let him
burn, and not put him out. But
tell me, I pray, what it was, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31072:13"/>
moved you to come hither into this
Place? I do believe, you know your
Friend to be Ungrateful, and that
ſhe acts the Rude, becauſe you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to pleaſe her too well; making
her too much diſcourſe of Loves Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures;
ſo that, you have furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her (it may be) with ſo much,
that ſhe hath or will Compoſe a great
<hi>Romance</hi> of your Flaeurettes: But
if ſhe had but been an Apprentice
in my Science a little, ſhe might
have been perſwaded to have Sighed
a little, and have ſhed ſome Tears,
although but faintly: For we ſhould
ſpeak ſome few Words, and make
them but a very eaſie ſhew of our
Motion towards them; and ſcarcely
give Permiſſion to thoſe that would
Careſs us, to let us paſs amongſt Women
for Babblers; although we ſeem to
be very Eloquent, and ſtudy to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, and
ſeemingly to have our Spirits occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
but in a very light and tender
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31072:13"/>
Paſſion; nor make ſhew of Abiding,
but for a moment of time, and not
ſerve them with a too long Diſcourſe,
accompanyed with Emphaſis. This I
have learnt to my Coſt; for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity,
that I have uſed ſometimes to
my Miſtriſs, hath rendered me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unhappy in my Love.</p>
            <p>She that I loved ſo dearly, <hi>(con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
my Poet)</hi> was a little mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Grig, who gave me many a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal,
or Nightly Aſſignment,
where I alwayes came; but never
could have the Power to come to
her, or joyn with her; for ſhe ſtaid
alwayes in her Chamber, and I up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Pavements; where very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
times I have received ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill Influences upon my Body by the
Neighbourhood; who probably took
me for the Conveyance of a Houſe
of Office, and ſo emptyed all their
Chamber-Pots upon me: Do but ſee,
how my Cloaths are accommodated
with it, <hi>(ſayes he, ſhewing me a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31072:14"/>
great Spot with his Finger, that
was in his Cloak, which hung
one part of it upon a Chair of
Straw, and the other part upon
the Floor):</hi> And as I went to take
a Turn round this Cartaw-Lodgings,
I could get nothing; for it ſhould
ſeem, the Place was accuſtomed to
receive all ſuch kind of Filth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I had often a Deſigne of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
my ſelf, and ſo to leave her:
Well knowing, by a thouſand of theſe
Tricks, which were very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to me, that it was altogether
impoſſible for me to gather a Roſe,
that was ſo environed about with
Prickles.</p>
            <p>So, feeling in his Pocket, he
pulls out a little tiny Box, which
I imagining to have been his Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Box:
I told him, <hi>That his
Candle was ſtill burning;</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hearkening to me at all, he
opens his Box, and pulls out a
ſhort Pipe, as Black as the <hi>Devil,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:31072:14"/>
and fills it with Tobacco, lights
it; and ſo, approaching to me
in this manner, he blows ſuch a
thick Smoke of his Tobacco in my
Face, that I had much ado to ſee
him: His Face was ſo beſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
alſo with the ſame Perfume.
And then he told me, That he
would compare his Miſtriſs to his
Pipe; reciting this Subject of
Tobacco, in theſe following Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Do but ſee how the Candle riſes</l>
               <l>The Tobacco that I will burn:</l>
               <l>And let my Thoughts go free;</l>
               <l>And ſhe participate of my Eaſe.</l>
               <l>The Air which ſerv'd me for a match—</l>
               <l>And of my Pipe to make a Flambeau;</l>
               <l>Which, to my Tast, ſeems to be Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſia.</l>
               <l>And in the Smoke, which I do make,</l>
               <l>I do divert my Fantaſie.</l>
               <l>Imagining it to make a Thouſand
Pourtraitures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:31072:15"/>
                  <hi>Phillis,</hi> like Tobacco I eſteem you;</l>
               <l>With both I have been ſurprized:</l>
               <l>For both of you reign over my Spirits:</l>
               <l>Of both I am become your Victim.</l>
               <l>But if you will ſettle this a little
ſtronger;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Phillis,</hi> I will not have all the Fault,</l>
               <l>Of quitting the Ardure of my Pipe.</l>
               <l>Your Eyes have giv'n me the Treſpaſs;</l>
               <l>And in the Flambeau of my Pipe,</l>
               <l>I will extinguiſh all your Charms.</l>
            </q>
            <p>You uſe then to take this kind
of Perfume, (ſayes I to him.)
Yes, (replyes he) and I am ſo
accuſtomed to this Smoke, that
once upon a time, wanting To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
I was forc'd to cut the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of my Pocket, that ſmelled
of it, and to fill my Pipe with it.
But I had rather take it alone in
my Chamber, than amongſt a
Company of Coal-Carriers, and
Porters, in Places where they do
diſpoſe of themſelves; which, one
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31072:15"/>
may, by good Right, call it a <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of Fens,</hi> or <hi>Rendezvouz of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds,</hi>
which do aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in this Place of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,
where Rudeneſs ſerves
for an Ornament to a Ruſtick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Black Fellows, in their
Melancholly Debauches, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
themſelves, in order to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the beſt and propereſt Hour
to go, and (as they ſay) beat the
Pavements; which is, as we ſay,
go a <hi>Padding,</hi> or <hi>Pilfering.</hi> Theſe
(ſayes he) are a certain ſort of
Men, which are much of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Owles;</hi> which care not to
be ſeen abroad at any time, but in
the Night.</p>
            <p>But, Are not you afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Robbed, in going into this
Foreſt, (then ſaid I to him?) No,
(replyed he) I rather fear the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſome of my Bones broken by
theſe Thieves, for not having that
about me, which may give them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31072:16"/>
Content. But in a word, I had
rather take my Tobacco in my
Chamber, where I can ſmoke with
Honour, and without Fear: For
which Cauſe, I learnt the other
Day an Air, which was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be ſung in ſuch ſorts of
Aſſemblies: I have never put it
in uſe yet; but it is good enough;
and hear it.</p>
            <q>
               <l>We are Swallowers of good Beer,</l>
               <l>Which, with Tobacco of a Thouſand
ſorts,</l>
               <l>We turn the Barrel upſide down;</l>
               <l>Which gives us a full Cariere.</l>
               <l>Fye upon thoſe, that drink by halves;</l>
               <l>But thoſe that will be drunk, are our
Friends.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But his Favours ſtill continuing
to me, he ſhews me a Manuſcript,
which lay upon his Table; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Take this, and go ſit you
down by yonder Window, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31072:16"/>
your ſelf, whil'ſt I am buſy
in deviſing of ſome Thing of
worth: it will be worth your
Reading; and ſo we may be both
imployed. So I took the Paper:
and when I had opened it, I found
in it as followeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>THeodore</hi> was a Young Man,
of a Family good enough;
and the Wiſdom of his younger
Years made ſhew of no leſs Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31072:17"/>
to thoſe that had the Charge
of his Education; and that they
hoped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all their Labour and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
would have a happy End: For
which Cauſe, all honeſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
were uſed. But the Youth
had no ſooner attained to the Age
of Sixteen Years, but he began
to change his Mind, and to take
other Meaſures, than thoſe of his
Tutor, and to frequent lewd and
debauch't Company; and amongſt
theſe, he found out one, who
went by the Name of <hi>Rondrille,</hi> a
very Felon, or Thief, who made
it his buſineſs to go a Pilfering in
the Night, in the Streets: And
on the <hi>New-Bridge,</hi> and elſe-where
in <hi>Paris,</hi> this Thief made ſhew, as
if he had known this Youth in the
Army in <hi>Catalogne,</hi> and ſaluted
him by the Name of <hi>de La Breeche:</hi>
To which the Youth anſwered
very freely, That he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
to be taken for one, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31072:17"/>
had been ſeen in any Noble Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or to paſs for any ſuch Man.
But all this time, he leaſt thought,
that theſe Fellows were only the
Searchers of good Fortunes; and
that their Buſineſs was only, how
to draw him into their Cabal, by
entertaining him at ſeveral Feaſts
and Entertainments, to bring him
into Love with their Company,
that he might taſte of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of their vitious, debauch't,
and unregulated Lives.</p>
                        <p>For this purpoſe, they had a
luſty Fellow, but lame, whoſe
Name was <hi>Ruſtaut;</hi> one, who had
ſerved in the Company of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
This Man being a reſolute
Perſon, was, by common Conſent,
made their Protector; who, ſo
ſoon as he ſaw <hi>Theodore,</hi> called
for <hi>Bondrille,</hi> and asked him, If
that Youth were in the Humor
to be Enrolled in their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?
To which <hi>Bondrille</hi> made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31072:18"/>
That according to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
that he had already ſeen
in him, he thought, that he much
deſired it, as being (as he thought)
a little in love with it: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this is a New Pigeon; and
therefore, may do well to be put
into the Flight, amongſt the reſt.
Then pray, (ſayes <hi>Ruſtaut)</hi> take
you care, that he be well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
for he ſeems to be a Youth
of good Faſhion; and I hope, in
time, to do ſomething that is good
with him. So <hi>Ruſtaut</hi> turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
towards the Youth, Saluted
him with a Civility agreeable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
So the next Morning,
being the Day of their Aſſembly,
<hi>Ruſtaut</hi> prayed him to be with
them, to break his Faſt in <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaut</hi>'s
Lodgings; which <hi>Theodore</hi>
(for we will leave for a time, to
call him by the Name of <hi>de La
Breeche)</hi> promiſed him to do: And
ſo accordingly, he came with <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drille</hi>
                           <pb n="33" facs="tcp:31072:18"/>
to <hi>Ruſtaut</hi>'s Lodgings; where
they found him as a Preſident,
ſitting in the midſt of a many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well liking Perſonages, and
ſeeming to be of very good Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
who talked to him with Hat
in Hand, giving of him Reaſons of
all that he demanded of them:
And at the ſame time, they put
many things into his Hands, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
which was both Gold and
Silver of divers ſorts; ſome of the
Pieces being of your light or
falſe Money; which <hi>Ruſtaut</hi> did
not much queſtion, nor trouble
himſelf to put it to a Tryal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he knew, that his Emiſſaries
did receive it, without looking
on it; and therefore, they were
not obliged to give it him, as ſuch
as had been put to the Teſt.</p>
                        <p>So preſently, they begin to talk
of other Buſineſs, and of their
Trade, and how to excite one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to go forward in ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:31072:19"/>
a piece of Work, whereof e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one was not capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
it. But the Table
being covered, every one began
at the ſame time; and in order
to let their Hands, their Eyes,
and Teeth to keep time alike; ſo
they all began to drink a Health
to the right Owners or Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of what they were eating of:
For, as it is to be gueſs'd at, it
was all ſtollen Goods; therefore,
it was all one whom they drank
to. But, in the Height of their
Combat in <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s Cauſe, they
were interrupted, not with Pots
and Glaſſes, of which there were
enough; but by a Burger, who
addreſt himſelf to <hi>Ruſtaut,</hi> with a
Note from an unknown Hand:
And this is the Tenor of the
Note.</p>
                        <floatingText type="letter">

                              <head>The Note that came to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaut,
from an unknown
Hand, &amp;c.</head>
                              <p>THe Bearer of this Note, is a
Worthy Perſon, and one who
deſerves to be obliged; and
I dare promiſe you, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
you well, after he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Favour from you, which I
demand of you for him; which is,
to put him again (by your Care) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Poſſeſſion of a Cloak of Black
<hi>Spaniſh-Cloath,</hi> laced with Black
Silk Lace, and an Emrald ſet in a
Gold-Ring; and about fifteen Francks
in Money, which was taken from him
about Nine a Clock last Night, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Bridge of <hi>Noſterdame,</hi> or
our Ladyes-Bridge. This I pray you,
not to fail me in: And then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
your ſelf, although I paſs with
you for an unknown Perſon; yet I am
capable of Serving, or Refuſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </body>

But when <hi>Rustaut</hi> had made an
end of Reading his Letter, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to ſtand, and muſe a little
by himſelf; imagining, that this
<hi>Burgor</hi> might, by ſome Subtilty
or other, have invented and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
this Note himſelf, only after
the Report of the Vulgar, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
People; or elſe ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
People might be commanded
to ſtop the Thieves, and would
not, as favouring their Actions,
in hopes to ſhare the Cake with
them. But on the other ſide, he
thought it a great Preſumption of
this <hi>Burgor,</hi> to throw himſelf, like
a loſt Body, into the middle of
his Enemies, without being back't
or ſet on by ſome great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Might and Strength:
Beſides, he conſidered, that it
might be a dangerous thing, to
make a Diſcovery in ſuch a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
as this; and if ſo it might
happen, that he might come to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31072:20"/>
thoſe that ſhould be ordered to
carry them to the Priſon, and
from thence to the Bar, to be
forc'd to beg their Pardon, or their
Lives; and to careſs ſometimes
thoſe that ſought only the Means
to take them at the greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and betray them at one
time or other, and cauſe them
early or late, to fall into the Paws
of the Woolf, ſuch as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
their Sheep.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Diverſities of Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
put <hi>Ruſtaut</hi> into a ſtrange
Perplexity of Spirit, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
But, at the laſt, in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Old Woman, which
gave a Wax-Candle to St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi>
and (at the ſame time) gave
another to the <hi>Devil;</hi> anſwering
thoſe that asked her, why ſhe
did ſo, <hi>To get me a Friend in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and another in Hell.</hi> So he
was reſolved in all he could, to
keep the Note, ſooner than all his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31072:21"/>
other Doubts; and ſo took a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of rather ſerving an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Perſon, than (at length)
to run the hazard of knowing
him ſo well: And ſo, turning
himſelf about to the <hi>Burgor,</hi> told
him, although but ſoftly; <hi>We may
do you reaſon to the Two first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
comprized in your Demands;
but for the Third, it is only Wine
for the Company; and therefore,
Silver-Mony is never found amongſt
us, in caſe of a Reſtitution. I ſhall
very freely forgive my Mony,</hi> (ſayes
the <hi>Burgor) with all my Heart</hi> (to
<hi>Ruſtaut,</hi> for Joy of the Hopes that
was given him, of having the reſt
of his Things again) <hi>and yet my
Mony ſhall be but (as it were) a
taste of the Thankfulneſs, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make you. Then go</hi> (ſayes
<hi>Ruſtaut) about your other Buſineſs,
and come hither again about Two
Hours hence, and you ſhall have your
Deſire; for I will go, and take care
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31072:21"/>
about it. But first, May we not
take Leave to drink a Health to a
Stranger, and then I ſhall go, and
acquit my ſelf of this Buſineſs; and
ſo, <hi>Here's to you;</hi> and you may,
if you pleaſe, do me Reaſon, or
Pledge me.</hi> This being ſaid, he
cauſed two great Glaſſes to be
filled with Wine, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally
emptied: After which,
the <hi>Burgor</hi> pray'd <hi>Ruſtaut</hi> to give
him leave to ſend him in ſome
Bottles of better Wine: But, as
honeſt Men are alwayes ſuſpected
in ſuch Company, <hi>Ruſtaut</hi> deſired
to be excuſed, giving him Thanks.
So the <hi>Burgor</hi> retired, till the Time
appointed was come.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>When the</hi> Burgor <hi>was gone
forth,</hi> Ruſtaut <hi>began to ſpeak
to the whole Band that was
there, after a Majeſtical manner,
ſaying;</hi> Children, Which of you
can give me any Tydings of that
which was last Night, upon the Bridge
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31072:22"/>
of <hi>Noſterdame,</hi> and have not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me an Account of it? <hi>At
which Words, the Intermixed Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
which made ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
Noiſe in that Place, was as
ſoon Converted into as great a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
as if every one had been
ſtruck Dumb, or had loſt their
Tongues; the Guilty not daring
to declare, and the Other fearing
to be accuſed of a Fault they had
not committed; chuſing rather to
be ſilent, than ſpeak, except it
came to be excuſed with a Heat.
But when</hi> Ruſtaut <hi>ſaw that, he
look't as if his Eyes had been all
in a Flame of Fire; and, Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Brims of a Broad Hat,
which he alwayes wore, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Chiding, and ſaid;</hi> Is there
any Raſcal here, that dares afront
me, and coſen his Comrades in this
manner? Where is the <hi>Brigadier?</hi>
So, What Appartment had they Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-day,
for their Quarters? Whom
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31072:22"/>
were they, that had this Side for
their Station? But, What is this
here? But, Will no Body make me
any Anſwer? It must be for all
this, when you have made your ſelves
both Deaf and Dumb, that this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Cloak, and certain Ring, muſt
be found, if the one were already
converted into the Covers of Chairs,
and the other if it were beaten into
Leaves, and thoſe Leaves already
applyed for the Gilding of the Leaves
of ſome Books; yet theſe muſt be
found, and reſtored. And to ſhew
you, Gentlemen, that my Diſcourſe
is not without ground, but that I
have a very good Foundation for
what I ſay, ſee this Note, <hi>(throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Writing down upon
the Table, to them all, ſaying;)</hi>
Gentlemen, This Letter (without all
doubt) was ſent from ſome Body,
whom we ought to give Reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Orders, or elſe we ſhall aſſuredly
be forc't to pay for the Prize that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31072:23"/>
we have taken: Wherefore, pray
think of our Preſervation betimes,
and the Preſervation of the Goods
of Violence from all ſuch as may put
a Scandal upon us, and our Society.
<hi>With that, up riſes</hi> Bondrille, <hi>and
another called</hi> Brindeſtoc, <hi>and goes
immediately out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
without ſpeaking one word
in Obedience to the Commands
of</hi> Rustaut; <hi>which did but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſurprize our Youth</hi> La Breeche,
<hi>to ſee a Man, who could ſcarcely
go without the Help of his Staff,
make thoſe tremble at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
who could make others Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop
at the Sight of them, for very
Fear.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With that, ſo ſoon as they were
gone out, <hi>Ruſtaut</hi> addreſt himſelf
to <hi>La Breeche,</hi> ſaying; That that
Perſon, which was gone out with
<hi>Bondrille,</hi> was the Nimbleſt, and
and moſt Activeſt Man, in all
the whole Company, and brought
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31072:23"/>
in much Profit into our Society:
For, in the Markets, he will coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
the Country-Man; and in
the Hall, a Practitioner; that is,
amongſt the Lawyers, he is clad
like a Student; and when amongſt
the Great Ones, he is cloathed
like a Gentleman: But in any of
theſe Places, he ſeldom miſcarries.
For if he ſees any thing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
or fit for his purpoſe, his Hand
is upon it as ſoon as his Eyes have
diſcovered; and if he doth but
lay his Clutches on it, he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
brings his Prey along with
him. He will furniſh his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
with Blades for their Swords,
which he buyes for nothing; for
if he comes to a Cutlers with an
empty Scabbard by his Side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
will be ſure to have one, whil'ſt
the Cutler is looking for another
to ſhew him: And ſo likewiſe, it is
his Cuſtom too in Mens Lodgings:
and if he finds no Body in his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31072:24"/>
way, he will take up that which
he thinks to be the Beſt; then
bidding them very ſoftly Farewel.
And ſo, with a wonderful Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity;
and not like ſome, that
ſleeps upon the Brink of a Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice;
or as ſome others, that
will rather flye with all Might and
Main, as far from the Danger as
they can, which makes them to
be look't upon as Thieves. But,
on the contrary, when he hath
marched ſome Thirty Paces very
modeſtly with his Booty, inſtead
of minding his Pace to gain
ground, for fear he ſhould be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
or ſtopped, he will turn
Tail about, and ſet his Face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Place from whence he
came out: And if he ſees any
Body in purſuit of him, he goes
ſoftly up to them, and ſo paſſes
by on the one ſide of them; and
ſo ſaves himſelf, and his Prey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Sometimes, he will put
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31072:24"/>
on a Petty-Coat over his own
Cloaths, a Scarf over his Head,
and a Mask before his Face; and
ſo, in this Diſguiſe, he will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
the <hi>Burgors</hi> in the Streets,
in clear Day; making them pay
him Tribute, as they go along.
Paſſengers, as they go by, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
it to be only a Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt Man and Wife; and
therefore, will not meddle in their
Affairs. He carryed out one Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
two Fancies made of <hi>Oziers,</hi>
and cloathed them in light Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and ſo diſpoſed of them in
the Corner of the Street; and then
went, and demanded a Purſe of a
Man, which as ſoon delivered it;
becauſe (as he ſaid) he could not
hold combat with Three at a time,
which appeared all very ſuitable
to his Sight.</p>
                        <p>One of the Company, called
<hi>Beauliou,</hi> which was lately come
from ſerving the King, under the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31072:25"/>
Diſcipline of a Committee, began
to inform <hi>Rustaut,</hi> That there
were many of the Brotherhood,
which he could not ſee; asking,
Where they were? To which he
anſwered him thus: Thy very
good Friend, <hi>La Boline,</hi> being ſo
well known in the Town for a
<hi>Boulineux,</hi> he is gone to Range
the Country, with a deſigne of
changing his Calling, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
himſelf to Play; for he is the
moſt Subtle of the Hand. But,
as it is alwayes a Truth, that the
Affairs of a Man cannot alwayes
proſper, or ſtand in the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as they are in when we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
them: So it is fallen out
here of late: For, within theſe
few Dayes laſt paſt, it was his
Fortune to take ſome certain Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Gold out of a Cup of a
Church-Mans, pretending only to
have changed them for a leſs: But
he was Coffered up, or Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31072:25"/>
in true <hi>Engliſh;</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all that he could alleadge
for himſelf, that the Church was
a Refuge for Sinners, and the
like. <hi>La Forest,</hi> and <hi>Du Buiſſon,</hi>
after they had a little while uſed
the High-Wayes about <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
and there-abouts, had the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to be hurt at the Croſs of
the Shooters, and are ſince dead
of their Wounds, (that is, they
are Hanged, and ſo Dead.) <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuin
la Jeuneſſe,</hi> and <hi>La Fleur</hi> are
gone to Fence againſt the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Sea, with Wooden-Swords;
(that is, they are gone
to the Galleys.) I underſtand you
now, (ſayes <hi>Beaulieu)</hi> for you will
ſay, They are gone to take my
Place. But for the following of
St. <hi>John,</hi> St. <hi>Charles,</hi> and St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
la Balaffre,</hi> (replyed <hi>Ruſtaut)</hi>
they are Martyred with the Blows
given them with the Knees, and
are inchaſed at the Chyrurgeons;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31072:26"/>
(that is, being Martyred with the
Knees: It is a Cuſtom in <hi>France,</hi>
when a Man is Hanged, that he
may be quickly out of his Pain,
the Hangman thumps him on the
Breaſt with his Knees; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inchaſed, they were begged
for Anatomies; and this is the
Meaning of it.) And <hi>La Ramce</hi>
was called aſide, and ty'd from
his Meat in <hi>England:</hi> But, as they
were leading him out towards
<hi>Tyburn,</hi> which is the Place of
Execution out of the City of
<hi>London:</hi> This Fellow believing,
that the People of that Country
were of another Underſtanding,
than that of <hi>France,</hi> he prayed
thoſe that guarded him to this
Fatal Place, that they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to make a Step over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own Country; for he had
ſomething of Conſequence to ſay
to his Father before he dyed; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them to believe, that they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31072:26"/>
ought not to deny any thing to
their Patient: But his Requeſt
was not heard, becauſe he ſpake to
thoſe that were deaf in his Cauſe.
Therefore, (ſayes <hi>Ruſtaut)</hi> there
is nothing more certain than this;
for when the Meaſure is full, it
muſt be emptyed: Our poor
Young Man had by this time made
many a fair Eſcape already; and,
amongſt the reſt, he had the good
Fortune one Evening, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a breaking in through a
Wall, he was immediately beſet
by the Archers of the Guſt, or
the Sheriff's Watch; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
him ſo quickly, that he by
a Subtilty mingled amongſt them;
ſo that they miſtook the one for
the other, ſeizing of their own
Comrades for the Thief, which
they had away towards the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
whilſt he got away, and
made his Eſcape to my Lodging,
&amp; no Body eſpyed him running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31072:27"/>
So I put him into his Bed,
with his Cloaths on, and a Night-Cap
on his Head; whilſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was hal'd to the Priſon-Door,
and well beaten: But when they
found their Miſtake, inſomuch
that they knew the Party in hand
to be one of their own Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
then they began to hunt as
faſt for the Thief, judging him
not to be far off, becauſe they
had not ſeen any Body run away:
ſo they purſu'd their Game too into
my Chamber, where they found
their Man in Bed; whom I told
them, was my Kinſman, and he
was very Sick: And what ſerved
me better than all the reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was
three Porringers of Blood, which
I had ſent for into the Town, the
Blood being ſtill upon the Table;
inſomuch that my Lie paſſed for
a perfect Truth, and the Archers
took it for no leſs; and ſo took
their Leave of me: Telling me
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:31072:27"/>
withal, That if they had not found
the Hat and Cloak lying on the
Ground, they ſhould have taken
this Encounter for an abſolute Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, (ſays <hi>Ruſtaut)</hi> I would
adviſe all the Brotherhood, be
they Travellers or others, that
they, above all things, be ſure to
keep a fair Correſpondence of
Love and Friendſhip with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of Juſtice, or the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and their Deputies: So that,
they may be ſure to have a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
done them in time of need,
when there is an occaſion. That
is Truth, (ſayes <hi>Beaulieu,</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
for ſuch an one may ſave a
Man's Life, when he is Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be Hang'd, by putting the
Noſe of a pair of Bellows down
his Throat, like a piece of Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
and ſo it may hinder him
from Expiring. No, (ſayes <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaut,</hi>
Laughing alſo) that is not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31072:28"/>
it; but they can put a Slice of
Bacon on the Patient's Shoulder,
before they put the Princes Arms
to it; beſides many other Favours,
when the Patient's ill Fortune hath
deſtined him to their Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>So, when <hi>Rustaut</hi> had ended his
Diſcourſe, the Cloak was brought,
with the Ring, to be put into the
Poſſeſſion of him that was the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
who came in very ſhortly
after, and received them both,
according to Promiſe. So the
<hi>Burgor</hi> made <hi>Rustaut</hi> a Preſent;
but he was long deliberating, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ſhould, or ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, as not being accuſtomed
to part with any thing that he
had gotten, till now, ſo eaſily;
neither did he ever make any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,
but only againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators,
in any Degree whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
But however, for fear that
the <hi>Burgor</hi> ſhould ſee him make
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31072:28"/>
Ceremonies, and Complement
with him, and ſo might carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his Preſent again, he as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy
took the Preſent, and diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the <hi>Burgor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This being no ſooner ended, but
in comes an old Man to <hi>Ruſtaut,</hi>
named <hi>Angleberge,</hi> and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed
by another old Man,
that was Lean and Dry, and as
free from Moiſture (almoſt) as a
Stock-Fiſh, in full hopes of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
a Maid, as he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of, that was very Rich, and
one who had ſerved already a long
time for the Production of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and the Propagation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Society: And this he ſpake
aloud, without fear of putting
himſelf, or any of the Company
to the Bluſh. <hi>Why, how now</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,
(ſayes one to this old Man,
for ſo was his Name) <hi>What! Do
you Court a Miſtriſs without any
Complement, or Formality at all?</hi>
                           <pb n="54" facs="tcp:31072:29"/>
With that a great luſty, fat, jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
Fellow, whoſe Name was
<hi>Roger,</hi> and one who had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
this old Man thither, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
ſaying; <hi>That one could not
chooſe, but uſe more Ceremony than
this to a Simple Girle, who never
had the Wit to be gotten with Child;
and therefore, he must not expect
to gain this ſo eaſily, who was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for him by many degrees, than
another, by reaſon ſhe was fitting to
govern his Houſe, and Houſhold-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> Ruſtaut, <hi>who was near of
Kin to this Damoſel, whoſe Name
was</hi> Jacqueline, <hi>having heard the
Demands that</hi> Lucas <hi>made to have
his Kinſwoman; and ſeeing him
to be in a better Habit, than he
was accuſtomed to be in; and
withal, knowing of him to be a
Cryer of Strong-Waters about
the Street, he anſwered him thus:</hi>
My old Friend, It is certainly the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31072:29"/>
Cuſtom, for Lovers to put themſelves
into their best Accoutrement, when
they come to appear before their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes;
and it is as certain, that
an ample, and well made Beard,
which you now have, was (not long
ſince) ſo heavy, that it covered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all your Face; although it is
now abated, ſhews a great Diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in your Years; ſhe not having
much more than one Quarter of your
Age; ſo great is the Diſparity of
your Years: So that, by the Courſe
of Nature, you will be ready enough
of your ſelf, to ſound your own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
rather than to make it your
Buſineſs to charge your ſelf with an
Equipage, which can ſtand you in
no other ſtead, but only to haſten
your Diſpatches into another World.
This Buxom Girle, that you look
after, were fitter for a young Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and would agree much better
with one that hath not nothing near
ſo many Years over his Head, as you
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31072:30"/>
have. And beſides, a young Woman
is like an old Clock, which never
Goes well, except it be often Wound
up: But an old Man is like a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of ſowre Wine: For you have
not above a Turn of Hair of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of a <hi>Baracan,</hi> which looks on
both ſides of your Jaws, like two
Whisks, which are only to make clean
Cloaths; and the Hair of your Head
looks like a Cap of a fleſh Colour;
and your Noſe reſembles more the
Neck of an <hi>Alimbeck,</hi> that is
alwayes dropping; and you are as
wetted, as if it had rained out of a
Glaſs on your Stomack; and you are
upon the very Brink of the Streams
of Forgetfulneſs: and you may tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
a great way, before you arrive
at the Fountain of Pleaſures; it
being (as it were) in Retrograde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you: And when you come
there, you may chance to have the
Cheat put upon you there alſo; for,
How can you expect to have a Wife
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:31072:30"/>
to your Self, that is accuſtomed to
ſerve others? And now, What can you
think of theſe Affairs, <hi>(ſayes</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaut,
<hi>turning himſelf towards</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<hi>who had very diligently hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to all their Diſcourſe; and
made Anſwer to it thus:)</hi> Why
truly, I think, <hi>(ſayes he, Laughing)</hi>
that <hi>Lucas</hi> may be like one of thoſe
Cowardly Souldiers, which dares not
give the Aſſault, till the Breach be
wide open: And <hi>Jacqueline</hi> makes
Love like the Wolves, who alwayes
make their Choice of the Uglieſt
Males.</p>
                        <p>But, in ſpight of all theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and the Jars of them all,
<hi>Lucas</hi> and <hi>Jacqueline</hi> pledged their
Faith to each other in Marriage;
and it was ſtupiltulated betwixt
them both, that ſhe ſhould have
a Dowry of <hi>One Thouſand Crowns,</hi>
to be raiſed upon the Goods and
Eſtate of <hi>Lucas,</hi> although he could
not name to the Value of <hi>One Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
                           <pb n="58" facs="tcp:31072:31"/>
of his own proper Eſtate.
And as for that <hi>Jacqueline,</hi> her
Riches conſiſted moſt in many
good Acquaintance; which, ſhe
ſwore, was worth a great deal of
Mony: But withal, ſhe was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill Clad; of which, <hi>Lucas</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
very much. But <hi>Roger</hi>
anſwered him, <hi>That it was a very
good Commodity: For,</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>you muſt undreſs her quite, before
ſhe goes to Bed with you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But at length, the Match was
ſigned, and the Ceremony of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
accompliſhed, and the Feaſt
provided; which was ſome groſs
Meat, and ſome as delicate Inter-Meſſes;
and all was to be at an
old Creator of Love, otherwiſe a
Bawd, called <hi>Ragonde,</hi> the moſt
Experienced of all the Trade:
And for her better Traffick, ſhe
had made Choice of a Houſe in
a By-place, and in a Quarter of
the Town; where very ſeldom,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31072:31"/>
or never any honeſt Man went,
except by Accident, or for a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
She uſed Divinations, len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Mony, treating of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
and traded in Brokery:
But particularly, in Girles or,
Whores; of which ſort, ſhe had
alwayes a ſufficient Number in
her Houſe; of whoſe Virginity,
ſhe had already taken the firſt
Tribute; but ceaſt not, every
Day, to raiſe ſome new Impoſt
upon them: For this cunning Gip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey
knows ſo well her Trade,
that ſhe can tell how to Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
them with <hi>Roach-Allom,
Salt of Saturn, le Conſolida Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi>
with other Ingredients, which
ſhe by her Subtilty made uſe of.
So that, ſhe could oftentimes ſell
one Maiden-Head in the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for as good as it was at the
very firſt. And, in the mean
time, ſhe ordered her Affairs ſo
well, that the Thieves (for the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:31072:32"/>
moſt part) brought all, or the
greateſt part of their Booty to that
Place, or ſome ſuch like; which
alwayes made the more Water
come to her Mill: and withal, the
<hi>Burgors</hi> could live more ſecure, and
at their Liberty.</p>
                        <p>But the Penſioners of <hi>Ragonde,</hi>
ſeeing of <hi>Jacqueline</hi> coming, they
all went out to meet and ſalute
her; they being (as it were) then
all undreſt, and in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
manner, that it would have
frightned any indifferent Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to have ſeen them: For the
one had a Bigen, ſo bedawb'd with
the Yolks of Eggs, that you would
have thought her Head to have
been wrapped up in a Namlet:
Others held a Box of <hi>Pumade,</hi> or
the Shells of <hi>Vermillion:</hi> Another
had her Hands ſo beſmear'd with
the Paſte of <hi>Almonds,</hi> that ſhe could
not tell what Countenance to
make: Another had her Face ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catriced,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31072:32"/>
by having received an
unfortunate Blow, (you may gueſs
how) which ſhe alwayes, when
Dreſt, covered with falſe Hair:
Others, having no Neck Cloaths,
ſhewed great Bunches, all ſwell'd,
which by Day they kept bound
up with Bands, that they might
not be ſeen. But the moſt Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
of all, was to ſee a great
foul Beaſt, with a piece of Spunge
ty'd to her Busk with the End
of a Lace; which made <hi>Ruſtaut</hi>
ask her, If ſhe were cleaning of
her ſelf with Sweet Water? To
which, <hi>Roger,</hi> taking the word out
his Mouth, anſwered; <hi>That he had
rather ſmell Piſs, than that ſweet
Angle-Water,</hi> (as he call'd it); <hi>and
that, in his Opinion, ſeeing the
Spunge hanging ſo near her Navel,
he gueſt that it might be employed
rather about her Inferior, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comly
Parts, than about any thing
elſe.</hi> At which, every one fell a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:31072:33"/>
Laughing, But a little after, all
theſe <hi>Curtizans</hi> were dreſt in a
little better Faſhion, and each ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in their beſt Luſtre they
could; and the Gueſts appeared
there, was all ſuch as by hazard
came thither: For, in that Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
every one was as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
as if he had been in his
own proper Lodging. And <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonde,</hi>
to do them the more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
ſeeing a great number of
People, made them all ſit down
to Table with them; where ſome
fell to Eating, without ſaying of
Grace before Meat; of which <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaut,</hi>
the better to counterfeit the
Judicious, told ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of it: At which, one of his
own Diſciples ſaid a ſorry Grace;
at the which, he declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be at the very End of his
Science; and that he could never,
in all his Life-time, attain to any
more, than what he had now done.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:31072:33"/>
                           <hi>And yet, you have made a Shift to
retain this still by rote,</hi> replyed
<hi>Roger.</hi> Another ſaid; <hi>If we were
not accompanyed with the Pottages,
I would willingly know, why we do
not uſe this Ceremony at Breakfaſt?
It is</hi> (ſayes another to this Twat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Basket) <hi>to hinder the Intruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the</hi> Daemons, <hi>or</hi> Goblings
<hi>now, which will ſcarcely come to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you at that time; becauſe they
have often heard ſay, by thoſe that
do prepare themſelves for that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
That they are ſo Hungry,
that they could eat the</hi> Devil <hi>Raw,
if they had him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So, by and by, every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
his Diſcourſe, according as his
Fancy excited him to it: So that,
by this time, there was ſuch a
Medly of confuſed Noiſe between
both Sexes, that none could tell
ſcarcely, what the other ſaid.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>One of the Damoſels, named</hi>
Cloris Jolygarcette, <hi>who was of</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gondes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:31072:34"/>
                           <hi>bringing up, and one of
the firſt Rank in her Aſſembly,
ſayes to</hi> La Breeche, <hi>that was eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as faſt as he could:</hi> My Dear,
I think that an Allyance betwixt us,
were more Reaſonable, than that,
<hi>ſpeaking of the Old Man, and
his Bride.</hi> Why not? truly, <hi>(reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he)</hi> the Difficulty would not be
great neither to make it; for I could
find in my Heart, to love thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready:
For ſuch a Lickeriſh Bit as
thou art, would ſerve me to break
my Faſt upon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>By this time,</hi> Roger, <hi>who had
heard all this Diſcourſe betwixt
the two Jollyeſt of the whole
Band, told her;</hi> That ſhe might
do well, to prefer thoſe Advantages
to another; and that they would
give her one of a more flouriſhing
Age: For ſhe did not ſo much as
look nor regard thoſe brave Antient
Fellows, <hi>ſayes</hi> Roger.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="65" facs="tcp:31072:34"/>
But <hi>Ragonde,</hi> when ſhe knew
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hat this Diſcourſe made for her,
began to lift up her Voice ſo well
as ſhe could, for the Diſability
of her Stomack, which was only
ſuſtained by the Help of ſome
Glaſſes of Wine, which ſhe ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
which otherwiſe could
hardly have ſubſiſted: Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as it ſhould ſeem) ſomewhat
heated with Wine and Anger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
ſhe took <hi>Roger</hi> by the
Shoulder to put him out of Doors;
telling him, <hi>That ſhe would be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
in her own Lodigngs.</hi> But
another old Hagg, whoſe Name
was <hi>Quintine,</hi> of a more amiable
Humor, as being the Mother of
<hi>Angilberd,</hi> who was alſo come to
the Feaſt, ſtood up, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
her; telling her, <hi>That they
were both Young enough to ſee the
Production of</hi> Lucas'<hi>s Children to
the Third Generation, by this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
now Conſummated.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="66" facs="tcp:31072:35"/>
So, this Stir being appeaſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and as <hi>Roger,</hi> who had lighted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Flambeau of all this Diſcord,
went to drink a Health to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonde,</hi>
they heard a great Noiſe
in the Street; and <hi>Ragonde,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
it to have been the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary,
with his Attendance,
who was coming to viſit her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines,
began to pray ſome of
the Company to be as Modeſt as
they could, in their Countenance
and Carriage: But, without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
to her Diſcourſe, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
themſelves to the Rout, with
all the Might and Main they could.
And ſo, riſing from the Table in
a Confuſion, ſome run to ſave
themſelves in the Garret, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the Sellar; and ſome,
who knew neither Door nor Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
nor how to ſave themſelves
in any Place; theſe put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
under the Protection of a
Servant-Maid, who conveyed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:31072:35"/>
them into a common Place of Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and ſo returned into the
Chamber, where ſhe ſtaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Fear, becauſe ſhe had been
often accuſtomed to theſe Alarms.
But, on the other ſide, they
thought the Houſe had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged:
For they without, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
knocking in ſuch a Manner
and Force, as if they would have
beat down the Door, or elſe
have beat him in pieces; which
obliged <hi>Ragonde,</hi> to put her ſelf
out of the Window of an empty
Chamber, where ſhe had convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her ſelf for fear: and for fear
of the worſt, ſhe made haſt down,
and cry'd out a main, <hi>A Wedding,
a Wedding! Vivat, Vivat!</hi> and ſo
ſent her Maid directly to open
the Door to her new-come Gueſt;
which proved to be <hi>Bondrille, Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtoc,
Beaulieu,</hi> and others, all her
very good Friends, and <hi>Ruſtaut</hi>'s
Officers; who ſerved as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:31072:36"/>
to a Broach full of Legs of
Mutton, which one of them had
civilly taken up from a <hi>Roſiſſier,</hi>
or (as we ſay) out of a <hi>Cook</hi>'s-Shop,
ready Roaſted, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them ſafe (with a great deal
of Hazard) to that Place; after
having made many Turnings and
Windings, to loſe the Sight of
the Cook, who had purſued them
very cloſe at the Heels, for a great
while together.</p>
                        <p>But by the Arrival of this Troop
from Abroad, our diſperſed Troops
at Home, began to take Heart,
and to Re-aſſemble themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
and ſo began to place
themſelves in Order at the Table,
which was now much better Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
than before it was, and
alſo better beſet with Company;
inſomuch, that this ſupply of Meat,
made every one begin to think
of disburſing for Wine, of which
they had quickly good ſtore; for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:31072:36"/>
they fill'd a great many Bottles,
of the which they began every
one to Drink heartily, and ſome
whole Bottles at a Health; ſo that
in a ſhort time, there was little
Diſtinction to be made in that
Aſſembly: For the Fair and the
Foul, the White and Brown, the
Gentle-women, Towns-women,
or Country-women was all one,
all were joval Dames alike; ſo
were the Thieves, Pick-pockets,
Gentlemen, and Beggars were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
mingled at this time: that it
ſeemed to be according to the
ſayings of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that for the
better Eſtabliſhing of a Society,
ſayes, <hi>That every Man ſhould Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
himſelf to be the Husband of
each Woman, and every Woman to
be the Wife of all thoſe Men.</hi> At
which words, one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
being one of the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
or Frollickſom, began to
look about her, ſaying, <hi>That if
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:31072:37"/>
there were any Eunuches in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
they ought to be Expulſed out
of the Company as uſeleſs, and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Members, which to be cut away
for the Preſervation of the reſt of
the Body, that was ſound and good;</hi>
to which <hi>Roger</hi> Anſwered, <hi>That
thoſe Men were very good Coverers,
for it never Rained where they
Wrought;</hi> that is a Truth ſayes
ſhe, <hi>But they are very bad Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n
eticians, for they cannot Multiply,
and they are as troubleſom in their
Conferences, for they never come to
a Concluſion.</hi> At the ſame time,
another who ſought to lay hold
on ſomething, alwayes began to
tell one, who was in her Year
of Novice, or the beginning of
her Practice; that he had heard
one ſay, <hi>That ſhe was a Cuclet,</hi>
to which ſhe Anſwers, <hi>I do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
how you come to know that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
for it is not long ſince my
Whether go you? or, Stay for this
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:31072:37"/>
time here, or the like, was by me.
O but</hi> (replyed he) <hi>you ſhould have
made him Anſwer to this half Term
thus; And, I pray, How do you call
the next Week? for the People of
Monaſteries change often their Names
and Habits.</hi> So he finding, that
he had not to do with a Fool, he
left her, and addreſt himſelf to
another Cocket, whoſe Name was
<hi>Diana;</hi> and told her, <hi>That one of the
Company,</hi> (pointing at them with
his Finger) <hi>had aſſured him, that
it was not long ſince, the best of her
Employment was Shelling of Beans;
and that ſhe could not go in high-Heel'd
Shoes, as being only accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to wear only Sabous, or Wooden-Shoes,
having never wore any thing
elſe, till now of late; and that her
Right Name was</hi> Friacrine.</p>
                        <p>But another, whoſe Name was
<hi>Philipotte;</hi> but becauſe ſhe would
have a more Gallant Name, ſhe
was named <hi>Silvy:</hi> This took the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:31072:38"/>
Diſcourſe upon her ſelf, becauſe
there was a Diſcourſe about her
Quality and Greatneſs; and, as
if ſhe had been mounted upon
her great Horſe, replyed, and
ſwore, <hi>That thoſe had undertaken
to talk on that Faſhion, knew full
e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ſily, that ſhe was a Gentlewoman of
good Faſhion; and had paid a good
Price for her Letters of Testimony.
That is a Truth indeed,</hi> (replyed
the above-ſaid <hi>Roger,</hi> ſpeaking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Air, like a Buffoon, or as
he made himſelf, a Fool) <hi>that there
were many, as he had heard ſay,
that could ſay as well as himſelf,
That ſhe was Noble: And if ſhe did
want a more ſufficien Teſtimony than
this, ſhe might apply her ſelf to
ſome ſweet and loving Notes, which
he had ſent her, whoſe Superſcriptions
were thus; <hi>A Mademoiſelle, Houſt-Houſt,
a La Mothepreſs de Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liput.</hi>
                           </hi>
But as ſhe had her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
at that time very ſlat, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31072:38"/>
ſtood as one ſpeechleſs, ſhe could
not revenge her ſelf upon <hi>Roger</hi>
by any thing, but by making an
ugly Face at him: But, by this time,
<hi>Diana</hi> was come into the Light, and
began as furiouſly to attack <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette,</hi>
otherwiſe call'd <hi>Louyſon du
Marais,</hi> the ſame which <hi>Roger</hi> had
ſhewn; and at this they joyned
with the above-known <hi>Silvia;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that theſe Three being
become Enemies by the Force of
the Wine, they began ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to pull Quails, that in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time they were obliged to
quit the Field and Combat, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Place of Battle covered
with their Cloaths, ſome of brave
Gaze, Muſline, Taffities, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Silks; inſomuch, that about
Day-light, the pieces of Ribbond,
and other things, which before
had ſerved to dreſs, and make
them fine, lay all here to be ſeen
in pieces: So that, at laſt, they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31072:39"/>
were fain to cover themſelves
with what was left of their
Cloaths, which was torn almoſt
as ſmall as their Scarffs: And their
Quoiffs hung down to their Heels,
which made look more like Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
then Courtizans; for they were
obliged to put Patches upon their
Faces, as big as Silk-Worms, and
as long, to ſerve for Plaiſters to
cover the Scratchings of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which were given in this
Battle. <hi>Ruſtaut</hi> would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to have interpoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
betwixt them, and ſo to have
made them Friends again: But
<hi>Ragonde</hi> undertook the Charge,
and made them Reciprocally give
each other Satisfaction upon the
Field; inſomuch, that they ſhould
all be acknowledged for Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women.
But then <hi>Roger,</hi> who
had not only been the Author and
Beholder of their Combat, but
was alſo a Witneſs to their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31072:39"/>
and ſo, to expreſs his
Joy for the ſame, told them, That
he would give them an <hi>Elogy,</hi> or
a Song, which he began after a
rude and ridiculous Faſhion: But
yet after his manner, the Verſes
were convenient enough for the
Occaſion; which are as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>To the end that we may finiſh all

                        <p>And now, What think you of my
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:31072:40"/>
Song <hi>Cupidon,</hi> with your wide
Chops, <hi>(ſayes</hi> Cloris <hi>to</hi> Roger, <hi>who
gad liſten'd very attentively to her
all the while?)</hi> Why, <hi>(ſayes he)</hi>
I think it is very like you: ſhe is
diſpleaſed; I know it already by Rote;
and would Joyne with you in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,
if my Foſſet could but be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to your Voyce; but I
can neither lead on my Party, nor
bate of my Meaſure. But this young
Sleeper may <hi>(ſayes ſhe, ſpeaking
of</hi> Theodore, <hi>who look't up with
a kind of Lecherous Eye)</hi> be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for my turn. Yes, I believe
<hi>(ſayes</hi> Roger) if he had his Spigot
in your Foſſet, called a <hi>Croperpice,</hi>
he might turn it eaſie enough, if not
too eaſily; feeling for the Corners
of it, as a Shoo-maker doth a Pair
of Boots, when he ſtuffs them: But
you anſwer not a word to this. <hi>But
with this, ſhe replyed to</hi> Theodore:
Up my Lecherous Friend; for I
ſuppoſe, you hearken to all this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:31072:41"/>
but for your better Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
A-ho! <hi>ſayes</hi> Theodore) it will take
up a great deal of Time for a Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to Learn a Trade ſo well, that
he ſhall out-do his Maſter: But
when you pleaſe, that I ſhall teach
ou to ſtudy the Metamorphoſis up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
down, I will be <hi>Andromede,</hi>
and you ſhall be <hi>Perſeus.</hi> Do but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
this Knave, <hi>(ſaith ſhe aloud,
Laughing with a full Mouth):</hi> They
ſay <hi>(ſayes ſhe)</hi> that he doth not
know what is a troubled Water; and
yet he is the nimbleſt Stalion in all
our Stable. <hi>But</hi> Lucas <hi>all this
while was like one ſtupid, who
ſpake not one word, nor moved
at the Table ſo well as the others:
But when</hi> Ragonde <hi>ſaw it, ſhe
cryes out;</hi> Why, how now Mr.
Bridegroom? What, Can you make
Money of nothing? For by your ſad
and heavy Countenance, you are
able of your ſelf to put us all into
the Dumps: Come, warm your ſelf
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:31072:41"/>
well with your Wine, and chear up
a little Mrs. Bride, your Spouſe:
What, Would you have her to leap
about your Neck? But if ſhe ſhould,
it would be contrary to the Cuſtom:
Beſides, ſhe is too Modeſt, and dares
not now, ſince ſhe is Married, ſo
much as look upon a Man without
Bluſhing. <hi>But this Old Fool</hi> Lucas,
<hi>being entred a little into Jollity,
replyed;</hi> That he had ſeen her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
Twattling with one or other;
and therefore, is now more Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
than ſhe us'd to be; for ſhe
admits of none, but <hi>French</hi> and
Strangers. But as concerning the
Affairs you ſpoke to me about,—
Me <hi>(ſayes</hi> Roger, <hi>who having by
this time learnt, that ſhe was</hi>
Engliſh-<hi>Born, ſayes to her,)</hi> If
this may paſs for a Stable, you may
alſo paſs for one of the beſt Geldings
in it: And beſides, having ſo good
a Stalion as this, you may both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Engender very good Colts.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:31072:42"/>
But there are more Days than Weeks;
therefore, you muſt give a little Reſt.
All this is Truth, <hi>(Replyed</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonde
<hi>to him)</hi> and yet you have
already well beaten the Wood, ſince
you were Conjugally bound to <hi>Jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queline</hi>
in Marriage: And beſides,
you ought alwayes to conſider, that
a Place not well Victualled, is eaſily
Taken by the Enemy. <hi>But ſhe ſaid
for Anſwer;</hi> That if ſhe had not
been Marryed, ſhe must never have
drank Wine; Wherefore, it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have the Entertainment of
a Woman, than for Carnal Actions:
And that he believed his Wife to be
wiſer, than to go about by Force to
take that Purity from him, which
he had ſo long preſerved intirely to
himſelf. <hi>But this being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
by</hi> Ragonde, <hi>and the reſt
of the Company, who began all
very heartily to laugh at ſuch a
Diſcourſe as this; at which the
Old Belldam began to ſing thus
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:31072:42"/>
upon this Subject, as followeth:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <lg>
                           <head>Ragonde's Song for Lucas.</head>
                           <l>When thou art in Hell,—<hi>Biſs,</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>The Old Man <hi>Lucifer,</hi>—<hi>Biſs,</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>Will ask out of what Mue</l>
                           <l>They have hunted this Faulcon,</l>
                           <l>Which hath not led his Life</l>
                           <l>Neither amongſt Wine nor Women?</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But ſtay a little then,</hi> (cryes <hi>La
Breeche</hi> to another young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
of the Gang, which <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonde</hi>
had there to be Broken up)
<hi>you have ſtollen away my Heart,
and I will feel in thy Belly to find
him again.</hi> But the Woman was
very much troubled, that he
ſhould be ſo Inſolent, as to offer
ſuch a rude Diſcourſe before thoſe
Girls: But <hi>Roger</hi> takes up the
Word, and asked, <hi>If there were
any Body in that Place, that had
their Ears more Chast, than all the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:31072:43"/>
reſt of their Bodies?</hi> But as they
were at that time, become all
good Friends again, ſhe made him
anſwer; <hi>That there was none but
very honeſt Girls with her now,</hi>
Laughing: But that their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was a little Scandalous,
whil'ſt <hi>Angilberd</hi> began to ſing the
Song of <hi>Dupont</hi> and <hi>Guimbarde,</hi>
upon which <hi>Quintine</hi> ſung Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to <hi>Lubeine,</hi> and his Loyal and
Noble Friends; and then every
one in Courſe gave his Song as he
pleaſed; as ſome for <hi>Bacchus,</hi> ſome
for <hi>Mars,</hi> and ſome in favour of
<hi>Vulcan</hi>'s Wife: So that, every one
gave a Song as they pleaſed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Bondrille,</hi> who could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſing, becauſe he had his
Mouth alwayes full; which was
eſpyed by one, who loved Ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
as her Life; who ſayes:
<hi>Come on, my brave Cavalier, now
is your turn to ſing; but you are
above the Potter now. Why, that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:31072:43"/>
were good for a Dance,</hi> ſayes he)
<hi>but do not ſpeak one Word more of
Dancing above the Potter; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I am ſuſpected: And beſides, I
am Tall enough, and need not to
be ſtretched.</hi> After this Anſwer
given, which was Merry enough
for the Matter it concerned. But
this fooliſh Gigglet, that thought
to Laugh alwayes, replyed; <hi>That
he was a very fit and proper Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
to ſtudy Youthfulneſs in the
Doctors School.</hi> Which words, by
a Miſ-underſtanding, very much
offended <hi>Bondrille;</hi> inſomuch,
that he roſe from the Table in a
great Heat, with a deſign to have
evilly intreated her; but ſhe fled
amain, and he purſued after to
catch her; and when he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-taken
her, he went to pull
her by the Ears, and as he went
to lay hold on them, he found
none; which made him return
almoſt chok't with Laughter to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:31072:44"/>
the reſt of the Company, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
his Adventure. <hi>That is very
good,</hi> (cryes <hi>Roger) and a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Commodity for a Combe to
paſs without Moleſtation:</hi> And ſo
conſequently, each had ſomething
or other to ſay of Gallantry, about
the Loſs of the Ear. Some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled
her to put ſome pieces of
Carton collour'd for Ears; but
to take heed of letting them fall,
for fear that People in the Street
ſhould cry after her, <hi>Madam, take up
your Ears before you go.</hi> Another
made a kind of a Moral Diſcourſe,
by way of Reflection upon this
ſilly Fool, and her Talk; either
as much diſcourſed her manner
of Life; ſaying, <hi>That ſhe would
not be exempted one Day or other,
from ſerving for a Model in the
Academy of Death.</hi> But another
made anſwer, <hi>That when that Holy-Day
came, they would Conſume her.</hi>
But <hi>Ragonde,</hi> to reproach this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:31072:44"/>
without Ears, told her; <hi>That
ſhe would not have her to Dreſs
her ſelf in the Mode, but with Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
only.</hi> With that ſtood up
one of the braveſt of the whole
Company; who was dreſt in a
Coronet, with a few light Hairs
over it; and ruffled out in a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
of ſmall Curles, or Truſſes,
ſaying, <hi>Hold there, Governeſs; for
I have taken part elſewhere.</hi> With
that our Gentlewoman without
Ears, being a little freed of her
Fears, and pretty well come to
her ſelf again, would begin to
enter the Liſt to babble again;
ſaying, <hi>That ſhe would take a new
Party alſo, and would make her Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in</hi> Normandy, <hi>and had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
given Earneſt for a Place in the
Coach that goes to</hi> Roan. <hi>VVhat
then, you think to do ſome ſtrange
Matters in that Country,</hi> (replyes
<hi>Roger) which is the only Rendezvouz
of thoſe Girls which are out of Trade,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:31072:45"/>
and Communes with theſe that are
here; or elſe, it may be, you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to draw great Profits from the</hi>
Portugals <hi>and</hi> Flemmines: <hi>But, by
the Faith of</hi> Roger, <hi>thou wilt ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
cauſe all the People in the Town
to flye from thee, when thou comes
there without thy Ears, if they do
but come to know it ſooner, than
thou wilt be able to induce one to
follow thee by all thy Charms.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But one whoſe Name was <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baut,</hi>
being Drunk, took an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to quarrel with <hi>Quintine,</hi>
calling her <hi>Old,</hi> dreſt up in Old
Cloaths. <hi>That is Truth,</hi> (ſayes
ſhe) <hi>thou Old Cuckold:</hi> At which
he ſeemed to be very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and began to ſtrike <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine;</hi>
which, when <hi>Ragonde</hi> ſaw,
ſhe began to be angry, and put
him away, ſeeing him much in
Drink, that ſhe might appeaſe
the Noiſe. But <hi>Roger</hi> ſeeing one
of the Company endeavouring to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:31072:45"/>
bring him in again, called to him,
and bad him have a Care; <hi>For
if ſhe ſhould chance to fall upon
you by the way,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>he might
enganger the cleaving of you in two
with his Horns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By this time <hi>Ragonde</hi> begins to
approach <hi>Theodore,</hi> for to Careſs
him; but he as quickly flings
himſelf from her: Telling her,
<hi>That the very Strength of her Breath
would poyſon him, if his were not
well fortify'd by the Quantity of
VVine which he had drank; which
ſerved as an Antidote against the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of it:</hi> For, to ſay the Truth
of it, ſhe was <hi>Ptyſical,</hi> and did
throw out ſuch Glanders, ſo thick
and ugly, that it would have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
any reaſonable Stomack of
either Man or Beaſt: For one
would have thought, that all that
ſhe did either Eat or Drink, did
convert it ſelf into this filthy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement;
and that the only paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:31072:46"/>
for it out of her Body, was
through her Eyes and Noſe.</p>
                        <p>But the moſt Charming amongſt
all thoſe brave Dames, that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves in that Place, was
one <hi>Clytie;</hi> but the moſt falſe
Miſtriſs of the Sun, who Ador'd
none ſo much as an <hi>Alchymiſt:</hi>
But ſhe quickly put her ſelf out
of the Company, to follow a VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
whom ſhe ſerved under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand:
feigning themſelves to go to
the Market, came and whiſpered
him in the Ear: But in their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
it was known, that but a
little before, ſhe was a little Snot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Girl; who uſed in time of
Vintage, to go and work in the
Country; and ſo continued in
the Village for to gather Hops,
and ſuch like, till ſhe came to be
in Love; and ſince that, ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to counterfeit, or make
the Gentlewoman; which ſhe
did ſo well, that in thoſe ſweet
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:31072:46"/>
Combats, ſhe carryed away the
Prize from all the reſt of her
Trade; having her VVitty and
comely Geſtures ſtrong enough to
move and invite any Man, if he
were not quite ſtupify'd and ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
without having occaſion to
uſe any other little Wheedling
ARTS, for to invite <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Courtiers, Merchants, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
Schollars,</hi> and any others,
were all wellcom; who, by the
Example of <hi>Layis,</hi> that Famous
<hi>Sicilian,</hi> who was oftner weary,
than ſatisfyed with her Luſt;
and that her Houſe was no more
without Gallants, than a good
Tavern without Drinkers: And
he muſt of neceſſity be a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Town, that did not
know her.</p>
                        <p>But in this mean-while, <hi>Jacque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi>
had taken a Diſguſt againſt
her Husband <hi>Lucas;</hi> and ſo, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her Excuſe to go out to Piſs,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31072:47"/>
and runs quite away; inſomuch,
that he could not tell what was
become of her, neither did he
put himſelf to any great trouble
to know: But finding every one
begine to Rail, and Jeer at him,
he alſo went his way without
ſpeaking one word at all: And
when Night came, ſome went to
their Beds, and ſome abroad to
their Good Fortunes here and
there, where they could find it:
And when the Morning was come,
thoſe that had ſtaid at <hi>Ragonde's</hi>
lodgings, had their Stomack up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Eyes were well open; &amp;
ſo began to gather the Fragments
together that were left over Night;
and ſo make Griladoes for Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
as faſt they could.</p>
                        <p>But the Coming-in of <hi>Bondrille</hi>
with Three or Four Cloaks upon
his Back, as if he had been afraid,
that his Limbs ſhould have been
ſtiff, or numb'd with Cold, put
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:31072:47"/>
them into a little Perplexity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Spirits a little troubled,
becauſe they went out <hi>Four</hi> of
them together, and none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was return'd of all the Night-Company,
who had traced the
Town about; notwithſtanding
he had waited at the Corners of
the Streets for them ſo long, till
his Legs were almoſt ſhrunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Body again. But by and
by, comes one of them with a
great Sackful of Goods, which he
had brought from a Coach, aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Paſſengers, as though
he had been one of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
to place Them, and their
Affairs; and ſo made his Eſcape
away. Soon after this, came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
with the Back-part of a
Cloak, which he had cut from
a Man's Back in a Croud, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only the two Fore-Lapets
hanging like a pair of Hanging-Sleeves.
But the laſt of all, was
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:31072:48"/>
the greateſt VVonder of all; for
he came all Cut and Mangled,
by getting out of a Sellar, where
he was ſhut in to have been kept
till Day, that they might have
conveyed him to Priſon in the
Morning, for having viſited ſome
Lodgings, which he ſhould not
have done, to have been found
as he was at the Viſit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> Bondrille, <hi>ſeeing all of his
Comrades met again, he began
to re-aſſume his good Humour,
and to take his turn; and to talk
of his Comrades, and their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Subtilities:</hi> For <hi>(ſayes he)</hi>
our Congregation is for the most
part, Compoſed of a ſort of Men,
which are good Takers up; but bear
amongſt us the Name of Souldiers
of the Short-Sword: And when they
have ſerv'd their Apprenticeſhips, they
go here and there, at their own Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie,
either to Cutt a Purſe, or any
ſuch like Actions as this, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:31072:48"/>
to their Calling. Sometimes
they go into the <hi>Tennis-Court;</hi>
where, toſſing ſome few Balls, they
take up a good Cloak, and lay down
an Old one in the Place; and ſo get
away as far as they can, acting the
Drunkard, for fear of being ſeen
and purſued; and to be tost in like
manner, if they ſhould be taken:
So likewiſe, if they come where they
are playing at Bowls, they ſeldom
miſs doing of ſomething; for whilſt
they meaſure a doubtful Caſt, what
is to be gotten, is their own law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Goods: And ſo, at the Seaſon of
Swimming, when Men are in the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they are making away the Cloaths,
and leave the Swimmers to heat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
without Cloaths. So that, by
theſe little Contrivances with the
Times, they become fit for any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Actions, as they ſhall be imployed
about. And ſo, when they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ſuch great Undertakings,
then we enroll them Comrades, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31072:49"/>
Night-VValkers; of which Night-VValkers,
the one of them the laſt
VVinter, got more himſelf alone,
than Six others could do in Two
Years: For, he would go into the
Streets himſelf, with a Flambeau
lighted in his Hand; and if any
one would follow him for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Light, when he found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
alone in a convenient Place,
he having an Exstinguiſher in his
Pocket for the purpoſe, he as ſoon
puts out his Flambeau, and then leaps
upon the Neck of the Man, and
makes him pay him well for his Pains
he has taken. But we have lost
this brave Man out of our Society;
for they have drawn his Soul out of
his Body, as they would draw Water
out of a Well, <hi>(That is, with a
Rope)</hi> and now, at this time, the
VVind blows under his Feet: <hi>(That
is as much as to ſay, He hangs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Gibbet.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="95" facs="tcp:31072:49"/>
Another of the Company, who is
at preſent in the Country; which
they call the <hi>Great Leaper,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his Great Agility: He is
counted a brave Fellow alſo; for
within theſe few Dayes, he emptied
the Pockets of Two Gentlemen as
they were a Hunting, Mounted on
their brave Courſers; but he took
them with ſo much Subtilty one
by one, pretending to mind ſome
thing that was amiſs in the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their Horſes, which they did
not perceive, and ſo knew not what
he did.</p>
                        <p>So, we have VVomen alſo, <hi>(ſayes</hi>
Bondrille) which we call <hi>Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi>
whoſe Buſineſs is only, for the
most part, to viſit the Markets, and
other Aſſemblies; when the Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Crowd will give them
leave to fiſh in Troubled VVaters.
Others will go to light a little Fire
in a Houſe, where they make as if
they were near Neighbours; and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:31072:50"/>
the other Day ſhe went to look for
Chambers to be Lett; and, under
pretence of ſelling ſome things ſhe
had to ſell, ſhe took all that lay
open, and could be with Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
conveyed away. And theſe good
Pieces are not only Faithful Keepers
of what you bring to them; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
are Reformers of our Acquſitions:
And in that they are as quick as
any thing can be, to diſguiſe any
thing that is put into their Charge to
diſpoſe of; for they will ſo rarely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
any thing, that it will be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hard matter for any one to know
his own Goods again, although they
ſee it before their Eyes: Of which
I am a VVitneſs; for a little before
I was Enrolled in the Brother-hood,
it was my Hap to Lodge one Night
with ſome of my Friends, in the
Houſe of one of theſe VVork-VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and giving her my Cloak,
which I did uſually wear, praying her
to adjuſt it Handſomly for me; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:31072:50"/>
only, that ſhe ſhould make it
Clean, and no more: But on the
Morrow-Morning I found my Cloak
lin'd with another Stuff, which ſhe
cauſed to be put in; the Cap was
turned up-ſide down, and Silk-But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
in the place of a Silver-Galoon,
with which it was bound; inſomuch,
that I had already handled him Three
or Four times, in looking for him on
all ſides; but not knowing of him,
till ſhe put me out of my pain, by
ſhewing of me what ſhe had done,
and the Work-man-ſhip ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on it.</p>
                        <p>But that which ſurpaſſed all the
reſt for Subtilty, was one whom we
called the <hi>Giboubeuſe.</hi> She uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
goes about the Town with a Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Straw, till ſhe could eſpy a
Place where ſhe might make a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Fortune; and having found
this, ſhe would go in, and lay down
her Pack for a better, and ſo be gone;
as ſhe did not many Dayes ago,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:31072:51"/>
when ſhe went into a Silk-Man'<hi>s</hi>-Shop,
and there layes down a Child
in the place of a Bundle of Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</p>
                        <p>But to Conclude <hi>(ſayes</hi> Bondrille)
we live like the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> who
without buying of any thing,
want nothing that is neceſſary for
them. And as our Quarters are in
divers Places, ſo we have Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents
every where aſſuredly true
to us.</p>
                        <p>And then he began to diſcourſe
of his Exploits in the Wars, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them, That he had met with
a Knowing <hi>Magician,</hi> who had
predicted to him; <hi>That he ſhould
Dye in the Middle of a Medley of
People; and that his Grave ſhould
be in the open Fields:</hi> Of which
he was not much Couzen'd; for
ſome ſhort time after this, he
was taken in the Plains of <hi>Long-Boyau,</hi>
doing of his Exerciſe; he
was Killed in the Middle of a great
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:31072:51"/>
Aſſembly, who was in a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſee the Spectacle; and ſo,
preſently after, they carryed him
out to the great High-way, where
an Old-Wile ſerved to circle
him.</p>
                        <p>So ſome of our ſhort Sword-Men
have Acquaintance amongſt
your <hi>Burgors</hi>-Sons, who may ſerve
to defray Charges every where;
as being aſſured of the Supplyes
out of their Purſe upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
if we can but make any
thing of a Difference amongſt
them, in hopes that their Purſe
or Pockets may be emptyed by
the Arm of thoſe which carry
your Cut-laces; becauſe when
they fall into any Treaties, it is
only of this kind; where their
Diſcourſe is only of Cutting off
of Heads, or Cutting their Bodies
in pieces; promiſing them to
take a ſevere Revenge upon all
their Enemies, if they ſhould be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:31072:52"/>
as ſtrong as the Great <hi>Mogul;</hi> or,
at the leaſt, they ſay, They will
make them come to a very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Compoſition. But theſe
Advocates do often-times find
their Practices ſo good, that they
never deſire to ſee the End of
the Controverſies: But, on the
contrary, they frame new Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
under-hand, to the End
that they may drink the oftner;
for in ſuch Medleys as theſe, they
make the beſt Reparations for the
Belly.</p>
                        <p>And again, if they do make
them believe, that they will Kill
one another in cold Blood, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a great Stir and Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet all they do in this great
Stir, is but to beat one another
with the Flat Sides of the Sword,
or Bulls-Piſle, or a Cudgel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Quality of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
that hath been committed
by our Duelliſts, or their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="101" facs="tcp:31072:52"/>
But to ſay no more of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
for they are an open Bank,
fit for the Extirpation of Men,
which ſhould do Service in the
Publick: For they never Fight,
but with the Quart-Pot; whilſt
theſe young fooliſh Fellows expect
every moment to ſee the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of their Enemies, by theſe
falſe brave Fellows, who call
themſelves by the names of the
<hi>Repairers of Wrongs and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages,</hi>
giving themſelves great
Names and Titles; whereof a
Knight is the leaſt amongſt them,
in all their Order; and making
more Saints of this their Order,
than there are in an Almanack.</p>
                        <p>But this Liberty, which had
been ſo openly taken by them at
<hi>Ragonde's</hi> Houſe, began now to
be much Retrenched by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of the Neighbour-hood;
which made the Short-Sword-Men,
and the Spinners of Wool,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31072:53"/>
to remove and with-draw: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that in the Houſe before,
where there was nothing in it
that was Good, but Evil; for it
created more Miſchief, than the
BOX of <hi>Pandora.</hi> But now,
there is nothing to be ſeen, but
the <hi>Amintas, Mariannes, Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaes,</hi>
the <hi>Amaranthes, Fanchons,</hi>
and <hi>Clorindes;</hi> and theſe but rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
viſited by ſome young, joyful
Youths, who had never Courted
the Ladies, but in a <hi>Romance;</hi> and
this only but to make them a
little bolder, when they found
the occaſion to appear before their
Miſtreſſes, whom they thought
fit to be made their Wives.</p>
                        <p>And, in brief, you heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
now ſpoken of, but Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and ſome Love-Toyes; and
<hi>Ragonde</hi> her ſelf incloyſtered in a
ſmall Room, beholding theſe new
Miracles of Nature; ſo great was
the Reformation: And her Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:31072:53"/>
now, was only to ſhew them
the Methods, which properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the Exerciſes which they
intended to profeſs; as namely,
how to hold their Countenance
before a Looking-Glaſs, to ſet their
Hair in divers Faſhions; and ſo
conſequently, to dreſs and ſet
themſelves out in the beſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they can; and ſometimes, to
bite their Lips, to make it ſhew
more like unto Artificial Corral;
pinch their Cheeks, to make the
Paint ſhew the better; and to
glance with the Eye to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
very handſomly, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſuch little Tricks as theſe,
to make them ſet off the better,
and handſomer to ſee to. To all
which, the Pommade, Jeſſemy-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Orange, Falſe Water, Falſe
Pearls, and Ribbonds of all Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
are not forgotten for the
Adornment of theſe pretty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who call'd themſelves all
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:31072:54"/>
Siſters; and Old <hi>Ragonde,</hi> they
called their Good Woman.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Theodore,</hi> who had made
Love to <hi>Mademoiſelle Cloris,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſtill to ſee her alwayes at
<hi>Ragonde</hi>'s Houſe, and to Live
with her, and other Ladies of
Pleaſure, in a continual Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
leading a very lewd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regulated
Life; which laſted a
long time, in ſpight of all his
Friends could do, with all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances
that they could make
him to the contrary; inſomuch,
that the Scandal of his Vitious
Life was known every day more
and more: So that, his Friends
at laſt acquainted him, That if
he would ſail againſt Wind and
Tide, he muſt expect to run the
Hazard of falling upon very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Shelves, which would
(without all doubt caſt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
for that the Debauches
were only a Gilded Pill, which,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:31072:54"/>
whoſoever did ſuffer himſelf to be
carryed away by it, would (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubt) in time find the
Bitterneſs of it at laſt. But their
Policy was ſo well ordered, that
within ſome few Hours after,
moſt of all theſe looſe, and ill
living People were taken, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by the Officers of Juſtice,
and moſt Priſons were filled with
them; of which, <hi>Ragonde,</hi> and
her Penſioners were not exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                        <p>And now, ſee what comes by
too much frequenting of ſuch
Houſes and People as are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched.
But <hi>Ragonde,</hi> who had
a little before made her Lodging
upon the Rampire of the Town,
which (in her Thoughts) was a
Place of leaſt Scandal: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſhe found to her Coſt, that
where the Sick-Man moves, his
Diſtemper goes along with him
alwayes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="106" facs="tcp:31072:55"/>
But, in ſhort, it was ordained,
That the greateſt Part our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
Girls ſhould be ſent to
ſome <hi>Iſlands</hi> newly Diſcover'd;
for which purpoſe they were Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
before the <hi>Louer,</hi> to be
ſent down the River to <hi>Roan:</hi> But
many of them were in Hopes of
being Reſcued by the People in
Power of that Town, as they
went along, for the Service that
they had render'd them in times
paſt.</p>
                        <p>But ſome of them, being more
vain, ſaid; If a <hi>Turk</hi>'s Man of
War ſhould come Cruſing out of
the Straits, it might happen, that
the Ship where they were might
be taken, and ſo ſome of them
might be preſented to the Grand
<hi>Seignior;</hi> and ſhe thought her
Deſerts might make her to be
Honoured with his Handkerchief,
or a better Thing: So good a
Conceit had ſhe of her ſelf and
Actions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="107" facs="tcp:31072:55"/>
But, at length, they all took
their Leave of the <hi>Queens-Court,</hi>
the <hi>Red-Houſe, Chaillot,</hi> of <hi>Paſſy,</hi>
of <hi>Soreſne,</hi> of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> St. <hi>Cloud;</hi>
and above all the reſt, of their
ſo much beloved Lodging, the
<hi>Signe of the Great State,</hi> where
they had often been better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
than now they were.
And ſo, following on their Courſe
till they came to <hi>Poiſſy,</hi> where
at the ſame time many Thieves
were Executed; ſome on the
Wheel, ſome Hang'd, and others
ſent to the Galleys; to the end,
that they might root out all thoſe
Diſturbers of their Publick Peace
and Tranquility, and that all
People might Live in Security,
both in Town and Country.</p>
                        <p>And now, behold! this was
the Unhappy End of thoſe, who,
by leading of a Vitious Life alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
without Controul or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
had made themſelves the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:31072:56"/>
of their own Diſgraces, and
were not look't upon by any,
but according to the petulant
Humours of the People.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Theodore</hi> had eſcap't this
Danger by means of ſome of the
Archers that were his Friends;
who, for the means of ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
ſo far favour'd him, that he
got home to his Friends and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
where he now exerciſes
an Honeſt Imploy, living accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Birth amongſt good
People of Honour, and in a good
Repute.</p>
                        <p>Now, let all thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Libertines like him, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Accident whatſoever, learn to
labor by his Example, if they do
really intend to hinder the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of an Evil over themſelves
in this manner; that they may
not be a Witneſs themſelves one
Day, of their Enemies Joy for their
Miſcarriages.</p>

☞ The Matter (<hi>ſaid I, when I
had read it over to the</hi> Poet) is
very Rare, and the Stile ſmooth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
wherefore, it is (without all
doubt) a Piece of your own Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
            <p>Pardon me, <hi>(ſayes he)</hi> for it is
a Friends of mine, who gave it to
me to Correct it: But truly, I had
rather leave it as it is, than to
ſpoyl the Works of another.</p>
            <p>Why, <hi>(ſayes I to him)</hi> you are
able to give a Luſtre to any Work,
ſooner than do it Wrong.</p>
            <p>I do not doubt that at all, <hi>(re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
he):</hi> But, to ſpeak without
Vanity, I call that a Thing Spoyled,
which another (it may be) calls a Good
Reformation. And I am alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that any Man, loving of his
Progenitors, cannot like it well, if
by Hazard, he ſhould beget a Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Child; and another, to make him
Streight, ſhould take his Bunch or
Crookedneſs away: This is, in effect,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:31072:57"/>
then ſuch a Deformity. Wherefore,
I had rather not run the Hazard at
all, than to make my ſelf diſliked of
by my Friend. And beſides, It is
not my Buſineſs to work in Proſe.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome Verſes in it,
<hi>(I replyed to him.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he made me Anſwer,
That they came not from him;
neither were they of his Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>But you have made very Good Ones
in taking of Tobacco, <hi>(ſayes I to
him.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he made me Anſwer, That
there was nothing leſs.</p>
            <p>But I told him, I had heard
them Rehearſed, and found them
to be very agreeable; and that
I had from time to time, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my ſelf in the Hearing, and
Seeing of them.</p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at the ſame time, I ſaw
upon his Table a great Lute;
which made me ſay to him: <hi>Sir,</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:31072:58"/>
for ought that I can ſee, you are
indued with a great many good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and are able to give a Luſtre
to all your other Works, by adding a
ſweet Harmony to their Force.</p>
            <p>And you, Sir, <hi>(ſayes he)</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
are of a very eaſie Belief,
that you can be ſo eaſily perſwaded
to believe a Suppoſition, as to reſt
ſatisfied by ſeeing of the Glove, and
not the Hand: It is a hard matter
for a Man to judge by the outward
Appearance, what is within-ſide: For
in a word, to tell you the Truth,
This Study of a Lute, which you ſee,
is only to put in ſome things of
mine; which are at your Service, if
you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, he pulls out
from under his Beds-Head a Shirt
of Cloath, which was Fine enough;
but ſo Old, and full of Holes,
that he could not lye in it at
Night, for fear of tearing it to
pieces. But putting in of his Left-Arm
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:31072:58"/>
into the Sleeve, he put his
Right-Arm into a Hole of the
Shirt, thinking it had been the
other Sleeve; and ſo came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
out of his Bed, and went
to the Table; and there fell a
Writing, till the Cold made him
leave his Pen. And after this
he goes, and opens his Study, or
Belly of the Lute; out of which,
he pulled a Lac'd-Band, laced with
divers ſorts of Lace; with a pair
of Cuffs ſo deep, that they might
reach from the Wriſt to the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
with a Perrywig, that was
neither White nor Red, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both: Which, when I ſaw
it, I asked of him, If he meant
to dreſs himſelf like a Courtier?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which he anſwered, mutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with his Lips, That he would
have been better accommodated
with his Hair than he was, if the
Rogue had not run away with
his Perry-wig, which he carryed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:31072:59"/>
him to mend a Place in it, where
the Hair was cut away, and to
cure a Figure of an</hi> Oſtridges <hi>Egg.</hi>
But truly <hi>(ſayes he)</hi> this ſhould not
have ſerved for a Scabbard for my
Head, if I had not been a little too
Familiar: And this made me to
know, that I ſhould ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
but alwayes know every thing:
Wherefore, if you ſhould be obliged
to make an Anſwer, be ſure that
you do it ſo, that it may be pleaſing:
For the Old Saying is; <hi>If a Thing
be well Given, it may be well
Taken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>(ſayes I)</hi> this kind of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
is a little Obſcure and Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate;
for there is none knows the
Meaning of it, but your ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With that he replyes:</hi> If you
pleaſe to hear me, I will tell you how
the Accident came: For, as it was
my Hap to be one Evening with a
Great Perſonage of the Court, who
was then in an indifferent good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:31072:59"/>
and asked me many pleaſant
Queſtions; to which I made him
Anſwer after a jeſting way, or (as
they ſay) like a Buffoon; which made
him as often to laugh heartily. But
at last, he asked me, If I were not
aiding at the Funeral of one of my
Brothers; telling me, That that
very day they had Hanged a Poet.
To which it was my Hap to make
him for Anſwer, That I never did
ſee any one Executed, but one Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who had his Head out off;
naming the Perſon; not thinking in
the leaſt, that the Party who dyed
by the Edge of the Sword, was any
thing a-kin to him: But he as ſoon
cut off my Words, by throwing a Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Candleſtick,
with a Burning
Wax-Light in it, at my Head; which
Burning Candle was ſo intangled in
my Hair, that the greatest Part of
my Hair was burnt, before I could
get the Gandle out of it: Beſides, I
was in as much trouble how to get
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:31072:60"/>
away, for fear of my Life; for he
purſued me with a Sword drawn in
his Hand. And this is the main Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why I wear a Perrywig. And
another Reaſon is this: It fortuned,
that not long ſince, I would have
Reſcued a Man out of the Hands of
ſome that were leading ſome poor
People to the Hoſpital; for which
they fell upon me, and hurt my Head,
as you ſee; for the Plaiſters remain
upon it yet.</p>
            <p>But, by this time, my Poet had
almoſt Dreſt himſelf after his
Faſhion; and we began to walk
abroad together: But upon the
Stairs, I Chanced to look back,
and ſpyed him with but one Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
on; which I gave him No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, and ſo he went back to
put it on: and then came, and
found me at the Street-Door,
where I ſtaid for him. But we
had not gone far, but a Man of
his Acquaintance meets him, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31072:60"/>
firſt Salutes him, and then asked
of him, How he had paſſed the
Night away?</p>
            <p>
               <q>Without ſleeping, <hi>(ſayes he)</hi>
but in the moſt agreeable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements
that ever Man had;
for, I believe, <hi>(ſayes he)</hi> that the
<hi>Nine Sisters</hi> were never Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with ſo brave Spirits, nor
indued with ſo many pleaſant
Thoughts, as I was: Neither
was it poſſible, that ever I ſhould
have attain'd to the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch a happy Night's
Divertiſement, if their Spirits
had not left them, to Court
and Careſs me, to the great
Envy of one or other.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ha, Alas! <hi>(ſayes the other)</hi> I
was not ſo Happy as you; for
I have blowed all this Night;
and that <hi>Daemon,</hi> or <hi>Devil,</hi> that
Inſpires us in our Curſed <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi>
was far off from Careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
me; for he made a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:31072:61"/>
ſet very well fitted with <hi>le Lain,
Antimony,</hi> the <hi>Stains of Ice,</hi> or
<hi>Orpine,</hi> live <hi>Sulphur, Sanders,</hi>
and other <hi>Drugs</hi> that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;
to which I had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
given them all the Degrees
of Heat: So that, within two
Dayes, it would have been
<hi>Gold</hi> of the Higheſt Pitch, that
would have endur'd Tryal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Dimunition: But it broke,
and was like to have ſpoyled
my Face into the Bargain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But by this their Diſcourſe, I
came to underſtand, that my Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et's
Friend was an <hi>Alchymist:</hi> But
I ſeemed to know nothing at all,
nor to take any notice of what
they ſaid. So, continuing their
Diſcourſe together, ſaying at laſt:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Whither go you, my Friend?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I go <hi>(ſayes the Poet)</hi> to look
out ſomething of Divertiſement
and Refreſhings for a Lover,
<hi>(meaning Me)</hi> that is wholly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:31072:61"/>
croſſed in his Love; for by
Vows and Promiſes, all is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into an Evil Succeſs, inſtead
of being Recompenſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Deſerts, for his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
and Faithfulneſs: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I am going to try if I
cannot make him quickly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
that Ingratitude.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Why then, <hi>(replyed the other)</hi>
you are like the Witches, that
can <hi>do,</hi> and <hi>undo</hi> that which
they have <hi>done.</hi> For my part,
I really thought, that it had
been the Poet's Part to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
<hi>Love,</hi> and not to chill
it with Cold. But if I may paſs
my Thoughts of <hi>Love,</hi> I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it to be a Diſtemper,
which is only cured by Mirth,
and not by Melancholly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is a Paſſion of the Soul,
which (when it is inflamed
there-with to the Higheſt, it)
deprives us of Reaſon, and makes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:31072:62"/>
us go aſtray beſides our ſelves,
like brute Beaſts or Vagabonds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But, in brief,—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>"Patience, <hi>(ſayes the Poet, who
brake off the others Diſcourſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;)</hi>
"That he ſhould ſee him
Laugh heartily by and by; and
I wiſh, that the firſt Flaſh of
Lightning, that proceeds out
of its Fiery Region, may deſtroy
the Mount of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> if I do
not Cure our Lover before he
be many Hours older, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him his Parallels, or thoſe
that were in his Condition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo, by little and little, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
as we went, we came at
laſt to the Hoſpital, where they
put thoſe that are beſides their
Wits: And ſo, addreſſing of
themſelves by common Voyce
and Conſent, to the Governour
of the Place, asked of him, If
they might not ſee thoſe that were
thus Diſtracted, or Fools? To
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31072:62"/>
which the Governour, who was
an Antient, yet Venerable Man
enough anſwered, <hi>That they might</hi>
And ſo brought them into a little
Hall; and firſt ſhews them a Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-Glaſs,
to ſee themſelves; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them to underſtand, that it is
not good to Inſult too much over
the Misfortunes of others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this Antient Man brought
us into a little Court, where the
Diſeaſed were ſhut up in little
Rooms aſunder: At which, the</hi>
Poet <hi>began to cry out;</hi> Stay here!
Gad, it is ſufficient, it ſuffices me;
for I have ſeen the greatest Part of
all their Fooleries: And I think,
that theſe Separations would do well,
if they were but big enough to be
an Incloſure for the greateſt Part
of the World, to ſhut up Fools in:
For there are but very few People,
who are not tainted with that kind
of Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Which Diſcourſe made the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:31072:63"/>
laugh a little; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Signe with his Head, to
ſhew that he approved of our
Diſcourſe. But I as ſoon eſpyed
a Great Man, who look't very
Pale and Wan; and cryed out
without ceaſing, with all his Force,
<hi>That there was no Mercy for him
at all! I have defaced That which</hi>
God <hi>made; for I have eaten Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>At which, I asked the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
What the Meaning of that
Extraordinary Diſcourſe ſhould
mean? Who told me,</hi> That that
Man had Eaten up the Revenues of
a Piece of Ground, and all the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold-Stuff
that was left him, to the
very Teſter of his Bed, which now
was all he had left of all his Goods;
at which he became Diſtracted, and
ſo took up theſe Words; and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
them ever ſince in his Mouth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſo we came againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who cryed out as loud and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:31072:63"/>
faſt;</hi> That the first that came ought
to ſet him at Liberty, by Releaſing
of him out of that Place; for he
was no more a Fool, ſince he came in
again of himſelf, uncompelled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which I made Anſwer,</hi> That
this Man ſpoke nothing, but what
was very good Senſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which the Governovr re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed;</hi>
Frieud, do not miſtake your
ſelf; for there is more of Malice
than Folly, in his Caſe: For the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
why he tarries here, is only
this; He having on a time Layn
with his Daughter, for which he was
put into Priſon; and had undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
Dyed for it, but that he Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
himſelf Diſtracted; and ſo
was Committed into this Place, to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter
himſelf from the Hands of
Justice.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Poet,</hi> who had been
all this time without ſpeaking of
one word, asked the Governour;
<hi>If there were not ſome, that were</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:31072:64"/>
Diſtracted for Love?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which he Anſwered,</hi> Yes;
for the greateſt Part of the Men
that were in for that very Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
return'd afar; if they do but
ſpeak of a Woman, they preſently cry
My Love, my Heart, my Dear, my
Soul! I Burn, I Dye! and the like:
And all this, is but to nouriſh up a
Company of Twattling, Fooliſh Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who believe all they ſay to be
True; and vant it abroad, that they
have made ſo many Slaves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſo, ſhewing him a little
Lodging that was all full of Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs;
and told him,</hi> That there
had been one that had layn there for
ſeveral Years: But, at last, came
one of his Friends to ſee him, who
asked me Leave to go into his Lodge
to him, to make a ſmall Collation
with him, which I readily agreed to;
ſo they emptyed ſeveral Bottles of
Wine together; which made me
fear, that the Strength of the Wine
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:31072:64"/>
might trouble his Brains: But, on
the contrary, he was ſo well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,
and his Senſes ſo well ſettled,
that after Three dayes Examination,
he was found a very Competent
Judge, and fit to be ſent out. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he parted, he writ this againſt
Wall; which is here Viſible for him
that ſhould come next, although it
be now almost all Defaced.</p>
            <p>Then our <hi>Poet</hi> began to look
at it nigh at hand; and for his
better Peruſal, he wiped it over
with the Corner of his Cloak,
that he might Read it the better:
But, contrary to his Expectation,
he found a Draft of <hi>Cupid</hi> in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch,
his Bow and Arrows
thrown down, and all in Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and over his Head theſe
Two Verſes written.</p>
            <p>Thou Son of Love, I am thine no more;
All that thou doſt, is ſuperfluous
Show'r.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:31072:65"/>
And under-neath was this Song
written, in imitation of this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
over our Souls.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The Wine alone ſhall furniſh me with
Flame;</l>
               <l>For <hi>Bacchus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> hath brought me under
his Laws,</l>
               <l>And made him throw his Arrows to
the Ground:</l>
               <l>Asking but another Glaſs,</l>
               <l>To make him as Drunk as his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs.</l>
               <l>All his Troops are on the Rout with the
Wind;</l>
               <l>And he has drank ſo much, that he is
quite Blind:</l>
               <l>For ſince he hath thrown his Belt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</l>
               <l>We ſee him lye ſleeping all the Day.</l>
               <l>For with the Juyce of the Bottle call'd
Wine,</l>
               <l>He hath quenched his Flambeau call'd
Divine.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:31072:65"/>
                  <hi>Callet,</hi> I Renounce thy Love, as Folly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>Such Pleaſures makes me Melancholly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>I abhor it, when thereon I think.</l>
               <l>But he is my Friend, that taught me
to Drink,</l>
               <l>And drove Envy from my Memory;</l>
               <l>And Reviv'd my Senſes, and Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
like to Dye.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>But our</hi> Poet <hi>quickly pulls an
Ink-horn out of his Pocket, with 
which he writes theſe Verſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a piece of Paper; ſaying,</hi> That
this was a good Matter to furniſh
him with; for it was capable of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a new thing, when he had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ordered it after his own Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But our Blower began to think
it now his time to ſpeak; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he asked the Governour,
<hi>Where they put the Alchymists?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he anſwered him;</hi> That
he never ſaw any ſuch there; for
either the Fire of <hi>Raymond</hi> alone,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:31072:66"/>
or the Mercury and Minerals conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them; or elſe, at the leaſt, it ſends
them ſtark-Naked to the Incurables;
and ſo we have none of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>But I was preſently informed by
the Governour, of a Young Man,
who had many Papers in his hand,
walking from one End of the
Courſe to the other, as if he had
been Rapt into ſome very profound
Thoughts of great Concernment.</p>
            <p>This is <hi>(ſayes he)</hi> a Poet, who
was Committed to my Charge the
other Day by a Courtier, more Fool
than himſelf; who accuſed him of
writing ſome Verſes that touch'd
him, wherein he is not ſo much as
named: Wherefore, I leave him at
his Liberty, as you ſee; and have
often ſent him away, but he as often
returns again to me, as if he had
ſome other Pretenſions here; and
here he will ſtay in ſpight of me, as
if the Houſe had been only built for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:31072:66"/>
the Commodity of the Poets. But,
for my own part, I was very Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to ſee that my Poet ſtaid, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
marked his Deſign that he had
to put the Trick upon me: But all
this time, I did not ſo much as let
him know any thing, that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Meaning of the leaſt of all
his Intrigues; neither would I break
off with a Perſon, who had ſerved
me ſo often for very rare Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements,
as he from time to time
had done.</p>
            <p>So the Governour cauſed us to
ſee ſeveral other diſtemper'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and told us of all the ſeveral
ſorts of their Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>And this done, we took our
Leaves of the Governour. But,
for my ſelf, I had almoſt every
day ſome kind of Divertiſement
or other with my <hi>Poet;</hi> till it
fell out, that I had a Journey to
go into the Country; which made
me be a long time from ſeeing of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:31072:67"/>
him, who was my only Object of
Delight.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Poet</hi> continued ſtill to
do ſomething or other, be it Good
or Bad, as his own proper Fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
led him, either to the Praiſe
or Diſpraiſe of a Part, or a Whole,
without knowing the Vertue or
Folly of the Perſon he writ of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But, Right or Wrong, he made
Verſes, and carried them to Men's
Houſes, as if it had been the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette.</hi>
And ſome gave it the ſame
Eſteem, which did a little blind
his Ambition; he believing all
they ſaid to be Truth, becauſe
they made him ſome ſmall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents.</p>
            <p>But it fortuned, at a time, that
he came to a Houſe, where I was
an Attendant in the Family; and
joyning of himſelf with me by
hazard, not knowing of me at
firſt, he gave me ſome <hi>Elogies,</hi> and
Glorious <hi>Epithetes;</hi> more for my
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:31072:67"/>
Quality that I was in, than for my
Perſonage: Not dreaming to find
me there, he prayed me very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
to Preſent to the Lord I
ſerved, ſome of his Works. But
I deſired to be excuſed; telling
him, <hi>That if I ſhould Preſent it,
there would come no Profit by it; for
my Lord was not of a Liberal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in that, or ſuch like Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be, <hi>(ſayes my</hi> Parnaſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>whiſpering in my Ear)</hi> that he
is of the Humour of ſome, who had
rather give a Hundred Pistols to a
Lady of Pleaſure, than a Teſter, or
Two Shillings to a Poet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I anſwered him;</hi> That if he
would know the Truth of it, my
Lord doth Compoſe ſome things him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and what he doth, is very
Excellent: Therefore, any thing
that is preſented to him, muſt be
the Fineſt, and beſt of Works; or
elſe, they may happen to fare no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:31072:68"/>
than an Old <hi>Italian Poet</hi> did,
who preſented him with ſomething,
as he thought, to be very Rare;
which my Lord took, and carryed it
to his Desk; and from thence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Mony, (for which the Poet
waited) he brought another thing of
the like Nature, being of his own
making, and gave it to the <hi>Poet;</hi>
ſaying, <hi>Volte pour, volte Patra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:</hi>
And this was all the Reward
he got.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Poet</hi> had ſtill the ſame Suit
of <hi>Spaniſh</hi>-Cloath, and Satten-Doublet,
pink't: Whether it was
that he was not Proud, or that he
was too Proud, I do not know;
but his Cloak had been lin'd with
Pluſh; which was plain to be
ſeen by the pieces that remain'd,
which were big enough to have
covered a Pair of Slippers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as he was talking to me
in the middle of the Court, he
was preſently ſurrounded by a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:31072:68"/>
great many Foot-Men, and the like,
which knew him, and of what
Trade he was; and asked him for
ſome of his Works, which he as
readily promiſed them: Which,
when I ſaw it, I told him;</hi> That
he had taken a very ill Place to walk
in, and that it was a bad Market:
<hi>And withal,</hi> That a Poet ought not
to be ſo Familiar, as to declare all
to the Common Sort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of People; and
that he (being a <hi>Poet)</hi> had to do
with Perſons of Quality, who would
not ſuffer Compariſons with others;
eſpecially, in Buſineſs of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>That is Truth, <hi>(ſayes he)</hi> but
Perſons of our Profeſſion, love an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Familiarity; and you need not
to doubt, but that all manner of
Publick Perſons ought to have their
Faces enlightned by every one; but
more eſpecially by the Poets, who
make up one Part of their Pulgibery
in this World; for the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:31072:69"/>
of which, they are obliged ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often to do it: For often-times,
it ſo falls out, that they are fain to
make as many Geſtures, as a Dog
that hath lost his Maſter, and ſeeks
out the means to joyn himſelf with
another. But if that fails, he ſhall
find one Wooden-fac'd Fellow or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Porters, that will ſhut the
Door againſt his Noſe; or elſe,
it may be, make him ſit Two or
Three Hours (as they ſay) to look to
the Muleat the Gate, whilst (it may be)
they loſe another better Occaſion in
another Place. And all this is done
with a little ugly-made Face, which
coſt them nothing.</p>
            <q>
               <p>But if a Spunger, or Hanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
do but chance to Careſs,
and make much of a Song, <hi>(ſayes
our Poet)</hi> he is ſtrait counted
for a Gallant Man: The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(they'l ſay) hath Means
enough; and he is importuned
to go, and Eat with the Great
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:31072:69"/>
Ones: For they'l ſwear, they
cannot tell how to Live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſeeing of him; for he is
one of the beſt Wits of the
Times, and a Perſon who (by
his Behaviour) might (in his
Travels) be a Gueſt to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by Monarchs, for his
Noble Parts: But if he make
but a little of his Neceſſities
known; Why, they will ſay,
Such an one is a Licker of Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers:
And they ſhall throw
all the Quibbles they can, and
ſhall imploy the whole Morning
in inventing one Foolery or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to pay him for his Dinner;
or they will let him Languiſh
and Dye with Thirſt, before
they will give him to Drink,
if he be at Table; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he ſhould ask for it
often-times: And after all, at
laſt, he ſhall be obliged to Riſe
and take it himſelf at the Side-Table:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:31072:70"/>
And then, it may be,
he ſhall find ſome Affront, or
other put upon him, at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Table again.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, (in a word) we
ought as much as we can with
our Conveniency, to love the
Servants as well as the Maſter;
and not to follow the Maxims
of ſome Flatterers, who will
cauſe the Servants Portion to be
leſſen'd, and have VVater put
into their VVine: And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
are obliged to run in
the Street, with a Company of
Laqueyes after him, crying a
<hi>Vinegar-Merchant,</hi> and a <hi>Cutter
of Diſhes.</hi> Such can never want
Scoffers after them, as they walk
the Streets.</p>
            </q>
            <p>But with this <hi>Poet</hi> was the
<hi>Alchymiſt,</hi> of which I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſpoken. But, to Regulate him
the better, and to fit him for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:31072:70"/>
Diſcourſe of his Calling, I
led him into an Arbor, where
we might ſtay whil'ſt a Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
was a preparing for us; and,
in the mean time, I began to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
the <hi>Alchymiſt,</hi> concerning
the <hi>Tranſmutation of Mettals:</hi>
To which he ſeemed to be a Man
very quick and ready at his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
as any ſimple ignorant
Perſon could be; who would
und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtake to hold an Argument
in <hi>Theology,</hi> that was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Fool of all thoſe, that ever
did undertake to look or ſtudy
for the <hi>Phyloſophers-Stone:</hi> For
his Brains were only Infected with
the Fumes, of the Minerals, on
which he practiſed. And ſo,
finding no more Satisfaction in my
<hi>Alchymiſt,</hi> than in my <hi>Poet,</hi> I
thought it now but high time to
come to a Concluſion with them
Both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:31072:71"/>
But in the mean time, our <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et</hi>
was ſurprized with an Extream
Heat of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi>'s Fury, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a-main for Pen and Paper;
and when he had walked a Turn
or two, he ſteps a ſide, and there
writes,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Illuſtrious Reflection! Great
and Famous merſonage!</l>
               <l>Tituler,—</l>
            </q>
            <p>But he could go no farther;
for the Greateſt of his VVorks
ſhewed him a <hi>Poet</hi> either at the
Beginning, or in the Middle of
his VVorks; but, as for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
the greateſt Part of it
was only the Fragments of ſome
ſcattered Works of others.</p>
            <p>☞ But here our Rejoycing had
end: For I knowing very well,
that my frequenting of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:31072:71"/>
could be no way Profitable,
but Prejudical to me: VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I ſought all honeſt Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to take my Leave, and to
be rid of them; promiſing them
all the Favours and Kindneſſes,
that I was able to make or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
to them, for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>And ſo Ends the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
