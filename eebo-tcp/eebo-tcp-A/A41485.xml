         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is no part
of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
in this
Dedication,
by the reflexion of
ſmooth language, to
ſhew you yourſelfe in
<pb facs="tcp:53834:3"/>
your glory, or to take
the worke of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
your worth, out
of the hands of all
the world, who are
now very intent, and
buſie at it. If honour
and approbation will
pay debts, the Nation
(I conceive) is not
much behinde with
you, for all the ſervice
you have done it: for
(as farre as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand)
you have ſcarce
enemies enough, to
deliver you out of the
hand of that curſe of
<pb facs="tcp:53834:3"/>
our Saviour, <hi>Wo be to
you when all men speake
well of you, Luk.</hi> 6. 26.
I have no authority to
queſtion the ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of your heart, in
thoſe notable and
noble engagements,
that are upon you:
yet if you will plead
your ſelfe to doe it,
the ſecurity attending
thereon, will beare
the charges. When
credit and conſcience
are yoked, and draw
the Chariot together,
<pb facs="tcp:53834:4"/>
Conſcience (oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times)
proves dull,
and heavie in the
worke, and if not
ſometimes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with the goade,
and put on, will ſuffer
credit to draw all on
the one ſide, and ſo
lay her fellow on the
wheele. It argues an
high, and excellent
frame of ſpirit where
a man can follow
with intenſneſſe of
minde, things that be
of good report, and
yet not be over-acted
<pb facs="tcp:53834:4"/>
with the goodneſſe
of the report; but
fetch the ſtrength of
that inſpiration, by
which hee is carried
on in his motion,
from the goodneſſe
of him that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it. The more
God is intereſſed in
our intentions, the
more he is like to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
himſelfe in our
executions. If wee
make him a ſtranger
in the propoſition of
our ends, hee takes no
pleaſure to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:53834:5"/>
knowne unto us
in our proſecutions,
except it be by way
of oppoſition, and
riſing up againſt us.
The royall method in
great actions, to
breake all difficulties,
and barre off diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
in ſunder,
as with a rod of iron,
is to digge out of our
ſelves as much of our
earth, that is, as much
of our ſelves as wee
can come at, and fill
up the pit, or empty
place, with God and
<pb facs="tcp:53834:5"/>
zeale for his glorie.
The conſecration of
an enterpriſe is ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
againſt abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereas to
worke for a mans
ſelfe alone, is little
leſſe, being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
than to betray
his action, and to
give ſecurity to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
that God
ſhall not build with
him, nor proſper him
in his way: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
that his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in building ſhall
be in vaine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53834:6"/>
The leaſt offenſive
(I am ſure) and yet
withall, (with ſerious
and inſide men) as
weightie a teſtimony
(as I conceive) as can
be given to your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
is to ſpeake
thus in the plaine dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of the ancient
ſimplicity unto you,
and not to ſpare
you, as farre as the
truth may doe you
good. Neither doe I
conceive, wherein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mans worth or
wiſdome can do him
<pb facs="tcp:53834:6"/>
better ſervice, than by
ſtrengthening others
to lay on himſelfe to
beare greater weights
of this treaſure, than
men of an under-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie
are able to
ſtand under.</p>
            <p>The Diſciples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
were great
looſers (for the time)
by their weakneſſe,
in this kinde; they
wanted the ſweete
company, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
of many high
and important ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
which
<pb facs="tcp:53834:7"/>
(doubtleſſe) had bin
equall too (if not
much better then) the
ſociety of ſo many
Angels, becauſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the preſent
infirmity of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
they were as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to beare the
ſtrength of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
and working,
as the frailty of the
fleſh and blood is, to
abide the glory and
preſence of thoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
of heaven.
Their gratious, and
great Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb facs="tcp:53834:7"/>
himſelfe, plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profeſſed this unto
them: <hi>I have many
things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſay
unto you, but you cannot
beare them now, Joh.</hi> 16.
12. And had they
not out growne this
weakeneſſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
by meanes of
that golden ſhowre
from heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were rained
upon with the Holy
Ghoſt, and with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
they had beene
kept faſting from the
feaſt of thoſe fat
<pb facs="tcp:53834:8"/>
things (whatſoever
they were), all the
dayes of their lives.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why
the world (ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally)
drinkes old
wine (in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Metaphor)
which is of a lower
and flatter taſte, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their veſſels are
not new, and ſtrong:
and therefore not fit
to have new wine
(which is of a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and more lively,
of a more ſtirring,
working, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
<pb facs="tcp:53834:8"/>
ſpirit) put
into them for feare of
breaking. Wee have
but the light of the
Moone inſtead of the
light of the Sunne, or
at moſt, but the light
of the Sun, inſtead
of the ſevenfold light
of ſeven dayes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<hi>Eſa.</hi> 30. 26.
ſhining to us, becauſe
wee are tender eyed,
and inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
afrayd, leſt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſhould undoe
us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53834:9"/>
Not to wrong (in
the leaſt meaſure)
the rights of Heaven
in point of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
due from us,
nor to quench the
leaſt ſparke of the joy
of our congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
for the bleſſing
of knowledge pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out unto us ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,
above the
line and meaſure of
former ages, certaine
it is, that truthes of
higheſt importance,
and which ſhould
joyne Heaven and
<pb facs="tcp:53834:9"/>
Earth neerer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and heale a great
part of that deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diſtance, which
yet lyeth betweene
men and Angels, and
ſo advance and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the ſpirituall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe,
and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
betweene the
two worlds, are little
ſtirring in the world.
One maine reaſon
whereof is, becauſe,
as the Diſciples of
Chriſt, when they
ſaw their deareſt
Lord &amp; Maſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="tcp:53834:10"/>
towards them
upon the water, were
ſore afraid, and cryed
out, ſuppoſing he had
beene a ſpirit, that
had appeared as an
executioner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
death upon
them, who yet was
the glory and crowne
of their ſecurity: ſo
many in the world
(no worſe affected
neither, to the truth,
in generall, than
they were to Chriſt)
crie out, as men out
of meaſure troubled,
<pb facs="tcp:53834:10"/>
at the firſt glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and appearing
of ſome truthes unto
them, as if they were
the ſpirits of Devills
comming upon the
world, for the ſpoile
and ruine of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
ſoules of men;
whereas, were they
capable of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,
and either
did, or were but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
willing to
know of what ſpirit
they were, they could
not but acknowledge
and confeſſe, that
<pb facs="tcp:53834:11"/>
they were of the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
and deepeſt, and
ſweeteſt confederacie
with Heaven. It was
<hi>Auſtines</hi> complaint
long ſince: <hi>Nonnulli
intelligentes citius vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt
exagitare, quod non
intelligunt, quam quaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
ut intelligant, &amp; non
fiunt humiles inquiſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
ſed ſuperbi calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores,
Aug. de Temp.
Serm.</hi> 72. I forbeare
to make Engliſh of
this Latine: becauſe
the party chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed,
are (for the
<pb facs="tcp:53834:11"/>
moſt part) men of the
language.</p>
            <p>But Sir, I conſider
the weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
of your
preſent imployments,
I know you are (with
your worthy Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants)
about a great
and laborious cure,
(the Lord proſper it
under your hands)
and farre be it from
mee to deſire, that this
ſhould ſuffer in the
leaſt, through any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of mine. I had
not preſumed thus
<pb facs="tcp:53834:12"/>
farre, but that this
little piece had ſtucke
in the birth ſome
yeares together, and
was well neere ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled,
found now a
way into the world,
by the providence of
God, and by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne
aſpect, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of that happy
conſtellation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
your ſelfe ſhine as
a ſtarre, in much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And the ſubject
of it being of that
neere affinity and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
with the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
<pb facs="tcp:53834:12"/>
piece of that
great worke you have
in hand, the reſcue,
and advancement of
the Goſpell, I ſhould
(I conceive) have
turn'd my backe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that providence
which look't mee in
the face, if I ſhould
not have preſented it
to ſome of thoſe
Worthies, whom
God hath anointed
with wiſdome, grace,
and power, as for the
bringing of many
greater, and weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb facs="tcp:53834:13"/>
things to paſſe, ſo
(the event bearing
witneſse) for the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
forth of it alſo
into the world.</p>
            <p>In which great and
honourable aſſembly,
I knew not one,
whom rather to caſt
mine eye for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
than on
your ſelfe, who, as
you are knowne to
the whole Nation, by
your worth and zeale,
for the things both of
God and Men, ſo
have you beene
<pb facs="tcp:53834:13"/>
knowne to my ſelfe,
heretofore, by ſome
more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance:
the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance
and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
whereof, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
onely to mine
owne unworthineſſe,
and negligence in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing
my ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you.</p>
            <p>I doe not in theſe
meditations put you

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader,
it was a ſaying
of <hi>Eraſmus</hi>
concerning <hi>Luther,</hi> that
poore <hi>Luther</hi> made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rich. His meaning
ſeemes to have beene, that
many were raiſed to
great places of promotion
and dignity in the
Church, and otherwiſe
<pb facs="tcp:53834:21"/>
highly rewarded for ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
up in the Popes
cauſe and quarrell againſt
him. The ſaying is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of another interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
alſo, ſomewhat
more ſpirituall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
and may have this
importance; that many
taking part with, that,
poore ſervant of God,
who was fiercely aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on every ſide, and
preſented againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to death and hell,
by the ſworne ſideſ men
of the Pope, by this ſervice
commended themſelves
<pb facs="tcp:53834:21"/>
with termes of higheſt
acceptation unto God, and
ſo were enriched with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of his grace
and favour. The Goſpel
which in this reſpect may
bee called poore likewiſe;
but the truth, glory, and
power of it, are ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
and trampled
on, by that great and
ſtrong party, the Divell
hath in the world, (may
in both ſenſes be) ſaid to
make many rich; but in
the latter, would make
many more rich then it
doth, if their hearts would
<pb facs="tcp:53834:22"/>
ſerve them, to be engaged
in ſo honourable a ſervice,
as to conſecrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and riſe up in the
defence of it.</p>
            <p>The great men of the
earth, who deſire to ride
on the world, as on a horſe
(as God is ſaid to ride
upon the Heavens) and
to rule, though not with
God, but by themſelves,
yet with an opinion of
ruling with God, ſeldome
or never ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more magnificent
and bountifull in rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
never give grater
<pb facs="tcp:53834:22"/>
wages to any workmen
they imploy, then unto
thoſe that are zealous,
active, and dextrous, to
accommodate the Goſpel
unto them; and to ſlay
the hatred and enmity
that burnes betweene the
truth and power thereof,
and their wayes and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
with the faireſt
and most plauſible co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of love and peace.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>Peters</hi> obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
concerning Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that ſuch as have
their hearts exerciſed
with covetouſneſſe, (and
<pb facs="tcp:53834:23"/>
therefore are beſt ſeene
in the art and method of
fetching in the world
apace unto them) ſtill
forſake the right way of
the Gospel (becauſe there
is little good to bee done
in that way) for ſuch a
purpoſe: the world will
ſeldome give much for
truth, and go astray after
the way of <hi>Balaam,</hi> the
ſonne of <hi>Boſor,</hi> who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the wages of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.
2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14.
15. What was <hi>Balaams</hi>
work for the doing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he ſhould have beene
<pb facs="tcp:53834:23"/>
ſo richly and royally paid?
It was onely the curſing
the people and children
of God with their wayes
and courſes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the juſtifying
and bleſsing of <hi>Balack</hi>
and his people in their
proceedings againſt them.
And what was this (in
effect) but to undertake
to reconcile Christ and
<hi>Belial:</hi> and to divide
Chriſt in, or againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?
<hi>Balack</hi> and his
rout muſt bee righteous
and just men, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of God: <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:53834:24"/>
his company muſt be chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the curſe, enemies
of God, and hated of him.
I beleeve the better halfe
of the Popes Kingdome,
two thirds of the triple
crowne would be given
to any man, that ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
(and quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
like a man by a ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable
performance) to
overthrow the State,
government, doctrines,
practices of all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches by the
Scriptures; but by the
ſame labour he ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
and reconcile the
<pb facs="tcp:53834:24"/>
rule, government, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and practiſes of
the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> with
the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Wee know the baſe
deſcent and pedigree of
farre, the greateſt part
of promotions and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the world: they
are begotten by the baſe
deſire of an earthly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
upon an earthly
greatneſſe, vainely deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of being thought to
bee of the houſe and line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of goodneſſe. Thus
(in one ſence) the poore
oppreſſed and perſecuted
<pb facs="tcp:53834:25"/>
Goſpel, makes many rich
in the world.</p>
            <p>Againe, the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
notwithstanding the
povertie of it (nay rather
becauſe of ſuch povertie)
makes many rich (and
ſad is the conſideration,
that it makes not many
more) in a better way.
As the world gives no
greater wages, of ſuch a
treaſure as it hath for
any worke, then for the
pulling downe the truth
and power of the Goſpel
where it riſeth up againſt
them. So neither doth God
<pb facs="tcp:53834:25"/>
open his hand wider in
his way of bountie, to any
ſervice, then to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of thoſe that will
labour to build them up
againe, and trie it out by
a deepe and ſolemne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
with the world,
whether light or darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhall rule, whether
God or <hi>Baal</hi> ſhall bee
hee. When our Saviour
promiſeth a Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to him that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
a Prophet, in the
name of a Prophet (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe)
hee promiſeth more
then bare meaſure, even
<pb facs="tcp:53834:26"/>
that good meaſure (which
he ſpeakes of in another
caſe, <hi>heaped up, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
downe, ſhaken
together, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
over.</hi> Now the
ſervice or worke of a
Prophet; is, as to hold
forth the word of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
to the world;
ſo (in speciall manner) to
hold faſt the ſame word,
to convince the gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9. and
not to ſuffer the world
to deſtroy, elude, or make
voide any part or parcell
of it. So <hi>Paul</hi> upon the
<pb facs="tcp:53834:26"/>
thought and mention of
that good fight hee had
fought, whereby hee had
kept the Faith (as hee
ſaith) viz. againſt the
ſubtile and outragious
malice of the Divell,
wherewith hee had inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his Angels in the
world, to make all the
havocke and ſpoyle they
could of Evangelicall
truth, was fil'd with the
hope and confidence of
that his crowne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
which (hee
ſaid) was laid up for him,
and ſhould bee given him
<pb facs="tcp:53834:27"/>
by the righteous Judge
at that day 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.
7. 8.</p>
            <p>So that if thou deſireſt
to make ſomething of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
J meane, to make
the beſt earnings of thy
times and dayes on earth
(which were they not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of a ſpirituall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
were but as
light as vanitie, as little
as nothing) there is no
labour thou canſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe,
no courſe thou canſt
runne, no ſervice thou
canſt performe, either to
God or men, like unto
<pb facs="tcp:53834:27"/>
this, to ſtand up in thy
might for the Goſpel, and
to ſet thy foote by it, and
ſo come men, come Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
come friends, come
foes againſt it, come ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
come diſhonour,
come liberty, come priſon,
come life, come death,
come Heaven, come Hell,
to ſtand to the defence of
it to the last haire of thy
head. Jt is a ſigne, that a
man knowes not to what
purpoſe he was borne into
the world, that will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Goſpel to receive
a wound by him, or
<pb facs="tcp:53834:28"/>
die before him.</p>
            <p>And being prevented
with ſuch an opportunity
&amp; ſeaſon as is now given
downe from heaven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, even above our
expectations, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable
with our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
for contending for
the Goſpel, not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the moving and
removing of every stone
which God hath not
fastned, bee it never ſo
hot or heavie, not to doe,
not to ſuffer, not to ſpeak
not to pray, not to crie,
both unto God and men,
<pb facs="tcp:53834:28"/>
not to give, not to lend,
not to ride, not to run,
not to watch, not to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
not to continue, not
to execute, whatſoever
the peace and ſafety
thereof ſhall require,
and to profeſſe that wee
love not, we regard not,
we deſire not the Goſpel,
are but expreſsions of
one and the ſame inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
            <p>Onely J muſt crave
leave to touch thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
it ſhall bee gently,
with one caveat about
thy contending; and then
<pb facs="tcp:53834:29"/>
the diſcourſe it ſelfe take
it thee, and make thee a
ſouldier in this warfare.
When thou contendest for
the Goſpel, let it not bee
grievous unto thee to
looke very narrowly, and
to conſider ſeven times
over, that thou conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
for nothing of thine
owne, for nothing of men,
inſtead of the Goſpel, and
matter of Faith. It is a
thing not to bee paſſed
over in our thoughts
without much ſadneſſe
and ſorrow, that there is
not one of many that
<pb facs="tcp:53834:29"/>
takes hold of ſhield and
buckler for the truth,
that ſtands forth with
zeale to pleade the cauſe
of the Goſpel, but ſuffers
this dead flie to lie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying
in this box of ſo
precious an oyntment;
he is not carefull to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the vile from the
precious, but takes his
owne and other mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
into part and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
of the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
with that which is
Faith and Goſpel indeed.
Great pittie it is that
darkneſſe ſhould ſhare in
<pb facs="tcp:53834:30"/>
the priviledges of light,
or that error and truth
ſhould be joyned together
in the ſame protection.</p>
            <p>I eaſily apprehend how
cutting and painefull it is
to fleſh and bloud, to ſee
thoſe opinions which
were long ſince begotten
and bred within them,
and have for many yeeres
beene tenderly nurſed
and cheriſhed in their
boſomes; yea, and (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply)
have beene their
glory and reputation, in
the world; yea, and
(perhaps, that which is
<pb facs="tcp:53834:30"/>
yet more) part of their
comfort and confidence in
God, to ſee theſe (J ſay)
caſt out upon the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,
and reputed as good
for nothing, but with ſalt
hath loſt the ſavour, to be
trodden under foote by
men; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but be as grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
in the eyes of men,
as it was to <hi>Abraham</hi>
to caſt his ſonne <hi>Iſmael</hi>
with <hi>Agar</hi> his Mother
out of doores. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.
11. Our Saviour that
perfectly knew the wayes
of the hearts and ſpirits
of men, put his finger
<pb facs="tcp:53834:31"/>
upon this ſore, in that
paſſage, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 39.
<hi>No man having
drunke old wine,
ſtraight way deſireth
new:</hi> for he ſaith, the old
is better. Mens opinions
and thoughts, with their
ſemblable practiſes, in
matter of Religion, may
well be compared to wine,
becauſe they are the great
cheerers of their ſoules
and conſciences. And
our Saviour affirming,
that men that have
drunke old wine, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or never love to
<pb facs="tcp:53834:31"/>
change their diet ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
ſeemes to imply theſe
two things, (beſides
what lieth in the plaine
ſuperficies of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.)</p>
            <p>Firſt, that men that
never dranke old wine,
that is, that were never
principled nor grounded
in any way of Religion
at all, as that never were
ingaged or interreſſed in
their judgements touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any particular contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
in Religion, may
ſooner be brought to drink
new, i. e. may with leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:53834:32"/>
reluctation and trouble
with leſſe reaſoning and
diſputing, and (for the
moſt part) with leſſe
ſhame and ſorrow bee
perſwaded to embrace
and profeſſe the truth,
then thoſe that have
beene built up and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
in a falſe way of
Religion, and beene faſt
tied to the wrong end of a
controverted point, by
their credits and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in the world. Jn
which reſpect that ſaying
of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> takes
place: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.
<pb facs="tcp:53834:32"/>
A man had better
beleeve nothing then that
which is contray to the

            <p>Secondly, that many,

by the way.</p>
            <p>My adviſe therefore
(for the preſent) is onely
this; that when thou
riſeſt up, as a man of
zeale and courage, to

(for the preſent) onely

what I conceive to bee

wee ſhall ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:)
and ſecondly, what
the meaning and waight
of that latter clauſe is
(<hi>which was once delivered to

                        <p>For the word <hi>Faith,</hi> it is
a tearme the holy Ghoſt

that grace or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit

indeed is the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

And thus the meaning
would be, that Chriſtians
ſhould earneſtly contend,
to maintaine and make
good that precious grace,
wrought in the heart, upon
which their eternall peace
and ſafety depends againſt
all that may indanger the
life and power of it.</p>

                        <p n="7">7. Secondly, this word
<hi>Faith</hi> is often by a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
expreſſion, taken for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53834:43"/>
the Doctrine of Jeſus
Chriſt, by which the grace
or habit of faith is
wrought in men, in an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
form of ſpeech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the better to expreſſe
the efficacie and vertue of

eſpecially when the
effect is great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and hath a ſpeciall
dependance upon ſuch a
cauſe: ſo that without it,
it could not be produced.
This is an emphaticall
ſpeech to commend the
excellencie of the vertue
of ſuch a cauſe. As if a
Phyſitian ſhould come to
a ſicke man, and bring his
receipt in his hand, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53834:43"/>
ſhewing it to the Patient,
ſhould ſay this to him;
here is your recovery,
here is life and health for
you. This kinde of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
is the higheſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
of that which hee
adminiſtreth: ſo we finde
that the holy Ghoſt to
commend the excellent
power of the Scriptures, or
word of God, very uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cals them by ſome or
other, of the names of
thoſe glorious and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
effects which they
produce, and raiſe in the
hearts of men; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they become of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
advantage to the
world. Thus <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 22.
the word of God is called
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53834:44"/>
by our Saviour, ſalvation:
<hi>for ſalvation is of the
Iewes,</hi> that is, the word
of God, (by which the
ſalvation of the world is
effected) is from the
Jewes; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, to
them were committed the
Oracles of God. So
<hi>Heb. 2. 2. How ſhall wee
eſcape, if we neglect ſo great
ſalvation,</hi> that is, ſo great
meanes of ſalvation. So
<hi>Solomon. Prov.</hi> 4. 13.
commends wiſedome to
men thus: <hi>keepe her, for
ſhee is thy life,</hi> that is, the
meanes by which thou
muſt live. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi>
concerning the Doctrine
that he had delivered, to
the people from God,
told them that it was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53834:44"/>
not a vaine word concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them; but that it
was their life: that is the
onely meanes to prolong
the dayes of their peace,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 47. and ſo wee
finde the glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
or Doctrine of Jeſus
Chriſt, often expreſſed by
this great and excellent
effect of it (ſaith:) thus
<hi>Gall. 1. 22. Hee who perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
us in time paſt, now
preacheth the faith,</hi> that is,
the Goſpel or Doctrine
of faith which he deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
So againe (to name
no more places) in that of
<hi>Paul. Phil.</hi> 1. 27. a place
of very neere affinitie
with this in the text; <hi>that
yee continue in one ſpirit, in

together with the faith,

                        <p>Secondly, in the later

the word is; by <hi>once,</hi> to
underſtand, but one time
in oppoſition to the word
often, or more then once;
and thus the weight of

beene once given to the

therefore, now you have
the words of eternall life,
it ſtands you in hand with
all your might to keepe
them; becauſe, if you
ſuffer them to bee taken
from you; there are no
more Chriſts, no more
ſonnes of God, to bring
them downe againe from

of the Father to the

                        <p>Secondly, the word
<hi>once</hi> ſignifies as much as
throughly, perfectly, to
purpoſe, ſufficiently, &amp;c
As where it is ſaid Chriſt
dyed once for ſinne, the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53834:48"/>
full and proper meaning
of the place, is not that
Chriſt died one time for
ſinne, that comes off but
(coldly) but hee died
once to ſinne; that is,
hee died to purpoſe;
his death was enough,
and enough for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing
of ſinne for
ever.<note place="margin">Num. 13. 30.</note> 
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 10.<note place="margin">Iudg. 16. 28.</note> And
ſo often in the Scripture
elſewhere,<note place="margin">Pſal. 74 6</note> if wee rather
chuſe this ſignification of
the word; the meaning
will fall thus: you ought
therefore to contend for
the faith, ſeeing it <hi>was once

perfectly; yea, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
<hi>delivered</hi> by
God <hi>unto the Saints:</hi> ſo
that hee meant not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53834:49"/>
it the ſecond time.
As if he had ſaid to the
<hi>Saints</hi> in the delivery of
it, looke to it, there is the
word of your peace and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life: there it is
compleat and perfect, I
meane to make no more
worke of revealing it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
unto you: if you
ſuffer it to periſh, or to be
taken from you; and
therefore (faith <hi>Iude</hi>) it
ſtands you in hand to
hold it faſt, though it coſt
you blowes: both ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
I conceive
would be put together, to
give full weight to the

That Chriſt ſuffered

from that great King
(as himſelfe ſpeakes in

                        <p>Secondly, the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

hee ſcarce ſuffered it ſo
much as to looke out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

reſerved it for companie
and ſocieitie to his owne
Sonne, when hee ſhould

God, as well as hee loved
his Angels, who ſtand
continually in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and behold his face,
yet kept them faſting
from the knowledge and
contemplation of this
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53834:86"/>
tranſcendent myſtery (at

perfect knowledge of it)
from the day of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
till the fulneſſe of

                        <p>Thirdly, the maine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient,
whereof it is

the bloud of Jeſus

                        <p>Fourthly (and laſtly)
the vertue and efficacie it

their life, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 18. &amp; 22.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. Alas, what

not the light of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance

If this beautifull gate of

Therefore let this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

indammaged, or ſuffer
waſte upon it, as the holy
Ghoſt implyeth: either

or taking away:
<hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18. or indeed as
oft by a certaine compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of both together,
by a kinde of exchange,
as by either alone: for
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53834:89"/>
there is never any truth
taken away, but there is
an errour in one kinde or
other, given or left in the
ſtead of it. As the Harlot
pleaded before <hi>Solomon.</hi>
1. <hi>King.</hi> 3. 20. againſt her

contrary to our

and that there is no

embraced upon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie

rule, which may bee tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the rule of ruls, in this

the vertue and

is that of our Saviour,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 17. that if any man

Gods will, hee ſhall know
the doctrine whether it be
of God or no, or whether
I ſpeake of my ſelfe; and
ſo concerning any man

ſpeake of themſelves or

doe the will of God, that
is, if a mans ſpirit bee
cleere and perfect with
God, that hee pitches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a right end, and labours
with all his might for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the will of God, or

what cloſes with

God, propounding
to it ſelfe no other end

to enable a man to ſee and

given by Chriſt, to a
kinde of expoſtulation,
or conteſtation made
with him, by a woman
whoſe name was <hi>Martha,</hi>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:53834:147"/>
againſt her ſiſter called
<hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The caſe (in a word)
was this. Our Saviour
Chriſt (whether volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or invited, is neither
eaſie, nor much edifying
to determine) comes
gueſt-wiſe to viſit a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when hee knew hee
ſhould finde a little neſt
(as it were) of his friends
together; <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi>
two ſiſters, and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
the brother. That
God which had made
them of one houſe, had
made them of one minde
alſo in that houſe: and
this minde wherein they
agreed, and were as
one, was the beſt and
bleſſedeſt minde of all:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53834:147"/>
they were one in the faith
and love of Jeſus Chriſt.
Notwithſtanding the two
ſiſters, however they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
well, and were
both as one in the maine;
they were both (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe)
children of the
ſame light: yet (it ſeemes)
they were of ſomewhat
differing diſpoſitions (or
apprehenſions rather, for
the diſpoſition ariſeth
from hence) in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:
Examples of
which kinde of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we ſee daily amongſt
thoſe that are not onely
truely, but even eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
godly, and religious.
<hi>Martha</hi> the elder ſiſter,
as is more generally
thought, though <hi>Mary</hi> be
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53834:148"/>
firſt named <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 1.)
her apprehenſions gave
her, that ſhee ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
her affections to her
cleare Lord (her preſent
gueſt) upon the higheſt &amp;
beſt termes, by beſtirring
her ſelfe about his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
and taking care
that all things might fall
right here. <hi>Mary</hi> on the
other hand, had another
conceit (and that more
ſpirituall, and of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reach) with her, that
ſhe ſhould beſt commend
her ſelfe and her affection
unto him, by being his
gueſt, and feeding upon
thoſe lips of his, which
were a tree of life to feed
many: by ſetting her ſelfe
downe at his feete, to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53834:148"/>
heare his preaching (as
the text ſaith.) Now
<hi>Martha</hi> apprehending,
without all controverſie,
that ſhee was the woman
at this time, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about that which was
fitteſt to bee done upon
ſuch an occaſion; and that
her ſiſter was careleſſe,
and forgetfull of what
beſt became her; and
withall (as it ſhould
ſeeme) being a little jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
that her entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might ſuffer ſome
loſſe and prejudice, and
not fully anſwer that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
plat-forme, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which ſhee had
projected it, becauſe
there was none but her
ſelfe to order and looke
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53834:149"/>
after the carriage of it:
<hi>Martha</hi> (I ſay) being
ſtrengthened with theſe
apprehenſions, comes to
Chriſt, and addreſſeth
her ſelfe unto him in theſe
words: <hi>Maſter, careſt
thou not, that my ſister
hath left me to ſerver alone?
bid her therefore that ſhee
helpe me.</hi> Shee made little
queſtion, but that Chriſt
had beene of her minde,
and would have taken her
part in this gentle quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
againſt her ſiſter. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhee thought, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken up in diſcourſe,
he did not minde or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the matter between
them; and therefore ſhe
would bee a remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
unto him: and comes
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53834:149"/>
and pleades her owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie
to have things
as ſhee deſired to have
them for his entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſuggeſts, that
if hee pleaſed to
ſpeake to her ſiſter to
helpe, ſhee was at very
good leaſure to doe it.
To this requeſt of <hi>Martha</hi>
to have her ſiſter away
from Chriſts feete, from
hearing his word, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
returnes this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
anſwer. <hi>Martha,
Martha, thou carest and art
troubled about many things;
One thing is needfull: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hath choſen the good part,
which ſhall not bee taken
from her. Martha Martha:</hi>
the duplication of the
word, ſheweth that his
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53834:150"/>
ſpirit was ſtirred within
him upon the motion, and
that his anſwer was ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and earneſt in a high
degree. <hi>Thou careſt and
art troubled, &amp;c.</hi> as if hee
ſhould ſay: thou findeſt
many things to take up
thy time, and trouble thy
ſelfe about that might
well bee ſpared and left
undone, and no man hurt,
or the worſe for it; and
in the meane time forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
and doſt not conſider
that one thing, which is
of Soveraigne neceſſity
indeed. But <hi>Mary</hi> thy
ſiſter, ſhee remembers it,
ſhe conſiders what it is to
learne the myſteries of
heaven, and to take hold
of the opportunities of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53834:150"/>
eternall life. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
howſoever thou
thinkeſt thou haſt eſpied
a Moate in her eye, and
blameſt her for doing
what ſhe doth: yet I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
her eye to bee ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
and her ſight cleare,
and muſt approve of
what ſhe hath done. <hi>Mary

which ſhall not bee taken
from her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of which part of the
anſwer, there is a double
expoſition uſually given,
according to the one, the
ſenſe fals thus: <hi>Maries
part,</hi> is therefore the good
part, and wiſely choſen;
becauſe it ſhall for ever
continue with her, ſhee
ſhall follow this her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment

in heaven,
where ſhe ſhall bee taken
up and exerciſed in the
contemplation of God,
and of the great things of
his glory, all the dayes of
eternity. This is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
that the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
and Popiſh Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
generally magnifie
upon this place, onely to
vilifie and beate downe
(as not onely their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but profeſſion alſo
is) the interpretation
which <hi>Calvin</hi> gives,
which yet (doubtleſſe) is
the beſt and trueſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
out the ſenſe thus:
<hi>Mary hath choſen the good
part, which, &amp;c.</hi> As if hee
ſhould ſay: in as much as
<hi>Mary</hi> hath done wiſely;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53834:151"/>
and made a good choyce
for her ſelfe, it ſhall not
be taken away from her
by me, I ſhall no wayes
put her by it, or adviſe her
to make any other choyce
inſtead of it. Thus wee
have the coherence toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the ſenſe and
meaning of the words.</p>
                  <p>In which words (thus
apprehended) wee have
theſe two things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The approbation of
<hi>Maries</hi> choyce, by the
great and infallible Iudge
of all queſtions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,
the Lord
Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His reſolution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, not to diſturbe, or
in errupt her in this her
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53834:152"/>
choyce: in theſe words:
<hi>which ſhall not bee taken
from her.</hi> Both theſe
breaſts are full of milke,
and ſpirituall nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and would gladly
unlade their treaſures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your boſomes, as well
the one as the other. But
I ſhall entertaine your
Chriſtian and patient at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
at this time, with
the opening and handling
of this one obſervation
onely from the former
branch (Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of <hi>Maries</hi>
choyce.)</p>
                  <p>The minding and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
opportunites for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
is a thing of high and
ſpecial acceptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with God.</p>
                  <p>The Lord loves none
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53834:152"/>
better than thoſe that
love themſelves beſt in
this way. Hee that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the higheſt termes of
reſolutions for Heaven,
he, he is the man in whom
the ſoule of the God of
Heaven chiefly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
hee that can let the
world paſſe by, &amp; not be
moved nor ſtirred at it,
but will be on fire to lay
hold on Eternall life,
when that comes in his
way, hee is the man that
ſhall be called great in
the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
by the great King of
Heaven himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the opening of
the Doctrine; I will (with
all convenient brevity)
ſhew theſe two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:53834:153"/>
1 What theſe opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for Heaven are, and
what I meane by them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 What I meane by the
improvement of them.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
it is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that there is nothing
that be falls us in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
world, good or evill;
nothing that befalleth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men (if the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
there of comes unto
us) nothing we thinke, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
we ſpeake, or do in
any kinde; nothing that
other men thinke, ſpeake,
or doe, if it falls within
the ſphere of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but by a ſtrong
hand of grace, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
wiſdome, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to a ſpirituall uſe,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53834:153"/>
and be compelled, and
forced to doe ſervice for
Heaven. A gratious and
wiſe heart knowes how
to ſubdue all the wayes of
God, and all a mans own
wayes, and all the wayes
of other men, and put
them under this tribute.
Amongſt all the wayes of
the providence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation
of God, in the
adminiſtration of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of the world, there
is none ſo drye, or barren,
but there is ſomewhat of
God in it, there is ſome
ingredient or other, either
of his wiſedome, power,
juſtice, goodneſſe, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes,
or the like; which
by ſervent and intenſe
conſideration may be
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53834:154"/>
drawne out as a ſpirituall
extraction, and be found
as light prepared for the
ſoule. For there is not the
leaſt beame of glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this light; the leaſt
ſhining of the knowledge
of God upon the face of
the ſoule, but it is of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
influence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
for heaven. <hi>This
is life eternall to know thee
the onely true God, &amp;c.
Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. The Heaven
and happineſſe of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature
depends upon the
happineſſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                  <p>So againe, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
we can thinke, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
love, feare, or the
like; nothing wee ſpeake
or doe, but if wee minde
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53834:154"/>
it, there is ſome taſte and
reliſh in it of the frame
of the heart within, ſome
diſpoſition or other is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and conſequently is
manifeſted by all theſe.
Now every degree of
this light alſo, every
touch or ſtreyne of the
knowledge of our ſelves,
directly tends to enlarge,
and ſtrengthen our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God (as might
be ſhewed at large, but
that wee have no leaſure
now for digreſſions) and
therefore is a gale of wind
alſo to fill our ſayles for
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wee can ſee, or
heare, or know concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
other men, as either
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53834:155"/>
ſpoken, intended, or
done by them. Whether
it be that which is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
holy, and good, or
otherwiſe wicked, ſinfull,
and vile; but that we may
ſee the truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
acted (as it were) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us therein, which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
in every place, as of
the manner, law and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of ſpirituall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
grace, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
on the one hand: ſo
likewiſe, of ignorance,
vanity, and profaneneſſe
on the other. So that I
ſay, there is nothing in
this world wee can meete
withall in any place, or at
any time, either from
God, or from our ſelves,
or from other men, be
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53834:155"/>
they things whoſe faces
ſeeme to ſtand quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, and no point of
the Compaſſe towards
Heaven, which yet by a
ſtrong hand of grace (as
was ſaid) and by a dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of ſpirituall wiſdome,
may be turned about, and
be made faire advantages
and oportunities for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>But howſoever, I would
not in the Doctrine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
ſuch opportunities
as theſe, which are but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
remote, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
importance. Yet I
chiefly intend thoſe that
are more proper, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
and that have a neare
affinity with heaven, that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53834:156"/>
are opportunities prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
(as it were) and made
to our hand, and need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſing.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch are, 1. The
Miniſtery of the Goſpell,
eſpecially in the hand of
a Miniſter that is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and enabled of God
to bring forth life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
into light by
the Goſpell, when wee
have no reall hindrance
or cauſe of abſence, as by
ſickneſſe, weakneſſe, or
ſome other indiſpence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
occaſions, &amp;c. this is
an opportunity for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the firſt Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                  <p>To which we may adde
(in the ſecond place) the
adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53834:156"/>
wherein wee
may feed upon the great
and holy things of Jeſus
Chriſt by other ſenſes, as
wee do by hearing in the
miniſtrie of the Word;
eſpecially the Sacrament
of the Supper, where hee
that is our life (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſpeaketh) the great
Captaine of our ſalvation,
preſents himſelfe, and his
deareſt love unto us in
thoſe elements of bread &amp;
wine: whereunto uniting
himſelfe Sacramentally,
they goe down together,
bread and wine into the
body, and Chriſt unto
the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another great
opportunity for Heaven,
is the preſence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53834:157"/>
of holy men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſuch as are able to
draw waters of life for us;
out of the wels of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh) that
are able out of the good
treaſure of their hearts (as
our Saviour calleth it) are
able to furniſh us with all
variety of ſpirituall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when God
meets with us in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or appearance of
fire, I meane in any
great or remarkeable try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
this is a ſpeciall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
for Heaven al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;
now is there a time
or ſeaſon, wherein to be
made partakers of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
(as the Scripture
ſpeakes) the fiery chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53834:157"/>
of afflictions, are ſtill
ſent for our hearts to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
them up into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Againe fifthly. When
God (on the other hand)
appeares unto us, as hee
did unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to
the Elders of Iſrael. <hi>Exod.</hi>
34. 10. with the likeneſſe
of a Saphir ſtone under
his feete, and as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
when it is cleare,
when he cauſeth his Sun
of proſperity to ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, whether ſpirituall
or temporall, and doth
things for us, whether in
the affaires of this world,
or of that which is to
come, which wee looked
not for, when either hee
lifts us up from the duſt of
the earth, and ſets us with
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53834:158"/>
the princes of his people,
or delivers our ſoules that
have dwelt among lyons,
devouring feares, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
terrours, and brings
them forth into a wealthy
place, and ſettles their
abode amongſt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
of the life to come:
this alſo is a rich oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
for Heaven: now is
it ſeaſonable to get ſuch a
fire of love to God, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in our hearts, that ſhall
never be quenched.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, when a man is
choſen, and called forth
by ſome ſpeciall hand of
providence, to doe any
ſpeciall ſervice for God,
or for the Goſpell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by ſuffering or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
this is a ſpeciall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53834:158"/>
and opportunity
alſo, for a man to take
hold of Heaven, and to
ſet life and immortality
on working within him.
<hi>Let patience</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iames,
cap. 1. verſ.</hi> 4.) <hi>have her
perfect worke. i. e.</hi> Never
goe about to ſhift or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
any ſuffering what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
for Chriſts ſake,
by any baſe or unlawfull
way: ſuffer on till God
himſelfe delivers you,
and let not Sathan be
your deliverer, this (I
conceive) is to let pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
have her perfect
worke. The ground of
this exhortation is: That
they might be perfect and
entire (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) wanting
nothing, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53834:159"/>
might be a compleate,
and immediate prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and fitneſſe for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
for after wee have
done the will of God by
beleeving, and walking
holily, we have yet need
of patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 36.) that we
may receive the promiſe.
Faith is our foundation,
holines of life as the wals,
and ſufferings as the roofe
&amp; conſummation of our
building up for Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, any <hi>Lucidum
intervallum,</hi> any reſpite
or breathing time from
the workes and labours of
our hands from our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
callings, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
is a ſeaſon
and opportunity for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53834:159"/>
reading, meditation,
&amp;c. and conſequently for
Heaven. When the world
hath nothing to doe with
us, it is our fitteſt ſeaſon to
have to do with God. We
might inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:
but by theſe you
perceive what the ſpeciall
opportunities for Heaven
are, which are chiefly
intended in the doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Wee come (in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place) to ſhew you
(in a word) what wee
mean by improving theſe
opportunities. This is
nothing elſe, but the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of ſuch matter of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and advantage from
them, as the nature and
condition of every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
doth afford. It
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53834:160"/>
is like the gathering of
fruit from the tree that
beares it, or drawing
milke out of the breaſt
that gives it. As when a
Sermon is preached, the
receiving, and gaining in
that knowledge, that
quickning, that raiſing of
heart, that ſtrengthening
of the inner man, that
weakning and diſabling
of corruption, and the
like, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and importance of
things therein delivered,
this is the improving of
ſuch an opportunity. So
in time of affliction, and
triall, for a man to joyne
with the chaſtiſement of
the Lord, &amp; to helpe his
rodde forward, with that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53834:160"/>
ſpirituall worke and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
about which it is
ſent, which (happily) may
be the awakening of us
out of the ſleepe of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
the quickning of us in
the wayes of holineſſe, &amp;
workes of righteouſneſſe,
the ſetting of our hearts,
and this preſent world
aſunder, at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
the reforming of
ſomewhat in our lives,
and practice, which is
heterogeneall, and ſo a
ſtaine, and blemiſh to the
reſt of our converſation,
or the like. Now when a
man ſhall take the rodde
of God that is upon him
(as it were) in o his owne
hand, and by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and aſſiſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53834:161"/>
ſhall compell his foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
heart to let goe the
hold it hath taken on va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in any kinde; and to
ſtoope to that yoke of
righteouſneſſe, which
God would put upon it
(which it may be is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him to doe at
another time, when hee
hath not the like aſſiſtance
from Heaven, in a way
of affliction: moſt mens
hearts are unruly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachable,
except it bee
when there is a rodde at
hand) this is an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity;
the like is to be
conceived in other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
There may bee
an inferiour and under im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53834:161"/>
when a man gaines
ſomewhat by it, but yet
more might have beene
made of it: and there is a
juſt, and full improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when a man ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the tree cleane, and
leaves none of the fruite
behinde him, ſo much as
in the outermoſt bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
The richer and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
the improvement is,
the greater and higher is
the acceptation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God.
This for the unfolding of
the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>We come (in the ſecond
place) to heape more of
the authority of Heaven
upon the head of it, and
to eſtabliſh the truth of it
with the teſtimony of
more witneſſes. That
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53834:162"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint of God himſelfe
concerning his people,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 28. 29.</note> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the earneſtneſſe of
his deſire towards them
this way, is a faire and full
evidence, &amp; confirmation
hereof. For <hi>they are a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
void of counſel, neither
is there any understanding
in them. Oh, that they were
wiſe, that they underſtood
this, that they would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their latter end! How
ſhould one of them chaſe a
thouſand, &amp;c. Oh that they
were wiſe, and would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their latter end, &amp;c.</hi>
This ſheweth that God
doth highly prize and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
this wiſedome, and
underſtanding in men and
women, which makes
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53834:162"/>
them treaſure up for
themſelves in Heaven
and become provident
for their latter end. His
ſoule longs (as it were) for
ſummer fruit, to ſee his
people fild with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of this wiſdome; yea
and profeſſeth himſelfe
willing (as it were) to pay
for this his longing, if
hee might have it upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
termes. How ſhould
one of them chaſe a thou
ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp;c. He would gladly
hire men &amp; women with
the beſt of this world,
to worke wiſely for that
which is to come. So our
Saviour in that paſſage
of Scripture,<note place="margin">Luke. 12.</note> ſeems to
be much take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; (to ſpeak
with due reverence) to be
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53834:163"/>
even raviſhed, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
out of himſelfe,
and caſt into an extaſie of
joy, and holy content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
upon the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſuch a diſpoſition,
and wiſe behaviour, as we
ſpeake of, in mannaging
and improving opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
for Heaven. Let
your loynes be girded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and your lights bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
and ye your ſelves
like unto men that waite
for their Maſter: and,
<hi>Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants,
whom the Lord, when hee
commeth ſhall finde wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
Verily I ſay unto
you, hee willgird himſelfe
about, and make them ſit
downe at table, and will
come forth and ſerve them.</hi>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:53834:163"/>
By girding up the loynes
and keeping their lights
burning, watching, &amp;c.
hee meanes nothing elſe
(in effect) but a diligent
and carefull mannaging of
the opportunities for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that were before
them. Now rather than
ſuch men as theſe ſhould
want honour, hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
once more to forget
his owne greatneſſe, and
to diſpenſe with Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie:
and will be found
yet againe in the forme of
a ſervant. I onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
one Teſtimony more
from the Scripture (let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
paſſe others without
number, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 26. &amp;c.
And to him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth,
and keepeth
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53834:164"/>
my words unto the end,
I will give power over
Nations. And hee ſhall
rule them with a rodde of
Iron, and even as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of my Father.
And I will give him the
morning Starre. This
fame overcomming and
keeping the words of
Chriſt unto the end, is
nothing elſe (being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted)
but the acting
of the true greatneſſe of
ſpirit we ſpeake of in the
Doctrine, which is ſeene
in the taking hold of, and
managing, the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that lie for heaven,
and carrying the affaires
of his ſoule before him
with a high hand. Now
of what acceptation this
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53834:164"/>
high and excellent ſtreine
of ſpirit is with the Lord
Chriſt, is eaſie to judge,
by thoſe rich and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ingredients, that are
put into the reward an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
thereunto. <hi>I will
give him power over Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
&amp;c.</hi> wee muſt not
ſtand now to make valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the particulars:
in the generall, they are
things tranſcendently
glorious: of this there is
no queſtion; it were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to make the pile of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
greater: but
wee have the minde of
God and of Chriſt in the
point wee labour for, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
already, wee
come therefore (in the
third place) to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53834:165"/>
the Doctrine from
the grounds and reaſons
of it. Amongſt many we
ſhall onely make uſe of
foure.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God therefore
highly approves this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition
we ſpeake of in
men, of minding and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
all advantages for
heaven, this ſame lying
out of the ſoule with all
its ſtrengh and all its
might for making good
the things of eternity,
becauſe hee hath given
commandement that ſo it
ſhould bee, and ſo his
voyce is obeyed in it.
Now this is a thing fully
ſympathizing and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with that nature or
diſpoſition in God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53834:165"/>
hee deſires to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
obeyed, and his will
ſubmitted unto by the
creature, it is as marrow
and fatneſſe unto him, it
is that wherein his ſoule
delighteth. <hi>Hath the Lord</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Samuel) as great
delight in burnt offerings
and ſacrifices, as in obeying
the voyce of the Lord?
Behold, to obey is better
then ſacrifice: and to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
then the fat of Rams.</hi>
The reaſon of the great
teſtimony given unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
(and that by God
himſelf) <hi>that he was a man
according to his owne heart,</hi>
is ſaid to be this, becauſe
hee would <hi>fulfill all his
will. Act.</hi> 13. 22. This is
ſome of the ſweeteſt and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53834:166"/>
pleaſanteſt wine he drinks
from this great Vine-yard
of the world, which hee
hath planted, to have his
voyce obeyed, his will
done by his creature.
Now that it is the will of
God, that men ſhould
thus weather all their
ſayles for heaven, and
carefully gather in all
winds that blow to make
that port or haven, it hath
beene already ſufficiently
proved from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
if you deſire to
have this meaſure heaped
up, and running over, take
that of <hi>Paul</hi> yet further.
1. <hi>Tim. 6. 12. Lay hold on
eternall life.</hi> Lay hold on
it: but where is it, that a
man may lay hold? It
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53834:166"/>
paſſeth by us daily in the
precious occaſions and
opportunities therof, and
when theſe are taken
hold of, and improved
diligently, eternall life
is laid hold of. As thoſe
two blinde men in the
Goſpel laid hold on their
naturall ſight, when hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that Ieſus paſſed by,
they tooke the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and ſtood forth and
cryed with might and
maine: <hi>O Lord, the Son of
David, have mercie on us.</hi>
This for the firſt reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe this
making out for heaven,
and mortality with a high
hand, is the trueſt and
moſt naturall and genuine
ſtreine or fruit of that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53834:167"/>
principle of reaſon and
underſtanding which God
hath put into men: it is
a mans wiſedome (as the
Scripture expreſſion is)
to doe it. As on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
to lay hold on this
worlds good, as riches,
honours, pleaſures, &amp;c.
with a neglect or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie
about the great
things of heaven, is (in
<hi>Solomons</hi> phraſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>
2. 3.) <hi>to take hold on folly.
i. e.</hi> to give out a mans ſelfe
or his ſtrength for the
imployment of ſuch
things, as no man
would doe, but hee that
makes folly of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.
And ſo the holy
Ghoſt (we know) every
where in the Scriptures,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53834:167"/>
calleth the neglect in
men, about ſpirituall and
heavenly things by the
name of <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe,</hi>
and ſometimes of
<hi>Madneſſe,</hi> and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it is nothing elſe
but the principle of
Reaſon imbaſed, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
&amp;c grown out of kinde
altogether; that makes
this preſent world a
ſtumbling block to men,
in their way to heaven.
And therefore for a man
to decline it, or ſtep over
it, and in the very face
and preſence of all the
deſireable and pleaſant
things of the world, to
goe forth in his might
from day to day, to make
all occaſions and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53834:168"/>
for the things of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
muſt needs bee
the pureſt, and higheſt,
and moſt exquiſite ſtrein
of that Soveraigne facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Reaſon, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in a man.</p>
                  <p>It may bee you will
here aske: but what is
there in this to gaine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
from God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in any ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
degree (as you
ſeeme to imply) if men
bee wiſe and prudent for
themſelves, is God ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
or delighted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with?
Or is there any
true excellencie or worth
in ſuch a thing? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how is this any
ground or reaſon of the
point?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:53834:168"/>
I anſwer, yes (my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
it is a matter of
high contentment to the
Almighty Creator of all
things, to ſee the workes
of his hands keeping the
Law of their creation,
and duely acting the parts
that are aſſigned, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them in their ſeverall
courſes and ſtations in the
world, to behold them in
the true, full, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate
exerciſe of all
thoſe ſeverall motions,
properties, and faculties,
wherewith hee hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
them according
to their kinde. To ſee
the Sunne ſhining, the
ſtreames running, the
birds flying, and all fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
trees bearing fruit in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53834:169"/>
their kinde, the Vine la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with Grapes, the
Olive tree with Olives,
&amp;c. is a ſweete and holy
contentment unto God: he
beholds his own wiſdom,
goodneſſe, and power, in
the glaſſe hee hath made
for that purpoſe. Now as
all other creatures have
their ſpecifical properties
diſtinct every one from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(with ſutable opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
belonging to them)
and it is the exerciſe or
putting forth of that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
is proper to every one
by that creature whoſe it
is, and not by another,
that is ſo comely and
gracefull in the creation,
ſo pleaſing unto God, as
when every tree or plant,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53834:169"/>
or ſeed brings forth fruit
according to their kinde
(as the Scripture ſpeaketh,
as when the Vine bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth Grapes, the Fig
tree Figges (if Vine and
Figge tree both ſhould
bring forth Grapes and
no tree Figges, this would
be a maime, or breach in
the creation) ſo is there
given unto man a ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
excellencie of reaſon
or underſtanding, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſtinct from, but in
dignity farre above all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
or properties
of other creatures. And
when hee walkes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this principle,
when hee guides his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
with diſcretion and
underſtanding indeed,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53834:170"/>
when he ſeekes his chiefe
good and happineſſe in a
way leading directly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; now hee bringeth
forth fruit in his kinde,
and doth not degenerate
into the diſpoſition of the
brutiſh creature that is
beneath him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is
that that is ſo highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
unto God. And hence
it is, that the feare of
God, and his ſervice, and
the add re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ment of the
creature unto him, are
ſtil commended unto us in
Scripture, under the name
of wiſedome, underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
&amp;c. <hi>And unto man
he (i. God) ſaid, the feare
of the Lord is wiſedome,
and to depart from evill is
underſtanding. (Ieb.</hi> 28.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53834:170"/>
28.) As if hee ſhould
have ſaid, therefore holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and the feare of
the Lord are required by
God of the creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or underſtanding,
or becauſe hee ſhall ſhew
himſelfe wiſe or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
by the practice
of them. And doubtleſſe
all duties whatſoever are
comprehended in that
one word of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
(emphatically under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood)
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>i. quit
your ſelves like men.</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 13. And ſo the
ground and reaſon of the
wrath and heavie diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of God againſt looſe
and ſinful men, is ever and
anon certified under the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53834:171"/>
name of Fooliſhneſſe. <hi>It
is a people of no underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
therefore hee that
made them will not have
mercie on them, and hee
that formed them will ſhew
them no favour. Eſay.</hi> 27.
11. Implying that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
quarrell or controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
the Creator hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Man, is the letting
fall of that great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
principle of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
within him, his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or underſtanding, or
a ſuffering of that in its
way of degeneration.</p>
                  <p>A third reaſon of the
Doctrine, why this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
and ſtriving for
this incorruptible crowne
of righteouſneſſe with ſo
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53834:171"/>
high a hand, ſhould bee
ſo highly approved by
God, is: Becauſe ſuch a
man will take the God of
heaven along with him in
his way, will bee ready
and able to doe great
things for him on earth:
ſuch a man will make the
Altar of his God fat, and
inrich the treaſurie of his
glory, will rejoyce over
his Lord and Maſter, to
doe him all the good hee
can, to honour him with
all hee hath; will make
the crowne of glory to
flouriſh upon the head of
Ieſus Chriſt his Lord: yea
that man that is reſolved
indeed to quit himſelfe
like a man for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heaven, &amp; ſeeks it
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53834:172"/>
with his whole heart, is
ready (if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
to part with it when
he hath obteined it, and
beſtow it upon him that
hath given it unto him, if
he ſtood in need of it: He
that loves God like a
God (and heaven, or ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
is nothing elſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
account, but God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
in fulneſſe, or to
the height) will bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to part with God, for
Gods ſake, <hi>i.</hi> if his glory
ſo required it; and much
more with all the world,
as we ſee in <hi>Paul:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>hee that deſpiſeth or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his owne ſoule</hi> (as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi>
expreſſion is)
that under-prizeth the
great things of eternity,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53834:172"/>
that pincheth and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
(all that hee dares)
in his paines and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and is ſtill afraid
leſt hee ſhould doe too
much, that is, (in his
owne interpretation) any
thing at all more then
needs muſt, to bee ſaved:
ſuch a man will never bee
but as a dry and barren
wilderneſſe to the God of
heaven: Ieſus Chriſt
will never be great of his
making. Hee that longs
(with any earneſt long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
to ſee his God face
to face, will not be afraid
to looke the Divell and
all the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and all the terrible
things of the world in
the face: hee will make
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53834:173"/>
glorious paſtime with
Lyons, and Beares, and
Dragons, and be ready to
plead the cauſe of his
God in flames of fire.
This is given for a reaſon
why <hi>Moſes refuſed to bee
called the ſonne of</hi> Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs
<hi>daughter, and choſe
rather to ſuffer affliction
with the people of God, then
to injoy the pleaſures of
ſinne for a ſeaſon; to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
the rebuke of Chriſt
greater riches then the
treaſures of Egypt. viz.
becauſe hee had reſpect to
the recompence of reward:</hi>
                     <note place="margin"> Heb. II. 24. 25. 26.</note>
as if it had beene ſaid,
had hee not had a good
minde to heaven, and
beene reſolute to take all
opportunities and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53834:173"/>
that way, for the
making good that great
piece the world would
have gained him in, and
God and his Chriſt
ſhould have loſt the great
and honourable ſervice
which hee did for them.
This is a third reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt
reaſon, why God ſo
highly approves and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
this labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
of the ſoule for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is, becauſe ſuch a
man furniſheth him with
fit matter to worke upon
in that kinde of worke,
wherein of all other hee
is chiefely delighted,
ſuch a man is as fine clay
in his hand ready prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to make a veſſell of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53834:174"/>
honour. God may poure
out abundantly of the
riches of his bounty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch a man in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and make him as
great in heaven, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth:
ſuch a mans way
and nobleneſſe of ſpirit
will beare a great weight
of glory, and that in ſuch
a way, and upon ſuch
termes that he that layeth
it upon him, ſhall ſuſteine
no loſſe nor prejudice by
ſo doing. For this is the
caſe: the great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
God of heaven,
hath abundance of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by him, and infinite
treaſures of glory, which
burne in his hand (as wee
uſe to ſay) and hee is pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
(as it were) within
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53834:174"/>
himſelfe till they bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
according to his
minde: and this muſt bee
amongſt the children of
men. Hee hath prepared
and framed many crownes
of glory, and he longs to
finde heads to ſet them
upon. The world furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him very ſparingly
with ſuch perſons; the
fearfull, and unbeleeving
and abominable, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,
&amp;c. are not meete to
weare them: he that hath
made them will rather
breake them in pieces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and ſtamp them to
powder, then that they
ſhould ever come upon
the heads of ſuch; hee
cannot ſatisfie himſelfe in
ſuch a diſpoſall of them,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53834:175"/>
nor make any thing (to
his minde) of his bounty,
if it ſhould bee carried in
ſuch a way. Such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and wiſe worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as God is, muſt not
make any ſuch looſe or
ſtaring joynts (as it were)
in any part of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and diſpenſation, as
to joyne and put things
together that have no
aptneſſe, meetneſſe, or
proportion, the one to
the other, as a baſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
minded man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and the undefiled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of heaven, God
will never put theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But when he meets
with fit ſubjects, with
matter duly prepared to
worke upon in this kinde,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53834:175"/>
there is no kinde of work
in all that infinite variety
that paſſeth through his
hand, wherein hee takes
the like delight and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
as to bee heaping
rewards upon the heads
of his creatures, and to
bee employing the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the unſpeakable
riches of his bounty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. It is true, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
God doth, he doth
it like himſelfe, and his
workes are comely and
beautifull in their kinde
and ſeaſon, and have faire
impreſſions of the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and righteouſneſſe
of their great work-man
upon them. But yet if we
conſult narrowly with
the Scriptures, wee ſhall
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53834:176"/>
finde that God is never
more himſelfe in any
thing he doth, then in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good to thoſe that
feare him, in rewarding
and recompencing thoſe
that are capable of his
magnificence in that way.
He takes a delight in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grace, in principling
the hearts and ſoules of
men from heaven to work
righteouſneſſe, and to live
holily, &amp;c. Againe hee
takes great delight to ſee
the fruits of this grace of
his in men, to ſee men
ſhining in holineſſe of life
and converſation, as lights
in this preſent world. But
yet he takes a greater and
higher comentment then
in both theſe, to reward
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53834:176"/>
and recompence the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſervice of thoſe that
obey him: yea hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
their holineſſe, and
ſervice with ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to theſe. This rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and magnifying
thoſe that ſerve him, is
that, that hath the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
neareſt, and
moſt entire connexion
with his glory. <hi>Oh that
my people had barkened
unto mee</hi> (faith the Lord
himſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.) and
<hi>Iſrael walked in my wayes!</hi>
Why, what if God had
had his wiſh or deſire
herein? What would it
have beene unto him?
Oh yes, here had beene
worke indeed for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53834:177"/>
and bountifull hand
of God, here had beene an
opportunity for him to
have done great things
for them, to have bleſſed,
and proſpered his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
Oh this is (as it
were) a ſecond Heaven
to him, that is Lord both
of Heaven and Earth. <hi>I
ſhould ſoone have humbled
their enemies, &amp;c. and
have fed them with the fat
of wheate, &amp;c.</hi> The great
God would gladly have
beene doing this way,
that ſo Heaven and Earth
might have rejoyced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
You may finde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scriptures of like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 48. 18.
<hi>Deut. 32. 29. &amp;c.</hi> This for
the fourth and laſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:53834:177"/>
The uſe of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is, firſt for confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that opinion;
which hath beene, and (I
beleeve) ſtill is maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> that it
is a thing unlawfull and
diſpleaſing unto God,
for any man to worke <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitu
merceds,</hi> to doe,
though never ſo well,
with an eye to any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to provoke, or ſtir
up himſelfe to well doing
by the conſideration of
the great wages of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which God hath
pitched, and covenanted
with men upon it. They
hold it not lawfull for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man to warme at this
fire, or to ſaile with this
winde. Doubtleſſe with
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53834:178"/>
more, and more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſuperſtition, than
was in the Doctrine of
thoſe teachers, who (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Pauls</hi> repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the heads of their
teaching) taught their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
ſaying. <hi>Touch not,
taſt not, handle not, Coloſſ.</hi>
2 21. If it be a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
for a man to
ſtrengthen his hand in the
worke of the Lord by
the remembrance, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
certainly God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
hath taught men to do
evill, that good may come
of it, for hee often in the
Scriptures heapeth theſe
coales of fire upon the
heads of men, &amp; teacheth
our fingers to fight that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53834:178"/>
good fight of faith, by
holding forth the crowne
of righteouſneſſe unto us.
But becauſe the whole
carriage of the point (in
a manner) hath beene a
pregnant, and ſufficient
conviction of this errour,
wee ſhall make no further
waſte of words or time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the point de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
is ſerviceable alſo
and uſefull by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and that chiefly
in two particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it this cloſe, and
home following the ſent
of Heaven, this purſuing
eternall life, with all the
ſtrength and might of the
ſoule, be a thing ſo much
ſet by, ſo highly accepted
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53834:179"/>
with God, then may wee
(in a word) take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and informe our
ſelves from hence, that
the coldneſſe, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and generall indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie,
that is found in
farre the greateſt part of
the world this way, who
ſeeke for Heaven, as if
they ſought not, and
runne for this crowne of
life, as if they cared not
to obtaine, is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
unto him, a ſinne
that will cauſe the wrath
of God to ſmoake againſt
him, that ſhall be found
under the guilt of it. It is
a piece of deſperate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
in the Devill, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that ſinne, to be
ſtrucken out of the roll, or
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53834:179"/>
catalogue of ſinnes, which
flayeth with the moſt
certaine, and inevitable
deſtruction, and taketh
neerer and faſter hold on
hell, than a thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſinnes. <hi>How ſhall wee
eſcape</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle,
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 3.) <hi>if we neglect ſo
great a ſalvation?</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſcarce ſo much as a
poſſibility of Salvation
unto thoſe that ſhall bee
looſe hearted about the
ſeeking of it, and yet how
few are thoſe, that know
to make any ſinne at all of
that ſinne, which is ſo
neere of blood to that
ſinne of ſinnes, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
ſinne againſt
the Holy Ghoſt! Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Adultery, Stealing,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53834:180"/>
Lying, Drunkenneſſe, and
ſuch like, the conſciences
of many are ſomewhat
ſhie of, as having affinity
with hell indeed: but
that ſinne which carrieth
eternall vengeance, and
damnation in the mouth
of it, that ſtrikes the ſoule
dead at the roote, this
ſame caſting the great
things of Jeſus Chriſt
behind our backes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them onely our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and ſubordinate
care, this according to the
ſcale of the world is little
(if any thing at all) out of
the way to heaven, men
are loath to judge either
themſelves or others wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, for being never
ſo indifferent, and cold
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53834:180"/>
herein. But if the God of
Heaven ſo highly magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the zealous ſtreines
of men and women, this
way (as wee have heard)
then muſt it needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
(by the rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries)
that a ſuperficiall
perfunctory, and remiſſe
minding, and looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
theſe things, lye in
the ſame degree of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
and accurſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
unto him.</p>
                  <p>Againe, ſecondly, If
this earneſt contending,
and laying out for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
be thus countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from on high, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by God himſelfe:
then obſerve wee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
from hence, that
which will abundantly
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53834:181"/>
juſtifie, and make good
thoſe wayes, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Saints of God
in the world, which are
made obnoxious to
much cenſure by many:
and oft returned to the
reproach of them that
uſe them. As <hi>David</hi>
ſaith, that when he wept,
and chaſtiſed himſelfe
with faſting, it was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to his reproach: So
when any man ſheweth
any more nobleneſſe of
minde, than others doe,
for the great things of
Heaven, making it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner of buſineſſe
than is ordinarily made
of it in the world, and
ſhall ſeparate himſelfe
from pleaſures, and luſts,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53834:181"/>
and vaine recreations, and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of eternity, and ſhall
intermeddle with all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and worke upon
all advantages that may
advance and ſet forward
this great and honourable
deſigne in his hand; this
is made matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe,
and of a ſore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
againſt him, this
way is every where ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
againſt by thoſe that
judge themſelves wiſe
and men of underſtanding
in the world. Theſe men
thinke they have ſuch a
man at advantage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
to caſt diſhonour,
and to powre out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon him: and as
<hi>Iudas</hi> cenſured the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53834:182"/>
out of that alabaſter
box of oyntment upon
the head of our Saviour,
ſaying. <hi>What needeth this
waſte?</hi> implying that he
on whom it was beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
might have done well
enough without it. So do
many judge, and call it a
ſuperfluous expence, and
waſte of mans time, and
paines, and eſtates, to be
continually at this plough,
to follow it ſo hard night
and day, to make it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of charge, to make a
labour and toyle of being
ſaved, and going to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
whereas they can
goe faire, and ſoftly, and
make merry by the way,
they can make it a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of pleaſure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53834:182"/>
and yet come
ſafe thither in good time.
Men might be wiſer (ſay
theſe) and yet go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
too: fooles, and their
pleaſures are ſoone par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Now here is, I ſay,
in the Doctrine delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
an apologie from
heaven, an anſwer (as it
were) put into the mouths
of theſe men thus cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
which thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
them ſhall never be
able to reſiſt: an anſwer
like <hi>Solomons</hi> King upon
his throne, againſt which
there is no replying, no
riſing up: a ſhield and
buckler put into their
hands, under the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
whereof, they may
laugh all ſuch cenſures,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53834:183"/>
and accuſations in the face
to ſcorne. The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt himſelfe, hee
approves of their way, he
hath ſet to his ſeale, that
their way is excellent,
and commendable with
the higheſt. <hi>It is God that
justifieth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in
another caſe) <hi>who ſhall
condemne?</hi> Hee that hath
God to juſtifie him, need
never be affraid of him
that ſhall condemne him.
No man will dare to ſay,
that Chriſt ſpake fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when he gave ſentence
on <hi>Maries</hi> ſide, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
that <hi>Mary</hi> had
choſen the good part:
but ſuppoſe the blaſphmy
ſhould be ſwallowed, and
men will yet ſay that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53834:183"/>
Chriſt herein ſpake foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly:
yet we know what
<hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.
25. that <hi>the fooliſneſſe
of God is wiſer than men.</hi>
If the Lord Chriſt be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
up to ſpeake in this
caſe, ſhall not all the earth
keepe ſilence before
him?</p>
                  <p>In the third place, for
Reproofe. If it be a thing
of this high eſteeme, and
approbation with the
Lord Chriſt, to make it
the great and ſolemne
buſineſſe of our lives, to
be ingaged, body and
ſoule, and all wee have,
to gaine in a bleſſed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
then will this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
bee found a hard
ſaying againſt two ſorts
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53834:184"/>
of men. 1. Thoſe that will
not come up to any ſuch
termes themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of Heaven what
will. 2. Thoſe that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,
or hinder ſuch as
would do it.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt: doe not
the hearts of farre the
greater part of men and
women, ſit looſe to this
great buſineſſe of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
Is there any other
fighting the fight of Faith
amongſt them, than as of
men beating the aire (as
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh) making a
kind of flouriſhing onely,
and paſtime with their
weapons, as if they had
no enemy indeed in the
field to encounter, or to
fight againſt? Is there any
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53834:184"/>
other kinde of running in
this race of Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
amongſt us, than as
if men did not much care
whether they obtained,
or no? A man might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinke, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
and coldneſſe
of the world, that Chriſt
had caſt water, and not
oyle upon this fire, that
hee had reproved and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
the world for being
too forward this way, for
beeing too buſie with
Heaven, than any wayes
ſharpened the faces of
men, or ſtrengthened
their hand, by ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
as you have
heard. Where is there a
man amongſt many,
whoſe heart is to the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53834:185"/>
worke indeed? Who
labors for this bread that
periſheth not, as if it were
bread indeed? Who ſtirs
up himſelf night, and
day, and provokes, and
calls upon his heart, and
ſoule, and all that is
within him (as <hi>David</hi>
ſpeakes) to take ſure hold
on the covenant of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
No: the generation
of wiſe merchants, that
will ſell all they have to
purchaſe the field, where
the treaſure lyeth, as well
nigh periſhed from the
earth: that incorruptible
Crowne of Glory is no
longer worth the ſtriving
for, according to the
lawes propounded by
him that holds it forth
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53834:185"/>
unto the world. Heaven
muſt come eaſie, or elſe
it ſhall goe: rather than
men will eate the bread
of life in the ſweate of
their browes, they will
venture periſhing forever
through the want of it.
The hearts of men are
ſunke into the earth: the
ſtreames of their deſires,
and affections doe not
ſtand upon heapes, and
riſe upwards, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the waters of the
red ſea did: the cares,
and luſts, and pleaſures
of the world licke them
up cleane, as the Oxe
licketh up the graſſe: ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and drinking, and
gaming, and company
keeping, building, and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53834:186"/>
planting, and marrying,
watching the upriſing of
new faſhions, that wee
may be vaine and proud
with the firſt, ſacrificing
to <hi>Mammon</hi> (the great
God of weake-hearted
men) theſe with the like,
ſucke out the heart, and
ſtrength of the ſoules of
men, and there is onely a
huske or a skinne left for
Heaven. Men are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to ſeeke the things of
this life, and to give large
quarter to the fleſh: if
God wil caſt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven unto
them, as an overplus, they
will take it, but they will
not ſtand ſo ſtrictly or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
upon this:
they will thorough with
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53834:186"/>
their bargain of the world
however. Things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
muſt have the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſeate, and Heaven
muſt ſtand at the Earthes
footeſtoole.</p>
                  <p>I ſay no more of this: but
only adviſe men ſeriouſly
to conſider, that God hath
a hell (and that ſtrong and
terrible above meaſure)
to revenge the quarrell of
his heaven, and thoſe
that care little to bee
made meete to be perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
with the Saints in
the inheritance of light,
will be the fitter and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prepared for the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Hell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly (by way of
reproofe alſo) are there
not many yet worſe, and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53834:187"/>
more abominable and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
than the former,
who like thoſe Scribes
and Phariſees, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.
13. (upon whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſpends ſo many of
his woes) ſhut up the
Kingdome of Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
men, becauſe they
will neither goe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
nor ſuffer thoſe
that are entring to goe in?
Who going but on foote
themſelves, are ſtill pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
others from their
horſes? And driving hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
themſelves towards
Heaven, would faine take
off the wheeles from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens chariots, that
they might drive no faſter
than themſelves? As if
they had a ſecret <hi>Item,</hi> or
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53834:187"/>
Propheticall inſtinct in
their conſciences, that
ſuch mens zeale, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencie
of ſpirit in the
things of Heaven, will be
there deeper condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
one day before God:
and therefore they will
be firſt the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that (if they can)
and will quench the life
and power of it, that ſo if
God ſhould ſeeke for it
againſt them, it might no
where bee found. But
theſe men are in the way
of this wickedneſſe, as a
wild Bull in a net (as <hi>Eſay</hi>
ſpeakes) the more they
ſtruggle and teare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to get out, the
more they are intangled,
and further and faſter in:
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53834:188"/>
the more they kicke at
this greatneſſe of ſpirit in
the true borne Saints of
God, which diſcovers it
ſelfe in making out an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched
arme for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and beſtowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon it, they do but
increaſe their bands the
more, and purchaſe them
ſelves a double inſtead of
a ſingle condemnation.
<hi>The Saints ſhall judge the
world,</hi> let the world turne
it ſelfe which way it will,
let it vexe, and rage, and
teare it ſelfe in pieces:
yea, and this judgement
of the world by the
Saints will be the ſorer,
by how much more the
world ſhall ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to judge the Saints
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53834:188"/>
I have but this more to
ſay to theſe men (for the
preſent) He that will ſeek
to ſtay or ſtop men in
their ſpeed to Heaven,
makes haſt himſelfe to
deſtruction, and there ſhal
be none to ſtay him.</p>
                  <p>This for the third Uſe
of the point. Reproofe.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt Uſe
is for Exhortation, and
that to two duties: wee
ſhall onely touch upon
the former. Since this
minding, and improving
opportunities for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
hath this glorious
teſtimony and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from him, who is
the Lord of Glory: let us
all be exhorted to arme
our ſelves with the ſame
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53834:189"/>
minde (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh
and reſolve to take this
great thought and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of heart to our
ſelves this day, to ſhew
our ſelves men; yea, and
(if it were poſſible) more
then men, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
that condition
wherein we ſhall bee like
to the Angels: let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to give out our
ſtrengh freely this way,
and make no ſpare of any
thing that is in our hand
to doe. If riſing early,
or going to bed late will
carry it, if treading the
world under foote will
doe it, if abſtaining from
fleſhly luſts (which fight
againſt the ſoule) will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
us this way, if
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53834:189"/>
watching daily at wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
gates, and giving
attendance at the ports
of her doores will doe
it, if crying unto God
night and day will doe it,
if doing whatſoever God
commandeth us to doe,
will doe it: let none of
theſe things from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
bee grievous unto
us: if the whole treaſure
of our might and ſtrength
will fetch it, let us not
ſpare to the uttermoſt
mite or farthing: let
not heaven goe one way,
and we another: reſolve
with your ſelves never to
have Divels, if you may
have God and Angels
your companions at any
rate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:53834:190"/>
To give you ſome eaſe
and inlargement of heart,
that you may take in the
words of this exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more willingly and
freely, give mee leave to
propound and preſſe (a
little) a motive or two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
many.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider that the
great things of this world
(falſely ſo called) houſes,
lands, ſilver, gold, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
pleaſures, &amp;c. they
are but for the ſhort race,
aſſoone as ever the winde
of this preſent life paſſeth
away (bee it the houre
next) the whole world is
gone with it. This night
(ſaith God to the rich
man) they ſhall fetch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
thy foule (<hi>i.</hi> thy life)
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53834:190"/>
                     <hi>and then whoſe ſhall theſe
things bee which thou haſt
provided?</hi> implying that
his they could bee no
longer. Shall not this
conſideration inlarge our
hearts mightily to purſue
the things of enternity w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
might and maine, <hi>viz.</hi>
that there is nothing elſe
to purſue but the Eaſt
winde (as the Scripture
ſpeaketh) nothing but
what is like the Apples
of <hi>Sodom</hi> (ſo much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of) which ſo ſoone
as a man toucheth, or
layeth hand on, are vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
into duſt. If the
world were any thing
that were able to ſtand in
judgement or compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or would hold any
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53834:191"/>
proportion at all with the
things of heaven: the
heart of a man might bee
put in ſome ſtraight, and
indure ſome conflict in it
ſelfe, and ſo might bee
overcome and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
in its choyce and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
what to doe. But
as that ancient Father and
Martyr, when the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
Emperour offered
him time of conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to ſatisfie himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſacrifiſing to his
Idols, had his reſolution
in a readineſſe, ſaying
that <hi>in retan ſanctâ delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio
non habet locum,</hi> that
was not a point that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any deliberation.
So if there were any
thing of any moment, of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53834:191"/>
any valuable conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the world, to ſet
up in competition with
the great things of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
it might cauſe ſome
offence and ſtumbling in
the mindes and thoughts
of a man. If the world
were any thing but what
it is, a man might (haply)
make a ſtand to aske him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the queſtion, whether
hee ſhould indeed follow
the things of the world,
or the things of heaven.
But now the things of the
world being ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveably
light, &amp; poore,
and empty, and will
ſcarce hold the handling
with the hand, or the
looking on with the eye,
yea ſcarce the thinking
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53834:192"/>
upon with the heart: me
thinkes the ſoule of a
man ſhould bee carried
and driven, as it were,
with a ſpirit of diſdaine
and indignation, quite off
from the world, upon the
face of heaven, <hi>Neither
turne yee aſide</hi> (ſaith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>

                     <hi>from ſerving and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, for that would bee</hi>
(ſaith hee) <hi>after vaine
things that cannot profit
you:</hi> implying, that it is
one of the greateſt
grounds and arguments
in the world, for a mans
keeping cloſe to God, to
know and conſider that
there is nothing elſe to
take up his heart, that is
worth the looking on:
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53834:192"/>
there is nothing elſe to
purchaſe but broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns
that will hold no
water, and broken Reeds
that will run into a mans
hand, inſtead of ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him. Alas! all that
the world gaines in the
hearts and affections of
men, that it exerciſeth
ſuch power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over our deſires, is
not by the meanes of any
lovelineſſe, ſtrength, or
power it hath in it ſelfe,
but rather by meanes of
the ſuperſtition of the
dreames we dreame of it,
by meanes of the lying
imaginations of our hearts
concerning it. And the
truth is, heaven ſhould
have no ſuch great victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53834:193"/>
or conqueſt of it, no
ſuch great honour done
unto it, to bee never ſo
much preferred or exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in our deſires and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
above it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider,
that as the things of the
world have all their uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
confined and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
to this preſent life
of nature which wee live
in the world: ſo is the
time of this life altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uncertaine, and little
other then an unknowne
nothing. The earth is a
very ſlippery ſtanding, to
him that thinkes he ſtands
faſteſt: the ſtrongeſt mans
foundation is but the
duſt; theſe houſes of
clay, even thoſe that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53834:193"/>
are of the beſt building,
are in danger of droping
downe about our eares e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
houre. The Lord
that knowes our making,
and the termes of our
ſtanding in the fleſh bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then our ſelves, gives
us a perfect accompt
thereof in this expreſſion
(<hi>Eſa.</hi> 2. 22.) when hee
tels us that our breath is
in our noſtrils, when the
paſſage is alwayes open,
neither is there any doore
to ſhut to keep it in: yea,
the condition of it is ſuch;
that the labouring or ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to keepe it in, is the
next way to extinguiſh it,
or to cauſe it to goe forth
never to returne. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how infinitely doth
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53834:194"/>
it concerne us above all
that can bee uttered or
conceived, to belay and
make ſure for a building
or houſe from heaven,
leſt our earthly taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
being diſſolved on a
ſudden, wee ſhould not
have where to hide our
heads from the fiery rage
and tempeſt of the moſt
inſupportable wrath and
vengeance of God for
ever.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 19 11.</note> As <hi>Michal</hi> ſaid unto
<hi>David,</hi> when time was
concerning the imminent
danger of his life natural.
<hi>If thou ſaveſt not thy ſelfe
this night, to morrow thou
ſhalt bee ſlaine:</hi> ſo it may
bee the caſe of the beſt
and greateſt and youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt
of us, that if wee
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53834:194"/>
deferre it a day longer, if
wee will not even this
now be perſwaded to lay
hold on eternall life, to
morrow our ſoules may
bee ſlaine with eternall
death.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) to
perſwade you to raiſe
your labours and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for heaven to the
higheſt, and to abhorre
and tremble at all
looſeneſſe, and low-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritedneſſe
that way, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that heaven is a
prize that is not to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with dallying, or by
looking another way, or
minding other things: he
that makes it not the
great ſtanding buſineſſe
of his life, will never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53834:195"/>
it. Thy bread will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bee eaten but in the
ſweat of the brow. There
is a kinde of Devill that
will not out (as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
tels us) but by prayer
and faſting: this Devill
will not goe, nor heaven
come but upon great and
high termes. Know yee
not (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians)
that they, which
runne in a race, runne all,
but one receiveth the prize;
So runne that yee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;</hi>
cleerely implying
that running it ſelfe will
not carry this prize, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it bee a running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
a running after the
manner of thoſe that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne
their competitors
in the race: a man may go
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53834:195"/>
farre, and yet come ſhort:
we may doe much, and
yet to little purpoſe. If a
man ſtrive for maſtery
(ſaith the ſame Apoſtle
elſewhere) yet is hee not
crowned except he ſtrive
lawfully, <hi>i.</hi> except in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
hee obſerveth the
Lawes and conditions
propounded and injoyned
by him, that beſtoweth
the prize, and maketh the
race. To ſay Lord, Lord,
onely, <hi>i.</hi> to make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the ſervice of
God, and of ſubjection
and obedience to Ieſus
Chriſt, is not the Law or
rule that God hath apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the races, wherein
heaven is to be obteined:
men muſt bee operative
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53834:196"/>
and active in doing the
will of God which is in
heaven, otherwiſe they
are no company for him
(in that holy habitation
of his glory.) Men muſt
quit themſelves like men
on earth, or never looke
to bee like Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Thoſe crownes of
righteouſneſſe and life
will never goe at the low
and baſe rates of delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
caſe, and ſloathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Hee that degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
and corrupteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with any of theſe,
giveth hoſtages to the
Divell, that he will keepe
him company, and be his
ſecond in the midſt of the
torments of hell for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Therefore ſtrive to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53834:196"/>
enter in at the narrow
gate: yea, I ſay againe,
ſtrive to enter, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
will abundantly
pay for the ſtriving: but
woe bee to him that ſhall
not enter: and the ſame
woe will bee to him that
ſhall not ſtrive. Yet a little
while, &amp; the world that is
preſent, will be the world
that is paſt, and the world
that is to come will bee
the world preſent all the
dayes of eternity.</p>
                  <p>This for the third and
laſt Motive.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
a worthy Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and precious piece of
mortality ſhee was, whilſt
ſhe lived; and doubtleſſe
her name and memory
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53834:197"/>
deſerve imbalming with
the ſweeteſt odours and
ſpices after the manner of
the deareſt and chiefeſt
Saints of God. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
it is not much that I
ſhall ſpeake of her; my
cuſtome in this caſe of
ſpeaking ſparingly, being
as a thing conſecrate unto
me, I muſt not violate or
ſinne againſt it: neither
was it the leaſt of her
comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations, of whom
we now ſpeake, that ſhee
affected that leſſe then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which ſhee deſerved
above moſt: I meane,
praiſe and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
diſtinguiſhing ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in this point of her
practice, as the Apoſtle
himſelfe ſeemes to doe in
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53834:197"/>
his precept, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8.
where hee injoynes men
and women to thinke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to follow the
things themſelves that are
of good report: but for
the report it ſelfe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as due to the things,
hee ſpeakes no word of
minding that.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſſe, if ever
there were either man or
woman ſince <hi>Maries</hi>
time, that made <hi>Maries</hi>
choyce, ſhee was compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with them herein;
and did likewiſe: the way
of her ſpirit and tenour of
her life being a cloſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of that great rule
of the Apoſtle, for uſing
this preſent world, as if
wee uſed it not. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53834:198"/>
31. The zeale of heaven,
and of the ſalvation of her
ſoule had even eaten her
up. The delights and
contentments of the
world, which are wont
deepely to ingage the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the daughters
of men (eſpecially of her
ranke and yeeres, being
but about twenty ſixe at
her death) and to ſteale
away their hearts from
their God, and from the
noble and bleſſed content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of heven, had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no power over her:
they entermedled little
with her ſpirit: ſhee trod
and trampled upon them
with a foote of heavenly
diſdaine: her heart was
ſoft and tender upwards;
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:53834:198"/>
but downewards towards
the world hard as the nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Milſtone. When God
ſpake, hee wounded her,
the world cryed and ſhee
regarded not. Thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of uncleane birds the
common Theaters or
Play-houſes the ſhame
and reproach, of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
profeſſion of Jeſus
Chriſt amongſt us, ſo
much hanted by uncleane
ſpirits, both of men and
women; to whom mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
and ſobriety (ſurely)
are a burden, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they goe for eaſe
and deliverance, places,
where if a man ſought
for company in the way
to hell, hee may finde
choyce of all ſorts, where
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53834:199"/>
(I had almoſt ſaid) a man
may read whole pages of
Gods booke of reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
theſe (I ſay) with all
their execrable appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
the ſoule of this
religious gentlewoman
loathed and abhorred:
they were the firſt-borne
of abominations unto her.</p>
                  <p>So for the coſtly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of apparell (though
ſhee ſate by a fountaine
where ſhee might have
dranke her fill of theſe
waters) ſhee regarded it
not: her uſuall ſaying was:
that ſhee did not love to
bee talked of for her fine
clothes. But eſpecially
that great Goddeſſe of
her ſexworſhipped with
ſo much devotion, both
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:53834:199"/>
by young and old, I mean
Fancie or Faſhion in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
ſhe blaſphemed.</p>
                  <p>For richnes of furniture
in her houſe another ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
temptation for her
ſex, to adde drunkenneſſe
to thirſt, ſuperfluity to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
<hi>non contempſit ſed
neglexit;</hi> ſhee did not ſo
much contemne as neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
it. She did not affect
or deſire to have her face
ſeene and beheld by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the glaſſe of any
ſuch glory. Shee was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with working out
her ſalvation, and making
robes of immortality for
her ſoule.</p>
                  <p>For the company and
ſociety of her delight,
her heart went hand in
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53834:200"/>
hand (as it were) with
<hi>Davids</hi> heart in this:<note place="margin">Pſ. 16. 4.</note> All
her delight was in the
Saints on earth, and in
thoſe that were excellent
that way. Thoſe that
could ſpeak the language
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and diſcourſe
the waies of life unto her,
and miniſter any wayes
to her ſpirituall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
though the gold ring
were wanting, and the
coſtly apparell appeared
not, were they perſons of
never ſo meane ranke and
condition in the world;
yet were they a joy and
rejoycing of heart unto
her. As on the other
hand, no earthly privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
no greatneſſe in the
world, no accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53834:200"/>
of nature could
make an attonement with
her for light and looſe,
and unſavouble ſpirits, to
cauſe her to take pleaſure
or contentment in them.</p>
                  <p>The remembrance of
that houre (which hath
now paſſed over her) when
ſhee ſhould be called out
of the world, wrought
mightily in her, and gave
her little liberty to minde
other things: it cooled
and quenched the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
heate of affection
(whereunto ſhee was by
nature as incident as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
to the things of this
world. She would oft ſay,
it was no light matter for
men to appeare before
God, to give an account
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53834:201"/>
of their lives.</p>
                  <p>Her manner was day
by day to give the firſt of
her ſtrength every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
unto God, in lifting
up her ſoule in prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: upon her awaking
ſhe was ſtill preſent with
him (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh)
yea, when her ſtrength
beganne to be but labour
and ſorrow, by reaſon of
her ſickneſſe; yet did ſhe
not take an occaſion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to intermit her daily
ſacrifice, or to behave her
ſelfe frowardly in this
Covenant of her God. As
long as ſhe had any being
though it were never ſo
weake and feeble, her
reſolutions remained as
ſtrong as ever, to praiſe
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53834:201"/>
the Lord. The very night
before her death, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
this ſacrifice of
prayer unto her God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her knees.</p>
                  <p>Another dayly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
and breathing of her
ſoule likewiſe was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with the minde and
thoughts of God in the
Scriptures. Her manner
indeed was not to reade
much at a time: but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſhe gave this conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
reaſon, that ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to make that her
owne which ſhe read. So
that it ſeemes ſtill as ſhee
read, ſhee writ it out in
the Tables of her heart.
And ſo by the bleſſing of
God upon her diligent,
and conſtant labours this
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53834:202"/>
way, ſhe had attained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her death a marvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
readineſſe in the
Scriptures, and was able
(ordinarily) to ſupply the
defect of a Concordance,
and to aſſigne any clauſe
or paſſage of Scripture
mentioned to her, to their
proper place, both for
Booke and Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The houſe of God, and
a golden ſhowre from
heaven in the Miniſtery
of the Goſpell, were the
ſtrength of her life, and
the great conſolation of
her pilgrimage, her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life in the mouthes of
Gods meſſengers, was
conſtantly ſo reverent,
ſerious, and undiſtracted,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53834:202"/>
that it was the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
together with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
of ſome, that had
communion with her in
that ordinance, theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
clouds could never
drop fatneſſe, but ſhe was
ſtill ready, if ſhee knew
when the time of their
dropping was, with the
veſſell of her ſoule to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it.</p>
                  <p>The Lords day was a
day of much obſervation
unto her: ſhe remembred
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eepe it holy, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it her delight. That
which remained of it from
publike duties, ſhee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
with as little loſſe
or waſte as might be, into
opportunities for private.</p>
                  <p>Her ſpirit was full of a
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53834:203"/>
ſweete and gratious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility:
it was no way
grievous unto her, to
make her ſelfe equall to
thoſe of the lower ſort.
A free and familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
ſhee was for all
thoſe that feared God,
and that were partakers
of like pretious faith with
her.</p>
                  <p>Abundant ſhee was in
workes of mercy, and lent
much unto the Lord: ſhee
underſtood what ſilver &amp;
gold were good for, and
gave them freely unto the
owners. A woman ſhe was
of very tender bowels,
and of overflowing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions,
to thoſe that
were in miſery.</p>
                  <p>In this courſe of life ſhe
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53834:203"/>
was perfectly engaged,
before that remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
of her mortality, that
lingring ſickneſſe, that
came to live and die with
her, was ſent unto her.
God (doubtleſſe) putting
it into her heart, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
and ſtrengthen the
inner man, the time draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neere, wherein her ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
man, was to decay and
periſh. During the time
of her ſickneſſe (which
continued ſome moneths
upon her) her carriage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the hand of God, was
humble, and gratious, and
with much ſubmiſſion.
Shee was in travell with
the great birth of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
from the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of her infirmity
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:53834:204"/>
upon her: and (I make no
queſtion) but after all here
other weakeneſſe, God
gave her ſtrength to bring
forth that. She was much
in prayer unto God by
her ſelfe, in private, yet
deſirous alſo of the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of others, when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
ſerved. Her
conference ſtill was, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ſubject, or theme,
wherof our Saviour ſpake
ſo much to his Diſciples
immediately before his
aſcending up into heaven,
<hi>viz.</hi> of the Kingdome of
God: and cared indeed
little to ſpeake of any
thing beſides. There were
now and then ſome bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of hope of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; recovery, which
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53834:204"/>
were ſoone nipp'd and
blaſted againe. But theſe
hopes were no ſnares un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her: ſhe went on with
her preparations for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and that with a high
hand, until the God of her
ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaid, It is enough.
To relate all particulars
would be as needleſſe, as
endleſſe: I have detained
you too long already. I
have no more to ſay. A
ſweete, loving, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
young woman ſhee
was, meete for a patterne
to her ſexe and yeares, of
piety, holineſſe, and the
feare of the Lord. <hi>Maries</hi>
good part was her choice:
and a joyfull reſurrection
(doubtleſſe) will be her
reward: where they to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53834:205"/>
whom ſhee was deare in
her life, walking in her
ſteps, may expect the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her the ſecond time
in communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
of the ſame glory
with her.</p>
