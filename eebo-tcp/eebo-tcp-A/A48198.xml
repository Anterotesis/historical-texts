            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>WHen I review alone the grand Entertainments of</hi> Learning, <hi>I used to meet with in your Conversation, the</hi> Wit <hi>of the</hi> Poets, <hi>the</hi> Reason <hi>of the</hi> Philosophers, <hi>your Excellent</hi> Observations <hi>upon the</hi> Actions <hi>of</hi> Persons <hi>illustrious in</hi> Arms, <hi>who have lived in the several Ages of the World, my</hi> Affliction <hi>is almost unimaginable to be separated from you: When you went up to the</hi> Parliament, <hi>there is nothing could have stay'd me (who can scarce be happy a Moment of my Life without you) behind you in the Country, but my Infirmity of Health, and a certain Desire of enjoying the Comfort and Pleasures of the Spring. You know, when we parted, how I conjur'd you alwayes to bear in Mind that grand Rule,</hi> Inter pericula libertatis aut veritatis silent amicitiae et inimicitiae, <hi>and then the Light of your own Mind will dispel and overcome the Darkness of others without Noise or Tumult: This World is govern'd by particular</hi> Hatreds <hi>and</hi> Friendships, <hi>not by the Reasons of Things; and there is nothing can keep you constant in your</hi> Integrity, <hi>but the having a perpetual Eye to that Rule. I also then told you, you should look abroad as well as at home, keeping your Eye on</hi> Forreign Affairs; <hi>for although</hi> Hannibal <hi>be not yet</hi> ad portas, Philip <hi>is at</hi> Olynthus. <hi>I have herein enclosed the Papers I promised you, in which I claim no</hi> Property <hi>against your absolute Power over them, do what you will with them: You know, the one contains a Discourse shewing the Reasons why</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery <hi>should be Punished with</hi> Death; <hi>the other, why the Writ,</hi> De Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retico comburendo, <hi>should be Abolished.</hi> Adultery, <hi>it is the greatest of all</hi> Thefts, <hi>a</hi> Theft <hi>of which no Restitution can be made,</hi>

tristi et obscuro Domicilio; <hi>and the inspired Apostle himself saith,</hi> we see darkly, and but through a Glass. <hi>God hath unfolded himself in as great Variety in the Minds of Men, as he hath done in the Material World: The Seed of Religion springs up variously in Human Souls, as we see the seminal Forms do out of the Earth; and would it not be Madness or Folly to destroy &amp; cut up all</hi> Trees <hi>and</hi> Plants <hi>but the</hi> Oak? <hi>I am not without all</hi> Jealousie, <hi>that it is possible, we in</hi> England <hi>may return back again to the</hi> Church of Rome, <hi>not only because I see in History</hi> Monarchies <hi>more subject to Changes then</hi> Common-Wealths <hi>in Matters of Religion, and observe how indefatigable that</hi> Infallible Church <hi>(in its own Iudgment) is to revenge our</hi> Schism <hi>from it upon us, and so may weary us out at last, &amp; how unsafe they apprehend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at</hi> Rome, <hi>while the Power of the</hi> Sea <hi>is in the Hands of</hi> Hereticks; <hi>but chiefly from the wild</hi> Philosophy <hi>and</hi> Atheism <hi>of the present Age,</hi> Atheism <hi>being a Preparation to receive any</hi> Colour <hi>or</hi> Tincture <hi>in Religion.

            <p>IT will be necessary before I give my <hi>Reasons</hi> why such a <hi>Law</hi> should pass, that I do explain what <hi>Adultery</hi> is, the Notion of it being ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rllly mistaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adultery</hi> is the <hi>lying of a Single or Married Man with another Man's Wife,</hi> and not the <hi>lying of a Married Man with a Single Woman.</hi> Thus it was constantly apprehended among the <hi>Iews,</hi> to whom God gave the Law, <hi>Thou shalt not commit Adultery:</hi> And <hi>David</hi>'s Sin was the taking the poor Man's <hi>Ewe Lamb</hi> from him, which lay in his Bosom, when he had Flocks enough of his own. I presume, there is none doubts the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magistrates</hi> Power to make such a <hi>Law; Death</hi> is already amongst us the Penalty for <hi>less Crimes:</hi> We punish boldly with <hi>Death</hi> a <hi>Horse-stealer</hi> or a <hi>Cut-purse</hi> without any Scruple at all; and is not my <hi>Property</hi> in my <hi>Wife</hi> of dearer &amp; nearer Concern to me, then my <hi>Horse,</hi> or a little <hi>Pocket-money?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>primary Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> is the Observance of our <hi>Contracts;</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, without this there could be no Government: the State of <hi>Nature</hi> would still have continued; this Crime intrenches highly on this Law, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving the <hi>Family-Government;</hi> it is a Breach of the Solemnest Contract (entered into <hi>pro bono publico, Marriage</hi> being <hi>seminarium Reipubl.)</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable: That is the Nature of the <hi>Crime,</hi> but the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is chiefly to concern himself in the Consequences of it; and they are more mischievous where the <hi>Woman</hi> breaks the <hi>Contract</hi> on her Part; for thereby a <hi>Spurious Issue</hi> that robs the <hi>Husband</hi> by wholesale of his Estate, of all his own and his Ancestors Acquisitions, is brought into his Family. The Crime is then a Complication of all the <hi>Wickedness</hi> in <hi>Lust, Breach</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Robbery;</hi> And therefore I may justly infer that seeing Men <hi>equally</hi> concur with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to transact it, they are justly <hi>equally punishable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a Man shall violate the <hi>Companion</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> or the <hi>Companion</hi> of the <hi>Eldest Son</hi> and <hi>Heir</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> it is <hi>high Treason:</hi> by this we see the Care of the Law, no <hi>Spurious Issue</hi> should <hi>inherit the Crown;</hi> should we not take some proportionable Care of our own Estates?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60862:4"/>
We may do well to reflect upon the Example of other Nations, as of the <hi>Iews</hi> (for many Ages the only known People of God) amongst whom <hi>Adultery</hi> was punished with <hi>Death,</hi> upon the Example of the <hi>Gentes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiores</hi> among the <hi>Heathens;</hi> of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who upon <hi>Solon</hi>'s Law punished this Crime <hi>Capitally;</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who in Imitation of <hi>Solon</hi>'s Law, set down for their Law in the 12 Tables, <hi>Moechum in adulterio de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensum necato.</hi> Afterwards in the <hi>Roman</hi> State it was lawful for the Husband, until the <hi>Lex Iulia</hi> in <hi>Augustus</hi> his Time, <hi>Uxores in adulterio deprehensas sine judicio impune necare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may also consider what the <hi>Christian Church</hi> has done for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of this Sin: In the first and best Times of <hi>Christianity</hi> they did all they could (having not <hi>jus vitae ac necis)</hi> against it. The <hi>Pennance</hi> then for it was perpetual to the <hi>Hour</hi> of <hi>Death. Zepherynus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome, anno</hi> 216. moderated the <hi>Pennance,</hi> but the <hi>African Churches,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the grand <hi>Tertullian</hi> opposed it as an Innovation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ancyran</hi> Council, <hi>anno</hi> 315. ordains 7 <hi>Years Pennance</hi> for it. And the Council of <hi>Eliberis</hi> ordains, that he that commits <hi>Adultery again after Pennance</hi> for the <hi>First Fault,</hi> should not be taken into Communion at the Hour of <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In after Ages, when the <hi>Roman Church</hi> was resolved upon a <hi>Corlibacy</hi> in her <hi>Clergy,</hi> It was necessary the Sin should be looked on with a <hi>gentle Eye,</hi> &amp; now it is dwindled down into a <hi>Peccadillo,</hi> but is in Truth like the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadillo</hi> of not believing in God at all; for if ever he gave a Law to Man, it is one to prohibit <hi>Adultery.</hi> Several of the Reformed <hi>Countries,</hi> who have recover'd themselves from under the Empire of Wit and Fraud over their <hi>Consciences</hi> by that Church, punish the Crime at this Day with Death.</p>
            <p>As for us in <hi>England,</hi> our present Law is not without the Infusions of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> upon it in this Case; all the Remedy the injur'd Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hath by our Law, is, to sue a <hi>Divorce</hi> in the <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> and be cozen'd with a Sentence of Separation <hi>a Mensa &amp; Thoro,</hi> a Crafty Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the plain Gospel.</p>
            <p>If the Husband kill the <hi>Adulterer,</hi> or his Wife found by him in <hi>ipso actu,</hi> the Law excuseth him in this Case from <hi>Murder,</hi> but condemns him of <hi>Man-Slaughter,</hi> and hangs him <hi>if he cannot read;</hi> what a poor Remedy hath the Injur'd Man? If he kill the <hi>Adulterer</hi> deliberately, not provoakt by Ocular Demonstration, it is <hi>Murder.</hi> Besides all this, the present Law being so defective, the Crime grows upon it; 'tis common, and this Age gives it the soft and gentle <hi>French</hi> Names of <hi>Gallantry</hi> and <hi>Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in Apology for it: What ought the <hi>Magistrate</hi> to do in this Case, but to pursue this Crime as far as his Hand can reach, to the Grave it self, and then <hi>Expectet Deum Ultorem?</hi>

            <p>BEfore I give my <hi>Reasons,</hi> it will be necessary to shew the State of the Law at present upon this <hi>Writ:</hi> Before the Sta<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>te, 2 <hi>H. 4. cap. 15. No Person could be convict of Heresie, but by the</hi> Arch-Bishop <hi>and all the Clergy of the</hi> Province, but by that Statute <hi>any particular</hi> Bishop <hi>might in his</hi> Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess <hi>convict of Heresie, and issue forth his Precept to the</hi> Sheriff <hi>to burn the Person he had convicted;</hi> a Law whereby the <hi>Clergy</hi> gain'd a Dominion over the Lives of the Subjects independent upon the Crown: it was repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Stat. 25. H. 8. cap.</hi> 14. but so as <hi>particular</hi> Bishops <hi>may still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict; but without the Kings Writ,</hi> De Haeretico comburendo, <hi>first obtained, no Person convict can be put to Death;</hi> and so the Law stands at this Day.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>My REASONS are these.</head>
               <p n="1">I. The Continuance of this <hi>Writ</hi> in force amongst us, is a standing <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> to the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion we profess (a Religion of Love and Peace) If it be not to be propagated in the whole by Force and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, certainly a Part of it as a particular Point of Faith in it, is not. In the Gospel of Christ all the <hi>Punishment</hi> of <hi>Heresie</hi> and of <hi>Infidelity</hi> it self, are adjourned over, and left to the other World.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If an <hi>Act</hi> pass to abolish this <hi>Writ,</hi> it will be an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Indulgence</hi> in part, and give an <hi>Assurance</hi> to all Persons of a <hi>different Iudgment</hi> from the present <hi>establisht Church, that they are secure as to their Lives under the Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. If <hi>Popery</hi> should ever return back into <hi>England,</hi> there must a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> sit to repeal such an <hi>Act,</hi> before any <hi>Protestant</hi> for his Opinion could be put to Death.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Such an <hi>Act</hi> would leave the Power of the present Church to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict, excommunicate</hi> and <hi>imprison</hi> Untouched<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only would take away their barbarous Execution of her Sentence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60862:5"/>
If it be objected, <hi>the Writ is grown Obsolete and disused and so need not be taken away:</hi> The Answer is obvious; <hi>Not so obsolete neither:</hi> It was used in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Time; However, it's fit it should not remain as a Snare among our Law; for the Case concerns <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Death:</hi> and the <hi>Papists</hi> use the <hi>Writ</hi> constantly against the <hi>Protestants;</hi> but they never against them.</p>
