            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO My Esteemed FRIEND Thomas Boteler, <abbr>Esq</abbr>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have a natural Right to this Piece, since, by your Advice, I attempted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of it with Alterations. Nothing but the Power of your Perswasion, and my Zeal for all the Remains of <hi>Shakespear,</hi> cou'd have wrought me to so bold an Undertaking. I found that the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modelling of this Story, wou'd force me sometimes on the difficult Task of making the chiefest Persons speak something like their Character, on Matter whereof I had no Ground in my Author. <hi>Lear</hi>'s real, and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>'s
<pb facs="tcp:55542:3"/>
pretended Madness have so much of <hi>extravagant Nature</hi> (I know not how else to express it) as cou'd never have started but from our <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fancy. The Images and Language are so odd and surprizing, and yet so agreeable and proper, that whilst we grant that none but <hi>Shakespear</hi> cou'd have form'd such Conceptions, yet we are satisfied that they were the only Things in the World that ought to be said on those Occasions. I found the whole to answer your Account of it, a Heap of Jewels, unstrung and unpolisht; yet so dazling in their Disorder, that I soon perceiv'd I had seiz'd a Treasure. 'Twas my good Fortune to light on one Expedient to rectifie what was wanting in the Regularity and Probability of the Tale, which was to run through the whole A <hi>Love</hi> betwixt <hi>Edgar</hi> and <hi>Cordelia,</hi> that never chang'd word with each other in the Original. This renders <hi>Cordelia</hi>'s Indifference and her Father's Passion in the first Scene probable. It likewise gives Countenance to <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Disguise, making that a generous Design that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a poor Shift to save his Life. The Distress of the Story is evidently heightned by it; and it particularly gave Occasion of a New Scene or Two, of more Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess (perhaps) than Merit. This Method necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily threw me on making the Tale conclude in a
<pb facs="tcp:55542:3"/>
Success to the innocent distrest Persons: Otherwise I must have incumbred the Stage with dead Bodies, which Conduct makes many Tragedies conclude with unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Jests. Yet was I Rackt with no small Fears for so bold a Change, till I found it well receiv'd by my Audience; and if this will not satisfie the Reader, I can produce an Authority that question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Dryd.</hi> Pref. to the <hi>Span. Fryar.</hi>
               </note> will. <hi>Neither is it of so Trivial an Undertaking to make a Tragedy end hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, for 'tis more difficult to Save than 'tis to Kill: The Dagger and Cup of Poyson are alwaies in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness; but to bring the Action to the last Extremity, and then by probable Means to recover All, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Art and Judgment of a Writer, and cost him many a Pang in the Performance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have one thing more to Apologize for, which is, that I have us'd less Quaintness of Expression even in the newest Parts of this Play. I confess 'twas Design in me, partly to comply with my Author's Style to make the Scenes of a Piece, and partly to give it some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of the Time and Persons here Represented. This, Sir, I submit wholly to you, who are both a Judge and Master of Style. Nature had exempted you before you went Abroad from the Morose Saturnine Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of our Country, and you brought home the Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedness
<pb facs="tcp:55542:4"/>
of Travel without the Affectation. Many Faults I see in the following Pages, and question not but you will discover more; yet I will presume so far on your Friendship, as to make the Whole a Present to you, and Subscribe my self</p>

            <lg>
               <l>INconstancy, the reigning Sin o' th' Age,</l>
               <l>Will scarce endure true Lovers on the Stage;</l>
               <l>You hardly ev'n in Plays with such dispense,</l>
               <l>And Poëts kill'em in their own Defence.</l>
               <l>Yet One bold Proof I was resolv'd to give,</l>
               <l>That I cou'd three Hours Constancy Out-live.</l>
               <l>You fear, perhaps, whilst on the Stage w' are made</l>
               <l>Such Saints, we shall indeed take up the Trade;</l>
               <l>Sometimes we Threaten — but our Vertue may</l>
               <l>For Truth I fear with your Pit-Valour weigh:</l>
               <l>For (not to flatter either) I much doubt</l>
               <l>When We are off the Stage, and You are out,</l>
               <l>We are not quite so Coy, nor You so Stout.</l>
               <l>We talk of Nunn'ries — but to be sincere</l>
               <l>Whoever lives to see us Cloyster'd There,</l>
               <l>May hope to meet our Critiques at <hi>Tangier.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For shame give over this inglorious Trade</l>
               <l>Of worrying Poëts, and go maule th' <hi>Alcade.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Well — since y' are All for blustring in the Pit,</l>
               <l>This Play's Reviver humbly do's admit</l>
               <l>Your abs'lute Pow'r to damn his Part of it;</l>
               <l>But still so many Master-Touches shine</l>
               <l>Of that vast Hand that first laid this Design,</l>
               <l>That in great <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s Right, He's bold to say</l>
               <l>If you like nothing you have seen to Day</l>
               <l>The Play your Judgment damns, not you the Play.</l>
