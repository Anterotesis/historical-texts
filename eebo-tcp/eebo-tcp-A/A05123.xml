         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But to you my brethren which haue ſuffred
many and ſo greate ſtormes, troubles, and
griefes euen to you (I ſaie) beholde new la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
daily ariſe, which muſt be ouercome
with gret co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie &amp; inuincible fortitude of
minde. For that I may omit diuers &amp; almoſt
infinit other diſcommodities, I perceiue that
you are exerciſed chiefly in two kindes of
battailes. The one is for that daily wicked
ſlaunderers (to wit) the miniſters of lyes, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
themſelues againſt the miniſters of the
truth, which by their lying Libels go about
to vexe and deface the innocencie of the
godly Paſtours of the Church, with moſt
horrible vntruths and impudent ſlaunders.
Of this ſort are ſome whome the heate of
perſecution hath deuoured, who by force,
and as it were, with a ſtorme and vehement
tempeſt, carried vnto the Popiſh hereſies, do
now, with moſt obſtinate mindes cleaue
vnto the ſame, as it were vnto a moſt firme
rocke. Yea, and that which is to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they begging as it were thereby the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
prelates good will and fauour make no
end of their malitious ſlaundering and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

opinion) you ſhall right well ſuſtaine not by
<pb facs="tcp:7264:4"/>
ſtriuing againſt it, but by calling to minde
the faying of Dauid in his 54.<note place="margin">Pſa. 54.</note> Pſalme, to

the ſlanderous tongue of theſe wicked ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derets,

For ſo it alwaies happene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

wound themſelues with their owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,

vnſpotted, beeing deliuered from
their vniuſt reports. The other kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
reſteth, in the which you muſt thinke to
labour both earneſtly and diligently, as I
know right wel ye do. For about a few yeres
paſt, there hath riſen vp certaine men,
who abuſing liberall artes and ſciences, and
chiefly that ſcience which is ordained to the

wherby they might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme &amp; eſtabliſh the

and ſuch are chiefely thoſe falſe named Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,

did not reiect the good &amp; right knowledge

principles produceth and bringeth forth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7264:11"/>
the knowledge of the truth: but rather that
vaine art of deceiuing with thoſe ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and deceitful ſnares, the which the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes
are wont full ſubtilly to folde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
whereby they may deceiue the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; faithfull. And that this was the mind
of the Apoſtle, it is manifeſt not onely by
the order of the Apoſtles ſpéech, but alſo by
that he vſeth this word [<hi>Apates</hi>] which is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> craft or circumuention by ſubtiltie.
Sith then the good vſe of Logicke chiefly
tends vnto this end, to diſpearſe abroade
the fallaces and ſubtill crafts of ſophiſtrie,
to expell errours, to reproue lies, and to ſet
before our eies moſt manifeſtly the light
of the truth: Who can with good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
thinke that the Apoſtle at anie time
did reiect this ſo worthie &amp; neceſſarie ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?

               <hi>Iohn Duns Scotus</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

the Diuines haue in ſome places mixed
Philoſophie with Diuinitie, &amp; that with
great profit: I truly confeſſe that they haue

haue therewith confuſed Diuinitie, but if
he thinke it was done with any fruite, I
beſéech maſter Doctor pardon me if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
héerein agrée with him: for ſithen the
Schoolemen haue not followed that good
part of diſputing, which giueth true reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
to arguments (as we ſhall héeraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

for the moſt part vaine &amp; friuolous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
me thinks they haue not brought
into the Church of God the true vſe, but
rather the abuſe of Philoſophie: and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I ſay it ſéemeth to me, that into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midſt
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, the Schoolemen haue brought
ſophiſtication and ſhameleſſe falſhood, dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and adorned with the colour &amp; name
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7264:14"/>
of Philoſophie, as of an honeſt matrone, to
the great detriment &amp; hurt of the Church.
But you will ſaye, they haue not gotten
this ſharpe knowledge of diſputing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great labour and paines: I graunt it
to be ſo: for oftentimes when I ſée theſe
ſchoole men labouring, ſweating, and as it
were out of breath in theſe their, ſubtill
diſputations, they make me to remember
the <hi>Troyans,</hi> which with great labour and
care brought into their Citie, the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite
Grecian Horſe, whereby enſued the
ruine of the whole Kingdome of <hi>Troy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Great, but vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the labour of the ſchoole Doctors.</note> So
theſe ſchoolemen with great induſtrie and
labour, haue brought into the church falſe
Philoſophie: that therehence, as from the
Troyan horſe might ſpring infinit errors:
by which, while theſe who ſhould haue ben
the watchmen ouer the Church, were euen
ouer whelmed in ſchoole ignoraunce, thoſe
errors haue crept in, corrupted and waſted
the Church of God (ſo as I maye vſe the
ſaieng of <hi>Eſayas</hi>) Except the Lord had left
vs a ſmal remnant, we had had no church
at all. A proofe héereof is the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> ſo depraued and corrupted, that
while we ſéeke the Church in the Church,
we are conſtrained, not without great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7264:14"/>
and teares, onely to behold the aſhes
of the true Church. But becauſe I maye
not ſéeme héere more willing to lament,
then to diſpute: mark what I ſay, to wit,
that the ſchoolemen and queſtionarie Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
haue neither followed the true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of diuine diſputations,<note place="margin">Certaine Errours which are to bee found in the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the ſchoole Doctors The firſt errour to make their ground Logicke See Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus and others, who haue vvritten vpon the maſter of ſentences, and in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations called Quodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, &amp;c.</note> neither lawful

               </gap>rred not a little in their diſputations,
from the true manner of diuine Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>The firſt errour that the ſchoolemen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in their diſputations is this: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they
are wont to diſpute by the principles of

concluſions. So queſtions being propoſed,
they make the grounde thereof Logicke,
and not Diuinitie, ſo that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in theſe their Diſputations, are
dumme and ſpeachleſſe: for they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
alleadge the Philoſophers as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoures
in theyr Diſputations, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
ſeldome the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>And if at anye time they bring in
the Doctours, they confuſedlye mingle
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7264:15"/>
their authoritie with the authoritie of the

their writings, by the name of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.<note place="margin">Lomb. li. 1. Sent. diſt. 34. &amp; li. 2. ſent. diſt. 9. &amp;c</note>
But we haue learned and that out
of diuinitie to take our principles from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie,
when ſo euer we diſpute thereof:
and that we ought ſo to doe, it is manifeſt
euen by Logicke, which doth forbid to goe
from the principles of one art to another,
or to wander without the compaſſe
of the ſcience, wherein wée haue begun to
diſpute. Sithen then, diuinitie is farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

equall with the Prophets and Apoſtles, is
altogether a thing intollerable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I thinke no man doubteth (except hée

ſufficiently proued this firſt errour of the
Shoolemen.</p>
            <p>The ſecond errour is this, that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of diuinitie which are moſt true and
plaine,<note place="margin">

as it were with probable argument vpon
the grounds thereof: when as they ought
not ſo to doo in theſe pointes: it béeing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7264:15"/>
both from the vſe of true reaſoning, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
from the nature of diuinitie: for Topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
talke of diſputations are to be left to
common kinde and exerciſes. But treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
or diſputings ſtanding vpon infalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grounds (of which ſort moſt chiefly are
the diſputations of diuinitie) doe require
demonſtratiue, plaine, and euident diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
which ought to ſtand on moſt true,
neceſſarie, and infallable Sylogiſmes or

were wont ſometimes to diſpute both
<hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Contra,</hi> touching the principles
of their artes and ſciences, that the truth
might thereby more manifeſtly appeare.
But the diuines diſpute not about the
principles of diuinitie, becauſe they are of
themſelues moſt true, and without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie.

I pray you now tell me, are theſe diuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

then to place theſe things in the moſt firm

            <p>The thirde errour is that they obſcure

Wherfore, that which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſomtime

ſo often as they diſpute, they ſéeme not to
explicate the matters, but rather to make
the ſame intricate, and in truth there is
not ſo much heard the voyce of men, as the
bellowing of beaſtes, out of thoſe darke

            <p>And finally the fourth error is,<note place="margin">Error. 4 Is theyr vaine queſtions</note> that the

            <p>There are two waies how to intreate

things ſimple and plaine as they are of
themſelues, and ſetteth downe plaine and
naked arguments, ſo that the truth of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

while it is clad with the fleſh, &amp; the bloud

this my purpoſe, I am willing ſomewhat
to admoniſh the Reader, howe that theſe
diſputations touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scriptures doth
farre differ from all others. For in diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Philoſophie, Phiſicke, ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
and ſuch other, there eloquence
ſheweth it ſelfe, there deſire to excell doeth

yea, oftentimes in ſuch matters, men deſire
nothing but to ſhew forth the braueneſſe of
their wits, or elſe ſéeke after glorie and
praiſe. But in diuine diſputations, where
(as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth) Brauerie muſt not
bée ſought,<note place="margin">De doct. Chri. li. 4. cap. 19</note> but good documentes and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and that with great reuerence: yea,
and verie reuerently wée muſt diſpute of
holy things, not as vpon the ſtage before
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7264:22"/>
men, but as in the middeſt of the Church
before the liuing God and his Angelles:
not for the deſire of victorie, but for the
maintenaurce of the truth, in as much as
<hi>Paule</hi> forbiddeth the Paſtours of the
Church, once to ſpeake of vaine queſtions,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note>
or contentions of wordes, which can ſcarce
be done without the detrument of the
truth. Wherfore praying aide at the hands
of almightie God, that he will direct and
eſtabliſh this our labour by his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
let vs procéede into this moſt holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
in the which the worde of GOD is
the place of combat, God himſelfe the
chiefe Iudge, truth the victorie, ſaluation
the garland of triumph. And héereby
with more valiant mindes we take vpon
vs this moſt noble conflicte, becauſe it
otherwiſe happeneth in this, then in other
battayles, for there hée alone is crowned
which vanquiſheth, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende of this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile

to be ouercome of the truth, then to be

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7264:22"/>
For whatſoeuer men practiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

Chriſt, the chiefe and moſt perfect Doctour
and teacher of his Church being giuen to
the world, taught the Apoſtles by mouth, &amp;
ordained them teachers for his Church,
which did publiſh in writing the doctrine
of the Goſpell receiued from Chriſt, &amp; by
them taught by mouth. Sith then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word
of God is the meaſure of our faith, &amp; that
that word of God remaineth in the moſt
holy monuments or writings of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
it followeth of neceſſitie, that al the
principles which are neceſſarie to faith
and ſaluation of the Church, are contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the holy Scriptures: and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7264:24"/>
the Apoſtles haue taught, we ought to
looke for them in the holy Scriptures: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought we to receiue any tradition in
matter of faith. And becauſe matters are
made more manifeſt by u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>militudes, wée
will take our ſimilitude from a King,
which by mouth proclaimeth an Edict, &amp;
then willeth the ſame to be printed, the
which being done, men are not wont curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlye
to enquire of others, which eyther
heard or wer preſent at the proclamation,
what is contained in the Kings Edict, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Edict is in print, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which they
muſt ſtand, and the which they muſt alſo
beléeue. So then I affirme, in as much as
the word was proclaimed and declared by
the Apoſtles and euangeliſts, and by them
committed to writing, it were in vayne
and foolish now a dayes anye other where
to be ſought, then in the Scriptures:
what the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes did
teach by mouth.</p>
            <p>But now the opinion of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
is this. That all principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

The which theyr opinion they
thus expounde. Although the worde of

who moſt often vſe them. Wherefore I
doubt not to vſe theſe, euen as well as the
categoricall arguments: becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or grounds of our diſputations are not
Topicall, or ſtanding on the inuention of
art, but grounded on expresſſe places of
Scriptures, and therefore thoſe kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
are not inferiour to others. The
ground or matter therefore of our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is made manifeſt euen by the light
of nature,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference.</note> who biddeth vs of things like, to

we haue drawne from nature her ſelfe, the
Apoſtle teacheth vs that they are not to be
reiected, when as in the matter of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
he bringeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to the
conſideration of nature: For being ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                  <note place="margin">Tert. de reſur. car.</note> thou
maiſt the eaſilier beléeue the Propheſie.
Now if wée marke the ſubſtance, we ſhall
finde the worde of God both in the olde
teſtament and in the new to bée all one:
For the Apoſtle profeſſeth, ſaying: That
he hath ſpoken nothing, but that which the
Prophets and <hi>Moſes</hi> had before ſpoken.<note place="margin">Act. 26.</note>
I confeſſe that the publiſhing of the word
of God in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Teſtament, was a great
deale more excellent and fruitfull then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7264:28"/>
yea, and that maketh for our cauſe,
and therefore farre wide is it, that it ſhuld
hurt vs or our matter, as héereafter in our
diſputation, we will more at large proue.
Let vs then make a compariſon betwéene
the olde and newe Teſtament, as much as
appertaineth to the word of God exhibited
in them both after this ſort: If God ſpake
by the Prophets in the old teſtament, then
alſo he hath ſpoken by the Apoſtles in the
new teſtament. And if the prophets taught
the word of God by mouth, the like ſo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the apoſtles haue done. And if the prophets
committed to writing the word of God, ſo
alſo haue the Apoſtles. Wherefore if the
prophets comprehended the whole doctrine
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old teſtament in their writings, why
ſhould not we ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Apoſtles haue alſo
compriſed the whole doctrine of the goſpel,
in their bookes? Now let the defenders of
the contrarie opinion, bring foorth &amp; ſhewe
ſome reaſon to diſprooue this my aſſertion.
I ſay ſome good reaſon, not borowed from
the dreames of mens braines, nor from to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall
&amp; cauilling arguments, but deriued
from the word of God. But this they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doo. Furthermore, I vrge this place of
the Apoſtle which we haue in hand, &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7264:28"/>
thus. If the word of God deliuered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diuers manners, waies, and at manie
times, be now altogether to be found in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
writings of the prophets: why ſhould not
we ſay the like of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell, being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word
of god, which (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtle witneſſeth) was
not at ſundrie times or in diuers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
deliuered? For otherwiſe who ſéeth
not, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the apoſtles compariſon in the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
text, were of no force. For if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle
had ſaide thus, then were our aduerſaries
opinion true: to wit, Like as in times paſt
vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t God ſpake at ſundry

&amp; alſo now ſpeaketh by the traditions

thus much touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt part of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.

vnto vs, firſt by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets, &amp; then after by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:7264:29"/>
Chriſt and his Apoſtles: and this is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
by this place of the Apoſtle, in that he
ſayth, In times paſt he ſpake by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
but in theſe laſt dayes by his ſonne:
And that this laſt ſpeaking apperteineth
alſo to the Apoſtles, it is manifeſt by the
words of the Apoſtle, in his ſecond chapter
of this Epiſtle, where he ſayth, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the goſpel
was firſt preached vnto vs by Chriſt, and
then confirmed by thoſe which heard him.
And againe <hi>Iohn</hi> the 20. and 17. Chriſt ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<note place="margin">Ioh, 20. 17</note>
As my Father ſent me, euen ſo ſend I
you. And it cannot be denied but that the

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond part of the minor is, that the
word of God deliuered by the Prophets, is
now only to be ſought for in the writings
of the Prophets. And this is proued by the
vſuall phraſes of the Scriptures, which by
the Prophets, meane the writings of the
Prophets, as <hi>Romanes</hi> the firſt, where hée
ſaith: Put a part for the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> which
he had promiſed before by his Prophets,

                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 24. And he began at <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lu. 24</note> &amp; at all
the Prophets, and interpreted vnto them
in all the Scriptures y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things which were
written of him. To conclude, becauſe I
will not recite many places, finally <hi>Peter</hi>
by the wordes of the Prophets meaneth
the writings of the Prophets.<note place="margin">2, Pet. 1.</note> 2. Epiſtle,
chapter. 1. And in the laſt ende of the ſame
chapter he ſaith thus: For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> propheſie came
not in olde time by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil of man, but holie
men of God ſpake as they were moued by
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt. Now if our aduerſaries will
not yéeld vnto vs, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bring good proofe
vnto vs to the contrarie: but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>, (as I haue
alreadie ſaid) they cannot doo.</p>
               <p>Now the third and laſt member is, that
they of the contrarie part, can bring forth
no proofe to the contrarie, but that we may
conclude touching the word of God deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto vs by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
it is wholy conteined in the writing of the
Apoſtles, as well as the word of God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
by the Prophets, is contained in the
writings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets, to wit, ſo much as
is neceſſarie for our faith &amp; ſaluation. But
if at any time our aduerſaries affirme that
they can bring ſome good reſon to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
then they muſt bring ſuch as muſt be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7264:30"/>
both true and alſo agréeing to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And thus the parts of our argument
béeing confirmed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> concluſion therof muſt

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:7264:33"/>
ſpake héere onely of the ſcriptures of the

héere addeth and ſaith, <hi>Through the faith
that is in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> he doeth manifeſtly
declare, that the doctrine of the Goſpell,
was ioyned with the knowledge of the old
Teſtament. But they may ſaye, that the
Goſpell was not then publiſhed in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
but onely deliuered and taught by
mouth. Firſt let them tell me, whereby
they gather this? for it is manifeſt by the
fourth Chapter of that his Epiſtle, that
<hi>Paule</hi> wrote this ſame Epiſtle, verie
néere about the time of his death. And
héere if you will make a good account of
the times, you ſhall eaſilye perceiue, that
then: when this Epiſtle was ſent vnto
<hi>Timothie,</hi> all the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles,
(or well néere all) were put in writing.
And furthermore, what matter were it, if
then the doctrine of the Goſpell had not
bene publiſhed in writing, inaſmuch as it
was afterward done. Finally, if ye would
that <hi>Paule</hi> ſhould héere ſpeak touching the
writing of the olde Teſtament onely, then
woulde I make mine argument of more
force and reaſon thus: <hi>If the writings of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7264:33"/>
the olde Teſtament were of ſuch force that
they were able to make men wiſe vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
how much more ſhall the whole

be able to perform the ſame?</hi> But he which
ſhall denie y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> this ſame excellent ſentence
of <hi>Paule</hi> touching the whole Scriptures,
(to wit, that it was giuen by inſpiration
of God, and is profitable to teach) doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine

he is not onely to be thruſt out

wiſe then Chriſt himſelf, his Apoſtles and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7264:39"/>

thoſe foundations which they layde, but
other: that they inſtruct the Church of
Chriſt amiſſe. But our aduerſaries teach
otherwiſe, inaſmuch, as they call y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church
not to the Scriptures alone, as is before
ſaid: but to traditions not written. And
out of the former argument, there ariſeth
this concluſion.</p>
            <p>If the Apoſtles (who although they wer
indued with the ſpirit of God) and taught
by mouth,<note place="margin">The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d argument againſt tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditions.</note> yet notwithſtanding did referre
themſelues vnto the Prophetical ſcriptures:
then a great deale more ought our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to referre their principles of doctrine,
vnto the holye Scriptures. And ſith they
doo not ſo: they are not to be heard.</p>
            <p>The antecedent is true:</p>
            <p>And therefore the conſequent muſt be
true.</p>
            <p>The antecedent is manifeſt by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon:<note place="margin">The expli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And the truth of the conſequent is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed

            <p>If all things be not contained in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the knowledge and faith whereof,<note place="margin">The third argument against tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditions,</note> is
neceſſarie to ſaluation, then it followeth,
that the ſpirit of God did not accompliſh
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7264:40"/>
his effect, when he gaue the ſcriptures vnto
the Church.</p>
            <p>But the conſequent is moſt falſe &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous:</p>
            <p>So likewiſe is the antecedent.</p>
            <p>The conſequent of the former propoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was prooued, when we went to ſearch
out the cauſes of the ſcriptures in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond
chapter of this our diſputation,<note place="margin">The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> where wée
affirmed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the word of God was to this
end &amp; purpoſe committed to writing, that
it might be freed and deliuered from the
corruption of man, and that it might help
the memorie of the godly, and finally, that
the Church might more and more bée in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
and confirmed in thoſe things, the
knowledg &amp; faith whereof, is neceſſarie to
ſaluation. Now, if all thoſe things be not
contained in the ſcriptures, then truly it
followeth, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the ſpirit of God did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
but in part accompliſh his effect: the
which God forbid. And certainly, if you
graunt this, (which cannot be denied) that
the ſcriptures were giuen vnto the church
not raſhly nor in vaine, but by the great
prouidence and wiſedome of God: then I
vrge this and ſay: If the ſcriptures were
giuen by God, that the word of god ſhuld
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7264:40"/>
be ſet frée and deliuered from the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of men, I pray you would the ſpirite of
God then, haue ſome certaine things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
to ſaluation to be ſet frée from the
corruption of men, and ſome things not?
If the Scriptures were giuen to helpe the
memorie of the godly: was it then giuen
in part onely? or ſhall we ſay, that of thoſe
things which were neceſſarie to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that ſome things are to be committed
to memorie, and ſome things not? or if the
memorie of thoſe things could haue bene
kept and preſerued without the ſcriptures,
to what ende were the Scriptures? for
the ſpirite of God doth nothing in vaine.
If the Scriptures were written, to the
ende our memorie might be holpen, who
then can denie, that our memorie muſt bée
holpen by the Scriptures, in all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
to ſaluation? Finally, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
If the Scripture were giuen by the
ſpirite of God, that thereby the Church
might be the better inſtructed, why then
ſhould not the Scriptures haue in them
al thoſe things, which are neceſſarie to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation?
Wherefore, what starting holes ſo
euer our aduerſaries ſéeke: yet the truth of
our former propoſition remaineth: to wit,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7264:41"/>
that they goe about to fruſtrate the ſpirit
of God, of his effect in giuing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
except in them be contained whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
is neceſſarie to our ſaluation.</p>
            <p>The conſequent no Chriſtian can deny.</p>
            <p>If the Apoſtles were led into all truth
by the ſpirit of God,<note place="margin">The 4. argument againſt tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditions.</note> as it appeareth Ioh. 16,
and wrote not all things that were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to ſaluation, that came to paſſe either
becauſe they ought not to write them, or
becauſe they would not write, or becauſe
they could not.</p>
            <p>But to affirme that they ought not, is
falſe: that they would not, is abſurd: and
that they could not, is the part of one that
diſputeth like an Atheiſt.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the antecedent is falſe, abſurd,
and altogether from Diuinitie.</p>
            <p>The conſequence of the former propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is maniſeſt,<note place="margin">The ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> except our aduerſaries
can bring any thing to the contrary. For
we diſpute not héere of euerye man, but
only of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles, whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of God
gouerned, and directed in the writing of
the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>The minor is manifeſt, except our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries

of diſſimilitude or vnlikeneſse in things
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7264:41"/>
not onely like, but alſo euen béeing the
ſelfe ſame. And this truly is moſt certaine
and moſt vndoubted amongſt all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
that if the Apoſtles wrote not all
things which are neceſſary to ſaluation,
that it was becauſe they ought not ſo to
doo. Qur aduerſaries of neceſſitie, muſt

they haue not written all things which

God himſelfe would not that men ſhould
know. But vndoubtedly our aduerſaryes
can prooue neither of theſe, and therefore
the concluſion of this argument, resteth

            <p>If the Canonicall bookes of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,<note place="margin">The fifte argument againſt traditions</note>

The Minor ſhall appeare by this inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which the reader ſhall moſt caſtly finde

it is manifeſt, that thoſe principles

which they refer vnto the vnwritten tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions

ſo that whether ſoeuer our aduerſaries

referre their principles of Religion, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

I will vrge the former grounde and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument:
that if thoſe principles repugne
with the writings of the Apoſtles, then
they are not Apoſtolike: If they confeſſe
that they doo repugne, then haue we our
purpoſe: if they denie it, then of neceſſity
they muſt turne to the writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
that theſe their opinions, whereof
the queſtion is, may be tried by them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they repugne with the writings of

not writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to wit, that they otherwiſe teach

haue taught: that the ſpirite of God
hath not accompliſhed his effect in publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
of the ſcriptures: that the Apoſtles
neither ought, neither could, or would write
all things neceſſarie to ſaluation: that the
writings of the old teſtament, is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
then the writings of the new: that the
holy Bible is not correſpondent to the title,
which is a Teſtament (if it bee lawfull for
men to adde to the will of God): that the
holy ſcriptures giuen after Christs incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and afterward the writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
are not abſolute in euerie point. And
that the ſame credite muſt bee giuen vnto

giuen vnto the ſcriptures of God: that we
muſt beleeue thoſe things whereof there is
no certaintie: that the cauſe of the old he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes

Heb. 8.<note place="margin">Heb, 8.</note> had ſet downe a difference betwéen
the old &amp; new teſtament, he bringeth forth
this place aboue recited of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> where
the ſchoolemen beginne to queſtion, what
ſhuld be the cauſe wherfore it is ſaid, that
the goſpell ſhuld be written in the minde?
Some bring forth this reaſon: for becauſe
the grace of God cannot be written. Of
which opinion is <hi>Thomas,</hi> whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole
swarme of ſchoolemen and Queſtionarye
Doctors doo moſt eſtéeme. But ſome had
rather this to be the cauſe: for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the Lawe, began from writing,
(for by and by the Tables of the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7264:50"/>
written, were publyſhed): but the
doctrine of the goſpell began from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles. Touching

And thus much touching the Anteredent,
where our aduerſaries commit moſt great
errour,<note place="margin">Taking their argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is in ſome ſort gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rally.

id quod impliciter.</hi> Now therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
their conſequent, the errours of the
which I will perticularly recite. The firſt
errour is, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſequent cannot follow:
for it followeth not to ſaie the doctrine of
the lawe was written in Tables, <hi>ergo</hi> the
doctrine of the Goſpell is not written at
all. Againe, the Goſpell is written in the
heart, <hi>ergo</hi> it is not written in Tables:
Who ſéeth not that theſe are friuolous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes,
and that their conſequents are
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7264:51"/>
falſe. Againe, they bring in a new kind of
reaſoning and reaſon from an vniuerſall
affirmatiue, to a particular negatiue, for
thus they ſay. God wrote al the doctrine of
the Goſpell in the minde of the godly: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>
certaine things appertaining vnto the
doctrine of the Goſpell are not written by
the Apoſtles. The which kinde of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
euen children would hiſſe at: for of
neceſſitie thus they muſt reaſon. Nothing
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is written in the heart is written in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
but the whole doctrine of the Goſpell
is written in the heart, <hi>ergo</hi> no part of the
doctrine of the Goſpel is written in tables.
The Maior is ſo falſe that euery man may
ſée it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond errour is, <hi>Falacia in figura
dictionis,</hi> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Logitians terme it,<note place="margin">The 2. errour.</note> for they
confound words of one ſignification, with
thoſe of diuerſe ſignifications: for, to write
in tables is a proper kinde of ſpéech, but to
write in the heart, is a borowed kinde of
ſpéech, and therefore of diuers ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſpoken by a Metaphore, and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that
<hi>Paule</hi> vſed another kinde of ſpeaking,
when hée ſayde that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were
his Epiſtle, (for hée went forwarde with
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7264:52"/>
the argument he had in hande) which was
when falſe Apostles would haue crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the mindes of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of commendations, then (ſayth he) I
haue no néed of ſuch Epiſtles, for you are
mine epiſtle, for my labor &amp; my diligence
is manifeſt towards you, euen in the eies
of all men. For all ſée, and (as I may ſaie)
may reade in you the doctrine of Chriſt,
which I haue preached vnto you: and to
conclude, this is the ſumme, that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
were ſo perfectly inſtructed, and
ſo well taught in the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might well remaine therin. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
thefore doth gather by theſe words
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtle, that the apoſtles did not write
all things neceſſarie to ſaluation, truly he
may be thought not to be well in his wits.</p>
            <p>The third errour is, for that they make
the efficient cauſe to repugne with the
cauſe inſtrumentall.<note place="margin">The 3. errour.</note> For God is hée who
writeth the Goſpell in the heart: but <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,
Paule,</hi> and the reſt, write the doctrine
of the Goſpell in tables, and were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of the ſpirit of God. Therefore
<hi>Paule</hi> in that place ſayd, that the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
were his Epiſtle: &amp; the epiſtle of Chriſt
miniſtred ſaith hée by vs, Loe héere you
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7264:52"/>
may ſée that hée maketh diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
his owne miniſterie and the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the holie Ghoſt. Wherefore our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries
conclude as if one ſhould reaſon
thus. God hath reſtored a ſicke perſon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his former health, <hi>ergo</hi> the Phiſition
preſcribed nothing, gaue him nothing to
drinke, neither yet vſed anie outwarde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.
Now if this concluſion be of anie
force, then this muſt néeds followe, GOD
wrote the Goſpel in the minde, <hi>ergo</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
wrote not the whole doctrine of the
Goſpell in Tables.</p>
            <p>The fourth errour is,<note place="margin">The 4. errour.</note> becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
agréeth not with their antecedent:
for if in the antecedent they oppone y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Scriptures vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> viſible, then trulie
they would bring this to paſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be: for vnto what
other ende doe they applie their oppoſition
opponing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inuiſible ſcriptures to the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

            <p>If we muſt not abſolutely ſtick vnto the

written the Goſpell in the mindes of the

godlie men: If all things (as they ſaie) are
not written which are neceſſarie to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to what end then appertaineth the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
For all things (ſaie they) that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
to ſaluation, God hath written in
the mindes of the godlie. But this argument
cannot bee concluded in one part onely: for
either it is vniuerſallie true, or els vniuerſally
falſe, &amp; ſo the whole authoritie of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

God forbid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe,</hi> If this conſequence be of anie

efficacie of God ſhould be confounded
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7264:54"/>
with the externall and viſible miniſterie of
the Apoſtles, and that traditions deliuered
by mouth, are the inuiſible Scriptures of
God, the which the holie Ghoſt did imprint
in the mind of the faithfull, the which thing
is moſt falſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe,</hi> if they make any good concluſion
out of that place of Ieremie, that all thinges
are not written that appertaine to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
becauſe vnder the new teſtament God
doth write his law in the minds of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
when as it was written in tables vnder
the old teſtament: Ergo by the force of this
oppoſition it followeth, that God in the old
teſtament did onely remit ſinne in part, and
that he was the God of the Iſraelites but in

that it wil come to paſſe that in the new

none of the traditions of our aduerſaries are

with the word of God, that the writings

all that doctrine of the Goſpell, the
which the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes did
teach and afterward put in writings, the
which alſo God by his ſpirit did write in

vnto the ſecond.</p>
            <p>The Church of Chriſt for the ſpace of
20. yeares wanted the writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,<note place="margin">The 2. obiection</note>
and was only contented with their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:
Ergo the writings of the Apoſtles
are not abſolutely neceſſarie vnto ſaluation,
neither is it needfull that al things appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:7264:55"/>
The Antecedent is manifeſt by reading

that the readers ſhould call to their reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce,
that the Church wanted not the
ſcriptures, before that the Goſpell was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
by the writings of the Apoſtles. Yea,
that Chriſt himſelfe and the Apoſtles did
preach the Goſpell out of the writings of

            <p>Wherefore the antecedent of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries

            <p>Therefore I denie the conſequent,<note place="margin">The error of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> for

<hi>Secundum ignorantiam Elenchi:</hi> for they

not twentie yeares, but two thouſande

            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:7264:56"/>
Let vs turne the argument of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries

            <p>If God being perfect wiſe,<note place="margin">The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection is returned.</note> hath not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the church of Chriſt, long time to want
the writings of the Apoſtles, both that hee
might maintaine the truth of the Goſpell,
as alſo he might prouide for the ſafegarde
of his church: Ergo, theſe men are blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
againſt the prouidence of god: which
denie that all things are contained in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall
writings, which are neceſſarie to
the doctrine of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>For to what end would God by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
prouidence, that the Apoſtles ſhould
write the goſpell, which they by mouth did
preach? was it becauſe they ſhould deliuer
an vncertain and imperfect doctrine? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
if at anie time the Church was
contented with the preaching of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:
to wit, in the firſt primitiue church:
I beſeech you why ſhall not ſhe nowe at

of the Apoſtles, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which (as is before ſaid)

            <p>In the firſt primitiue Church the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles

ſhould be either corrupted of men: or els,
(ſuch is the infirmitie of man) the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance

that Paule did neuer declare the full counſel

before the ſending of the holie Ghoſt
were not ſo fully capable of the myſteries
of God, which appertain vnto the doctrine
of the Goſpell: yet notwithſtanding, after
the comforter was ſent, and after they
were led into all truth, it is moſt vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the whole truth which appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

they kept his traditions.<note place="margin">6. Obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Ergo, Paule

            <p>The antecedent is prooued. 1. Cor. 11. I
praiſe you bretheren (ſaith Paule) that you

            <p>Nowe let vs come to the examining
of theyr Antecedent.<note place="margin">Anſvvere.</note> This place of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7264:61"/>
               <hi>Paule</hi> is expounded by <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> and
<hi>Ambroſe,</hi> as alſo of many other learned of
this our time, not touching doctrine, but
touching eccleſiaſticall rytes and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
Others againe confeſſe indéede, that
<hi>Paule</hi> doth héere intreate of certaine rytes
both appertaining to good order and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.
But yet notwithſtanding, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries
denie, that theſe wordes which
they obiect vnto vs, are to be reſtrained to
thoſe rytes: and they rather vnderſtande
and interpret this place generally, becauſe
<hi>Paule</hi> héere hath ſpoken it generally: for
he ſaith, I commende you brethren, for
that you haue remembred all my thinges,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Alſo they adde this word <hi>Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> héere
vſed indefinite or generally, ſcarce ſound
in the writings of the Apoſtles, reſtrained
or tied only to traditions which appertain
to orders and rytes of the Church. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they expound <hi>Paules</hi> words after this
ſort: <hi>You will keepe in memorie all thoſe
things which I haue taught,</hi> &amp; therein truly
I gretly praiſe you. But becauſe amongſt
other things which I deliuered vnto you,
to be obſerued touching rytes and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in your Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7264:61"/>
for that certaine are contencious amongſt
you, which doo not ſo well lyke of them: &amp;
therfore I declare theſe my reaſons, by the
which I was ledde to deliuer them vnto
you: this is theyr expoſition of this place.
But after what ſorte ſoeuer our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
doo vnderſtand it, yet truly their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
ſhall neuer be of any force. For if
he diſpute there touching rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
only, then is this place without the
compaſſe of our diſputation: for we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
touching thoſe things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
to ſaluation, and not of rites and
ceremonies, which may be chaunged for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
cauſes.</p>
            <p>Againe, if they be willing héere, that he
ſhould intreate of doctrine, yet ſerueth it
not anie thing for their purpoſe, as I wil
now declare, for I denie the conſequent.</p>
            <p>Paule deliuered many things to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.<note place="margin">The error</note>
Ergo ſome of them (ſaye they)
are not written. The conſequent hereof

            <p>Yet I confeſſe that this place hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in a plain &amp; leuel way. For firſt <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:7264:62"/>
did write that ſame tradition touching the
rytes of the which, he there ſpeketh. Again
although he had not written to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
yet he might write vnto others. To
conclude, if they were not extant in the
writings of <hi>Paul,</hi> yet might they be found
in the writings of the other Apoſtles. But
<hi>Paule ſaith, Be followers of me, as I follow
Chriſt.</hi> He therfore deliuered nothing, that
might in one iote be repugnaunt with
Chriſt, the which notwithſtanding our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries

            </p>
            <p>If by reaſon that Paul taught by mouth,

thoſe traditions be not written: Ergo, the

thus.</p>
            <p>If the traditions which Paule doth there,

of our Aduerſaryes themſelues, becauſe

their Monkes preach not bare headed, but

ſhall it be lawful for vs, to neglect thoſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,

            <p>That we may therefore amend this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,<note place="margin">The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note>
we muſt ſay that <hi>Paule</hi> doth in that

as he had diligently conſidered how great

Whereby we ſée, that wée muſt alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

leaſt the forged deuices of men, doe
withdrawe vs from the truth of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
            <p>Paule biddeth the Theſſalonians to
keep the traditions which they had learned
either by word or by Epiſtle:<note place="margin">7. Obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Ergo, Paule
wrote not all Traditions neceſſarie to

            <p>The antecedent is prooued 2. Theſſa. 2.

            <p>Now let vs trye the antecedent.<note place="margin">Anſvvere</note> In

            <p>So alſo he vſeth this word <hi>[Mete]</hi> in

wherefore it is as though he ſhoulde ſaye,
ſtande ye faſt in the doctrine, which you
haue learned both by our wordes when

            <p>Therefore I deny their conſequence,<note place="margin">The error</note> for

by worde and Epiſtle, that thoſe thinges

for if they were not written in

And in another place hee attributed vnto
them a moſt ſure perſwaſion of faith, which
they receiued by preaching, Whereby it is
proued, that Paule did deliuer to the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,
all thinges neceſſarie to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
the which thinges could not bee if the

            <p>If the Theſlalonians were throughlye
inſtructed in chriſtian religion,<note place="margin">The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection returned,</note> and that by

howe much more ought wee to

            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:7264:65"/>
Therefore the errour of our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
muſt be amended,<note place="margin">The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting.</note> and we muſt ſaye,
that <hi>Paule</hi> inſtructed the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> not

he had ſéene of what great value his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

And thereby alſo that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>Paule praied that he might ſee the face

            </p>
            <p>I doo thus aunſwere their antecedent.
Manie of the olde writers doe vnderſtand
this place touching doctrine:<note place="margin">Chriſoſt.</note> For <hi>Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>

               <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
Although <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſéeme not to

as though vnto you (ſaith he) there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
part of faith wanting, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you ought
or néed to learne anie thing. And I ſée this
opinion of interpreters greatly to pleaſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7264:65"/>
certaine of the learned new writers. But
other expound the name of faith touching
the conſtancie of faith, as in the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he ſayth:<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 3.</note> 
               <hi>I ſent that I might know your

            <p>Now concerning their conſequent,<note place="margin">The error</note> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it: for if by this word faith, they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

the olde fathers wrote thoſe things which

But becauſe I will not say y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> that is falſe,

therby he might the more firmely eſtabliſh

of what great efficacie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſence of

            <p>Paule wrote vnto the Corinthians, that

to be taught by mouth. The antecedent is
proued. 1. Cor. 11.</p>
            <p>Thus I anſwere their antecedent, <hi>Paule</hi>
doth not héere ſpeak of the chiefe points of
faith,<note place="margin">Anſvvere</note> but of Eccleſiaſticall order. For the
Gréeke word which he vſeth, ſignifieth to

elders as I haue commaunded thee,</hi> where
<hi>Paule</hi> vſeth the verie ſame Gréeke worde.
And againe, 1. <hi>Cor. 16. Paule</hi> vſeth the ſame
word in the actiue voice, touching the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
of their liberalitie, &amp; ſaith, becauſe
I haue commanded, &amp;c. And ſpeaketh of an

and we ſay Ordaine.</p>
            <p>Now I denie their conſequent:<note place="margin">Error</note> for the

their conſequence is falſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:7264:67"/>
               <hi>Paule</hi> would ſet in order certaine things

new principles of faith. Againe they
reaſon thus: <hi>Paule</hi> deferred certaine things

            <p>
               <hi>And therefore wée maye well bring

               <note place="margin">Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,</note> 
               <hi>ſaying: If that be

that Paule then when hee wrote that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,
had not deliuered to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
al thoſe things which wer neceſſarie to
faith: then would it come to paſſe (which
GOD forbid) that thoſe thing which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
in his Epiſtle, were not true: to wit,
that the Corinthians were made rich in
all knowledge:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1</note> 
               <hi>The 1. Corinth. Alſo hee
ſayth: I declare vnto you the Goſpell the

And againe, Ye abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in al things, in faith,

ſuch like examples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, this their obiection may be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vpon themſelues, and correted as wée
haue done in the former arguments,</p>
            <p>Iohn would not write much,<note place="margin">Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> Ergo, hee
wrote not all things neceſſarie to faith.</p>
            <p>The antecedent is proued in the 2. and
3. Epiſtles of Iohn, wher he ſaith thus: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I had manie things to write vnto you, yet
would I not write with paper and inke.</p>
            <p>I admit their antecedent,<note place="margin">Anſvvere Error</note> yet I denye
their conſequent. For theſe things hang
not together. <hi>Iohn</hi> had manye things to
write, <hi>Ergo</hi> they were principles of faith.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> alſo they are not any wher exta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for
otherwiſe this abſurditie would followe.</p>
            <p>That the ſame Ladie vnto the which
Iohn wrote,<note place="margin">Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> was not fullie inſtructed in chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

with Iohns ſpeeches, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth

turned vpon themſelues, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Manie other things did Ieſus,<note place="margin">11. obiec.</note> beſide thoſe
which were written, the which if they were
euerie one written, the whole world would
not containe the bookes: Ergo, all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
to faith are not written by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
            <p>The antecedent is proued Iohn. 21.</p>
            <p>I gaunt their antecedent:<note place="margin">Anſvvere</note> yet I denye
their conſequent. For the error is, <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
ignorantiam Elenchi:</hi> for they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
héere without the compaſſe of our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
<hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh in that place of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which Chriſt did, &amp; our diſputation is
of doctrine neceſſarie to faith &amp; saluation.
For theſe are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of <hi>Iohn, Chriſt did
manie things,</hi> &amp; therfore héerof commeth no
conſequent. Al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miracles y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt did, are

of chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; doctrin are not write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now ſée héere how our aduerſaries beat
themſelues with their owne weapons:</hi> For
if our aduerſaries refer their traditions vnto
thoſe things which Iohn faith are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:<note place="margin">The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ouer throwe their own traditions</note>
Ergo, thoſe traditions are infinit &amp; with

without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of knowledge.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7264:69"/>
               <hi>And truly I eaſely confeſſe, that ſuch kind
of traditions are ſo greatly increaſed, that
the world now can ſcantly beare them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We may therefore turne their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vpon themſelues thus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection returned.</note> Iohn ſaith,
Chriſt did manie other things, which are
not written: but he alſo affirmeth, That
thoſe things which are written, are written
to the ende we might beleeue &amp; haue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life. Ergo, thoſe things which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
are ſufficient to ſaluation.</p>
            <p>The error therefore of our aduerſaries
may thus be amended,<note place="margin">Correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> ſaieng. <hi>Iohn</hi> and
the reſt of the Euangelists, did chooſe out of
thoſe things which Chriſt did, being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
infinite, thoſe which ſéemed neceſſary:
whereby it commeth to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we ought
to be contented with the writings of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles did often recite teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
taken from the traditions of ſuch aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
men,<note place="margin">12. Obiec.</note> as liued before their daies. Ergo,
wee muſt not onelie ſticke to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>The antecedent is manifeſt. 2. Tim 3. As
Iannes &amp; Iambris withſtood Moſes. Againe,
Iude ver. 9. Michael the Archangell diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
about the bodie of Moſes. And a little
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7264:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after he reciteth the Prophecie of Enoch,
Behold the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth with manie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of his ſaints.</p>
            <p>To their antecedent I aunſwere thus,<note place="margin">Anſvvere</note>
Indéede I confeſſe, that the Apoſtles didde
ſometimes recite certaine ſentences taken
out of the bookes <hi>Apocripha:</hi> And to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
the place of <hi>Paule</hi> in <hi>Timothie,</hi> I
doo not doubt but in his time y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſome booke
did remaine touching thoſe Magis <hi>Iannes</hi>
and <hi>Iambris:</hi> for <hi>Plinie</hi> in his 30. booke of
his naturall hiſtorie. chap. 1. doth there rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vp <hi>Iannes</hi> amongſt the auncient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi,
the which he would not haue done, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he had learned it out of ſome booke.
And furthermore, I aunſwere that thoſe
Ethnickes, were not altogether to bée
refuſed of the Apoſtles:<note place="margin">Act. 17 Tit. 1.</note> for ſo <hi>Paule</hi> reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
certaine verſes out of <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minides:</hi>
but I doo affirme, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
did not therfore vſe theſe teſtimonies,
that by them they wold confirme any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of faith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> for when they would ſo doo,
they had alwaies readie expreſſe places ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the writings of the Prophets,
and thoſe they did expounde according to
the motion of the holy Ghoſt. But when
they would teach any doctrine touching
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7264:70"/>
manners, or declare ſome thing, touching
the which very few or none did doubt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
if peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture they remembred any thing
written in the bookes <hi>Apocripha,</hi> or in the
writings of thoſe Ethinks, they did not ſo
diſlike their ſentences, but that they wold
apply them vnto their purpoſe: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
the Apoſtles did not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
ſo great authoritie vnto them, that
they ſhould be of ſufficient authoritie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
for god forbid we ſhuld once think
ſo. But they were willing by that meanes
to mooue mens mindes the more, that they
might thereby the eaſier receiue their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
which notwithſtanding was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſufficiently confirmed, euen by the
word of God. As for examples ſake it is
manifeſt in Exodus, that the Magi or wiſe
men of <hi>Aegipt</hi> withſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is it by what name thoſe Magi were
called, or can thoſe their names be applyed
to any principle of faith? No, to none tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Alſo <hi>Michael woulde not vſe railing
words vnto the diuell,</hi> as Saint <hi>Iude</hi> ſaith:
wherby we may learn much leſſe to ſpeak
euil of Magiſtrates ordained of God. This
exhortation of <hi>Iude</hi> to the reuerencing of
Magiſtrates, is in many places to be found
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7264:70"/>
in the ſcriptures. The like is that which
<hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2</note> 
               <hi>That the Angels doo not raile
on thoſe that haue authoritie. 2. Pet.</hi> 2. Alſo
the Lord will come ſaith <hi>Iude,</hi> to rewarde
the wicked, the which threatnings is vſual
in the holy ſcriptures. Whereby we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
ſée, to what ende the Apoſtles culled
out certaine ſentences from the bookes <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocripha,</hi>
to the ſeruing of their own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Now we come vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which
I denie. The Apoſtles did vſe certain ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
taken out of the bookes <hi>Apocripha:
Ergo,</hi> they vſed them to the confirmation of
faith. And againe therefore alſo we ought
to runne to traditions ſo often as we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of faith, as though the teſtimonies of
the holy ſcriptures did faile vs. This is a
falſe argument, &amp; no good conſequent can
come héerof. For the Apoſtles vſed not ſuch
teſtimonies to confirme principles of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Yea: and euen thoſe teſtimonies them
ſelues (if you marke well the matter) you
ſhall ſée them confirmed by many &amp; expres
places of ſcriptures. Wherfore our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
ſéeme to be forgetful of our purpoſed
queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, while they go about to obiect theſe
things to vs: for this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate of our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
(whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther ariſeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie touching
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7264:71"/>
faith, whether we ought to ſticke onelye to
the teſtimonies of the Scriptures, or els to
adde thervnto traditions, to the which we
may giue the like credite, as we maye to
the ſcriptures. But you ſhall finde no ſuch
thing in theſe teſtimonies which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
vſed, as I haue before ſhewed. Yea,
and I may ſay that this argument is not
rightly applied againſt vs in this cauſe,
taken from the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Let vs retourne this abſurditie on our
aduerſaries, ſaieng thus.</p>
            <p>If becauſe the Apoſtles did recite certaine
ſentences out of bookes not Canonicall,<note place="margin">Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note>
that therefore it followeth the Apoſtles did
attribute authoritie to thoſe bookes &amp; ſuch
like in matters of faith. Ergo, becauſe ſome
of the Apoſtles did recite ſome out of the
Ethnicks bookes, it muſt follow, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
did attribute authoritie to thoſe
bookes in matters of faith, which thing is
abſurde and contrarie to the opinion of all
men.</p>
            <p>Let vs tourne this obiection vppon our
aduerſaries, after this ſort.</p>
            <p>If the Apoſtles did at anie time recite
the traditions of auncient fathers,<note place="margin">Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> returned.</note> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to beautifie thoſe things which wer eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7264:71"/>
and confirmed by moſt firme teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of holie ſcriptures? How much leſſe
then ought wee to recite the traditions of
the olde fathers, to the confirming of thoſe
things which want teſtimonie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore we may amend the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of this their obiection, and ſaye,<note place="margin">Correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that
the Apoſtles whereas they did applie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to the capacitie of men, that they
might thereby the better ſtirre them vp, or
the more eaſily conuince them, they vſed
ſome times the bookes <hi>Apocripha,</hi> as alſo
ſentences gathred from Ethincks, to wit,
when they did diſpute of thoſe things, the
truth whereof was manifeſt in the holye
ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>The heretikes did wreaſt the writinges
of Paule,<note place="margin">13. obiect</note> &amp; that in the verie time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and alſo it is moſt manifeſt that the
heretiks: yea, &amp; Sathan himſelfe haue cloked
their hereſies euen with the Scriptures: ergo
we muſt not cleaue to the Scriptures alone.
The antecedent is proued, 2. Pe. 3. as alſo by
the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, and alſo Math 4.
If thou be the ſonne of GOD caſt thy ſelfe
down headlong, for it is written he ſhal giue
his Angells charge ouer thee, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:7264:72"/>
I admit their antecedent.</p>
            <p>But I denie their conſequent.<note place="margin">Anſvvere</note> Neither
doth <hi>Peter</hi> ſo conclude, but rather calleth
them vnto the writings of <hi>Paule,</hi> then in
anie part to abridge the ſame. The error is
as the Logitians ſay, <hi>Secundum non cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam

            </p>
            <p>The heretikes abuſed the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Error</note> &amp;
wreſted the writings of the Apoſtles into
a contrarie ſence, <hi>ergo</hi> ſaye they, we ought

is not in fault, but onely men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
which doo wreſt ſo worthie a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

this is ſo farre from the Apoſtles minde,
that we ſhould leaue the aide of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
becauſe heretikes haue abuſed them,
that rather the heretikes are by the verie
ſcriptures to be conuinced, like as we haue
alreadie proued out of the places of <hi>Paule,
2. Tim. 3. Tit.</hi> 1. And when Sathan abuſed
the Scriptures,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. Tit. 1.</note> that he might weaken the
faith of Chriſt, truely Chriſt went not to
traditions, but with the Scriptures again
ouerthrew the enimy. For ſathan obiecting
and ſaying it is written: Chriſt alſo on the

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7264:72"/>
left in tradition.<note place="margin">Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,</note> And therefore we muſt
bring them to this inconuenience, ſaying.</p>
            <p>If becauſe the heretikes falſified the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
we may not therefore only cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Scriptures: then truely becauſe the
heretikes falſely fathered traditions to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike,
as wee haue prooued before both
out of the writings of the Apoſtles, as alſo
out of Irenaeus and Euſebius: therefore wee
may not ſticke onely to traditions. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
becauſe heretikes abuſed both Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and traditions, therefore we muſt ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cleaue to Scriptures, nor to traditions:
the which is abſurde, and euen our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
themſelues yeeld to the ſame.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore turne their argument

            <p>If like as Sathan abuſed the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Chriſt, ſo likewiſe the heretiks do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
true Chriſtians. Then truly as Chriſt
vſed the Scripture onely to repell Sathan:
ſo likewiſe the true Chriſtians muſt vſe
onely the Scriptures in repelling of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</p>
            <p>And therefore we may amend their error
thus:<note place="margin">Correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> If ſuch be the wickednes of the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,

kéepe both their authoritie and puritie, the
which will be if the heretiks be conuinced
by the Scriptures alone, and thoſe places
which ſhall ſéeme ſomewhat obſcure, maye
take their interpretation from places more

vnto vs: yet at the leaſt waies let them
giue eare euen vnto themſelues,<note place="margin">Can. rela. Diſt. 37</note> in whoſe

            <p>The doctrine touching the baptiſme of
Infants is not found in the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">14. obiec.</note>
neither theſe words, Trinitie, like ſubſtance,
perſons, &amp; manie ſuch like: all which words

and principles of faith: Ergo all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
vnto faith are not to be found in
the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The antecedent is found true by reading
of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Now touching their antecedent,<note place="margin">Anſvvere</note> I ſaie
thus: In that they affirme the doctrine
concerning Baptiſme of children not to be
found in the Scriptures is moſt falſe, like
as our late writers haue taught in theyr

touching the which I will not héere make

<hi>Trinitie, like ſubſtance, and perſons:</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
they are not found in the writings of
the Apoſtles, but yet I ſaie y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the verie doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
which is ſignified by theſe words, is
deriued from the Scriptures: for when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
heretiks roſe vp which denied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine, then the godly Fathers
which liued in thoſe daies, hauing care of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
circumſtances, added theſe wordes: by the
which they might the more eaſily explicate
&amp; declare the doctrine touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trinitie,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which doctrine they had before confirmed
by expreſſe and manifeſt teſtimonies of the

            <p>Now touching their conſequence. The
error is,<note place="margin">Errour</note> 
               <hi>Secundum fallaciam figurae dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi>
Theſe words <hi>Trinitie, the baptiſme of
infants, like ſubſtance,</hi> are not found in the
Scripture, it is called [<hi>Omonomos</hi>] for the
words indéede are not found in the holie
Scriptures, but the things ſignified by the
words are there found. And our chriſtian
faith conſiſteth not in the title of words,
but in ſubſtance of matter, not in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7264:74"/>

            <p>And therfore our aduerſaries reaſoning

            <p>If becauſe the perſons, the trinitie,<note place="margin">Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie.</note> and ſuch
like words be not extant in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
it therfore followeth, that all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
to faith are not found in the holye
ſcriptures: Ergo theſe words are neceſſarie to
faith, and ſo by force of the conſequent: Sith
this worde [Omoouſios] that is like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and ſuch other wordes were onely
found out by the godly Doctors after the

it followe that the Church of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

&amp; contrarie to the Scriptures of God.</p>
            <p>And therefore we may amend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> error
of this their obiection,<note place="margin">Correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> ſaying: That it is

            <p>If we muſt altogether beleeue the church

The antecedent is true: and therfore
it muſt follow that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is alſo true.</p>
            <p>The Maior hath two parts, touching the
which we will particularly ſpeake.<note place="margin">Anſvvere</note> And
touching the firſt point, I doe make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7264:75"/>
of the Church, which <hi>Paule</hi> calleth
the houſe of God, the piller &amp; foundation of
truth, which heareth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voice of her ſpouſe, &amp;
onely dependeth vpon his mouth, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
gouerned by the ſpirit of God, &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſéene becauſe ſhée is not tied to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances

we beleeue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the ſame church
is vpholden by the word of God, &amp; that ſhe
nothing eſtéemeth mans traditions. But
this or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> viſible Church, or the companie of
many viſible congregations may ſwarue
from the truth, as it is manifeſt touching
the Churches in the Eaſt, of which y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> moſt
part haue turned to <hi>Mahumet.</hi> I will not
héere bring in the ancient counſells, which
haue both allowed &amp; brought into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church
great &amp; gréeuous errors. And touching this
church we may thus determine: inaſmuch
as ſhe is ſubiect to many errors, ſhe is not
otherwiſe to be heard, except ſhée ſpeake
thoſe thinges which are agréeable to the
Scriptures, touching which matter I haue
diſputed more at large in another place:
wherefore this hath héere no place which
they ſay &amp; affirme, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wée muſt altogether
beléeue the church, &amp; in part ſwarue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
credit of the ſame, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt we beléeue the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7264:75"/>
viſible Churches, when as they propound
nothing els vnto vs but the word of God:
&amp; on the other ſide we ought not to beléeue
the viſible churches when they ſwarue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the word of God, for I make my example
by the Sinagogue which very religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath reſerued the Cannons or bookes
of the Scriptures, yet notwithſtanding ſhe
hath innumerable errors. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may
beléeue the ſame Sinagogue, whereby ſhe
ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Canonicall bookes haue ſprong
from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of God: &amp; againe we may not
beléeue her, when ſhe reiecteth &amp; caſteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the doctrine of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> Therfore in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
reſpect Chriſt ſaith:<note place="margin">lbi. <hi>ve.</hi> 16.</note> The Scribes &amp; Phare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire are to be heard,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note>
&amp; yet notwithſtanding in another place he
reprehendeth &amp; reproueth their traditions,
whereby wée ſée proued, that in one parte
they ought to be heard, &amp; on the other not.
Wherfore their Minor is not true, &amp; ſo the
conſequence cannot ſtand, becauſe there is
an error,<note place="margin">Errour</note> 
               <hi>Secundum fallaciam figurae dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi>
And they reaſoning thus, we may well
bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a great inconuenience, ſaying.
<hi>In the time of Tertulian the church did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie.</note>

the time of the Nice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, the church did
affirme, that oblation for birth daies was not
a tradition of the Apoſtles, as in his proper

ſwarue from the Church, then muſt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the things which are manifeſt oppoſit

impoſsible.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we may turne their obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>And therefore we may amend the error

moſt diligently ought we to take héede,

true church of God neuer ſwerneth: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
therefore the Church affirmeth vnto vs,
that the ſcriptures are the word of God,
we acknowledge the ſame to be true, not
onely becauſe the church ſo affirmeth, but
becauſe of the inward efficacie of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite

as the church by the conduction of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite

is true, which the Church affirmeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our
faith may neuer reſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, but for euer

            <p>The Apoſtles did adde vnto the lawe:
to wit the doctrine of the Goſpell: Ergo,<note place="margin">16. obiec.</note>
it is lawfull to adde vnto the worde of
God.</p>
            <p>To the antecedent I thus aunſwere.<note place="margin">Anſvvere</note>
Although the doctrine of the Goſpell bée
more full and fruitfull then the writing
of the olde Teſtament, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if ye well mark the matter: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new
and olde teſtament, the ſelfe ſame doctrine
of ſaluation is contained in them both, for
that is moſt true which <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith Acts,
26.<note place="margin">Act. 26.</note> that he taught no other thing, then that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7264:77"/>
which the prophets and <hi>Moſes</hi> had before
taught. And againe in the firſt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note>
he ſheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the goſpel was before promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the Prophets, &amp; therfore this is falſe
which they ſay, that the Apoſtles added to
the law: for it is one thing to adde to the
lawe, and another to erpound and referre
it to his owne proper ſcope and purpoſe.
For let ſome man bring forth an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(that we may vſe this ſimilitude) and
the payment being made, he addeth at the
ende that the Obligation is ſatiſfied, I
pray you can he well be ſayd to adde any
thing to the ſame Obligation? So when
the Apoſtles gaue teſtimonie to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that Chriſt by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
both the lawe and the prophets, they
did not adde either to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, or writings
of the Prophets.</p>
            <p>Now, their conſequent,<note place="margin">Errour.</note> I denie: for héere
is an error, <hi>Secundum figuram dictionis,</hi>
as it is manifeſt by theſe things which I
haue alreadie ſpoken. Yea, alſo the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot well procéed from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
to other men: for graunt this, that
God would adde vnto his lawe, and that
it was done by the miniſterie of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
which wrote by the influence &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7264:78"/>
of the ſpirit of God: yet truly héereby
can nothing happen, whereby it ſhoulde be
lawfull for other men to adde vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
word of God.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſithen by the argumentation
of our aduerſaries, there would follow the
ouerthrowe of this moſt noble &amp; excellent
doctrine, touching the ſimilitude of the old
and new Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Therefore we may well amend their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
by this moſt excellent ſaieng,<note place="margin">Correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> which is

ſaith, <hi>What is the Lawe?</hi> he aunſwereth &amp;
ſaith: <hi>It is the Goſpell foreſhewed.</hi> Againe
he demaundeth, <hi>What is the Goſpell?</hi> he
aunſ wereth, <hi>The Lawe fulfilled.</hi> By which
words it is manifeſt, that the Goſpell is
not a newe doctrine added vnto the lawe,
but a new fulfilling of the olde promiſe.

all thoſe their obiections, which they haue
or can bring forth in an argument, which
is thus.</p>
            <p>The Doctors of the Church haue thought

            <p>Ergo all thoſe things which are neceſſarie
vnto faith and ſaluation are not contained in
the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Let vs now trie their antecedent.<note place="margin">Anſvvere</note> It
is manifeſt by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teſtimonies of the ancient

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe auncient fathers haue not written

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7264:92"/>
it behooued to knowe the minde and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the olde Doctors before they obiect
them to vs. But let this be the full ſumme
of all thoſe things which the auncient doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
who are moſt to be accounted of, haue
written touching Traditions. All thoſe
things which are deliuered, either apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to the principles of religion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of manners, or elſe vnto eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
rites and orders of the Church, but
thoſe thinges which appertaine to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of faith and manners, are moſt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contained in the Scriptures, neither is
it anie hindera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce if certaine kinds of ſpéech
to the eaſie explication of doctrine &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of religion, be not found by expreſſe
words in the holy Scriptures, ſo that the
matter it ſelfe, &amp; the ſence ſignified by theſe
tearms be extant in the ſcriptures: But as
touching thoſe things which appertain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
rites &amp; eccleſiaſticall order if they agrée
with the Scriptures, and ſerue to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Church: Yea, finally, if they
be receiued with the common conſent of
the whole Church, then are they with
greate reuerence to be receiued, and that
this was the opinion and minde, of
the auncient Fathers, I thinke it is
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7264:93"/>
ſufficiently made manifeſt by theſe things
which haue bene alleadged before: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we may ſée, that the ground and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of our aduerſaries is falſe.</p>
            <p>Now therfore I denie their conſequent:<note place="margin">The error of the former obiection</note>
for the errour is in forme of reaſoning:
the Argument is grounded vpon the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnderſtanding
of the fathers. Another er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
is this: for that they take that to bée
graunted; which lyeth betwéene vs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie.
For thus ſtandeth the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
vs, whether in confirming princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of faith, the ſcriptures alone be to bée
harde, yea or nay. But our aduerſaries
ſtraight waies propone to vs the opinion
of Doctours, and thereby they by and by
conclude, that the Scriptures alone are
not to be heard, to wit, being vnmindful,
that this ſelfe ſame thing is a controuerſie
betwéene vs. For if this opinion touching
the which we doo diſpute, may be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the writings of the Doctors, then
it followeth, that the ſcriptures alone are
not to be heard in eſtabliſhing articles of
faith. Wherefore our aduerſaries doo not
rightly diſpute, their firſt principle béeing
not rightly applyed.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the errour of their former
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7264:93"/>
concluſion, is thus to be corrected: In aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the writings of all the Doctors,<note place="margin">Correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former obiection</note>
muſt be brought vnto the rule of the holy
ſcriptures, both the word of God ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
it, and alſo the Doctors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
conſenting therevnto: and the olde
Doctors of the Church themſelues, haue
taught that euery article of our faith muſt
be grounded vpon the ſcriptures only: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
Eccleſiaſtical rytes and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
if they agrée with the ſcriptures, if
they ſerue to the edification of the church:
yea, finally, if they be receiued with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conſent of the whole Church, that
then they are to be receiued with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence:
Now héere we muſt diligently
ſearch out, whether that this opinion of the
Doctours, be agréeable to the word of god,
ſo that ſo farre it is to be receiued, as it
hath his confirmation by the Scriptures.
And becauſe our whole Diſputation is
heere had onely touching principles of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
neceſſarie to faith and ſaluation, that
we may not ſeeme to wander from our
propoſed queſtion, we héere ceaſe: neyther
