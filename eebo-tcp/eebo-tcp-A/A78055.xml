            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>lifying and deſpiſing the ſaid Order, ſued the Sheriffs for an Eſcape, whereupon he was again clapt up a cloſe Priſoner in the ſame <hi>New-gate:</hi> But upon his Petition to the Lords at their reaſſembling, their Lo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dſhips were pleas'd to order the commitment of thoſe Creditors, but the ſudden diſſolution of that Parliament fruſtrated Mr. <hi>Buſhell</hi> of the benefit of the ſaid Order.</p>
            <p>The ſame Creditors at whoſe ſuit he is now a Priſoner, did in <hi>Cromwels</hi> time ſubſcribe to take five in the hundred; nor do they aim now ſo much at the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their debt, as to ſerve the avarice of others, (with whom they are combined) who have intruded into Mr. <hi>Buſhells</hi> Eſtate, and now ſeek by this oppreſſion to deprive him of all means to recover his Rights, which they have wreſted out of his hands: One <hi>Jones</hi> having now a Mine of Mr. <hi>Buſhells,</hi> which he hath kept from him many years, worth 700 <hi>l. per an.</hi> and that for nothing almoſt.</p>
            <p>Nor is the debt to <hi>Crofts</hi> ſo juſt as is pretended, being for Commanders and Souldiers clothes, in which the ſaid Mr. <hi>Buſhell</hi> was cheated with Copper inſtead of Silver Lace.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Buſhell</hi> humby conceives hereupon, that the relief their Lordſhips ſhall afford him will be a high Juſtice to their late and preſent Majeſties, their Lordſhips own Honour, and the whole Nation in general.</p>
            <p>For if a Perſon that hath done their Majeſties ſuch Signal ſervices ſhall have no other Monument then a loathſome Gaole, it cannot but caſt an unhandſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on their Majeſties: What his ſervices to his late Majeſty were, and what His Majeſties Reſentment of them was, does appear by his Royall Atteſtation.</p>
            <p>For his ſervice to His preſent Majeſty, he humbly refers himſelf to His Royal Breaſt; only this he muſt take the boldneſs to ſay, That by the intelligence which at a dear Rate he purchaſed, and gave His Majeſty of a deſign laid by <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his curſed Fraternity, to deſtroy both His Majeſty and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> he was one of the Principall Inſtruments of the happineſs, theſe Kingdoms now injoy in their reſtored Prince.</p>
            <p>What a Juſtice it will be to their Lordſhips own Honours, will be no hard matter to conjecture: For, if Articles made by their General, and Confirmed by the Parliament, and Orders in purſuance of them be ſo eaſily violable; a great diminution and contempt both of their Honour and Authority will neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, eſpecially in ſuch a Caſe as this: For Mr. <hi>Buſhell</hi> could not be ſo ſtupidly inſenſible of his own ingagements, as to have adventured himſelf among ſo many Creditors, but that he conceived himſelf ſecured by the Honour of a Parliament, which he had received in Hoſtage for the performance of his Articles.</p>
            <p>What a Juſtice it will be to the Nation in general, may be concluded from his conſtant indeavours (which have not been without Eminent ſucceſs) to promote the honour and profit of it, inriching it by diſcovering its Subterranean Treaſure, and imploying many poor people who are now ready to ſtarve for want of him: Nor are the Mines in a better condition, thoſe that have injuriouſly extorted them out of his hands, not knowing how to work them; So that they now lie uſeleſs and unprofitable, being buryed in their own Ruines; and that he is able to reſtore them may be eaſily Credited from his firſt reducing them from a ruder Chaos to ſuch a perfection, as that of the Silver extracted out of Lead, he Coyned a 100 l. a week.</p>
            <p>Nor have the Eclipſes he has ſuffered in his fortunes (to a total deprivation of them) had any influence on his Induſtry, which has ſtill continued indefatigable. Witneſs the Recovery of a Work at <hi>Row-Pits</hi> on <hi>Mendyppe</hi> in the County of <hi>Summerſet,</hi> formerly deſerted (by reaſon of the abundance of water) by Sir <hi>Bevis Bulmar,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Buſhell</hi> is ſo confident, that he will be content to forfeit all his Grants both of the Mines, Mint, and Cuſtoms of Lead, and to ſuffer death as the greateſt Traytor and Impoſter, if in two years time he doth not out of that drowned work and other diſcoveries of his own, raiſe 1000 l. a week. Provided he be ſecured by the Parliament in the quiet injoyment of them, when he has been at the trouble and charge to drein the one, and diſcover the other.</p>
            <p>This work had been long ſince perfected, had not his Arreſt and Impriſonment (contrary to his Articles, deſtroyed that little Reputation he had left, and invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him in thoſe misfortunes, which make him now an humble Suitor for their Lordſhips relief. And certainly it cannot but ſeem to my Rational man to be very hard meaſure, a Perſon that hath done and is ſtill able to do ſuch conſiderable ſervices to the publick (to which he ever was, and ſtill is only devoted) ſhould be denyed a ſhare in that happineſs of which himſelf was ſo great an Inſtrument, and which he dares ſay he is able by mineral diſcoveries, to advance more then any other Subject within His Majeſties Kidgdoms. Mr. <hi>Buſhell</hi> having been proved by a part of his life, led for three years in an obſcure Hermitage, before he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by his maſter the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> to attempt the ſaid mineral deſign. And after that, to preſerve himſelf from utter ruine, he was forced in the late Wars to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a three years famine in <hi>Lundy Iſland,</hi> before he had thoſe Articles, whoſe Confirmation he now humbly deſires. As alſo three years baniſhment from the Converſation or ſight of his friends or any others at <hi>Lambeth</hi> for ſervice he had done His Majeſty; to which retirement he was purſued by <hi>Cromwels</hi> bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, and others who had intruded into his Eſtate. And after all this hath languiſhed and groaned under a loathſome Sepultu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e for three years more in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> contrary to the Articles he had given him by the Parliaments General, and Confirmed by an Ordinance of their own, as hath been ſaid before.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhall ſeek to prejudice the Reputation of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Buſhell,</hi> by objecting againſt him the multiplicity of his Debts yet unſatisfied: It cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by any Rational man, but that a perſon ingaged in ſo expenceful a deſign as that of the Mines muſt of neceſſity Contract ſome Debts, which had not his late Majeſties Commands called him from thoſe rich Works his own Induſtry had raiſed, or had he been reſtored to his Eſtate as he ought by his Articles, had, been long ſince diſcharged; So that the non-payment of his Debts contracted before the Wars, thoſe he was ingaged in for His Majeſties ſervice during the Wars, and thoſe which for his neceſſary ſupport, by reaſon of his being diveſted of all his Eſtate he has been involved in ſince, muſt by any ſober man be rather imputed to his misfortune, then any injuſtice in himſelf: Eſpecially, ſince the ſole aim of all his indeavours ever was the ſervice and advantage of the Publick, according to the Commands and Directions of his Dead Maſter the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> without any the leaſt reflection on his own particular Intereſt.</p>
