            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST REVEREND Father in God, and singular Patron of all good learning, the Lord Archbishop of Canturbury his Grace, Primate of all England, and Metropolitane, and one of the Lords of his Maiesties most Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Priuie Counsell.</head>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT honourable, and my gracious</hi> good Lord, I make bold to present to the view of your wisdome, foure Sermons prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by me, though not very lately, yet not very long since, vpon speciall occasions, as their titles shewe. Beeing hitherto vnwilling that they should see the light; though thereunto I haue bene greatly importuned, both by the instance of diuers my iudicious friendes, and (for some of them) pressed, by the reuerend authority of your Graces owne name, which (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) I haue hitherto detrected; as knowing how little need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is, to pester the world with any more bookes, which groneth already vnder the burden of them: Yet am I now beaten from my former resolution, by the incessant importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of certaine seduced, and seducing spirits, who (swelling with a windie opinion of knowledge, falslie so called) haue taken great exception at the second of these Sermons, which was preached at your Graces visitation, and as yet, make no end of traducing it to the world, as tending directly vnto the disgrace of preaching. For the detecting of whose igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and conuincing of their malice, I am now not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, to publish to the world what was spoken at that time: if your Grace doe not esteeme it, as a thing borne out of time. Not doubting, but that wich passed the fauourable censure
<pb facs="tcp:2680:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of so reuerend and so learned an assembly as then were the hearers, will now find like acceptance, with all that be iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and indifferent Readers. As for Papists, and (their confederates in this cause) our schismatickes and Sectaries, I neither expect, nor respect their approbation of it. They be now (as we hope) not in any so great number, as that any great reckoning is to be made of them: especially, in your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces peculiar Dioces, which (I am verily perswaded) is better defecated and purged, both from Papistes and Schismatiks, then any other quarter of this land; which as it is our most blessed peace and quiet, so may it be your Graces exceeding ioy and comfort.</p>
            <p>These slender labours and indeuours of mine, I presume to offer vnto your Graces patronage, not onely in respect of my strict obligation vnto your Lordship for many of your forepassed most honorable fauours: but also, because (in true account) your Grace may rightly be esteemed the very anchor of all these, &amp; my selfe but the instrument: they all of them receiuing their first motion and being (either directly, or occasionately) from your gracious fauour, as from their first mouer: which, as it giueth me full assurance of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable acceptance; so it bindeth me to performance of all dutifull obseruance; and to pray for the continuance of your Graces most prosperous and happie estate, that as God hath made you hitherto a notable instrument, to settle and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish both his truth and Church amongst vs, so wee may long inioy you, to the comfort of all them that wish well vnto them both.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Iewish Rabbines prescribed vs</hi> this excellent rule for the right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of euery text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>Qui non aduertit, &amp; quid suprà, &amp; quid infrà scriptum, is planè peruertit viuentis Dei verbum</hi>: He that weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what is written, both aboue and below, shal neuer well expound that is written betweene them. Now, if we proceede by this rule in expounding of this Scripture, wee shall finde that King <hi>Salomon</hi> in this booke of the Preacher, had a two-fold end, the one of them subordinate vnto the other. For first, if we looke vpward to the beginning of this booke, we shall there finde this sentence which I now haue read vnto you, <hi>Vanitie of vanities, all is vanity</hi>: wherein his end and scope must needs bee, to bring vs out of loue and conceit with earthly things, as being vile and vnprofitable, nay, hurtfull and damageable; which there he implieth by this title of Vanity. Secondly, if we looke downeward to the end of this booke, we shall there finde this sentence, <hi>Let vs heare the summe of al, Feare God and keepe his commaundements, for this is the whole duety of man:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 12.13</note> wherein his end must needs againe be, to bring vs into loue with diuine and heauenly things,<note place="margin">Col. 3.1.</note> and (as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> aduiseth) to make vs seeke those things that are aboue, as comprehending in them the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2680:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
onely true felicity; So that King <hi>Salomon</hi> in this booke hath (as I said) a double end: The first is to reuoke vs from the loue of the world: The second to prouoke vs vnto the loue of God, which will certainely ensue and follow in vs, if the former obstacle be remoued from vs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Iohn 4 16.</note>For our God and Creator, who is perfect loue himselfe, hath made vs his creatures of such a louing nature,<note place="margin">Plut. in vita Solon.</note> that (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> well obserueth) we needes must be alwayes louing of some thing: so that if our loue bee diuerted from the world, it needes must be conuerted vnto God; or else it should lie idle, which loue cannot doe; that is against the very nature of it.</p>
            <p>Now King <hi>Salomon</hi> to diuert our loue from the world, and the things of the world, he vseth none other argument thorowout this whole booke, but onely this one, to tel vs they be Vanity: neither could he indeed haue vsed any reason more forcible to bring them into extreame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with vs, then by calling them Vanitie: for no word in the world doth more fully expresse the vile, and the thriftlesse and vnprofitable nature of these earthly things, then Vanity doth.</p>
            <p>And therefore seeing that King <hi>Salomon</hi> so constantly vseth the name of Vanity thorowout his whole booke, whensoeuer he speaketh of any worldly glory; calling them stil Vanity, and Vanity of Vanities, and nothing but Vanity; it shall not be amisse to enter a serious and diligent inquisition, what should be heere intended by this name of Vanity. For we must not thinke that the holy Ghost doth iterate so often and beate vpon one word, either rashly, or idlely, or casually, or vnaduisedly, but for this speciall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; that we seeing this one word to be so often inculked, and so constantly vsed in euery place, might take the greater heed vnto it, and search with greater diligence into the hidden and inward meaning of it.</p>
            <p>Neither shall it be a vaine or a needles labour thus to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2680:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hunt out this Vanity, but both profitable and necessary vnto our present purpose. Profitable, because if we know not what vanity meaneth, we shall neuer reape any profit by this admonition of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> in telling vs so often that <hi>All is vanity</hi>: for in the perfect knowledge of this one word, Vanity, consists the perfect knowledge, not only of this particular text, of which I now preach, but also of all this whole booke of the Preacher: which is nothing els in effect, but as it were a comment vpon this word, Vanity, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> obserueth. And necessary it will be, because the true knowledge of this word,<note place="margin">Aug. lib 20. De ciuit. Dei, cap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.</note> Vanity, is a matter of greater difficulty, and more laborious inquisition, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man would at the first imagine, as euidently appeareth out of <hi>A. Gellius</hi>: who maketh report of a notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betweene two great and professed <hi>Grammarians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A. Gel. lib. 18. cap. 4.</note> about this word Vanity, what it properly should signifie. Their controuersie being grounded vpon a place of <hi>Salust,</hi> where he censureth <hi>Cn. Lentulus</hi> to be such a one, as it was vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whether he were, <hi>Vanior,</hi> or <hi>Stolidior</hi>; a more vaine or a more foolish kinde of man: the one of them maintayning, that both these two words did note but one vice, and that Vanity is nothing els but Folly: The other, that either of them deciphered a seuerall kinde of vice, and that Folly is one thing, and Vanity another; as hee there most plainely proueth.</p>
            <p>But howsoever these two <hi>Grammarians</hi> dissent, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the particular vice designed in this word, yet they both consent in this, that it is a name of vice: and that it implieth, that all those things vnto which it is rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, are of a reproueable and vitious nature. So thas (as I said before) this Preacher could not possibly haue vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny word which more fully layeth out and exposeth to our eyes the base and contemptible, the bad and vnprofitable nature of all earthly glories, then Vanity doth.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of them, he vseth a very homely and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2680:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dishonourable name to expresse their comtemptible nature by: he calleth them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, dung, or drosse, both of them,<note place="margin">Phil. 3 8.</note> vile and base: but yet neither of them so vile as Vanity is. For both dung and drosse may haue profitable vses, but that which is vaine, that hath no vse at all, it is vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable; it is like vnto salt, when it hath lost his saltnes, which is good for iust nothing, as our Sauiour Christ tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs.<note place="margin">Matt. 5.13.</note> So that this Vanity is of a more vile and abiect nature then the vilest excrements of the most abiect crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for there is none of all them, that is clearely without all vse, as Vanity is, in what significations soeuer you take it; as (if you will but looke into the diuers significations of this word Vanity, deliuered vnto vs by Heathen writers, and confirmed out of the holy scriptures) you may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see.</p>
            <p>For I find this word Vanity, to haue sixe significations, &amp; yet not one good one amongst them all, not one that impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the least fruite or profit to be implied in it. To begin with that first, which I named last.</p>
            <p>The first signification of this word Vanity, is al one with <hi>Inutile,</hi> that is to say, a thing without al vse, or profit, for so it foloweth immediatly after this text:<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>Quid emolumenti? What profit hath a man of all his labours wherin he hath trauailed vnder the sun?</hi> He proueth al our labours about these earthly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be therfore Vanity, because there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth no profit of them: for this is one essential note of Vanity, to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and vnprofitable: And therefore as God heere reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth against the world, that it is vanity because it is vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; so worldlings els where do reason against God, that his seruice is likewise Vanity, because it is vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: <hi>Ye haue said, it is in vaine that we haue serued God, and what profit is it that we haue kept his commaundements?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 3.14.</note> They conclude it to be vaine, because it is vnprofitable. And the consequent is good if the antecedent were true. So that King <hi>Salomons</hi> first meaning in calling these earthly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2680:5"/>
matters Vanity, is to insinuate thus much; that they be altogether fruitlesse and barraine of all good, and that there is no profit at all to be found in them. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth vnto the Romanes owne iudgement, what profit these earthly things haue brought them; <hi>What profit</hi> (saith he) <hi>had ye then in those things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.21.</note> 
               <hi>whereof ye are now ashamed?</hi> And <hi>Salomon</hi> bringeth worldlings complaning, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of their vnprofitable labour about earthly things: <hi>What hath pride now profited vs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wisd. 5.8.</note> 
               <hi>or what hath the pompe of riches brought vs?</hi> So that when it pleaseth God to open a mans eyes, to see the true vanity of all earthly glories, in their owne proper colours, as he did the Romanes eyes, by the preaching of Saint Paul, then doe they see most cleerely, that there is no profit in them, but rather that they be such vaine and foolish things, as that they ought to be euen ashamed of them, as the Apostle Paul implieth in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alleged place. And surely, the true reason, why men are not ashamed, so foolishlie to bestow their vnprofitable paines about these transitorie earthly things, is, because God as yet hath not opened their eies, to see the fruitlesse vanity of them, &amp; how grossely they be deceiued in them, their sight being blinded by the god of this world,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.4.</note> as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> obserueth.</p>
            <p>To giue you an instance or two to this purpose: The theefe when he goeth about to steale, he hunteth after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and thinketh it better to reach out a little, then to liue in want, because the god of this world hath blinded his eyes: but when his punishment commeth, then he seeth his owne error, and then he is ashamed of it, and then he findeth by experience, that his stealing hath brought no profit to him, but incomparable losse. The licentious worldling like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, when he hunteth after pleasure, he seeketh after that which seemeth good vnto him, because the god of this world hath blinded his eyes: but when his punishment commeth, then he changeth his minde, and then he seeth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2680:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his folly,<note place="margin">Wis. 5.7.8.</note> and then he is ashamed of it. <hi>That he hath so wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himselfe, in the waies of wickednesse, and yet hath got no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it,</hi> as is notably declared, in the booke of <hi>Wisdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And euen so is it likewise in all other sinnes: though the sinner do alwaies propound vnto himselfe, (at the least in his conceit) a kind of profit in them, whereunto they seeme to answere, with appearing shewes of goodnes, yet he still findes in the end, when he hath made his triall of them, that they be indeede no better, but (as the Apostle truely calleth them) <hi>Vnprofitable workes of darkenes</hi>:<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.11.</note> and therefore such as (of right) wee ought to be euen ashamed of.</p>
            <p>But here we must take heed, that we measure not our profit by wordly gaine and commoditie: For, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is losse, as our Sauiour Christ teacheth vs in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; though a man should gaine the whole world, yet if he lose his owne soule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that gaine is but Vanity, because there is no profit in it. For so it foloweth in that very place: <hi>What shall it profit thee to wine the whole worlde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16.26.</note> 
               <hi>if thou lose thine owne soule?</hi> Therefore, we must measure our profit, not by gaine, but by godlines: for, that is the greatest gaine: and that (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs) is profitable to all things,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6 6.4.8.</note> hauing promise both of this life, and of the life to come. That which a man gaineth with godlines, that is great gaine, and great profit, though it be but a little: but that which he gaineth without godlines, that is Vanity and disprofit, though it were the whole world: because he payeth his soule for it, which is more precious then the worlde, as it followeth in the forecited place. And therefore this our Preacher, who (in the beginning of this booke) telleth vs, that all is Vanity: yet (in the end of it) he excepteth godlines, that it is not Vanity: <hi>Let vs heare the sum of all</hi> (saith he) <hi>feare God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 12.13</note> 
               <hi>and keepe his commandements, for this is the compleat duty of man.</hi> This godlinesse is not vanity, because it is full of profit: it hath a great reward (as our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2680:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sauiour Christ teacheth vs in the Gospell) <hi>Great is your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heauen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 5:12:</note> The reward of godlinesse, though it be but small in earth, yet is it great in heauen; yea as great as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, for it is heauen it selfe: but the reward of earthly profit when we seeke it without godlinesse, is the losse of heauen: and therfore al such gaine is meerely Vanity, Vanity in this first sense, that is, meerely vnprofitable and damagea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vanity.</p>
            <p>The second signification of this word Vanity, is all one with <hi>Vacuity; Vanum, tanquam vacuum:</hi> that is, <hi>a thing that hath a shew, but yet taketh the true substance of that it representeth</hi>: and so indeede is nothing els but onely an empty sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</p>
            <p>In which sense I finde this word applied three seuerall wayes: First, <hi>Vanum,</hi> I finde opposed to <hi>Plenum</hi>: and so it signifieth a thing voyde and emptie. Secondly, I finde it opposed to <hi>Graue</hi>: and so it signifieth a thing light and windie. Thirdly, I find it opposed to <hi>Verum</hi>: and so it signifieth a thing false and crafty.</p>
            <p>For the first of these three senses, to wit, <hi>Vanum inane,</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Cic. orat. pro. Cn. Plancio.</note> empty Vanity: In this sense doth <hi>Tully</hi> vse that word in his oration <hi>pro Plancio,</hi> where he calleth those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises that be not kept, <hi>Vana &amp; inania,</hi> vaine and empty promises: as (contrariwise) the keeping of promises both in our English and in the Latine tongue, is commonly called a fulfilling of them; <hi>Implere promissa.</hi> Promises if they bee not fulfilled in their keeping, they be but vaine and empty in their making. In this sense doth <hi>Virgil</hi> likewise vse that word in the first of his <hi>Georgiks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Virg. lib. 1. Geor.</note> he calleth the empty eares of corne which haue nothing but a huske, <hi>Vanas aristas,</hi> vaine eares: <hi>Expectata seges, vanis elusit aristis.</hi> He calleth such eares vaine, because they be empty. And in this same sense doth likewise the Scriptures themselues vse that word. <hi>Iob</hi> calleth the dayes of this mortal life,<note place="margin">Iob 7.3.</note> 
               <hi>Menses vacuos</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths of Vanity, that is, voyd and empty moneths, empty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2680:7"/>
of all stayed and solid comfort, few and euill, as <hi>Iacob</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth of his life.<note place="margin">Gen. 47.9.</note> So likewise the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in the second <hi>Psalme,</hi> hee vseth the same word, in the very same sense:<note place="margin">Psal. 2.1.</note> 
               <hi>Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vaine thing?</hi> He speaketh in that place of the attempts of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then against Christ and his kingdome. Which place of the <hi>Psalme,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> translating, he putteth for <hi>Vana, Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia: Inania meditati sunt, They imagined vaine things,</hi> saith <hi>Dauid</hi>; that is, voyde and empty things, saith <hi>Hierom,</hi> things voyd of reason and voyde of successe. For though they might seem to haue gotten a ful conquest ouer our Sauiour Christ, when they once had killed him,<note place="margin">Plut. in vita Bruti.</note> because (as <hi>Theodotus Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> once said of <hi>Pompey</hi>) <hi>Mortui non mordent,</hi> A dead dogge biteth not: yet euen then did their fulnes proue to be meere emptines, and euen then did Christ begin his conquest ouer them. He, whom (whilest he liued) they counted litle bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a dead dogge,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16.9. Eccles. 9.4. Apoc. 5.5.</note> as it is in the prouerbe, after he was dead did proue a liuing Lion, a victorious Lion of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and conquered the whole world, according to that prophecie which he had giuen of himselfe, that <hi>If he once were lifted vp,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 12.32.</note> 
               <hi>he then would draw all men vnto him.</hi> So that all their attempts against our Sauiour Christ, did proue, right indeede as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth them, but vaine and emptie imaginations: as likewise doe the attempts of like wicked persecutors against his members the Christians,<note place="margin">Psal. 2.1.</note> they commonly proue vaine and empty.</p>
            <p>For when they seek to conquer them by cruelty &amp; perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, they themselues are thereby conquered; and the Christians by their torments become more then conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.37.</note> 
               <hi>Though for thy sake we be killed all the day long, yet are we in all those things made more then conquerours.</hi> Thus (as <hi>Iustine Martyr</hi> hath very well obserued) <hi>Tormenta paganismi,</hi>

And therefore the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> speaking of the Vanity of those vngodly men,<note place="margin">Isay 29.8.</note> which seeke to deuoure and swallow vp the Church; he compareth their attempts (and that very fitly) vnto a hungry mans dreame, who imagineth that he is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himselfe at a banquet, but yet when he awaketh, his soule within him is empty and faint; and so are their hopes too, which desire to feast themselues of the spoyles of the Church, they doe vanish as a dreame, and their soules bee found empty; as (God be praised) we haue had great and gratious experience, and that very lately. And euen so is it likewise in all other earthly things, all the comfort which they yeelde vs, is but a false ioy, as it were in a dreame; but hee that is the fullest of them heere in this world, when hee awaketh and riseth vp vnto the resurrection, shall finde himselfe emptied of them all:<note place="margin">Luke 1.53.</note> 
               <hi>When the hungry shalbe filled with good things, but the rich shall be sent empty away,</hi> as it is in the Gospel:<note place="margin">Phil. 2.7.</note> For as Christ when he came to vs in mercy, did empty himselfe quite of all his heauenly glory: so we, when we go vnto Christ in iudgement, shall likewise be emptied of all our earthly glory; we shall appeare before him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, being stript of all those gay and goodly trappings, which now so much glorifie, and vanifie foolish world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as euen <hi>Plato</hi> himselfe noteth.<note place="margin">Plato, in Gorgia.</note> And then (as I noted before out of the booke of Wisdome) wee shall truely see the Vanity of all these earthly glories, when wee see how bare, and how naked, and how empty they haue left vs. This briefly for Vanity, as it is <hi>Inanity,</hi> that is, voyde and empty of all those good things, whereof it seemeth to

haue store and plenty.</p>
            <p>The second branch of Vanity, in this second signification, is <hi>Vanum,</hi> opposed vnto <hi>Graue,</hi> or <hi>Ponderosum</hi>: and so Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty signifieth a thing light and windy: so that <hi>Vanitas</hi> and <hi>Leuitas</hi> be in this sense <hi>Synonyma.</hi> In this sense doth <hi>Salust</hi> vse the name of Vanity, as <hi>Nonnius</hi> citeth him: <hi>Mauriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num genus.</hi> He calleth the <hi>Morians</hi> a vaine nation: that is, Light and vnconstant; <hi>Ingenio mobili</hi>; as he noteth them in an other place.<note place="margin">Salust. b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, as the excellent Art of Musicke is growne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contempt through the basenes and lightnes of certaine vagrant musitians, which prostistute their comming at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery drunken feast: so likewise that renouned Art of <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> grew into great comtempt, through the vilenes of certaine roguing mountbanks, &amp; cosoning fortunetellers, which out of mens forheads, and faces, and hands, would take vpon them to diuine, and to reade hidden destinies: and thereupon it was, that <hi>Tully</hi> so complained, that the dignity of so noble an Art, had suffered such a preiudice, through the leuity and Vanity, of certaine hir professors. Vsing Leuity &amp; Vanity, <hi>Promiscuè,</hi> for one thing. And in the same sense, doe likewise the Scriptures vse the name of Vanity, for lightnes, and that which hath no waight or worth in it. The Prophet <hi>Moses</hi> calleth Idoles Vanity: and the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> calleth them Wind:<note place="margin">Deut. 32.21. Isay, 41.29.</note> both words noting out their lightnes vnto vs; they are as light as wind, which is the lightest of all things; yea as light as nothing, as it followeth in that place:<note place="margin">1.

The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> likewise discoursing of the vaine condition of man, he vseth the same word,<note place="margin">Psal. 62.9.</note> in the very same sense: for he saith, that <hi>Man is deceitfull vpon the waights: Yea, and altogether lighter then Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

            <p>The third branch of Vanity in this second signification, is <hi>Vanum,</hi> opposed vnto <hi>Verum,</hi> and so Vanity signifieth a thing false &amp; crafty: so that <hi>Vanitas,</hi> and <hi>Falsitas,</hi> be (in this sense) <hi>Synonyma.</hi> In this sense doth <hi>Plautus</hi> vse the name of Vanity,<note place="margin">Most. act. 4.

            </p>
            <p>And in this sense I find the name of Vanity applied most commonly vnto three seuerall things: First (in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall matters) I find Idolatry to be called by the name of Vanity, because it is but a false religion; it is <hi>Falsum,</hi> and therefore <hi>Vanum,</hi> as you heard before out of <hi>Terence. It hath a shew of godlines</hi> (as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh) <hi>but yet it lacketh the power of it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.5.</note> In this sense doth <hi>Moses</hi> vse the name of Vanity, in the booke of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> where complaning of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the person of God, he saith, that,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.21. Ier. 8.19.</note> 
               <hi>They moued him to iealousie with that which is not God, they prouoked him to anger, with their Vanities.</hi> As Idols are false gods, so idolatrie is false worship: and both these called Vanity, because they be false.

In this sense doth <hi>Tully</hi> vse the name of Vanity, in the first of his <hi>Offices,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cic. lib. 1. Offices.</note> where speaking of the falsehood of tradesmen in

Thirdly (in friendship) I find Flattery to be called by the name of Vanity, because it is but a false and a counterfeit loue. It likewise is <hi>Falsum,</hi> and therefore <hi>Vanum.</hi> In this sense, doth <hi>Tully</hi> vse the name of Vanity, in his booke <hi>De Amicitia:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cic. lib. de Amicit.</note> 
               <hi>Assentatio ea est molestissima</hi> (saith he) <hi>cùm ad vanitatem accedit authoritas</hi>: He saith, that Flattery is then a most dangerous quality, when as men of authority doe abiect themselues, to so vile a Vanity. In this sense doth <hi>Accius</hi> vse the name of Vanity also: putting <hi>Vanans</hi> for <hi>Fallens,</hi> as <hi>Nonnius</hi> obserueth; and he citeth this place out of his <hi>Alcmena,</hi> which notably expresseth the whole nature of Vanity, in this present sense, as it is taken for <hi>Falsity. Tanta frustrando lactans, et vanans protrahit.</hi> So that <hi>Vanum</hi> is that which doth <hi>Protrahere,</hi> and <hi>Frustrando lacta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>: A vaine thing is that which leadeth on our desire, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2680:9"/>
as it were suckleth it with a false and flattering hope, and yet vtterly frustrates and deceiueth it in the end.</p>
            <p>So that (to gather all the branches of this second signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Vanity into one bundle, and to apply them vnto our present purpose) King <hi>Salomon</hi> in calling these earthly matters Vanity, (if Vanity be taken in this second signification) insinuateth thus much; that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all the greatest glories of this present worlde, but meere deceit and falsehood: they being empty of all those things whereof they seeme to be ful, light in all those things wherein they seeme to be waighty, and treacherous in all those things, wherein they seeme to be friendly; so that they doe nothing but delude and abuse our weaker senses, with false and flattering shewes, of a certaine pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted goodnes, that which indeed is not in them; and therfore those men which set their harts vpon them, and place their whole felicity in them, are as vaine and as foolish, as if they should make their felicitie of an empty bladder, which is <hi>Vanum Vacuum</hi>; or of a light feather, which is <hi>Vanum vento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi>; or of a lying picture, which is <hi>Vanum falsum</hi>; all which were great points of ridiculous folly.</p>
            <p>The third signification of this word Vanity is all one with <hi>Frustra Vanum, quasi frustraneum,</hi> which signifieth a thing that attaineth not his end.<note place="margin">Donat. in Eunuchum.</note> Hence some of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and learnedst <hi>Grammarians</hi> define <hi>Vanum</hi> to be, <hi>Quod fieri non potest</hi>: they call that a vaine thing, which cannot be compassed; as if a man should indeuour with <hi>Danaus</hi> his daughters, to fill a sieue with water: or with the foolish <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> to reach vp vnto the heauens with their finger; it were a vaine attempt, because he cannot attaine his end. In this sense doth <hi>Virgil</hi> vse the name of Vanity, in the first of his Aeneids:<note place="margin">Virg. lib. 1. Aeneid.</note> 
               <hi>Nifrustra auguriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vani docuere parentes.</hi> Where he expoundeth <hi>Vanum</hi> (as you see) by <hi>Frustra.</hi> In this sense doth <hi>Accius</hi> likewise take the name of Vanity in the place that I cited before vnto you. <hi>Tanta frustrando lactans, &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans,

The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> likewise in one of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> vseth the name of Vanity three times together in this third signification: <hi>Except the Lord build the house,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 127.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>the builder buildeth but in Vaine. Except the Lord keepe the city, the watchman watcheth but in Vaine.</hi> Except the Lord giue his blessing, the plowmans toyling is in Vain; that is, without the grace &amp; blessing of God, neither the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his building, nor the Watchman in his watching, nor the Plowman in his toyling, can possibly attaine vnto his end: and therefore he calleth their indeauours Vaine. So againe in another place:<note place="margin">Psal 33.17.</note> 
               <hi>A horse is but a Vaine helpe to saue a man.</hi> And why is he but Vaine? the reason followeth in the very same place, <hi>because he cannot deliuer any man by al his great strength.</hi> That is, he cannot attaine his end in sauing of a man, and therefore he is said to be but a Vaine helpe. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in another place:<note place="margin">Psal. 60.11.</note> 
               <hi>Helpe Lord, for Vaine is the helpe of man.</hi> That is, mans helpe attaineth not his end, but is like vnto the rotten reede of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which pearceth the hand that leaneth vpon it,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 18.21.</note> if (<hi>helpe Lord</hi>) be not ioyned with it. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Saint <hi>Paul, If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching in Vaine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.14.</note> 
               <hi>and your faith, that is likewise in Vaine.</hi> That is, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine their end.</p>
            <p>So that if Vanity be taken in this third signification, then the end of King <hi>Salomon</hi> in calling all things Vanity, is to insinuate thus much; that no earthly thing can attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his end; but that when a man hath euen tired himselfe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2680:10"/>
and wasted out his strength in hunting and pursuing after them, yet shall he neuer finde that end, nor that glorious good which he seeketh for in them, but shall (in the end) be driuen to complaine, that he hath wasted &amp; wearied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in Vaine; as he himselfe professeth in the booke of Wisedome.<note place="margin">Wisd. 5.6, 7.</note> Take himselfe for an example, how greatly he abounded with all the greatest glories that the earth could yeeld, Wisdome, Honour, Riches, Pleasure, &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer worldly good the hart could desire: all which when hee had so fully attained, that hee was euen glutted with them, yet could he no where find that end which he sought for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd therefore first he was driuen to shift and change his desire from one thing vnto another, being still wearied, but not satisfied nor contented with the fruition of them. And after, he finding them euery one to be alike deceitfull, hee generally pronounceth of them al, without exception, that they haue nothing in them but Vanity and Vexation; as is largely declared in the second chapter of this booke.</p>
            <p>The fourth signification of this word Vanity, is all one with <hi>Fragile</hi> or <hi>Mutabile</hi>; that is, <hi>A thing fraile and weake, and of no firmnesse nor continuance,</hi> and so <hi>Vanum</hi> is opposed to <hi>Firmum</hi> or <hi>Constans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this sense doth <hi>Tully</hi> vse the name of Vanity in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke <hi>De natura Deorum,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Virgil. lib. 4.

And in the same sense doe we vse the word Vanish
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2680:11"/>
in our English tongue likewise when a thing is quickly dissipated, and passeth out of sight, then is it sayd to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish away;<note place="margin">Iob 27.12.</note> that is, to be turned into this fading Vanity. In this sense doth <hi>Iob</hi> vse this word in his booke, where he sayth of his fickle and deceitfull friends, that <hi>They Vanish into Vanity</hi>; noting thereby, their inconstancie, and referring the word Vanish vnto his true originall, from whence it is descended: to wit, onely from this Vanity. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> likewise vseth the very same word, in the very same sense: for he saith, that <hi>Man is like to Vanity, because his daies Vanish like a shadow.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 144.4.</note> And all the old Translations (as Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> obserueth) except onely <hi>The Septuagint</hi> (to illustrate this Vanity by a liuely example, and to set the true nature of it, as it were before our eyes) in stead of, <hi>All is Vanity,</hi> they translate,<note place="margin">Hier. in Eccle.</note> 
               <hi>All is smoke,</hi> because nothing vanisheth so quickly as smoke: it riseth vp very stately, as it were a tower, and it mounteth vp aloft, as if it would reach vnto the very heauens, and yet euery little blast of wind disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and driueth it away. This is the vnstable and fraile nature of Vanity, it is as weake as smoke: and therefore the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> compareth the life of man,<note place="margin">Iam. 4 14.</note> for the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and the weakenes of it, vnto a Vapour or Smoke, which sodainely appeareth, but presently vanisheth. And the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> (as you heard before) compareth it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Shadow,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 144.4.</note> which is lesse then Smoke: so that nature it selfe can hardly fit any paterne, or find any comparison, to expresse vnto the life, the fraile and fleeting nature of this vnstable Vanity.</p>
            <p>Now Vanity (in this fourth sense) hath two branches, or degrees, the one of them a steppe vnto the other: the first of them is <hi>Vanitas mutationis</hi>: The Vanity of alteration: The second, is <hi>Vanitas corruptionis,</hi> The Vanity of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or dissolution. Of the first of those Vanities, to wit, the Vanity of alteration,<note place="margin">Iob. 6.16, 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh in his booke, where he compareth the friendship of this present world, vnto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2680:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ice and snow, which with the least heat of the sunne, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth away: that is, altereth and changeth into an other nature. Of the second degree or branch of this Vanity, to wit,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.20, 21.</note> the Vanity of corruption, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh in the Epistle to the Romans, where he pronounceth of all Gods visible creatures, that <hi>They be subiect vnto Vanity,</hi> that is, the Vanity of corruption, as he himselfe expoundeth it, in plaine and expresse words,<note place="margin">Primas. in cap. 8. Rom.</note> for <hi>Quicquid finem habet, Vanum est:</hi> as <hi>Primasius</hi> glosseth vpon that place.</p>
            <p>So that if Vanity be taken in this fourth signification, (as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> thinkes it is, who saith, vpon these wordes, that <hi>Caducum quidda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hoc verbo Vanitatis oftenditur,</hi> that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity implieth a weaknes and fragilitie) then King <hi>Salomons</hi> meaning is, that all these earthly things are so fraile and so momentary, that they be as wauering as the wind: hauing no constancie, no firmnesse, no stabilitie in them, but are changed in a trice, as easily as smoke. And it is most true indeed, as we may euidently see in euery one of them, if particularly we doe looke into them. For what other thing is honour, but onely a light blast of the peoples breath, which vanisheth in a moment,<note place="margin">Pro. 31.30. Isa. 28.4.</note> as the sound of a tinckling Cymball in the ayre? What other thing is beauty, but the weake paint of a false colour,<note place="margin">Pro. 23.5.</note> which with one shake of an ague is blasted, and so fadeth? What other thing are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but a heape of shining dust,<note place="margin">Isai. 40.6.</note> which with euery blast of winde is puft away and perisheth? Finally, what thing is all <hi>liuing flesh but only grasse</hi>? (as the Prophet <hi>Isai</hi> teacheth,) <hi>and what all the glory of it, but the flower of the field? the grasse withereth, and the flower fadeth, if the breath of the Lord doe but blow vpon it,</hi> as it followeth in that place. So that no globe of smoke is more quickly dissipated, no blast of winde more quickely changed, then the weake vnstable nature of all earthly matters is.</p>
            <p>Yea, and though they had some stability in themselues, yet haue we no whit of stability in our selues, but euery day
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2680:12"/>
and houre are subiect vnto Vanity, not onely to the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mutation, but also to the Vanity of corruption. So that though they could not be taken away from vs, yet may we in a moment be taken away from them, as <hi>Belshazzar</hi> was from the middest of his pleasure, euen whilest he was floting in his greatest iollity:<note place="margin">Dan. 5.4, 5.</note> and <hi>Herod</hi> likewise in the middest of his honour, euen whilest he was extolled with his greatest glorie:<note place="margin">Act. 12.22, 23</note> and the rich man likewise from the middest of his treasure,<note place="margin">Luke 12.20.</note> euen whilest he was saying, <hi>Anima quiesce.</hi> So that both in respect of their frailty and of ours, neither hath the rich man any cause to reioyce in his riches,<note place="margin">Ier. 9.23, 24.</note> nor the strong man in his strength, nor the wise man in his wisdome, nor any man in any thing, but onely in the Lord. For <hi>Mundus transit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Iohn 2.17.</note> The world vanisheth away as it were a little smoke, with al the concupiscences of it: but God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, I am, he is euer the same, and in him is no change, as the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> noteth:<note place="margin">Mal. 3.6. Iam. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</note> no, not so much as a shadow of change, as the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> addeth.</p>
            <p>The consideration of this transitory Vanity of these earthly things, ought to worke in our hearts those same two good effects, which I mentioned in the beginning of this speech: f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irst to loosen our affections from the world: And secondly, to knit them vnto God. The first of these two vses Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> maketh of it in his comment vpon this place:<note place="margin">Hier. in Eccle.</note>

                  </gap> omnia haec transire, solumque Deum idem semper esse, cogor, non semel, sed bis exclamare, Vanitas Vanitatum! When I consider</hi> (saith he) <hi>the heauens and the elements, and the wonderfull vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of creatures in them both; I stand almost astonished at the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull maiesty and greatnes of the worke: but when I consider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that all these things are but transitory, and that onely God himselfe hath stable perpetuity, then am I forced againe,</hi> (in as great a contempt of them) <hi>to cry out, not once but twice, O Vanity of vanities.</hi> He calleth them Vanity, because they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2680:12"/>
be transitory, and therefore of our loue thinketh them vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnworthy. The second of those vses doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Peter</hi> make in his second Epistle: <hi>Seeing then</hi> (saith he) that <hi>all these things shall be dissolued,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>what manner of persons ought we to be in godlines and holy conuersation of life, looking for, and hastning the day of Gods comming</hi>? The consideration of the frailty and Vanity of all earthly things ought to make our affections to mount vp into heauen, and to setle themselues there vpon stable and eternall things: to wit, on God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in whom is no change, as you heard before. This is the right vse which we ought to make of considering the frailty of our earthly state.</p>
            <p>The fifth signification of this word Vanity is all one with Iniquity; so that <hi>Vanum</hi> and <hi>Iniquum</hi> be (in this sense) <hi>Synonyma:</hi> a Vaine thing is nothing but a lewd and a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thing. In this sense doth <hi>Pacuui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> vse the name of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as <hi>Nonnius</hi> obserueth: <hi>Ne tu turpassis Vanitudine aetatem tuam. Turpassis Vanitudine</hi>: See that thou defile not thy youth with Vanity: that is, with Wickednesse, as with lust and filthinesse, and such like vices; which (our Sauiour Christ telleth vs) doe <hi>defile the man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.19, 20.</note> In this sense doe also the Scriptures vse the name of Vanity, as well as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> desireth the Lord to <hi>turne away his eyes that they behold not Vanity</hi>;<note place="margin">Psal. 119.37.</note> that is, Wickednesse. And King <hi>Abiam</hi> calleth <hi>Ieroboams</hi> followers Vaine and wicked men.<note place="margin">2. Chro. 13.7.</note> Vaine and wicked, expounding by the latter word what he meant by the former. And the holy Ghost cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the sinnes of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Kin. 17.15.</note> 
               <hi>the Vanity of the Gentiles.</hi> And againe, <hi>God knoweth the thoughts of men, that they be but Vaine</hi>: that is,<note place="margin">Psal. 94.11.</note> Wicked. For so it is expresly affirmed in the booke of <hi>Genesis: All the imaginations of the thoughts of mans heart are onely euill continually.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So that if Vanity bee taken in this fifth signification, King <hi>Salomons</hi> meaning is, that all earthly things bee not onely Vaine in all the forenamed kindes of Vanity, but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2680:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
also in this too (which is worse then all the rest) that they be occasions and inducements vnto wicked Vanity. <hi>They draw on iniquity with the cart-ropes of their Vanity,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isai</hi> teacheth vs.<note place="margin">Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>They be the roote of all euil,</hi> as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs. And the like may be said both of honour, of knowledge, of pleasure, &amp; of all other worldly goods whatsoeuer. There is as it were a secret hooke conueyed closely into euery one of them; <hi>Quo homines Capiantur, tanquam hamo pisces,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> obserueth out of <hi>Plato</hi>:<note place="margin">Cic. lib. de Senec.</note> whereby those men which chop greedily at the bait, are by &amp; by taken with the hook, and so drawne on by the cordes of their Vanity, first vnto sinne, and then vnto misery: and therefore Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in one of his Sermons, hauing entred the consideration of the dangerous and insidious nature of these earthly goods, he crieth out twenty times in detestation of them,<note place="margin">Aug. Serm. 31. ad fratres in eremo.</note> 
               <hi>O munde immunde, fallax &amp; proditor, qui homines illaqueare non desinis, quiescere non permittis</hi>: O the Vanity and villany of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent euill world, which with one and the same breath, both flattereth &amp; betraieth vs, neither suffering vs to sit stil, with out hir allurements, nor yet to escape the snares of hir pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments. So that (to gather all these significations of Vanity together) you now may see how vile the nature of it is. It is <hi>Inutile</hi>; it is <hi>Fucatum</hi>; it is <hi>Inane</hi>; it is <hi>Falsum</hi>; it is <hi>Leue</hi>; it is <hi>Simulatum</hi>; it is <hi>Mendax</hi>; it is <hi>Frustraneum</hi>; it is <hi>Inconstans</hi>; it is <hi>Caducum</hi>; it is <hi>Iniquum</hi>; and it is <hi>Stultum.</hi> These be the materiall partes of Vanity. Wherein you may plainly see, what King <hi>Salomons</hi> true censure is of all these worldly things, which seeine so specious vnto men: first, that they be altogether without all fruite and profit; which is the proper adiunct, or rather indeed the essentiall forme of Vanity. Secondly, that whereas they haue a shew of profit, yet is that nothing but euen a shew indeede; yea and that an emptie shew, a flatering shew, a lying shew.

Thirdly, that if they could haue any profit in them, yet were it but a light profit, not worth the accounting of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it neuer attaineth that end which it maketh shew of. Fourthly, that though all those things should attaine their end, yet could they not possibly retaine their end, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so fraile and so brittle, that they be more easily broken then a bubble. Fiftly, that they doe not onely disappoint and defeat vs of their hoped end; but also they mislead vs to a wrong and a worse end: namely, to sinne and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the end of which is death and vtter misery. And thus all the greatest glories and good things of this world, be not onely <hi>fallacia, quia dubia</hi>: but also <hi>insidiosa, quia dulcia,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius</hi> truely noteth:<note place="margin">Lactant. lib. de opific. dei. cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>They be not onely deceitfull, because doubtfull, but also dangerfull, because delightfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all these worldly things being thus many wayes Vanity, it followeth by a consequent of vnauoydable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, that if man doe stil set his heart vpon them, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe should be Vanity in the sixth and last sense, that is, blind and foolish Vanity.</p>
            <p>For in that sense sometimes do I find this word Vanity to be taken.<note place="margin">Salust. lib. de bello Iugurt.</note> In this sense doth <hi>Salust</hi> vse the name of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in his <hi>Iugurthine Warre,</hi> expounding <hi>Vanitas</hi> to be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritia</hi>: that is, Vnskilfulnes and Ignorance. In this sense also did that <hi>Grammarian</hi> take it, who contended with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollinaris</hi> about it, as I noted before out of <hi>A. Gellius.</hi> Hee confidently maintained that <hi>Vanus</hi> and <hi>Stolidus</hi> were all one: that is, that a Vaine man is nothing but a foolish man. In this sense doe likewise the Scriptures themselues vse the name of Vanity.<note place="margin">Iob 11.12.</note> 
               <hi>Vaine man</hi> (saith <hi>Iob</hi>) <hi>would faine seeme to be wise</hi>: that is, Foolish men do affect an opinion of wisdome. So likewise doth <hi>Salomon</hi> vse the same word:<note place="margin">Pro. 12.11.</note> 
               <hi>He that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the Vaine, is voyd of vnderstanding.</hi> And so likewise doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vse it,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.17, 18.</note> interpreting Vanity to be nothing but <hi>the darkenesse of vnderstanding.</hi> So that man if he set his heart vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these Vaine and foolish things, which be inthralled and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2680:14"/>
subiect vnto so many Vanities, then must needes hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe be Vainer and foolisher then they: and so be <hi>altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lighter then Vanity it selfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 62.9.</note> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaketh.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I largely shewed what Vanity is, and what parts it hath: and that though it be a word of many signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, yet that there is not one good one amongst them all, as before I noted: but all of them implying, that that which is a Vaine thing, must needes be a vile thing: a false and a flattering, a fraile and a fleeting thing, and such a thing as hath no kind of good thing in it.</p>
            <p>Let vs now see in a word (for the conclusion of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) why King <hi>Salomon</hi> hauing thus brought all earthly things into extreame contempt with vs, by calling them not Vaine, but euen Vanity, <hi>in abstracto,</hi> is not yet content with that, but calleth them still further, <hi>The Vanity of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> For we must not thinke that euen this is done in Vaine. Of which point I find three differing opinions, which I will dispatch in three words.</p>
            <p>The first is S. <hi>Hieroms,</hi> that this Vanity of Vanities is spoken onely <hi>per exaggerationem,</hi> by way of amplification, to note out the greatnes and the excellencie of their Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> because they lacke the highest and superlatiue degree of comparison, they do vsually expresse it by ingemination &amp; doubling of the positiue: as <hi>Dominus Dominantium,</hi> The Lord of Lordes, for the greatest Lord: <hi>Canticum Canticorum,</hi> The song of songs for the excellentest song: <hi>Seculum seculorum,</hi> The worlde of worldes, for the world Eternall. And so <hi>Vanitas vanitatum,</hi> for the greatest and excellentest Vanity of all other. So that <hi>Vanitas Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum</hi> goeth as farre beyond common Vanity, as <hi>Canticum</hi> beyond <hi>Verbum,</hi> and <hi>Verbum</hi> beyond <hi>Silentium</hi>: or <hi>Seculum</hi> beyond <hi>Momentum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hugo. de S. Victor. in Eccles.</note> and <hi>Momentum</hi> beyond <hi>Nihilum:</hi> as a learned Father noteth. Then the meaning of King <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in calling these earthly matters the Vanity of Vanity, is nothing else, (in S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> opinion) but to note out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2680:14"/>
vs,<note place="margin">Hier. in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clen.</note> 
               <hi>Magnitudinem Vanitatis,</hi> the greatnes of their Vanity: and that they be of all other things the most excellent Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. For as the blackenes of blacke is the most excellent blacke, and the whitenesse of white is the most excellent white: so the Vanity of Vanities is the most excellent Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as it were the sublimation and quintessence of Vanity; as if all the Vanities of the world should lay their heads together, to make but one peereles and excellent Vanity, that should be this <hi>Vanitas Vanitatum</hi>; and yet euen that could not be Vainer then these earthly things be, as I haue formerly shewed. This is the first opinion.</p>
            <p>The second opinion is <hi>Hugoes de Victore,</hi> who thinketh, that this Vanity of Vanities,<note place="margin">Hugo. de S. victor. in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clen.</note> is rather spoken <hi>per inculcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem,</hi> that is by way of repetition, to note vnto vs, not the magnitude, but the multitude of those deceitfull Vanities, which euery where lie hid in these earthly things. For in all these earthly glories which we thinke so goodly of, if we throughly would search and looke into them, we assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly should find a whole nest of Vanities, (as it were of serpents) to lie lurking in them which lead vs, like brute beastes, from one Vanity to another: first drawing vs to iniquitie with the cart-ropes of their Vanity, and then vnto miserie, with the cart-ropes of their iniquity, as before I noted. So that this <hi>Vanitas Vanitatum</hi> (in <hi>Hugoes</hi> opinion) doth <hi>Omnem Vanitatem contiuere, quasi genus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mnium gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> This Vanity of Vanities is rather referred to the number and variety, then to the greatnes and quantitie of these earthly Vanities.</p>
            <p>The third opinion is grounded vpon both the former; which I find in <hi>Hugo</hi> too: to wit, that this patheticall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemination of Vanity of Vanities, is yet rather spoken <hi>Per admirationem,</hi> by a way of wonder and admiration: that King <hi>Salomon</hi> considering, in the deepnes of his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, both the magnitude and the multitude of these earthly Vanities, and yet, how greedily Vaine men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2680:15"/>
&amp; follow after them: <hi>Admirans &amp; stupen: ait, Vanitas Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum.</hi> He crieth out as euen astonished with admiration, <hi>O Vanity of Vanities</hi>: that euer any man should be so grosly blinded, as to be deceiued by them. For this repetition and doubling of the word, as he noteth in that place, <hi>Et re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niudinem, et admirationis significat nouitatem.</hi> It noteth out vnto vs, both the wonderful greatnes, &amp; the maruelous strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of that we wonder at. And surely though the prouerbe be, that <hi>Sapiens nihil admiratur:</hi> that he which is a wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil wonder at nothing; yet in this case, of the wonderful Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the world, the wisest man is alwaies the greatest won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer; when he considereth,<note place="margin">Psal. 39 6.</note> 
               <hi>How vaine men walke in a Vaine shadow</hi> (as the Psalmist speaketh) striuing with infinite la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, vexation, &amp; trouble, to get vnto themselues, a thing of nothing: which first they are vncertaine whether they can obtaine; and yet, by &amp; by, most certaine that they can not long retaine, for the vnstable condition, both of it and of them selues So that, though all other worldly things be no better then meere Vanity, yet man himselfe (of all other things) is the greatest Vanity. He is a world of Vanities, yea a world of wicked Vanities, <hi>Who drinketh vp iniquity, as a beast drinketh water,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> noteth in his booke: yea he is indeed,<note place="margin">Iob 15.16.</note> this <hi>Vanitas Vanitatum</hi>: he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> this Vanity of Vanities, which the Preacher here speaketh of: not one single Vanity (as other things be) but an vpheaped masse of many Vanities together: His cogitations, consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and contemplations, Vanity: his proiects, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and indeuors Vanity, his life Vanity, his death Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nay Vanity of Vanities, as <hi>Hierom</hi> collecteth; <hi>Si vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uus homo Vanitas est, certe mortuus homo, Vanitas Vanitatum est.</hi> Finally,<note place="margin">Hier. in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clens.</note> all the creatures of God (for his sake) be Vanity: and hee (amongst the creatures) is the greatest Vanity; whose beginning was with the Vanity of Mutability,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.6. Iob 15.16.</note> in desiring to change and to alter his estate: whose continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in the Vanity of Iniquity, which (as you heard euen
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2680:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now) <hi>he drinketh in like water</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> and, whose ending will bee with the Vanity of Mortality. For, the <hi>certaine wages of his sin shalbe death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 5.18.</note> Thus drawe we (like to beasts) in the cordes of many Vanities, from our birth vnto our death. So that man (as I said) is not onely Vanity, but also <hi>Vanity of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>: that is,<note place="margin">Psal. 38.5.</note> 
               <hi>vniuersa Vanitaes,</hi> as the Psalmist calleth him: <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersa vanitas omnis homo,</hi> Man is an vniuersal Vanity, &amp; as it were a <hi>Compendium</hi> of al the Vanities of the world together: of the Vanity of Mortalitie in his body; of the Vanity of Iniquitie, in his soule: and of the Vanity of Mutability in them both. Yea and further to expresse the vnexpressible Vanity of man euery way, he saith (in an other place) that, <hi>Man is altogether lighter then Vanity it selfe</hi>:<note place="margin">Psal. 62.9.</note> so that no Vanity can compare with the Vanity of Man; no lightnesse with his lightnes. If it should be demanded, what is lighter then wind, we might answere, that Vanity is: for so the Prophet <hi>Isai</hi> affirmeth in his prophecy.<note place="margin">Isa. 41.29.</note> If it should be demanded, what is lighter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Vanity, we might answere, that Man is: for so the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> affirmeth in the <hi>Psalme.</hi> But if it should be demanded, what is lighter then Man; we must answer that Nothing is.<note place="margin">Isa. 40.17.</note> For so the prophet <hi>Isai</hi> affirmeth in an other place, where he saith of Man, that <hi>he is lesse then No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>; nay, Nothing is not lighter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Man, but Man is ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Nothing. For, he is not only Vanity, which is as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as Nothing, but he is <hi>Vanity of Vanities,</hi> which is lesse then nothing.<note place="margin">Gen. 18.27.</note> Thus pleaseth it the holy spirit of God, to humble the haughty &amp; proud spirit of man, by making him the mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nest &amp; vilest of al creatures: yea, as <hi>vile as dust,</hi> or <hi>ashes,</hi> as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue (partly here, and partly elswhere) vnfolded the whole substance of this present Scripture; yea, and that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sermons, as you may remember, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering in all of them such profitable doctrines, as I thought best befitted the nature of the hearers: which I purpose not at this time to rehearse againe vnto you, but onely to offer vnto your considerations, a modest defence of some speciall doctrines, which haue beene much traduced, as false and erroneous: that so, those questions which arise in the Church may peaceably be, both heard and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not in any blind and obscure conuention (as some of them haue beene) but, in a learned and a lawfull congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>For our fitter ingresse into which discourse, let me onely repeat thus much: That, the generall partes which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in this Scripture, were in number two: The <hi>Author,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:2680:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the <hi>Matter</hi>: or his <hi>Doctor,</hi> and this <hi>Doctrine.</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> is heere called by the name of a Preacher; <hi>Saith the Preacher:</hi> The <hi>Matter</hi> is deliuered in the forme of a censure; defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiuely pronouncing of all earthly glory, that it is indeede nothing but <hi>Vanity of Vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Author of this doctrine I made this obseruation: that hee calleth not onely himselfe A Preacher, who spake this Sermon with his liuely voyce as <hi>Athanasius</hi> affirmeth;<note place="margin">Athanas in Svnop. Psal 19.3.</note> but he calleth this booke A Preacher too, though it <hi>haue neither voyce nor language,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaketh. From whence I then collected these three positions, for the clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of certaine truths, which haue beene greatly obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Atramento Sepiarum,</hi> as the Orator speaketh: by the writings of certaine troublers and disturbers of our peace.<note place="margin">Cic. lib. 2. de Nat. deor.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, that all the bookes of the Scriptures are Preachers vnto vs, which teach vs most plainely the way of Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not onely when they bee expounded, but also when they are humbly and faithfully read. This position I then proued: first, by the authority of king <hi>Salomon</hi> in this place, who calleth this booke (as you see) A Preacher; which had beene an vnfit, &amp; a misapplied title if the books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues did not preach vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I proued it by the authority of S. <hi>Iames</hi> in the Actes of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Act. 5.21.</note> who calleth Reading expresly by the name of Preaching. <hi>Moses</hi> (saith hee) <hi>hath them that Preach him in euery citie, seeing he is read euery sabboth day.</hi> He saith that he is preached, because he is read: <hi>Because</hi>: for euen <hi>Beza</hi> himselfe in his translation expresseth that place by this causal, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction <hi>Quum, Because.</hi> So that he which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the reading of the Scripture to be a preaching to vs, he denieth the authority both of the old and new Testaments. For <hi>Salomon</hi> affirmeth it in the old, &amp; <hi>Iames</hi> affirmeth it in the new: yea, &amp; (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> noteth of the <hi>Metaphrasis</hi> of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi>) hee putteth the holy Ghost himselfe to schoole,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 4. Eccles. hist. cap. 27.</note> and wil teach him how to speake more fitly &amp; exactly, though
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2680:17"/>
               <hi>Sus. Mineruam.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cic. lib. 1. Acad.</note> For the holy Ghost, as you see, calleth a booke a Preacher: and hee calleth Reading Preaching, which certaine men amongst vs count an absurd kind of speaking: nay, a false and an erroneous doctrine, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming therein euen the Spirit of truth himselfe.</p>
            <p>The second position which I deduced out of the former obseruation, in his calling a booke by the name of a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, was this: that this Reading is not a faint or a feeble kind of Preaching (as some men affirme of it, who call bare reading but bare feeding) but it is a mighty and a powerfull kind of preaching; both sufficient, and efficient to beget in our hearts both faith and all other spiritual ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: if wee rightly come prepared vnto the reading of them, and if God vouchsafe his blessing vnto our labours in them; two necessary conditions vnto our profitable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eading: the first of them giuen by S. <hi>Augustine</hi>; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>;<note place="margin">Aug. lib. de vtilit. credend. cap. 6. Chrys. hom. 21. in Gen.</note> yea, and both of them no lesse ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in preaching, then in reading: without which it is no more in the Preachers power then it is in the Readers, to beget any good in the hearts of the hearers. But these two being granted, euen bare reading (as some scornefull spirits doe in derision terme it) may be as actiue a kind of preaching, and as operatiue of all true Christian vertues, as their most adorned or impassioned Sermons. This posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I proued: first by the authority of the Prophet <hi>Moses,</hi> who ordained in the booke of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 31.11, 12.</note> that the booke of the Law should be read vnto the people: yea, and that vnto them all, men, women, and children: yea, and that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time that they appeared before the Lord. Now to what end must all this reading be? yea, and reading so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of one and the same thing? He telleth vs in that place, that these three effects shal insue &amp; follow of it: the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, the feare of God, and the faithfull keeping of the commandements of God. All which notable effects (as there he noteth) the bare reading of the word shal effect
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2680:18"/>
and bring forth; yea, and that not onely in men of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but also euen in women and children: yea, and that not onely in the <hi>Israelites,</hi> but also in the Heathen and stranger that should heare it. Which point I pray you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to note: that euen bare reading is able of it selfe, not onely to nourish faith in the heart of the faithfull, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to beget faith in the heart of the infidell, and such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did neither know God nor his word.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I proued the same position by the authority of <hi>Ezra,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nehem. 8.9.</note> who found by his experience, the former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>Moses</hi> to be true: for when as he had but onely read the booke of the Law vnto the people, it was of so mighty &amp; powerfull an operation, that it cast them all into mourning and weeping: yea, and that so excessiue, that he himselfe was constrained by a publique edict and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to restraine it. Now though in that place there be some mention made of exposition, and giuing the sense; yet note, I pray you, that this notable effect of their mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not there ascribed vnto the exposition, but onely to the reading; for it is said that it was the wordes of the Law which wrought this vehement passion, and not any glosse which was made vpon them.</p>
            <p>A like effect also did the bare reading of the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in King <hi>Iosias</hi>:<note place="margin">2. King. 22.11, 19.</note> it had so powerfull an operation in him, that it caused him to rend his clothes off from his backe, and his heart to melt away within him: and yet was there heere no exposition, but onely bare reading. The same points I yet further backed by the testimonies both of <hi>Ieremie</hi> and <hi>Baruck</hi>: The first of whom foretold as much as <hi>Moses</hi>:<note place="margin">Ier. 36.6, 7.</note> and the second sound performed as much as <hi>Ezra</hi> in the bare reading of the word:<note place="margin">Baruck. 1.5, 6</note> for it made the people both to fast, and to pray, and to weepe, and to giue almes vnto their needy brethren. Now what or whose preaching could haue wrought more worthy and noble effects then this bare reading did?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:2680:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thirdly, I proued the same position by the testimony of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who ascribeth euen faith it selfe (which is the chiefe point in question) vnto this action of reading.<note place="margin">Iohn 20.31.</note> 
               <hi>These things</hi> (saith he) <hi>are written, that ye should beleeue.</hi> Now, that which is written cannot make vs beleeue, but onely by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Finally, I confirmed it by the testimonie of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, in bidding vs <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> that is, to read it, and adding,<note place="margin">Iohn 5.39.</note> that so <hi>we should find eternal life in it.</hi> So that, by the forecited Scriptures you see, that both <hi>The knowledge of God,</hi> and <hi>The faith of God,</hi> and <hi>The feare of God,</hi> and <hi>The obedience of God,</hi> and <hi>Eternall life with God,</hi> (which is the highest reward of all vertues) is expresly ascribed vnto the bare reading of the word. And therefore those men which deny reading to be an effectual kind of preaching, &amp; disable it, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> begetting either faith, or any other spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vertue in vs, they make <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ieremie</hi> two false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Baruck,</hi> two false historians: S. <hi>Iohn</hi> a false Apostle: and our Sauiour, a false Christ; for all these affirme it.</p>
            <p>The third position which I gathered from the former obseruation, in calling a booke by the name of a <hi>Preacher,</hi> was this: That <hi>Preaching is not alwaies more effectual then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi> This position I then proued by two speciall instances: The first of them out of <hi>Tully</hi>;<note place="margin">Cic. lib. 2 ad Attic.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2680:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(which he plainely confessed, to be strong and mighty) then euer it had been, by the hearing of his Sermons, which he despised, as light, and things of no value. <hi>His letters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> (saith he) <hi>are sore and strong, but his bodily presence is weake, and his speech of no value.</hi> This is truely and ingeniously the summe of that doctrine, which heretofore I haue deliuered as concerning the comparison of <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all which, what was spoken, that could giue the least offence, vnto any well meaning, or but indifferent mind? What that any way offended, either against any article of our Christian faith, or any duty of godly life: or, against any other point of sound and wholesome doctrine? Nay, what but iustified by the authoritie, both of the old and new Testament, and ratified by the testimonie of the holy ghost himselfe. Nay, yet further, what, but auouched for a sealed truth, by al true Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, against the Papists? who teach vs, that the Scripture is darke and obscure, and such as cannot preach vnto vs. With whom I did neuer looke that any of our men (professing themselues, to be such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and reforming Protestants) would euer haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hands as we euidently see (by the writings of some and the speeches of others) they apparantly doe. For, those three forenamed positions of mine, which (I am sure) would greatly haue offended the Papists, if they had bin my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and beene censured of them as hereticall doctrines, haue likewise displeased some, that call themselues Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants. Who haue (in their ignorance) traduced all those three former positions, both farre and neere, and howted them vp and downe, not onely as three false and erroneous doctrines: but also, as doctrines dangerous, and such as tend directly vnto the disgrace of preaching, and making it of none effect: though no word were spoken vnto any such purpose, no, nor yet, that could bee forced vnto any so badde a sense, vnlesse it were this one (which must bee done with a wrinch too) <hi>that they which preferre any prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2680:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sermon, either in excellencie, or in effecacie before the holy Scriptures, they preferre this word of a man, before the word of God</hi>: which I take to be no heresie, but an impregnable verity, and so I hope to make it to appeare most plainely to you.</p>
            <p>And therefore, I must craue your Christian patience, that I may clere the former doctrines, from the two former imputations; especially, from that imputation of false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: which is the greatest infamie, if it be true, and the greatest iniurie, if it be false, that can possibly be cast vpon a Preacher: yea a farre greater iniurie, then to call him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a murderer, a theife, or a traitor. For to be a false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, is to be all these together; it is to be both a murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerer of mens soules; a theefe, vnto Christs fold: and a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to Gods honour. And therefore, Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> saith, that <hi>Neminem decet in suspicione baereseos esse patientem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hier. Epist. ad Pammach.</note> That no man ought to be patient, when his doctrine is impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. And Ruffine though his aduersarie in some other matters, yet in this agreeth with him; <hi>That he which can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the suspicion of an heretike, it is vnpossible for him to be a true Catholicke.</hi> And therefore, I must pray your licence, that by a modest and a Christian Apologie, I may vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate these doctrines into their natiue verity: and not suffer such tried and approued truthes, to runne vp and downe, so branded for errors, but freely and sincerely to discharge that duty, which I owe both vnto God, and to his truth, and to the Church, and to my selfe. All whom I should betray into the handes of the wicked, if I should permit such innocent truthes to be any longer so scourged and whipped, as they haue lately beene, and not doe my best indeuour to rescue and deliuer them.</p>
            <p>First therefore, as concerning those three positions which haue bin so mightily resisted, you are to know thus much: (which I doubt not, but the greatest part of this graue and learned auditore, being the flower of our Clergy, doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2680:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnderstand) that there is none of them all which is any nouelty of mine owne inuention, but are all of them maine and beaten grounds of religion, expresly and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely set downe, by all our learned Protestants, in their disputations (vpon these pointes) against the Papists.<note place="margin">Breut. prico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe tertia.</note> Of which I wonder, that some of the reprouers of those do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, should be so vnlearned, as to be ignorant.</p>
            <p>For first, whereas the Papists teach vs, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of themselues, are darke and obscure, &amp; such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not teach vs, much lesse preach vnto vs, because they lacke a voyce; whereupon they call the Scripture, in a kind of derision, but <hi>Mutum magistrum,</hi> that i, sa dumbe Teacher: we positiuely set downe both the contraries against them. First, for their position, That the Scriptures in themselues are but darke and obscure, and such as cannot teach vs: we set downe this <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> against them,<note place="margin">2.

               <hi>Adeo vt diuina scriptura opus non habeat hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana sapientia, vt intelligatur</hi>: as he writeth in an other place. So that (as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth) <hi>If the doctrine of the Gospell be hid vnto any,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.3.</note> 
               <hi>it is but onely vnto such as perish.</hi> And this truth we proue against the Papists by many great and strong arguments, grounded partly vpon the authority of the holy Scriptures; partly vpon the concludencie of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie reasons: and partly vpon the testimonie of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers,<note place="margin">Whitak. cont. Bellarm. quaest 4. de Script. cap. 4.</note> being twenty sixe in number, as I find them collected by a learned Writer: and all of them most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, answering fully all obiections which are vsually brought, either by Papists or Schismatikes against those positions. Which because they are all of them most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your hearing, and yet the time will not now allow me
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2680:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their speaking, I referre those that be learned vnto our mens disputation against <hi>Bellarmines</hi> fourth question vpon the Scriptures: where they shall euidently see, that there is no point of doctrine necessarie to saluation, but that it is most plainely and familiarly deliuered in the Scripture, euen to the capacitie of euery simple Reader, yea euen the simplest of all: <hi>Etiam Publicanis, Piscatoribus, Fabris Pastori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, Illiteratis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chris hom. 3. de Lazaro.</note>

                  </gap>tir,</hi> as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> noteth. Vnto which his induction, Saint <hi>Agustine</hi> addeth his generall conclusion,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. de Vtili creden. cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Nec in caeteris contrarium est videri</hi>; though in somewhat other words, <hi>Vt nemo sit</hi> (saith he) <hi>quii<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de haurire non possit, quod sibisatis sit.</hi> That for their false position.</p>
            <p>Now for their friuolous reason, why the Scriptures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not teach vs because they lacke a voyce, wee set downe this position: That the Scriptures haue not onely a liuely voyce in them, as birds and beasts haue, but also a spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king voyce too, as men and Angels haue, whereby they doe both teach vs, and preach vnto vs. And this wee proue by many sound reasons: whereof I will giue you a tast but onely of some one or two, because the Arguments be long and the time is short.</p>
            <p>Our first argument is this: which (because I am now as it were in the Schole, and as in a Colonie of both the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersities) I will conclude in Scholasticall forme. It is in effect thus much.</p>
            <p>If the Scrptures instruct vs with a speaking voyce, then doe they likewise preach vnto vs: For what other thing is preaching but instructing with the voyce? But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures instruct vs with a speaking voyce: <hi>Ergo,</hi> They preach vnto vs.</p>
            <p>The Assumption we proue by manifold texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where the Scripture is expresly affirmed to speake vnto vs. As namely in that place vnto the <hi>Romanes: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the law speaketh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>it speaketh vnto them that are vnder the Law</hi>: where the Law is said to speake vnto vs. So likewise
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2680:21"/>
in another place vnto the <hi>Hebrewes: Haue yee forgotten the consolation which speaketh vnto you as vnto children?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.5.</note> where the Prouerbs of <hi>Salomon</hi> are said to speake vnto vs. For from thence is that testimony fetched. So likewise in another place vnto the <hi>Romanes: What saith the Scripture?</hi> where the Scripture in generall is said to speake vnto vs.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.3.</note> And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other such like places there bee, alledged by our men against the Papists in discussing the fifth question vpon the Scriptures. Wherein we labour to proue it as a ground of our religion, against the Papists hereticall doctrine, that the Scriptures in themselues doe both speake and preach vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Our second argument is this: That if the Scriptures do expound the Scriptures vnto vs, then do they also preach vnto vs. For what other thing is preaching, but expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scriptures? But the Scriptures expound the Scriptures vnto vs; <hi>Ergo,</hi> They preach vnto vs.</p>
            <p>The assumption of this argument we proue by many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, euery one hauing the strength of a firme demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and containing sufficient matter to furnish a whole Sermon: being all of them deduced, either from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Scriptures, or from necessarie reasons; or from the concurring iudgements of the ancient fathers. Yea, and (that you may perceiue how far a learned iudgement doth differ from an ignorant) that man of worthy memory M. <hi>D. Whitaker</hi> (whom for his godly labors against the Papists all posterity will reuerence) hee deliuereth his iudgement vpon this question in these words:<note place="margin">Whitak. in Bellarm. quaest. 5. de Scrip. cap. 8.</note> which I pray you to marke diligently.</p>
            <p>First he affirmeth, that God speaketh vnto vs as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his word as euer hee spake vnto <hi>Moses</hi> in the cloude when he talked there with him face to face. Secondly, he affirmeth that the Scriptures doe preach so plainely and so excellently vnto vs, that if God should speake vnto vs from heauen in his owne liuely voyce, hee neither would
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2680:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deliuer any other matter, nor yet dispose it in any other forme then hee hath already deliuered in the Scripture. Thirdly hee affirmeth of the contrary opinion, that it is <hi>&amp; falsum, &amp; impium</hi>: That is, not onely an erroneous but also an impious kinde of doctrine. And fourthly, he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of the defenders of it, that they be <hi>&amp; inepti &amp; audaces,</hi> that is, not onely an ignorant, but also an impudent kinde of persons. This is his iudgement of the reprouers of my doctrine.</p>
            <p>So that, for the first of my three positions: <hi>That the Scriptures in themselues doe preach vnto vs</hi>; you see that it is no such strange and vncouth monster, as some men (in the deepenes of their ignorance) haue imagined it to be, preparing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with no lesse folly to fight against it, then the souldiers in <hi>Pacu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ius</hi> did against a Snaile, which they thought to be some <hi>Monstrum borrendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, informe, ingens,</hi> as the Poet speaketh;<note place="margin">Virg. lib. 3. Aeneid.</note> that is, some fierce and terrible mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, when they heard it thus described; <hi>Animal terrigenum, tardigradum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cic. lib. 2. de Diuin.</note> 
               <hi>Domiportum, sanguine cassum.</hi> Thus ignorance and blindenes, there faineth many monsters, where true and solid knowledge findeth none at all.</p>
            <p>But let vs now proceede vnto our second position: that <hi>Reading is an effectuall and a powerfull kinde of Preaching.</hi> For which point; whereas the Papists teach vs that the Scriptures as they be darke, and cannot teach vs, so they be weake and cannot moue vs; whereupon they call the Scripture but <hi>literam frigidam,</hi> and <hi>egenum elementum</hi>; that is, a weake and beggerly rudiment: we positiuely set down these <hi>Theses</hi> to the contrary: First, for the plainenes and perspicuity of the Scripture: that <hi>Deus nobis in Scripturis pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissime loquitur</hi>: that God speaketh vnto vs most plainely in the Scripture; which is <hi>Iewels</hi> position in his Apologie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for the power and efficacie of the Scripture, that <hi>Sacra scriptura, vel cum ligitur, vel cum auditur, est ordinarium organon, quo spiritus sanctus mentes lectorum &amp; auditorum rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2680:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
illustrat, viuificat, &amp; caelestibus virtutibus ornat.</hi> What can there be more plaine, or more full, or more direct vnto our purpose? And this is the categoricall position of <hi>Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in his learned disputation (vpon this point) against <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>: hee expresly affirmeth, that the very Scriptures, not onely when they be Preached vnto vs, but also when they be but onely Read by vs are an ordinarie meanes to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate mens soules, to inlighten them, to quicken them, and to beget all heauenly vertues in them; and all this it effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cùm ligitur,</hi> when it is but onely Read. Wordes of great force and great power, and such as proue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be neither dumbe, nor yet dull teachers, but indeed most powerfull, and mouing Preachers.</p>
            <p>For proofe whereof (amongst other arguments) we vse these Scriptures following. First, that place of the Psalme, where the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ascribeth vnto the word of God, not onely to bee able to inlighten the minde and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but also to worke vpon the hart and affection. He saith that it is able,<note place="margin">Psal. 19.7, 8.</note> both <hi>to giue light vnto the eyes, and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the simple</hi>: yea and further to <hi>comfort the hart,</hi> yea and <hi>euen to conuert the soule.</hi> What can there be more, either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Preacher, or desired by the hearer, then here you see most plainely ascribed to the Scripture?</p>
            <p>Secondly, we alledge that place of the prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> where he compareth the worde of God vnto a fire and a hammer,<note place="margin">Ier. 23.29.</note> which is able to <hi>breake euen the strong rocks a sunder,</hi> and (as <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist speaketh) <hi>euen out of very stones to raise vp children vnto Abraham.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3.9.</note> I trow, it must haue no smal strength and power in it, that is able to cleaue and to break a stony rocke.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we alledge that place of the Epistle vnto the <hi>Hebrewes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> 
               <hi>The word of God is liuely and powerful in operation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sharper then any two edged sword, that it pierceth euen to the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the soule and the spirit, the ioynts and the marrow, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to discerne, euen the very inward thoughts and intentions of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2680:22"/>
heart.</hi> A notable place indeed, and which euidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that the Scripture is not either a dumbe teacher, nor yet a dull worker, but a mighty and a potent preacher, euen to the very harts of men.</p>
            <p>Neither be these places to be vnderstood of the worde <hi>Preached</hi> onely, (the onely euasion of our ignorant aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries) but of the word <hi>Read</hi> also. For to that onely end they be alleaged by vs Protestants against the Papists, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they should be alledged beside the purpose. The question being betweene vs, not of the Preaching of the Scripture, but of the Reading of them: of the natiue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent perspicuity of the Scripture, and not of that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental light, which is brought vnto them by our expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as they that be learned and conuersant in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies, doe right well vnderstand.</p>
            <p>Let vs therfore now proceed vnto our third positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which was thought the greatest monster: that <hi>Preaching is not alwaies more powerful then Reading.</hi> For that point, let me giue you but onely this one watch word: that it is knowne to be a notable Art and cunning of the Papists, to ioine vnto their former disgraces of Reading, an excessiue and hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal commendation of Preaching: that so, they hauing wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the people from the reading of the Scripture, whereby their errours might bee discouered, and brought them on wholly to depend vpon their Sermons, and as it were to hang vpon their lippes, that their <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> might passe for demonstrations, they might so leade them more easily (as it were hooded and blindfold) into all kind of errours. I pray God it bee not also the drift of some others, that would seeme to be farre vnlike vnto the Papists. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto our question.</p>

                  </gap>reaching is farre more excellent, then is dead Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>: that position doth <hi>Brentius,</hi> a very learned Protestant, confute and refell, as a popish errour, in his <hi>Defence of the Confession of Christopher,</hi> Duke of <hi>Wittenberge,</hi> where hee handleth this point both fully &amp; substantially, both larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learnedly censuring this forenamed position of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> to be a contumely and reproch, not only against the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, but also against our Sauiour Christ himselfe. Againe, whereas <hi>Hossius</hi> an other papist affirmeth vnto the same effect, that the <hi>Scriptures are but bare and naked elements, but Preaching is indeede the liuely word of God</hi>: that position doth <hi>Iewel</hi> (the iewel of our Church) most earnestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute in his learned Apologie; affirming it to be a speech (in effect) as blasphemous, as the horrible heresie of <hi>Montanus,</hi> who presumptuously vaunted of himselfe, that hee <hi>could speake better then the holy ghost himselfe</hi>: which is indeed both a true and a wise censure of it. For what is it els, to prefer our Sermons before the holy Scriptures, but to prefer mens speeches before the holy ghost? Therefore, this doctrine of the Papist, the Protestants confute, by many strong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: which proue vnto vs plainely, that the Scriptures of themselues are both in Teaching and in Meaning, of farre greater power, then any mans expositions, how artificiall soeuer. I will giue you but a taste of some one or two of our mens reasons, and so passe on to the second of their scruples.</p>
            <p>First therefore, for the first point, that the Scriptures haue in themselues, a greater power to teach and instruct vs, then any preachers Sermons, <hi>Luther</hi> proueth it by this reason. <hi>Because all Preachers and expounders of the Scriptures doe proue their expositions to bee true by Scriptures.</hi> But euery proofe must be a <hi>Notiori,</hi> as those that be learned know. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> the Scriptures be <hi>Notiores,</hi> that is to say, <hi>More knowen and more plaine, then any Preachers expositions.</hi> This is <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion, confirmed with his reason, which the learnedest
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2680:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on our side haue allowed for a good one: yea, and doe vse the same themselues against the Papists.</p>
            <p>Now secondly, for the second point, that <hi>The Scriptures haue also greater power to mooue vs, then any Preacher Sermons:</hi> that most graue and learned father <hi>Brentius,</hi> (for so it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> to honour him,<note place="margin">Defes. Apol. p. 520.</note> yea and very worthily too, for his great learning and wisdome) he, not onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it, as his opinion, but also confirmeth it by good and sound reason: and he citeth for this purpose, that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Sauiour;<note place="margin">Luke 16.31.</note> 
               <hi>He that will not harken vnto Moses and the Prophets, he will neuer be perswaded, though a man should be raysed from the dead to speake vnto him.</hi> Which is a notable place indeede, for the power and efficacie of the written word, and such, as euidently proueth, that he which will not be moued with the reading of the Scriptures, he will neuer be reclamed by hearing any Sermons, be they neuer so patheticall, neuer so effectuall. Which our Sauiour Christ himselfe doth likewise acknowledge in plaine and expresse words:<note place="margin">Iohn 5.47.</note> 
               <hi>If you beleeue not Moses writings</hi> (saith he) <hi>how will ye beleeue my words?</hi> So that euen he himselfe ascribeth greater power of working faith in our hearts vnto the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Scriptures, then vnto his owne most liuely and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sermons:<note place="margin">Iohn 7.46.</note> though it be affirmed of him, that <hi>neuer did any man speake as he spake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus as concerning those three forenamed positions, which were thought by some to bee such great nouelties, you se that there is nothing in the at all contained, but that which is both said and proued by vs Protestants, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said by none, but either Papists, or Schi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But let vs now proceede vnto the second of their scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: <hi>That this doctrine tendeth greatly vnto disgrace of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and making it of none effect: because I preferre reading, in calling it the worde of God, and make preaching to bee but the word of man.</hi> For so it hath pleased some men to collect, though without all due consequent. For if any man doe construe my commendation of Reading to bee a disgrace of Preaching, he may by the same reason (or rather lacke of reason) condemne of the same fault, euen the Apostles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> compareth Faith and Hope,<note place="margin">1.

God forbid. To come a little neerer vnto our owne question: The Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> biddeth vs, that <hi>If any man lacke wisedome, hee shll aske it of God.</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:2680:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Whereby he implieth that spirituall wisedome may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by prayings.<note place="margin">Iam. 1.5.</note> Shall we therefore say that S. <hi>Iames</hi> disableth Preaching, &amp; maketh it vnnecessary to the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of wisedom? Nay, (to come home vnto the ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will set downe his words, because they be most pregnant, and deliuer most plainely his resolute iudgement. <hi>Ad quid, inquis, ingredior</hi> (saith he in the person of those conceited auditors) <hi>nisi aliquem Sermocinantem an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He addeth in that place: <hi>Omnia clara sunt &amp; plana ex Scripturis. Quacunque necessaria sunt, manifesta sunt. Sedquia delicatuli estis auditores, delectatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem audiendo venantes, propterea &amp; ista quaeritis. All things</hi> (saith he) <hi>are open and easie in the Scripture, and whatsoeuer is necessary vnto saluation, the same is euident and plaine. But because we are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2680:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wanton and delicate hearers, hunting onely after pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in our hearing, that is it which maketh vs runne so fast after Preaching.</hi> Heere is <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> iudgement as concerning Reading and Preaching, wherein hee goeth very farre in aduancing of Reading, &amp; yet hath no purpose to depresse or disgrace preaching, which no man vsed more diligently.</p>
            <p>These things haue I noted to rectifie the errour of such malignant interpreters, and to exemplifie vnto the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler hearted hearers, that spirituall things may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together, without any wrong or disgrace vnto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea,<note place="margin">Tertul. lib. 1. cont. Marci. cap. 29.</note> euen then when as one is preferred before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Because (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> very aptly distinguisheth vnto our present purpose) <hi>Non praeferrimus vt malo bonum, sed vt bono melius. Wee doe not preferre them as a good thing before an euill, but as a better thing before a good.</hi> And it is a rule of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torike</hi> (yea and of reason too) as concerning such compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons,<note place="margin">Cic. lib. 2. ad Heren.</note> that <hi>Non necesse est, in rebus comparandis, vt alteram vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuperes, si alteram laudes:</hi> and therefore as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth against <hi>Iouiniam:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hier. lib. 1. cont. Iouin.</note> 
               <hi>Nunquid argentum non erit argentum, siaurum argento pretiosius dicatur? Is therefore siluer made no siluer, if a man chance to say that gold is better?</hi> So may I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise reason in this our present question: <hi>Is therefore Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching made no preaching, if in some points it be surpassed by Reading?</hi> Or must Preaching of necessity be disgraced, if Reading in any respect be preferred? Hee must needes be a man of a deplored blindnes, vnto whom things so distant doe seeme to haue coherence.</p>
            <p>Then why should my commendation of eading, which I gaue, both according to the holy Scriptures, and to the ancient fathers, and to the professed doctrine of all true Protestants, be rather accounted a disgrace of Preaching, then their excessiue commendation of Preaching bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for a disgrace vnto reading? or vnto praying, both which they haue iustled out of the Church by their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, to vse <hi>Cartwrights</hi> owne wordes. This forsooth is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2680:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the matter: that in comparing a Sermon with the Scripture, I called Preaching but, The word of a man; which they confidently hold to be truely and properly the very word of God: and resolutely affirme that it ought to find the same credit and authority with all men. A very vntrue and an vnsound position, that I say no more of it.</p>
            <p>And therefore I pray so much equity of you that be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned (which I doubt not to obtaine of those that be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) that that which shall be spoken against this false o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, may not be so peruerted as if it were spoken simply against all Preaching: which euery good Christian must of necessity confesse to be a necessary duety in the Church of God, and a powerfull instrument to draw mens soules vnto him. But yet for all that, as Preaching may bee too much depressed, so may it be likewise too much aduanced, euen to the dishonour of God himselfe, whose owne worke it is. For as <hi>Iob</hi> noteth in his booke; that <hi>a man may speake wickedly euen in defense of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 13 7.</note> so may a man speake wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euen in defence of Preaching. Which surely is then done, when we make our owne sermons (which are but mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions) to equall in authority Gods diuine and holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>And therefore that you may the better perceiue the monstrous absurdities of this foolish opinion, giue me leaue I pray you (in a word or two) to set before your eyes that strange kind of doctrine, which these men haue deliuered, as concerning Preaching: for so you shall a great deale more easily discerne whether such kind of Preaching be the word of God or no.</p>
            <p>First, they openly denie that the Reading of Gods word is a Preaching of it: because this lacketh exposition. And yet S. <hi>Iames</hi> telleth vs,<note place="margin">Act. 15.21.</note> that <hi>Moses is Preached, whensoeuer he is Read; euen without exposition.</hi> In which onely instance of Reading the Scripture, Preaching may truely and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by called <hi>The word of God.</hi> But yet this Reading though
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2680:26"/>
it be of all other (in this one respect) the most diuine and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall kind of Preaching, because it deliuereth the word of God, most simply and sincerely in his owne proper forme; without either any mixture of humane inuention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any tainture of humane corruption: yet this do they first of all, and most of all cast away from being Preaching, and call this no better then playing vpon a Stage.<note place="margin">D. Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift. P. 579.</note> They be the very words of some of our chiefe reformers; though I know there be many which will hardly beleeue that so leaud and prophane a comparison, should euer proceede out of the mouth of a Christian, especially of so purified and refined Christians as they would seeme to be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they exclude from Preaching, all those discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which are made by any other persons then onely by our selues. Whether it be by way of explication of a text, as the Comments and Sermons of diuers great Diuines, both ancient and recent: or by way of Common place, without any certaine text: as the Homilies of our Church, which be indeede most learned and most godly Sermons, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer disgraced by those scornefull spirits, which spare not (as you see) the word of God it selfe, but blasphemously compare the Reading of it, vnto the playing vpon a Stage. But yet neither of these kindes doe they allow for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because they be not of our owne, but of another mans making.<note place="margin">Ier. 36.7, 8.</note> And yet <hi>Baruk</hi> was commaunded by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremie</hi> to Read his prophecy vnto the people; that is, to Read a Sermon of another mans making: and was told that it should worke an excellent effect in them, as it did in very deed,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. 4. de doct. Christ. cap. 29.</note> as before I haue shewed. But yet this will not those men allow for Preaching, though Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doth, yea &amp; sheweth great vse of it in the Church of God. Whereupon there doeth follow this euident absurditi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, which I pray you well to marke: That if a simple and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Minister shall happily meete with a most learned Sermon of another mans (namely <hi>Caluines</hi> or <hi>Bezaes</hi>) and so
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2680:26"/>
shall rehearse it vnto the people, that must not be counted Preaching, because it is not his owne; but his own is Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, because it is his owne; be it neuer so vnlearned, neuer so confused.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they reiect from Preaching, euen these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that be our owne, vnder two conditions: First, if they be read out of a paper, as the weaknes of some mens memories compelleth them to doe, who yet may be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table members in the Church of God. But this (with them) is no preaching, though it be our owne inuention: and yet <hi>Baruk</hi> did read,<note place="margin">Ier. 36.8. Baruk 1.5.</note> not onely the Prophet <hi>Ieremies,</hi> but also his owne Sermon too, <hi>Out of a paper,</hi> vnto the people, as he professeth of himselfe: yea, and he found that his Reading to be an effectuall kind of Preaching, though it were, <hi>Out of a paper.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Kings 22.11, 19.</note> For it caused both Prince and People, <hi>both to fast, and to pray, and to weepe before the Lord.</hi> As likewise did the reading of the law (euen <hi>Out of a paper</hi>) vnto King <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> as you heard before.</p>
            <p>Againe, euen our owne proper Sermons they reiect from being Preachings, if euer they haue beene Preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though in an other place, and to an other audience. And yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confesseth vnto the Philippians, that <hi>He was not ashamed to speake the same things diuers times vnto them</hi>;<note place="margin">Philip. 3.1.</note> adding, that <hi>for them it was a sound way of instruction</hi> Thus you see how great a chaine of errors this one opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath linked together: and all of them, <hi>Ex diametro,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the Scripture. Reading of the Scripture is no Preaching, because it lacketh exposition: Expositions of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ancent fathers, or moderne writers they be not Preaching, because they be not of our owne making: Our owne Sermons be no Preachings, if we speake them not by heart: Nay, though we so rehearse them, yet be they no Preachings if euer they haue beene Preached before.</p>
            <p>So that now you see what maner of Preaching that is, which must be counted equall vnto the word of God, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2680:27"/>
may not, without blasphemic be called <hi>The word of man.</hi> It must onely be our owne, be we neuer so ignorant: it must be none other mans, be he neuer so learned: and it must be our owne, not by ordinary course of reading attained, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from old or new writers; neither yet, by often iterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on decocted; but (in a sort) after the Anabaptistical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, both sodainely infused, and effused. This is, (with those men) that noble and that worthy kind of Preaching, which must, in credit and authority, equall the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in power and perspicuity farre excell them. A very blind and a bad kind of doctrine.</p>
            <p>For these great inconueniences must needes insue of it: First, if our Sermons be truely and properly the worde of God (as they comonly affirme) it will from thence follow, that the Preacher in his Sermons cannot erre. For, <hi>The word of God can not erre.</hi> And so, we who haue taught all this while, that the Fathers can erre, the Pope can erre, the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels can erre, shall now teach, with the selfe same mouth that <hi>We our selues cannot erre.</hi> Which were both an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and an impious assertion. For what is that which can priuiledge vs from errour in our Preaching? The Chaire of <hi>Moses</hi> could not priuiledge the Pharises from errour: the Chaire of <hi>Peter</hi> cannot priuiledge the Pope from errour: the earthly Paradise could not priuiledg the first man from errour: nay Heauen it selfe could not priuiledge the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles from errour; and can onely the Pulpit priuiledge vs from errour? Is not Papistry Preached? is not Heresie Preached? is not Schisme, and contention, and all errour Preached? doe not all these find Pulpits, to vent themselues out of? Why then it is apparent, that a Sermon may not onely bee the word of a man, but also sometimes the word of a wicked and vngodly man; the word of a Schismatike, the word of a Papist,<note place="margin">Greg. hom. 9. in Ezech.</note> the word of an Heretike. For as <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> truly teacheth vs: <hi>Si desit spiritus, nihil adiuuat locus</hi>: It is not the place can helpe vs, if the spirit be not with vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:2680:27"/>Secondly, if Preaching be truely and properly the word of God, as they affirme, it will from thence follow, that all our glosses must needes be canonicall Scriptures. For the word of God is canonicall Scripture: and so wee who haue taught, all the expositions of the Fathers, to be but the bare opinions of men, shall foolishly now teach of our owne expositions, that they be the very word of God: which is to set the Preacher not vp in <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, but to plucke downe God himselfe, and to set him vp in Gods chaire.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if Preaching be truely the word of God, as they affirme, then if I expound the Scripture one way, and another man an other way, both these must bee taken for canonicall senses, and both be true meanings of the word of God: though the one of them should be cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto the other, as they be but too too often. And so, euen we our selues should make the holy Scriptures, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no better then a very nose of waxe, to be bowed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, though we bitterly and worthily reproue it in the Papists.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if Preaching be the very word of God, and the sole ordinary meanes to beget a true faith in vs, as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme; then will it from thence follow, that the Scriptures of themselues, are not sufficient to saluation; but as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists adde vnto them their apocryphal and vnwritten tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; so we must adde vnto them our vocal and speaking expositions, to make them perfect. These and diuers such like false &amp; dangerous consequents must necessarily follow that phantastical doctrine, that <hi>Preaching is properly the very word of God</hi>:<note place="margin">Aug. lib. 4. cont. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag. cap. 3.</note> of which I may truely say (with S. <hi>Augustine</hi>) <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get meta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dicere, quàm muita eos v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sana sequantur, talia sentientes, talia dicentes.</hi> A new and a strange opinion, which only doth proceede from humaine pride and ignorance, and from an arrogant conceit, of men which dote vpon their owne giftes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:2680:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>Why? is not all this enough which we ascribe vnto Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, when we acknowledge them to be Gods owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly institutions: to be necessarie meanes of our instruction; and powerfull meanes of our conuersion: to be truthes, which ought of all men to be accepted and honored: when they consent and agree with the holy word of God? Is not all this (I say) enough, which we lawfully may, &amp; willingly do ascribe to Sermons, but that we must needs make them the very word of God it selfe? The Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> though he spake all by Gods owne holy inspiration, yet doth hee twice professe in one and the same Chapter, that <hi>This hee speaketh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.12, 25.</note> 
               <hi>and not the Lord.</hi> He is very well content (though hee were an Apostle) that where he lacke the warrant of the expresse word of God, that part of his writing should be held and esteemed but as the word of a man. But some men now adaies, are so farre inamored of themselues, and so vainely conceited of their owne gift in Preaching, as to obtrude all the idle fancies of their owne addle heads, vnder none other title, but the <hi>very word of God: Purum pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> flat contrary to the doctrine of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in an other place,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.12.</note> who telleth vs expresly, that a Preacher may take for the foundation of his Sermon, <hi>The very word of God</hi>: and yet, build vpon it, as well <hi>Clay and Stubble,</hi> as <hi>Gold and Siluer.</hi> But these men do tell vs (if we will beleeue them) that they do build nothing but only pure gold. Belike they would faine haue vs to take all for gold that glitters.</p>
            <p>Beloued, though we ought (in all true sincerity) to giue all due honour and reuerence vnto Sermons, when they be truely made according to Gods word, yet must we alwaies put this difference betweene Sermons and Scriptures; The Scriptures we must know,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16. Psal. 12.6. 2. Pet. 1.21.</note> to bee Gods owne diuine and holy word, containing nothing but pure and tried truthes, being all of them writ and penned by Gods holy spirit: and by him so commended vnto his holy Church: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of all the true members of the Church, to be reuerently
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2680:28"/>
accepted, without all exception. But for Sermons, we haue an other rule and direction: we must in them, both examine <hi>the spirit of euery speaker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4.1.</note> &amp; exact the matter of euery speech vnto the strict rule of the scripture: as the <hi>Bereans</hi> dealt euen with the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe.<note place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note> So that Sermons ought to haue no greater credite with vs, then they can gaine vnto themselues by their agreement with the Scriptures: if they dissent from them, no pulpit can sanctifie them, no spirit can make them to bee the word of God:<note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> if they consent with them, yet (the Canon of the Scripture being now sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp) the <hi>Truth of God,</hi> or the <hi>Doctrine of God,</hi> they may be called: but <hi>The word of God</hi> they cannot, but onely by some Metonymie, or Synecdoche, or some other such vnproper and figuratiue speech.</p>
            <p>Therefore, it is as true a position, to say, that a <hi>Sermon is the word of a man,</hi> as it is to say, that a <hi>House is the worke of a man.</hi> For as in building, though both timber, and stone, and iron, and lome, and all other the materials be the workes of God, yet the house it selfe (in respect of the forme) may both truely and fitly bee called <hi>The worke of a man</hi>:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3 10.</note> so is it also euen in Preaching too (which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a <hi>Spiritual kinde of building</hi>) though both the Sentences and Testimonies, and Similies, and Examples, yea and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions too, be the very word of God; yet the positure and placing of those things so together, and the disposing of them in this and that order, and so consequently the whole frame and structure of that speech which we cal a Sermon, that is truly and properly the worke of a man. The Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is mans; the Disposition mans; the Elocution mans; the Action mans; the Application, and Allusion mans: and the ioyning of all those things together, in one artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all body (which giueth to the whole speech the name of a Sermon) that likewise is mans.<note place="margin">Chrys. hom. 7. in 2. Cor.</note> And therfore as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> affirmeth of Reading, that <hi>Lectio est legentis actio</hi>: so may we likewise affirme of Preaching, that <hi>Praedicatio est Pradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantis
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2680:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
actio</hi>: as Reading is the action and worke of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, though the thing which is Read be the word of God: so Preaching is the action and worke of the Preacher, though the thing which is Preached be the trueth of God.</p>
            <p>Which argument howsoeuer it may distaste the eares of some ignorants which are without iudgement, yet must it needes seeme very milde and gentle, euen to the reprouers, if it be compared with some of those speeches which haue beene deliuered by some of their owne chiefest authors. For <hi>Cartwright</hi> in his answere vnto the preface of the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> hee calleth the very translation of the Testament but the word of a man: as though all the Scriptures which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue not in their originall languages, did presently cease to be the word of God, &amp; immediately become but the word of a man. This is harsh indeed, to call the Gospel it selfe but the word of a man, when it is translated. We goe not so farre by many degrees (and God forbid we should) we call but those glosses and expositions which are made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, The word of a man, which is a farre more tempered and qualified speech.</p>
            <p>Which censure notwithstanding, lest any wicked hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer should wrest and peruert vnto the despising of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, as some haue done the like vnto the despising of Reading; let him vnderstand thus much: that when wee call a Sermon the word of a man, we take not the word of a man in the worst sense: as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> doth; who writeth thus of it: <hi>Res vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Bern. serm. 2. in Solen. Pet. &amp; Paul.</note> 
               <hi>nullius soliditatis: The word of a man is a thing vile &amp; wauering, of no waight, of no worth, of no estimation.</hi> In this sense we take not the word of a man, for so it is in a kind of contrariety vnto the word of God, as appeareth by those titles which the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> giueth it in the nineteenth Psalme. But when we call a Sermon the word of a man, we take it not by way of opposition to the word of God: but by way of distinction from the worde of God. A
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2680:29"/>
Sermon is the word of a man, not opposed, but supposed vnto the word of God.</p>
            <p>Which distinction I pray you diligently to marke: for in that onely consisteth the whole resolution of this knotty question: That a Sermon rightly made is the word of a man, not opposed vnto the word of God, but distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the word of God. A Sermon is not so the word of God as the text it selfe is, but a discourse framed vpon it by the wit of man.</p>
            <p>Which action notwithstanding, (lest any wicked spirit should draw it into contempt) we acknowledge it (as I said before) to be Gods owne holy institution, &amp; one principal meanes of procuring mans saluation; as likewise is Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Meditation, and Praying, which are no lesse to bee practised, though in many places they bee too much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. We further confesse, that though in outward forme it differ from Gods word, yet in substance of matter it agreeth with it, if it be rightly made, and that therefore though it bee not (in propriety of speech) the word of God it selfe: yet because it is a trueth agreeing with Gods word, there can no man despise it, but he despiseth God that sent it. For as if a faithfull messenger deliuer the true sum and substance of his Masters minde, though he vse not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely all his Masters owne wordes, yet is it to be taken for his Masters message; and he that despiseth him in that mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, despiseth not the messenger, but the Master. So is it likewise in our Preaching: though the forme of our mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage be of our owne making (as it commonly falleth out in an Ambassadors Oration) yet because the matter is of our Masters sending, you cannot despise vs, but you despise him that sent vs, as our Master himselfe testifieth: <hi>Hee that heareth you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke. 10.16.</note> 
               <hi>he heareth me, and he that despiseth you, despiseth me, and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much I thought good to speake at this time, in iustification of my former doctrine: That a Sermon may
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2680:30"/>
be the word of a man, and yet the truth of God. And that this neither was intended by the speaker, nor yet ought to be extended by the hearer, as implying the least disgrace vnto Preaching, as certaine malignant and captious hearers snatching at my words, and affixing their owne senses, haue indeuoured to inforce; to whom I wish a better mind, and a more Christian dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in the hearing of a Sermon.</p>

with want and labour, yea and (that which is a great deale more grieuous then they both) with a cruel restraint fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the seruice of their God: For (as <hi>Moses</hi> recordeth in the booke of <hi>Exodus</hi>) they could neither serue their own God without danger to their bodies,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.26.</note> because they must offer vnto him the abomination of Aegypt; nor yet see them serue their gods, without griefe vnto their soules, because they offered vnto idoles, the abomination of Israel. This Psalmist therefore, ballancing those two estates together, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how graciously God had dealt in his time, by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying and vpheaping all his mercies on his Church, more then he had done in the time of old, he was so rauished and transported with that heauenly contemplation, that hee doth, as it were, <hi>Excessum pati</hi>; he is carried, as it were, cleane out of himselfe, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> was in his spirituall exstasie, who, <hi>whether</hi> he were <hi>in the body,</hi>

               <hi>or out of the body, he</hi> himselfe <hi>could not tell</hi>: calling here vpon the whole Church, in a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment passion, to come and assist this his godly affection, and to helpe him, with all sorts of musicall instruments (as though humane voices were too weake for his purpose) to sound out the praises of so gracious a God: as wel for their exemption from that grieuous captiuity, as for their adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into so glorious a liberty: wishing, that the day of that blessed redemption might annually and eternally bee obserued in the Church, with all kind of religious and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiual solemnity, as if it were enacted by a statute and a law, <hi>In perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> that so the remembrance of it might neuer fade or perish.</p>
            <p>Hence breaketh out that vehement and patheticall <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordium</hi> of this Psalme, <hi>To sing, and sing againe: to sing ioifully, and cheerefully: to bring out their timbrels, their harpes, and their viols; and to blow vp their trumpets, as in the new Moone.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth, that the whole scope and purpose of this religious Psalmist, in this his so passionate exhortation, was indeed nothing els, but only to rowse vp the drowsie spirits

of the people, by the helpe and assistance of these musicall instruments, and to waken them to a holy and religious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity, that so they altogether (like so many seueral pipes in an organe) might sound out with ful noise the praises of God, as being the chiefest end for which they were created.</p>
            <p>For a man (as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> noteth) is not onely <hi>Templum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Clem.

            <p>First, for the Soule; wee see by dayly experience that the mind of a man, if it be indeed a mans mind, if it be not a brutish and an inhumane mind, not the mind of a beast in the body of a man, it hath such a Sympathie and coaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the musicke which it heareth, that (like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Twinnes) they doe alwayes either mourne or reioyce together: imbracing still the same passion, as though they both were ruled by one heauenly constellation, and had but one spirit diuided betweene them. In so much that (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth in his <hi>Politikes</hi>) there were diuers of the ancient and learned Philosophers,<note place="margin">Arist. lib. 8. Pol. cap. 5.

               <hi>Iubilation</hi> (as some thinke) is an Hebrew word, indeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and made free amongst the Latines, as diuers other strang words be: because otherwise they could not (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out long circumlocution) expresse the full power and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification

of it: a worde more familiar amongst Diuines, then amongst secular writers, it being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly applied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the expressing, of a spirituall and heauenly reioycing.</p>
            <p>In which word, there be diuers of the ancient Fathers, which thinke there lieth hidden some Diuine and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly mysteries: and therefore it is a matter that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the noting, to see what strange speculations they haue deuised in it, and how greatly they haue laboured and toyled themselues to giue vs the full signification of it. <hi>Origen,</hi>

               <hi>Hilarie</hi> saith, that this <hi>Iubilare</hi> is, <hi>vox agrestis &amp; pastoralis, a word that is borrowed out of the countrey</hi>: but how, or by what reason, he expresseth not.

               <note place="margin">Var. lib. 5.</note> that great master of words, who thus distinguisheth of this word <hi>Iubilare</hi>; that <hi>Quiritare,</hi> is <hi>Vrbanorum</hi>: but, <hi>Iubilare, Rustico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> giueth some light vnto this forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med opinion,<note place="margin">Aug. in Psal. 99.</note> by adding a familiar example to illustrate it; but yet he goeth far more cunningly about it. <hi>As country men</hi> (saith he) <hi>when they gather in their fruites, doe vse to sing for ioy, and in their song, which consisteth of words, doe intermixe certaine other voyces, which he indeed no words, but notes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriections of their inward affections; These voyces</hi> (saith he) <hi>doe properly expresse that inward passion, which we commonly doe call, by the name of Iubilation.</hi> Such voices were those med<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leys, which the <hi>Athenians</hi> vsed in their solemne sacrifices called <hi>Ostophoria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plut. in vit.

The first, being the <hi>Iubilus</hi> of their Peans and mirth-songs; the latter, the <hi>Iubilus</hi> of their <hi>Threni</hi> and mourning songs. For, <hi>Iubilus</hi> serueth for this vse also, as wel as for the former. The voice of <hi>Iubilation,</hi> is sometimes the voice of tribulation, yea and of <hi>Iugulation</hi> too, as euidently appeareth in the prophecy of <hi>Amos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos 2.2.</note> where hee threatneth the <hi>Moabites,</hi> that they shall die with the voice of <hi>shouting</hi> and <hi>Iubilation.</hi> So that this <hi>Iubilation</hi> hath not onely his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum,</hi> and <hi>Blandulum,</hi> but also his <hi>Tremulum,</hi> and <hi>Queru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> too, not only his <hi>Hypertidion,</hi> but also his <hi>Hypodorion</hi> too, as <hi>Isidore</hi> teacheth:<note place="margin">Isid lib. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> orig. cap. 19.</note> that is, not only his light and glad mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, but also his heauy and sad musicke too; though the vse thereof most frequently be in the former sense.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2680:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to mingle with their songs. <hi>Iö paean: Iö triumphe: Iö Hymen,</hi> and such like. And (to illustrate it by a domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and familiar example, because <hi>Iubilus</hi> is a domesticall and familiar country-song) such voices bee those <hi>Faiaes,</hi> which are oftentimes vsed and intermixed with our songs: wordes of no proper and determinate signification, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimations of our inward affection, which they argue to be full.

               </gap>, as it were a composition of <hi>Fa, la, la, nomine fictitio</hi>; by a word which is made to the similitude of the sound: as <hi>Balatus ouium,</hi> for the bleating of sheepe: <hi>hinnitus Equorum,</hi> for the neying of horses, and such like.

            <p>Now other of the Fathers doe take this word otherwise: affirming it to be, not <hi>Agrestis,</hi> but <hi>Militaris vox; Not a voyce which is borrowed out of the field from Farmers, but a voyce which is borrowed out of the campe from souldiers</hi>: this <hi>Iubilus</hi> beeing drawne from that Hebrew <hi>Iobel,</hi>

            <p>But yet the opinions of those Fathers, doe euen in this same point, not a little dissent. <hi>Origen</hi> saith of this <hi>Iubilation,</hi> that it is <hi>Clamor exercitus,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The second is this: that though they speake their mind as it were in a strange language, &amp; deliuered their meaning but onely in parables; yet that God so inlightned the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all heart of our King, with a bright shining beame of his heauenly wisedome, that notwithstanding all their obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their inward meaning, yet he should point downe directly vpon the very mystery of their iniquity, &amp; present- (like an <hi>Oedipus</hi>) dissolue all their <hi>Sphingas</hi>: or rather indeed (like a <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>find out all their riddles.</hi> This hath likewise oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned me,<note place="margin">1.

            <p>For the first, to wit, our deliuerance in the waters, in the time of our late Queene: let vs but cal to our remembrance that same wonderfull deliuerance which from heauen was sent vnto vs, in that wonderfull yeere of <hi>Anno.</hi> 1588. when all our seas were ouer-spread with the sailes of our enemies, and all our waters couered with the ensignes of those that came to fight against vs. A benefit whose memory ought neuer to die amongst vs, neuer to decay. For though wee now be at one with that nation, which at that time most earnestly endeauoured our destruction; it followeth not, that because they be now (as wee hope) our friends, that therefore it should not be lawfull for vs, to remember the great mercie and goodnes of God towards vs, when as we are sure, that they were our enemies.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore (I say) but call vnto our mind with what a strong desire and mighty preparation they came as then against vs, and how great a perturbation their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming then wrought in vs, <hi>terore,</hi> not <hi>panico,</hi> but <hi>Hispanico</hi>; and we shal find that we had as great a cause to vse that feareful lubilation, which is recorded in the Psalme, as euer the Iewes had in their like trepidation:<note place="margin">Psal. 124.1.</note>

            <p>In which catalogue of the Apostle, you may obserue this difference; That all other sinnes are but onely named by

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 5.</note>So that he bestoweth more cost, &amp; more paines, to make vs know this one sinne of <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> alone, then to know all the sinnes of the whole world beside.

            <p>The reason of which his paines-taking is this: Because the sinne of <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> is (in some respects) both more hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto God, and more hurtfull vnto men, then any other sinne in the whole world is. More hatefull vnto God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> noteth) <hi>Simulata sanctitas,</hi>

               <hi>two sinnes bound together,</hi> as the wise man speaketh More hurtfull vnto men, because (as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> noteth) <hi>Malum. sub specie boni celatum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chrysost. in cap. 7. Matth.</note> 
               <hi>dum non cognoscitur non cauetur: Whilest wickednesse is couered with a fained shew of godlines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it can not be descried, it cannot be declined.</hi> And such a sinne is the sinne of <hi>Hypocrisie</hi>: It is indeed true wickednes, which is couered ouer with a false shew of godlines: It is

sinne in a mysterie,<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.7.</note> as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh: It is mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vngodlinesse; and therefore can hardly be descried.</p>
            <p>For which cause the Apostle (to helpe vs in this point) hath taken great paines to describe this sinne at large, and to represent vnto vs (as it were in an Embleme) the true and perfect nature of those men, which in these latter dayes shall be resisters of the truth, disturbers of the Church, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers of the people, and opposers of themselues vnto the Prince and ciuil Magistrate, <hi>speaking euill of all those men which are in authority,</hi>

And this he performeth from the beginning of the fifth verse, vnto the end of the ninth, in fiue whole verses, as before I noted. Of which, though I purpose to insist but vpon one; yet must I pray your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, to recite them all; that so I may shew you more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainely that whole mysterie of iniquity, which the Scripture noteth vnto vs by the name of <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in this chapter descibeth it in this manner:</p>

               <hi>They haue a shew of godlines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 5.</note>

               <hi>and lead captiue simple women, laden with sinnes, and led with diuers lustes: Which are euer learning, and yet neuer able to come vnto the knowledge of the truth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">7.</note> 
               <hi>As Iannes and Iambres resisted Moses, so doe these men also resist the truth: men of corrupt mindes,</hi>

               <hi>and reprobate concerning the faith. But they shall preuaile no longer:</hi>
               <note place="margin">9.</note> 
               <hi>for their madnes shalbe euident to all men, as theirs also was.</hi> Thus farre extendeth the Apostles description, most graphicall and liuely.</p>
            <p>Which discourse of his consisteth of three partes: The first is <hi>A definition of the nature of an hypocrite,</hi> in the fifth verse of this chapter; which may be thus collected: <hi>An hypocrite is a man that hath a shew of godlines, but yet denieth the power ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> A definition so exact and so exquisite in all his partes, that if it were examined by the strictest rules of Logicke, I
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2680:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doubt whether any could be found more perfect.</p>
            <p>The second is <hi>An admonition</hi> to decline and auoyde them; giuen in the person of <hi>Timothy,</hi> vnto all the godly; in the same verse, <hi>Turne away therefore from such.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third, is <hi>A description of a double conflict,</hi> which the hypocrite entertaineth with two sortes of people: the first of them with women, in the sixth and seuenth verses: the second of them with men, in the eighth and ninth.</p>
            <p>In both which his conflicts, the Apostle setteth downe and obserueth foure things: First, who be the persons, whom the hypocrite singleth out to make his incounter with: which (if you marke them) be of contrarie disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and quality.</p>
            <p>His first conflict and incounter, is but onely with <hi>women,</hi> yea and those also such, as for witte, be <hi>Simple</hi>: for life, <hi>Sinfull</hi>: for capacity <hi>Doltish,</hi> and vtterly <hi>Ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cible.</hi> For all these <hi>Epithites,</hi> you see in this place to be giuen them: <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple women, laden with sinnes, euer learning, and yet neuer able to come vnto the knowledge of the truth.</hi> This is the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> beginning, degenerous, and abiect. But his proceedings be of a more elated and lofty spirit. For his second incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is with <hi>Men</hi>; yea and those no common men: but euen with such persons, as for authority be <hi>Princes</hi>; for vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <hi>Prophets</hi>; for integrity of life, Gods pincipallest seruants. For al this is implied in the person of <hi>Moses,</hi> whom, and whose like, those <hi>Hypocrites</hi> doe most ambitiously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to resist.</p>
            <p>So that you plainely see, how quickly such <hi>Hypocrites</hi> will take hart and courage to them: and, if at first they be backed, and but a little fleshed, though it be but by sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sinfull women, they will by and by after not sticke to incounter, euen with the greatest men, and of cheefest place, both in the Church and Common-wealth: yea and that, they count their glorie.

            <p>The second thing which the Apostle obserueth in the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> conflicts, is <hi>His manner of incountring with both those sortes of people</hi>: which is very differing and vnlike vnto it selfe. In this first conflict with women, he <hi>Creepeth</hi> like a micher: <hi>They creepe into houses.</hi> In his second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with men, hee standeth vp like a Souldier: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>They stood vp against, euen Moses himselfe.</hi> This may seeme a strange course, and almost ridiculous, that he should so stoope to women, that is so stout to men; yea and men of place too. But yet, euen herein the hypocrite declareth himselfe to be very wise, in his owne generation: imitating precisely the auncient policie of his Father the diuel; who, that he might winne <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ghrys. hom 2. de lapsa Adae.</note> he layd his battery vnto <hi>Eue,</hi> as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> obserueth, and euen so doth likewise the subtill hypocrite, his sonne: he knoweth well enough, that in gaining of the woman, he commonly gaineth two; he gaineth the husband also, especially if he be an vxorious man: and therefore he still seeketh to lay the foundation of his credit in the minds of women, that so he may be sure to haue <hi>Patrones satis dicaculos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plaut. Asim. Act. 3.50.1.</note> as the Comicke speaketh; that is, such patrones as will pratle enough in his cause, though it be without all reason: which without such sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse and pleasing behauiour, he could neuer obtaine of them. For it is commonly true, in such friends as women be, that <hi>Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit: Fauning findeth their fauour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Terent. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria. Act. 1.50.1.</note> 
               <hi>but plaine dealing their displeasure.</hi> Which as it is generally true in their sex, so is it most specially true in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2680:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their sect. For it once they doe growe to to be sectaries and humorists, they must then needs be humored, or els all is marred.<note place="margin">Hier. Epist. ad Demetriad</note> And this is the reason, why he creepeth so to women. <hi>Serpit in paucis, vt perueniat ad plurimos,</hi> as Saint <hi>Hiaerom</hi> writeth in an other case.</p>
            <p>Now on the other side, the reason why he standeth vp so stoutely against mem, yea and men of that high ranke, is to venditate himselfe vnto his complices, by seeming not to be a regarder of mens persons, be they neuer so great, but so farre to be possessed with zeale and sincerity, as euen to haue neglected the regard of his safety, by hazarding himselfe too farre in speech against them. For by this kind of rebelling against such great men, he expecteth to gaine no lesse reputation, then by pleasing the forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> simple women: who (as Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> writeth, against <hi>Ruffinus</hi>) doe <hi>Procacitatem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hier. apol 3. cont. Ruffin.</note> 
               <hi>disertitudinem, &amp; maledicere omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, bonae conscientiae signum arbitrari: They in their sottish sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, doe verily beleeue, that such their procacity, and satyricall uberty in reprouing of great persons, must needs be a sure argument of the sincerity of their consciences.</hi> And surely you shall see diuers of those painted hypocrites, who when they haue lauished beyond all bounds of reason, of sobriety and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, against both <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that is against both the Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall Magistrate, in publike places; yet can they be content to creepe and crouch most base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto very simple women, in their priuate houses: much like vnto <hi>Hercules,</hi> who abroad amongst men, was very fierce and terrible; but within dores amongst women, he would permit his mistres to combe his head with her pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The third thing that the Apostle obserueth in the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites conflicts, is the euent &amp; successe of his incountering with those persons: which is as diuers and vnlike, as his incounter it selfe was. For in his first conflict with the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2680:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
women, he preuailed against them, and led them captiue, as the words of the text shew: <hi>They lead captiue simple women, laden with sinne.</hi> But in his second conflict with those men, he is preuailed against, &amp; himselfe <hi>led captiue</hi> by the Truth, whilest it gloriously triumpheth ouer his detected false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: <hi>They shall preuaile no longer, but their madnes shall be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth and last thing which the Apostle obserueth, is the instrument and meanes whereby this successe is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in both conflicts. In his first, he preuailed against those women, because he was able to <hi>lead them captiue</hi> after him, <hi>with diuers lusts.</hi> With diuers: <hi>Gloriae pecuniarum, iactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, deliciarum, fortassis, &amp; foediores concupiscentias signat,</hi> as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> numbreth them.<note place="margin">Chrys hom. 8. in 2. Tim.</note> In his second, he is preuailed against by those men, because <hi>they are able to lay before him his madnes: Their madnes shall be euident to all men, as theirs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was.</hi> This is the true coherence of this text with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Scripture; and withall, a short <hi>Epitome</hi> of the generall doctrine of it.</p>
            <p>The particulars that we haue to consider in it, may sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily be comprized in these two short <hi>Aphorismes</hi>: First, <hi>That the truth shall alwayes be resisted:</hi> And secondly, <hi>that it shall in a certaine method and order be resisted</hi>: namely after the selfe same manner, that <hi>Moses</hi> was resisted by <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first of those positions, <hi>That the truth shall be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sisted</hi>; het Apostle heere confirmeth it by two notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances: the first of them <hi>Historicall,</hi> taken from the former times: <hi>Moses was resisted by Iannes and Iambres,</hi> two notable inchanters: the second of them Propheticall, giuen to the latter times: <hi>So shall the truth also be resisted by these men:</hi> that is, inchanting hypocrites. Which two examples the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle onely nameth, not for lacke of other store; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued succession of <hi>Romane Bishops</hi> (which is so much stood vpon) hath beene oftener interrupted, and for longer
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2680:50"/>
space, then the succession of Heretickes, and Schismaticks, and such like resisters of the truth hath beene, as appeareth by <hi>Chronologistes</hi> and writers of stories. But he setteth down these two by way of <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> putting a part for the whole, and a few examples for a many, to avoyd prolixity. In which few notwithstanding, by this his comparing of the first times with the last, and of that which hath beene, with that which shall be, this appeareth to be an irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Axiome,</hi> that <hi>The truth shall alwayes be resisted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For first, if we take the name of <hi>Truth,</hi> in his largest and most extended sense, for the generall <hi>speaking of the truth,</hi> as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth in his former vnto <hi>Timothie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim 2.7.</note> 
               <hi>I speake the truth in Christ Iesus, and lie not</hi>: the truth in this sense is so commonly resisted, that it passeth in euery mans mouth as a common prouerbe, that <hi>Veritas odium parit: The reward of speaking the truth is onely hatred.</hi> Of which vnequall measure the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth vnto the <hi>Galatians: Am I therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>become your enemie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.16.</note> 
               <hi>because I haue spoken the truth vnto you?</hi> And our Sauiour Christ likewise vnto the Iewes:<note place="margin">Iohn 8.40.</note> 
               <hi>Ye goe about to kill me, a man that haue spoken the truth vnto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, if we take the name of <hi>Truth</hi> in a particular and more restrained sense, for <hi>the truth of Gods religion,</hi> and <hi>the doctrine of his word,</hi> as our Sauiour Christ doeth in the Gospel of S <hi>Iohn;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 17.17.</note> 
               <hi>Sanctifie them with thy truth; thy word is truth</hi> (in which sense I take it to be taken in this place:) the <hi>Truth</hi> is in this sense, so naturally resisted, by all that are not the <hi>Truthes</hi> owne naturall children, that <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulian</hi> hath giuen vs this generall obseruation:<note place="margin">Tertul.

               <note place="margin">Aug. lib 4. de doct.

            </p>
            <p>Of which hypocriticall resisters of the truth, there be two diuers kinds. The first of them are such as hold the truth in small things, but resist it in greater matters, as euen now I noted: such as were false Prophets in the the time of the law, and deceitfull heretikes, in the time of the Gospell: both which the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> yoaketh together in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2680:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one sentence: <hi>As there were false Prophets amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so shall there be also false teachers amongst you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.1.</note> 
               <hi>which priuily shall bring in damnable heresies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second sort of hypocriticall resisters of the truth, doe seeme to be cleane contrarie vnto the former: for they hold the truth in greater matters, but resist it in smaller: about which (notwithstanding) they stirre vp no small stirres.<note place="margin">1.

            <p>But howsoeuer those men may seeme to please and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud themselues, in making a conscience to resist the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.5.</note> whom the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth them euen for <hi>Conscience,</hi> to obey: yet sure I am of this, that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> is so farre from allowing of this their disobedience to be conscience, that he openly pronounceth it to be indeede nothing els, but onely a true resisting of the truth: <hi>Cui nisi ipsi veritati resistitur</hi> (saith he) <hi>cum regi,</hi>

            <p>Thus you see that the truth shall surely be resisted, both by many men, and by many meanes. And therefore, no man ought to be so weak minded, as to cal the truth of the

And therefore the speaking against the truth, (though with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer such confidence and vndertaking) yet ought not either to scandalize or discourage any man, which truely and sincerely seeketh after the truth.

            </p>
            <p>Let vs now come to the second: <hi>How the truth shall be resisted</hi>: which (as you see) must be done, by a kind of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne; <hi>As Moses was resisted by Iannes and Iambres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs therefore now examine, who this <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> were, and after what manner they resisted <hi>Moses</hi>: for it is not throughly agreed vpon by all expositors.</p>
            <p>Some take this <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> to be <hi>Corah</hi> and his consorts,<note place="margin">Aret. in 2. Tim. 3.</note> who resisted the authority of <hi>Moses</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Now the manner after which they resisted him, was this: they being high minded and ambitious persons, and euen burnt vp with enuie of other mens honours and preferments, which they themselues affected, and thought themselues more worthie of, if they might be their owne Iudges, they made a great Schisme, and a dangerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion about the rule and authority of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aron</hi>: and so gathering a great companie of their owne condition

and quality, they intended flat rebellion, if God himselfe had not stayed them:<note place="margin">Num. 16 3.</note> telling <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that <hi>they tooke too much vpon them, in making themselues Lordes ouer the rest of their brethren.</hi> And adding this, for a reason; <hi>that the whole congregation, was as holy as they, and that God was with one man, as well as with an other.</hi> Yea and one of their grand exceptions was this (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> reporteth) that <hi>they did,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioseph lib. 4. Anti quit. cap. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Sacerdotium absque Populi suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>agio gerere: That they were not elected to their places by the people</hi>: though they could not be ignorant, but that they both had beene ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by God himselfe before. So that the maine ends which especially they aymed at, were principally two, <hi>Parity,</hi> and <hi>Popularity</hi>: the two deadly banes of all good order, and of ciuill policie, and the beaten pathes to confusion and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which their commotion, this is worthy the noting: that those great reformers, which sought thus to pull downe both <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as two vsurpers, sought to set vp themselues into the selfe same places, as <hi>Moses</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly obiecteth vnto them: <hi>Seemeth it a small thing</hi> (saith he vnto <hi>Corah</hi>) <hi>that God hath seuered thee from the multitude of Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>and all thy brethren, the sonnes of Leui with thee; and do ye also seeke the office of the priest?</hi> Marke, the Leuites cry out against pride and ambition of <hi>Priests</hi>; as certaine male con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Ministers doe likewise against <hi>Bishops,</hi> whom God hath made their rulers: but what is the drift and end of such their declamations? onely that which was theirs: that these being displaced, they might creepe into their roomes. So that it is not humility, but it is another pride, which driueth such men, so hotly to declame against pride. And this was the resisting of <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, if by them be meant <hi>Corah,</hi> and his mutinous companions.</p>
            <p>Let vs now looke downe into those latter times, and see whether the truth hath not beene resisted, after the selfe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2680:52"/>
same manner with vs heere at home, that it was then with him. Haue there not stood vp amongst vs, certaine ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and seditious <hi>Corahs,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> who bursting with enuie at the honour and preferment of the reuerend Fathers and Gouernours of our Church, who sit in <hi>Moses chaire,</hi> haue both by word and writing indeauoured to resist them, and thereby to extenuate, or rather indeede exterminate all their lawfull authority and iurisdiction, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of a new reformation? Haue they not told them plainely, that they take too much vpon them, in setting vp themselues aboue their fellow Ministers, who ought to be al equalles? 2. Haue they not brought for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the same allegation that those seditious persons did, that <hi>al the people of God are holy, and that euery Minister is as good as a Bishop, and ought to haue as great authority as he?</hi> Is it not one of their chiefest greeuances, that the election of Ministers is not subiected vnto the peoples suffrages, who are their great masters, and whom they seruilely obserue with all addicted obsequiousnes? Haue they not made as great and as dangerous a schisme in this owne Church, about these matters, as euer the other did in the Church of the Iewes? And (that which is the prime point of all the rest) doe not their owne writings declare, that all that rule and authority which they would take away from our reuerend prelacie, they would assume againe, and cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuay vnto themselues, vnder the name of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie</hi>? All this is more then manifest, vnto men of any reach if they haue but with halfe an eye lookt into the peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie dealing and practice of their presumptuous <hi>Consistorie,</hi> and of that enormous and vnlimited claime, which it lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto all authority, both Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill.</p>
            <p>But the same God which denied successe vnto that <hi>Schisme,</hi> hath also restrained the proceedings of this: (his name be praised for it:) for the very ground &amp; fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation whereupon these men builded their imaginarie <hi>Babel</hi> and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2680:53"/>
towers in the aire, hath begunne long agoe, to sinke vnder their feete, as it did wiih those mutiners: so that a great part of them are swallowed vp by it; and the rest are fast fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing vnto the center of <hi>Shisme:</hi> onely the cry of a few of the hindmost may still be heard amongst vs, as they are in sinking downe: which can not much longer be irksome and tedious because they be in the way to silence. And thus much for the former application of this storie, if by <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> bee vnderstood <hi>Corah</hi> and his seditious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>
            <p>Now other expositors (and those the greater number) doe expound this otherwise: affirming this <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi> to be those two Egyptian sorcerers which resisted <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in the presence of King <hi>Pharao.</hi> Now the manner after which they resisted him, was this: When as <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> were sent into Egypt to deliuer the Israelites from their slauery and bondage, they auouched to King <hi>Pharao,</hi> that <hi>The Lord God of Israel</hi> had sent them on that message; and for the proofe of their assertion, they confirmed their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage by diuers signes and strange wonders, which could not be wrought, but by the finger of God. Against whom there stood vp this <hi>Iannes</hi> &amp; <hi>Iambres</hi>: two brethren against two: and they vndertooke that all their signes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were but meerely sophisticall, and that themselues (by inchantments) could doe as great things as any they had done.</p>
            <p>In which their incounter, they seemed (in three miracles) to haue gotten a kind of conquest and victorie ouer them: In turning their roddes into serpents; in bringing in of frogges; and in changing their water into blood: all which those inchanters did, as well as the Prophets.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Hugo Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalis.</note>Vpon which accident, a learned Father hath allegorized in this manner: <hi>This threefold attempt of these sorcerers against Moses shadoweth out a threefold engine, whereby the truth shall be resisted in these latter dayes.

Secondly, by the garrulity of frogges<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and thirdly, by the cruelty of blood.</hi> By all which meanes indeede the trueth hath beene resisted, euen in these our dayes, as well as in his: as if we shall but call to mind the proceedings of those Hypocrites, which haue resisted our <hi>Moses</hi> we may well perceiue.</p>
            <p>For first, as concerning the subtilty of Serpents. The Serpents policie is this: when hee seeketh to creepe and winde himselfe into any place, he will first beginne to trie whether he can wrest in his head: which if he can effect, he will by and by draw his whole body in after it: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so those subtile and those venemous Serpents, which haue of late so stung this worthie Church of England, and like a cruell generation of Vipers, haue gnawne euen in sunder the bowels of their mother, they began their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended reformation at the first but with a few smaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>All was well a great while, but the cap and the surplice: whilest the Serpent had thrust and wrung in his head; but when he saw that this was hearkned to a while, then drew he in a greater part of his body: then was our whole <hi>Leitourgie</hi> nothing but a masse of corruption; &amp; our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion booke nothing but a <hi>Compendium</hi> of the <hi>Masse booke.</hi> When this was listned to a little, then must the whole forme of our Church gouernement be changed: for our Clergie were nothing but an <hi>Antichristian</hi> hierarchie. Heere the Serpent had wrested in almost all his whole body. When this a while had beene admitted, then by and by after was our Church counted no Church, but a companie of reprobates, and a very denne of theeues. No Church, no Word, no Sacraments amongst vs, as there ought to bee. Our Priests, they were counted but for idle Priests, and our people, they not counted as a flocke of Christs sheepe, but as a herd of silthie swine; for euen vnto this height and extremity of madnesse haue some of our reformers grown, vpon the same grounds and principles that the first refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2680:54"/>
laid downe, as their owne maine foundations.</p>
            <p>And this is the bringing in of the Serpents very taile. For the taile doth not follow the head more naturally then this conclusion followeth vpon their premisses, if they once be admitted: as they that be learned do right well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
            <p>And now I permit it vnto your owne iudgement and wisedome, to consider, whether these be not the men of whom this Apostle speaketh in the chapter next before; <hi>that their words shall spread and frette like a canker:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.17.</note> which eateth further and further, vntill it haue eaten and consumed the whole body, as ths doctrine of these men hath the bodie of our Church, vntil at last they haue brought it (as you see) to be no Church.</p>
            <p>And surely these men be indeede the very <hi>Gangrens</hi> and <hi>Cankers</hi> of our Church, which will neuer leaue fretting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they be cut off (the proper cure of that euill) though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so many medicines be applied vnto them, as we see by experience. And therefore that those fierie Serpents may be rightly charmed, it is almost necessarie, that (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isai</hi> speaketh) <hi>both head and taile of them bee cut off</hi>:<note place="margin">Isai. 9.14.</note> and that the rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that is, of the Magistrate should euen eate them vp, as it did the Serpents of <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi>; otherwise they will neuer leaue both hissing and sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>I speake not this to exasperate authority against such as be cureable, nor to stirre vp against them any cruell perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; of which they still complaine: though indeed they themselues be the true persecuting <hi>Isma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That if you had vsed the signe of the crosse (it being so inioyned you, by a Christian law) you might haue beene sure that you had not sinned: but hauing forborne it, you could not but know, that therein you great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinned.

                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn 3.4. 1.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2680:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>

This word [Dangerous] is a word of ambiguous signification, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting either that, which naturally and necessarily carrieth danger with it: or, that which onely casually, and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally may giue some occasion of danger by it. In both which senses this word Dangerous is vsed in one sentence, in the scripture:<note place="margin">Act. 19, 27.</note> where, <hi>Demetrius</hi> speaking against the doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he saith, <hi>that it is Dangerous, not only to bring the state into reproofe, but also to bring the temple of their goddesse into contempt.</hi> To the latter of these purposes the doctrine of S. <hi>Paul</hi> was naturally dangerous, yea, and necessarily too, <hi>viz:</hi> to the bringing of their temple into contempt, because hee taught, <hi>that they were no gods which were made with hands:</hi> but, to the other purpose, of reprouing the state, or, of taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the gaine of their art, it was but only accidentally dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. dist. 39 quaest. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If you take Dangerous heere in the former sense, for that which is properly and <hi>per se,</hi> as cause of danger; then yeeld I your proposition to be true, that whatsoeuer (in that sense) is dangerous vnto idolatry, it ought to bee auoided in the seruice of God. But if you take this word Dangerous in the latter sense, for that which casually and <hi>per accidens,</hi> may bee an occasion of idolatry; then I deny your proposition, as vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly false. What greater shew of danger could there

               <p>
                  <hi>Whatsoeuer is apt to breed a remembrance of that horrible idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by it in the Synagogue of Rome that is dangerous to lead vs vnto idolatry. But the signe of the crosse is such. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> In this argument, both the partes are false. First, for the proposition, there is no coherence betweene the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the succeeding part of it. Doth euery thing that breedeth a remembrance of any thing abused vnto idolatry, indanger vs to fall into the same idolatrie? then were it dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to read in the scriptures the seuerall idolatries of the Iewes, least by remembring them, we might be indangered, imitate and follow them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But you will say,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.39.</note> 
                  <hi>that these be not pictures, but scriptures, which, our Sauiour Christ himselfe commandeth vs to read.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> I answere, that this maketh nothing against our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose but, rather much for it. For, in that our Sauiour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to read them, his meaning is, that wee should reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them, which remembrance he would neuer haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs, if he had iudged it to be so dangerous for imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as you affirme it is. But, to come to your exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that kinde of remembrance, which is procured by images or pictures.<note place="margin">Numb. 33.</note> The image of that golden calfe which the <hi>Israelites</hi> worshipped, set forth in our Geneua <hi>Bibles,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but breed a remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that horrible idolatrie, which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted with it, in the wilderness, (this, you see, is a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; not a scripture) and yet, those reuerend and worthie men, who are the authors of that learned translation, of purpose set out that picture in their edition, thereby to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2680:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
imprint the remembrance of their sinne more firmely in our mindes, neuer doubting, that the remembrance of their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry would stirre vp our desire vnto like impiety. Neither yet (as I thinke) hath any man beene found, who either by view of that picture, or remembrance of their practice, hath beene led to imitate them in that vice. So that, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance doth not alwaies breed a liking of the thing so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, but, oftentimes, a lothing.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Cic. Epist. 15. Bruto.</note>There be <hi>monumenta odij,</hi> as well as <hi>Amoris.</hi> To goe no further for instance, but to the signe of the crosse: doe wee not see by experience, that our remembring how the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists haue abused it, hath stirred vp in many men detes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it? whereby, the hatred vp of their abuse hath so blinded their reason, as to breede an abhorring euen of the lawfull vse of it. Which euidently sheweth, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table incohaerence of your <hi>Maior</hi> proposition, and that wee may well remember idolatry, without any danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into it.</p>
               <p>Now, for your assumption: <hi>That the signe of the crosse is apt to breed a remembrance of the horrible idolatry, which was committed by it, in the Synagogue of Rome.</hi> If that wee freely granted, yet were not the cause preiudiced: your <hi>Maior</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so weakely founded.</p>
               <p>For, what if it gaue vs occasion to remember that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent idolatry, which by remembring, wee abhorre: doth this make it vnlawfull? or doth it not rather make it good, and profitable? But I see no cause at all why wee should yeeld you so much. For, I pray you, why should our crosse be thought to bee more apt, to breed a remembrance of Popish idolatry, then our Communion-bread is, to breed a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Popish <hi>Artolatrie</hi>? Or, why should it be thought more powerfull to leade vs vnto the one, then this is, to lead vs vnto the other? Especially, the bread being a materiall &amp; a sensible body, and remayning (for some good space) an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the eye, whereby it may more easily suggest vnto the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2680:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
minde how it hath in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church bene abused: whereas the crosse, being an immateriall and a vanishing signe, in one and the same moment being both bred, and dead, is neither so fit to instruct, not so strong to incite vs as the bread is. And yet I do not know, nor euer haue heard, that any man (not being before a Papist) hath by the sight of our bread, bene induced to desire to returne vnto Popery. So little colour of probability is there, that euery one which seeth a crosse made in our baptisme, should by and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that former idolatry, which (happily) he neuer saw; yea &amp; not onely remember it but also desire to returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it;<note place="margin">Psal. 14.5. Aug: Epist. 118. ad Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar. cap. 2.</note> there is no likelyhood in this fancy. <hi>But it is indeed a feare, whereas no feare is, as the Psalmist speaketh. Yea it is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiosa timiditas, as Saint Augustin truly censureth it: it is indeed to feare superstition, with a superstitious feare.</hi> Now if our crosse be no more apt to reuiue the remembrance of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, then our bread is, I would know by what rule, the one being receiued, the other should be reiected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OB.</hi> Perhaps you will say, <hi>that Bread in the supper is Christs owne ordinance, but the crosse is not so,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The brazen serpent was Gods owne ordinance, &amp; yet it being abused to idolatry, was iustly abolished. So that if your vrging of this instance be fit,<note place="margin">Page 40.</note> which else where you stand so much vpon, the bread can haue no protection by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Christs</hi> ordinance, because it hath also bene abused to idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OB. That bread which we vse, was neuer so abused,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> No more was that crosse which we vse, euer so abused. But yet if your reason be good, that what-souer renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the remembrance of the old idolatry, is dangerous to occasion a relapse vnto it, and therefore to be remoued from the seruice of God; it holdeth against bread, as well as against the crosse. For that is as dangerous to renue the remembrance of former idolatry, as the crosse is. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is but a needlesse feare, that there should bee
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2680:65"/>
any such danger in it. For first, why should the seeing of a crosse made, rather mooue vs to idolatry, then the hearing of an idoll named? may not the reading of the Lords praier, or of the angelicall salutation, put men in mind as well of their <hi>Pater noster,</hi> and their <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> and of that old superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they vsed in both these, as the crosse can of that which they vsed in it? yet, I thinke, you will not thinke it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull (for this supposed danger) either to read the one, or to say the other: neither doe I thinke it so, to vse the third. For, secondly I demand, who those persons bee, vnto whom this pretended danger can bee intended? are they Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants? or, bee they Papists? The greatest part of Protestants are such, as (for their age) could neuer see or know how the crosse was abused amongst the Papists, yea and of those there is a great part, so faire from danger of Poperie, by the vse of this ceremonie, that they are in great danger of an other extremity, condemning the lawfull vse, for the vnlawfull abuse, so that none of them is so slenderly grounded, as by such a weake meanes to bee remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The other sort of Protestants, which are more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and so by their age might happily remember it, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene weaned this forty sixe yeares from it, and so long trained vp in an other vse of it, there is no shewe of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, that such men should (now on the sudaine) bee so offended at it, as to quit and abandon their religion for it.</p>
               <p>Now for the Papists, they be such as seldome do come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to praiers, neuer to our Sacraments, by their owne goodwil: so that, there is small danger of doing them any harme. But if any of them should happen to bee present at our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, they may plainely see our crosse, both by the simple vse of the signe, and by the wordes added for exposition of the signe, to bee so vindicated and cleered from their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, as there is farre greater danger to harden them in their opinion by our so distant a difference from them,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2680:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then by our so neere coniunction with them. Finally, the folly and vanity of this needelesse feare appeareth in this point, that in all the space of this sixe and forty yeares, wherein the crosse hath beene vsed amongst vs, there can not bee giuen so much as one instance, of either any Papist to haue beene confirmed in his Popery, or of any Protestant to haue beene conuerted vnto Popery, by seeing the signe of the crosse, as wee vse it. Some examples may bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the contemners of the crosse, whome God hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to fall from that error in horrible heresies, as into <hi>Donatisme</hi> and <hi>Brownisme,</hi> but none at all of the obseruers of the crosse, that thereby haue beene brought to fall into <hi>Papisme.</hi> And indeed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>First therefore as concerning your proposition, I answere. That no idoll, continuing in the nature of an idoll, may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be vsed in the seruice of God: but if that condition and nature be altered (as it is in our crosse) then may it lawfully enough bee vsed, yea though it were the same <hi>indiuiduum</hi> which before was abused.<note place="margin">Iosh. 6.19.</note> Example whereof of wee haue in the metalls of <hi>Hierico,</hi> which were wholely reserued for the vse of the tabernacle, notwithstanding their abuse in that idolatrous citty: wherein it is more then probable, that no little part of them was molten into idols.

                  <hi>Resp.</hi> I answere, that this place of Saint <hi>Iohn to keepe our selues from idols,</hi> is a <hi>Metonimie</hi> of that subiect, and implyeth no more, but to keepe vs from idolatry, with out which, an idoll (in it selfe) is nothing, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs. To this exposition I am induced by these reasons.</p>
               <p>First, because I take it to bee the peculier opinion of the Mahometanes to condemne all vsed of images simply, as you seeme to do by pressing this place.

                  <hi>for I am the Lord thy God.</hi> So that this place of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in forbidding idols, forbiddeth not simply all kinde of vse of them, but onely that religious vse, when wee adore and worship them. For this place of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> is paralleled by an other in the booke of <hi>Exodus</hi>:<note place="margin">Exod. 23.13.</note> where wee are forbidden, so much as to name or to mention other Gods. Which place must needs be restrained with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that it forbiddeth vs but onely, <hi>Honoris causa no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minare</hi>: or else the very scriptures should be contrary to them-selues. For they not onely name, but also preserue and keep in record the names of diuers heathen gods. <hi>Asta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth</hi> and <hi>Milcom</hi> are named in the booke of kings:<note place="margin">1.

VVhich it is knowne wee do not vnto the crosse. So that if it were graunted that the crosse were an idoll, yet (as long as wee do not worship it) it is not by that place of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> condemned.</p>
               <p>But to come now to the <hi>Assumption</hi> of your argument: you say in it that our crosse is an <hi>Idoll</hi>: and you proue it by three instances. <hi>First that the Papists doe thinke it a defense against the diu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:2680:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>Of which three proofes, because the last doth indeed proue it to be (in some sense) an idoll; I will take none exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the two first though they be insufficient,<note place="margin">Pag. 66.</note> but wil grant that (to the Papists) it is no better then an idol. But yet, I pray you note, how ill these points hang togither. The Papists a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and worship their crosse. <hi>ergo</hi> our crosse is a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> idol. How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cohaerent is this? Can their worship of their crosse make our crosse an idol, which is not worshipped? How then could our consciences be assured of the lawfull vse of any thing which we vse, when as wee are not sure, whether the same thing, in some other place, be not made an idoll? Suppose that at our communion there should come in some temporizing Papist, who seeing the communion bread vpon the table, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly adore it, afte the idolatrous manner of the Romish church, doth his making of that bread an idol, pollute the vse of it vnto the Godly receiuers? if yea, then can we neuer bee assured, whither that which we receiue be Christs body, or an idol: because, there may be alwaies some such disguised Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists amongst vs, if no: why shold their adoration of an other crosse corrupt ours, which is not the same, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as his adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bread, which is none other but the same that wee receiue, corrupts it not? that crosse which they adore, is not the same which wee make in our baptisme: and that crosse which we make, is not the same, that they adore: &amp; therfore I do not see, by what rule, either of true religion, or, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reason, the one should be condemned for the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. But yet seeing they make though not the same indiuidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all crosse (which wee vse) yet the same species of crossing an idoll, we ought to forbeare the vse of a thing so much abused, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it beeing none ordinance of God, but onely a meere inuention of man.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The same particular crosse which wee make, the Papists neither doe, nor can abuse: and much lesse can they the whole <hi>Species</hi> of crossing, whereof a part remaineth with vs, as well as with them: if wee should grant, that our crosse

But if that were granted;<note place="margin">Page. 63.</note> then all which the Papists can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly abuse, is onely so much of the <hi>Species</hi> of crossing, as they haue in their owne possession. Now, for the abuse which is offered vnto some <hi>Indiuidua</hi> of any <hi>Species,</hi> why the other <hi>indiuidua</hi> of the same <hi>species</hi> (though not so abused) should bee condemned, there is neither right nor reason: no more then if wee should condemne the whole action of kneeling, beecause idolaters do vse to kneele vnto their idols.</p>

                  <hi>Beza</hi> yealdeth not thus much: for hee thinketh it not necessary that the same altar which hath beene abused vnto popish idolatry, should of necessity be altered, but that it may serue (as well as a table) for the vse of the sacrament. So that he is so far from thinking that the abuse of one <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiduum</hi> corrupteth the whole <hi>Species,</hi> that he thinketh not the same <hi>Indiuiduum</hi> it selfe to remaine corrupted, when the abuse thereof is remoued, as it is in our crosse; which yet is not the same with the <hi>Papists</hi> crosse, neither <hi>numero,</hi> nor <hi>Specie,</hi>

And he thinketh that by the helpe of such images, the text it selfe may bee illustrated and better vnderstood. The translators of our <hi>Geneua</hi> bible goe yet further, for they in the 33. cap: of <hi>Numbers</hi> in one page set downe, the image not onely of the brazen serpent, (now after it hath bene abused) but also of the <hi>Isralites</hi> gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den calfe which was neuer well vsed. Which they would neuer haue done, if they had beene perswaded that the abuse which was offered to one of these images, had so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and tainted the whole <hi>Species,</hi> that none other of them, could for euer after haue any lawfull vse. Yea and all those images they place euen in the Bible, whereby they must needs intend to haue some vse of them in the seruice of God. Let these examples be well considered and then giue vs a reason, how they may lawfully set downe an image of that same idoll which hath bene abused, and not wee as lawfully vse that signe of the crosse which hath neuer beene abused.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>Now for your second reason in this fourth obiection, to witte, that the signe of the crosse is but an inuention of man, and that therefore (it hauing beene abused vnto idolatry) may not be vsed in the seruice of God, that is a reason compacted of many errours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For first (as concerning your <hi>Antecedent</hi>) I thinke that wee may vppon better ground affirme, that the vse of the crosse is as an Apostolicall tradition, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n you, that is but meerely an humain inuention. For first, diuers of the fathers expresly affirme so of it: as namely <hi>Tertullian.

                  <note place="margin">Page: 180.</note> yet it hath both <hi>Traditionem au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctricem,</hi> and <hi>consuetudinem confirmatricem.</hi> So likewise <hi>Basil

                     </gap>. p. 20</note> He ascribeth as great authority to the Apostolicall traditions, as he doth vnto the Apostolicall writings, and reckoneth for the chiefest of them, the signe of the crosse.<note place="margin">Pag. 324.</note> So likewise <hi>Damascene lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de orthodoxa fide. cap.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the practise of the whole Catholike church (which hath euer from the time of the very Apostles had this ceremonie in vse) doth giue great strength vnto the iudgement of the fore-named Fathers.<note place="margin">August. Epist 118. ad Ianu.</note> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that <hi>whatsoeuer is generally obserued of all churches</hi> (as the vse of the crosse hath beene) that <hi>assuredly is either an Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call tradition, or at the least, the Canon of some generall counsell.</hi> And <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertul. lib. de coron. cap. 4.</note> from the generall obseruation proueth, that it is an Apostolicall tradition. <hi>Idonea testis probatae traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, est perseuerantia obseruationis</hi>: for otherwise it is not likely, that all churches would so generally haue consented in this, more then in any other ceremonie, as it appeareth they did by Saint <hi>Basils</hi> testimonie,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> who calleth this signing with the crosse, both <hi>primam</hi> and <hi>vulgatissimam traditionum.</hi> Thirdly, that great reuerence, and high estimation, which all the Fathers, from the first to the last, haue had of this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie (though all of them doe not expresly call it an Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolicall tradition) must needs argue that they thought it to haue a better institution, then to be meerely and simply an humaine inuention. Finally, if it be but an humaine inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let vs know (I pray you) the first inuenter of it, and when it was first decreed, and how it came so soone to bee so generally obserued. Which if you cannot shew vs, I thinke that wee may with greater probabilitie, esteeme it to be an Apostolicall tradition (the fore-alledged reasons giuing strength to our coniecture) then you can (without the like) call it a mans inuention.</p>
               <p>Now for your consequent, (if your antecedent were granted) yet might that with great reason be denyed. For first, admit that this signing with the crosse were indeed no

                  <note place="margin">Cic. lib. 3. de nat. deor.</note> they may afterward be vsed in the seruice of God, as <hi>Gedions</hi> Oxe was, which being conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated as a sacrifice for <hi>Baal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iud. 6.25.26.</note> yet afterwards was offered vp vnto God: and why may not in like sort, the decent and orderly ceremonies of the Church, though abused in one place, yet in an other be restored vnto their right vse? espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the abuse which is offered in ceremonies, being but only <hi>secunda idolatria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertul. lib. de coron. cap. 10</note> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> noteth, but <hi>a second and inferiour degree of idolatry</hi>: whereas that which is offered in the creatures, is often-times the principall: they beeing honored for very Gods. Where finde you Gods creatures (in this case of idolatry) to haue any greater priuiledge then the Churches ceremonies: If they, after they haue beene made idols in the highest degree, may yet haue their vse in the seruice of God, why may not the other too, which can be made idols but in an inferiour degree? If the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie with creatures, do not destroy the vse of the same <hi>indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why should the idolatry of ceremonies (which is a lesse abuse) destroy the vse of all the whole <hi>species</hi>? the translators of our <hi>Geneua</hi> Bible, in setting out the picture of the golden Calfe, insinuate these two things. First, that the abuse offered to one idol of that kind (though it were idolatry in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree) yet hath not so corrupted the whole <hi>species</hi> of it, but that other may both lawfully and profitably bee vsed. Secondly, that though that idols were but a mans inuention, &amp; had bin so notably abused vnto idolatry, yet, that it is not debarred, from helping vs euen in the seruice of God: for that must needs be the end of their figuring it in that booke.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2680:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Beza</hi> (as you heard before) goeth further:<note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> for hee allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the very same alter, which hath beene the instrument of an idolatrous sacrifice, to be vsed as an instrument of our christian Sacrament. In which iudgement, diuers martyrs in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time concurred, who were content to vse the same Surplices and Chalices,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 1843.</note> which had beene abused in adolatrous masses.<note place="margin">Sozomen. hist. lib. 7. cap. 15.</note> The like did the christians in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue church: they conuerted the same temples into the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God, which had beene consecrated to the seruice of abhominable idols; yet are both idolatrous Temples and Alters mans owne meere inuentions, and not Gods ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures or ordinances. So that, though our crosse were the same which was abused, and but a mans inuention, yet might it by these examples be defended.</p>
               <p>But secondly, I answere vnto your consequent; That if it were granted, that the signe of the crosse were but a mans inuention; yet can it not bee granted with any truth, that the protestants crosse is the same, which the Papists haue abused; ours differing from theirs, both in the <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>in the ends</hi> of the action: two very great and materiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.

Let vs descend lower vnto the primatiue Church. In it these significant ceremonies were generally obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. First, in baptisme they were dipped three times into the water. Secondly, they were anoynted with oile. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they were signed with the signe of the crosse. And fourthly, they were clothed with white garments. All these ceremonies are recorded by <hi>Dionisius Areopagita</hi> in his booke of <hi>Ecclesiasticall hierarchie.</hi> The significations of all which ceremonies he afterwards expoundeth,<note place="margin">Dyonis: lib: de eccles: hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarch: cap. 3.</note> in the <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation</hi> annexed vnto that chapter. Yea and diuers other fathers, both of diuers Churches, and of differing ages, in their writings declare, that not onely these ceremonies were vntil their times continued, but also their significations recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. First for that threefold dipping into the water, S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> saith that it was done to signifie,<note place="margin">Hier: lib: 2. in Ephes:</note> that the sacrament was ministred in the name of the whole trinity.

they lost by sinning. That they prayed standing, vpon the Sunday, to signifie, that as that day was the day of Christs resurrection, so they were risen againe with Christ, and now sought those things which are aboue: with diuers other like; reckoned vp in that place, which he affirmeth to be apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call traditions.</p>
               <p>All which examples doe euidently declare the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the primitiue Church; that both it had power to ordaine ceremonies, and also to giue them their significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and consequently, the want of iudgement in those men, which affirme, that neither the Church hath any such power, nor histories affoord any such example. Herevnto I may adde the opinion of the very <hi>Reformers</hi> themselues, who preferre sitting before kneeling at the communion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>sitting betokeneth rest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whitgift. pag. 599.</note> 
                  <hi>and an end of all legall ceremonies in Iesus Christ</hi>: which reason they would neuer haue allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, if they had thought that the Church had had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ordaine significant ceremonies and rites. Therefore the Church doth not tyrannize ouer mens consciences, in ordaining significant rites and ceremonies; but these men would tyrannize ouer the Church, who would spoile her of that her lawfull authoritie; especially they not being able to produce any Scripture, whereby shee is abridged of that power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. But though the Church should haue power to ordaine rites and ceremonies for priuate order in it selfe; yet hath it no power to appoint any out-ward signe, to bee a note of our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall profession, but that is GODS owne peculiar prerogatiue.</hi> Gen 17 7.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> That the Church hath authority in greater matters, then either in adding significations to ceremonies, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward notes to our profession, very many instances doe nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly declare. First, that whereas Christ instituted his supper at the time of supper, it hath changed that time from the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the morning, which is an altering (in circumstance)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2680:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Christs owne institution. Secondly, whereas the Apostles decreed in a generall councell, that Christians should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from bloud and from stranglers, that hath it likewise altered, and so cancelled an Apostolicall constitution. The like authority they shewed in altering the ancient day of the Sabboth, and administring Baptisme vnto children: in this, they wanting the commandement of Christ; in that, they changing the commandement of God. From which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances we may argue, as from the greater to the lesse, That if they erred not in those fore-named ordinances, much lesse haue they erred in adding significations vnto their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: &amp; by the same reason, why hath not the church as great a power to adde outward signes vnto our profession, as to ordaine other ceremonies, concerning our Ecclesiasticall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration? Is the signe the lesse lawfull, because it is a signe of our profession? Why then is none at all lawfull: for not onely this signe of the crosse,<note place="margin">Aquin. 1.2. Quaest. 103. Art. 4 c.</note> but also all other Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall ceremonies (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> teacheth vs) are signes of our profession.

The Christians likewise in the primitiue Church, euer from the time of the very Apostles, haue vsed this same ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the crosse which is now in question, as a marke and a signe of their profession, and yet did neuer either they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues thinke it, or the greatest aduersaries that they had, impute it, as a presumption and incroching against Gods owne prerogatiue,<note place="margin">Basil lib. de Spiritu sanct. cap. 27.</note> as Saint <hi>Basil</hi> obserueth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Or (if it be weake) it is weake against vs, as well as against them. For the vse of it now, is no more an incrochment vppon Gods owne prerogatiue, then it was in that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. But you proue by that place</hi> Gen: 17.7.11. <hi>that God onely hath power to adde signes vnto his couenant: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, that they which adde any such signes, presume to enter vppon Gods owne prerogatiue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> But this proofe which you alledge, hath two great faults in it First, that it is not <hi>ad idem</hi>: and secondly, that it is not concludent in the cause: not <hi>ad idem,</hi> thus. To proue that the Church may not adde any ceremoniall signe vnto our profession, you produce a place of scripture, which spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth onely of sacramentall signes. It is circumcision (which was a sacramentall signe) that God in that place did adde vnto his couenant. Such signes I do yeald that God onely may institute. But as for the crosse, wee make it not a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but onely a ceremonie. And wee may truly say of it,<note place="margin">Aug: 119. ad Ianuar:</note> as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doth of the birth day of <hi>Christ, Non in sacramento celebratur, sed tantum in memoriam reuocatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if your proofe were <hi>ad idem,</hi> and proper to the purpose, yet is it inconcludent. For, by what rule of reason can this consequent follow, <hi>God added a sacramentall signe vnto his couenant. Ergo, man may not adde a ceremoniall signe?</hi> if God added signes vnto his couenant to assure vs of his faithfull performance of his part, why may not wee adde signes vnto our couenant, to assure him of our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full performance of our part?<note place="margin">Tertul. lib. de coron. cap. 4.</note>

               <p>Now, for your <hi>Minor: That our profession of Christ is the couenant of God</hi>: it may (in some sense) bee allowed to bee true, although (as you know) the couenant betweene God and man doth passe in some-what an other forme.<note place="margin">Ier. 11.4.</note> viz. <hi>That he should be our God, and we should be his people,</hi> where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet expoundeth our part of the couenant, to bee the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obeying of him, and not the outward professing of him. As for faith &amp; confession, which you alledge out of the <hi>Rom.</hi> cap. 10.9. to be the whole sum of our profession, and of our part of the couenant with God, that is not true; they bee partes indeede of our couenant with God, but our whole part they be not; vnlesse you take both faith &amp; confession in a very large signification; faith not only for beleeuing with the heart, but also for working with the hand; And confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, not onely for the speeches of the tongue, but also for the gestures and behauiours of the body. By which meanes (though not there <hi>nominatim</hi> expressed) yet our God ought to bee serued, and the truth both of our faith and confession to be testified.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.20.

So, though the sacrament of baptisme, do both fully and richly declare our duty, yet is not our religious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to be condemned, if (for our better remembrance) this ceremony be super-added.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>But you seeme to insinuate, that the sacrament of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme doth testifie sufficiently that wee bee Christians, and that therefore this other testification by the crosse is superfluous: and being added, doth seeme to import some defect in baptisme to that purpose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere, first, for the cleering of our action. That wee adde not the signe of the crosse vnto baptisme, as though the sacrament were either vnperfect or vnsufficient without it, to our regeneration, in Iesus Christ: but we annex it as onely a significant signe, to testifie, what new profession (by our baptisme) wee are entered. So that, wee make not our crosse either a part of the sacrament, or any neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary supplement vnto it, to giue it any strength which it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2680:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath not of it selfe: but we adde it, as onely a circumstantiall complement, for illustration sake, to notifie vnto the world, that wee honour our new profession of Christianity by that very signe, which al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> (that be not Christians) thinke the great dishonour of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly I answere, that our adding of this signe vnto baptisme, doth neither argue it to be sufficient, nor is argued by it to bee superfluous. God added the new testament vnto the old, for our more plaine instruction: (the matter of both the testaments is the same) doth either this argue that to bee <hi>vnperfect,</hi>

rather indeed so <hi>transcendent,</hi> hath this sinne of idolatry bin.

which points are far otherwise in the signe of the crosse, as we see by experience. And therefore no cause, why for that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of it which hath beene in an other Church, and is long agoe reformed in our Church, so ancient a ceremony should now be abolished.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>But you strengthen your proposition with two fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The one is a sentence of the Cannon law, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth vnto vs the abolitions of things abused vnto superstition.

               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> First, for that iudgement of the Canon law, if wee were of some mens disposition, we might allow it for a good reason, that the rule could not be good, because it is fetched out of the Canon-law, &amp; was no better but a Popes-decree.

               <p>In which sentence there be two things to be considered of vs. The first is the quality of the persons of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he speaketh: the second, his qualified maner of speaking. For the persons heere ment by the name of <hi>Posterity,</hi> it must needs be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of men in authority, &amp; not of any priuate persons. The words of the decree are most plaine &amp; pregnant. <hi>These ought to be of great authority in the church.</hi> Why? that, <hi>if things wel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun do degenerate into euill, by that great authority they may bee destroyed,</hi> whereby hee implyeth, that hee which will do the worke of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> in destroying things abused, he ought to haue the authority of <hi>Ezechias.</hi> Otherwise, if therbe a dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the agents, there wil certainly follow a disparity in the actions. For, if that clause in the latter end of the decree <hi>cum magna authoritate a posteris destruantur,</hi> bee so construed (as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2680:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some men haue wrested it) that the very example of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi> in destroying the brazen serpent) (which before he had alledged) doth giue great authority vnto euery other man, to do the like; it is not onely a manifest peruerting of the <hi>Gramatical</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>struction, but would also proue the subuerting of all ciuill constitutions. For what authority doth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of magistrates, (which orderly repeale inconuenient lawes), giue vnto priuate men, disorderly to breake them, whilst they stand in force? Or how doth the action of the Magistrate, who hath his authority inuested in himselfe, as a publike person authorize priuate men to do the same worke, by their voluntary immitation?

And hee commendeth his iudgment to bee very sound,<note place="margin">Io. Wolph. in lib. 2.

And he strenghneth his iudgment by the example of <hi>Gedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> who all the while that he was a priuate man, he indured the Alter &amp; the groue of <hi>Baal,</hi> &amp; laid no hand to pull downe that idolatry, but when he once was called vnto the magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracie, &amp; furnished thereby with lawfull authority, then hee did the deed,<note place="margin">Iudg: 6.25.26.</note> &amp; he did it throughly. So that the magistrate
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2680:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beeing the person, whome the decree vnderstandeth by the name of posterity, his example can bee no warrant for any man to do the like, if he lacke the like authority. Now for the qualification of the speech, which was the 2. thing to bee considered in the law: the forme of speech which it vseth, is but onely permissiue, granting a liberty, and not preceptiue, imposing a necessity, leauing place for the Magistrate, with aduisement to consider, whether the abuse be such, as doth necessarily require such an vtter destruction. The law saith, <hi>That posterity may destroy them. You say that posterity must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them.</hi> From <hi>May,</hi> to <hi>Must,</hi> is no good consequence. That Logike rule (as you know) is growne almost into a prouerbe. <hi>A posse ad esse non valet argumentum</hi>: we yeeld that posterity may destroy them, if the abuse can hardly bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: &amp; that it must destroy them, if it can not be reformed at all. But neither of these can bee said of the crosse, whose abuses wee haue reformed with very great facility, and yet not destroyed the right and true vse of it, as experience sheweth plainly. And therefore those men, which match our crosse with the brazen serpent &amp; thinke it as necessary to bee destroyed as that, they truly fall into that censure of <hi>Caluin,</hi>

For, if he destroyed the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen serpent, being</hi> GODS <hi>owne ordinance, because it was ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrously abused: then much more ought wee to abolish the crosse, which is but mans inuention, it hauing bene likewise idolatrously abused.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> This example of <hi>Ezechias</hi> is very much stood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore it would be the more narrowly examined, Your argument is inforced <hi>A maiori ad Minus</hi> and it may be framed thus. Ezechias <hi>spared not the ordinance of</hi> GOD, <hi>but destroyed it, because it had beene abused. Ergo,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2680:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much lesse ought wee to spare the ordinance of man but destroy it, if it haue bene likewise abused.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, that your <hi>Antecedent,</hi> which is the ground of your argument, is not true. <hi>Ezechias</hi> in destroying the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen serpent, did not therein destroy the ordinance of GOD. For,<note place="margin">Numb: 21.8.</note> in the brazen serpent there be things to be considered: <hi>Viz:</hi> the first erection, for the healing of the people: and the preseruation, for the remembrance of that benifit. The first erection was indeed the ordinance and iniunction of GOD himselfe: but the preseruation was the meere inuention of man, It issuing from the good intent of the people, without any warrant or commandement from GOD. Now, that worke beeing finished in the wildernes; for which GOD erected it; that which <hi>Ezechias</hi> destroyed, was but onely mans inuention, to witt the preseruation of it. So that if the crosse be but onely an humane inuention, and not Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall tradition, yet euen so, that thing in the serpent which <hi>Ezechias</hi> destroyed, was no better. And therefore the ground of your argument <hi>A maiori</hi> faileth, it beeing rather a false presumption, then a true position.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>But happily you will say, that the brazen serpent had yet a further vse ordained by GOD: namely, to be a figure of our sauiour CHRIST; And so ought to haue continued vnto his coming, if for that abuse it had not iustly beene cut off.</hi>
               </p>

                  <note place="margin">2.

               <p>The third difference is taken, from the nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the abuse. Hee tooke away that idoll, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, contrary vnto law; you would take away that crosse which is rightly vsed, and the vse thereof established by law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:2680:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>The fourth difference is taken, from the degree and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the abuse. He tooke away that idoll which was abused in the highest degree, being idolatrously worshipped for a false God. For that same people refused to burne their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense vnto God, [2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.7.] which notwithstanding of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it most profusely vnto that idoll. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 18.4. But you would take away that crosse, which was neuer yet worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as a false God by any, but hath beene vsed in all <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Churches, as a lawfull and lawdable ceremonie, in the worship of the true God.</p>
               <p>The fift difference is taken from the continuance of the abuse: He tooke away that idoll whose abuse still remained; but you would take away that crosse, whose abuse hath long ago bin remoued, &amp; whose right vse is now againe restored.</p>
               <p>The sixt difference is taken from the certainty of the abuse: He tooke away that idoll, which vpon certaine knowledge, he saw to be idolatrously abused: but you would take away that crosse, which (onely vpon an vncertaine surmise) you do imagine may possibly bee abused, <hi>Scilicet,</hi> if some Papist should chance to come in amongst vs in the very nick, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest it is in vsing.</p>
               <p>The seauenth difference is taken from the difficulty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing the former abuse. Hee tooke away that idoll, whose idolatry could hardly bee reformed, so long as the sensible obiect of their abuse remained: but you would take away that crosse, which can hardly be abused; the obiect of abuse is so presently vanished: as euen <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe noteth in an other like instance.<note place="margin">lib. 1. Instit. cap. 11. sect. 3.</note> He disputeth, that the sodaine appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Holy-ghost in the forme of a Doue could not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister iust matter of adoring that resemblance, because it was of so short continuance, being but <hi>vnius momenti Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> which may much more truly bee said of the crosse, that it is indeed but <hi>vnius momenti symbolum,</hi> it appearing and perishing in one and the same moment. And therefore if his appearing in the shape and forme of a liuing body, was
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2680:83"/>
so free from danger, because it was so short: then much more is the crosse, whose forme is lesse dangerous, vanishing more sodaine, and appearing of lesse continuance.</p>
               <p>Therefore the crosse and the brazen serpent being equall in this point, that both of them are but humaine inuentions, but vnequall in so many other points of farre greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: in the obiect, in the subiect, in the quality, in the quantity, in the continuance, and in the certainty of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse: and againe, in the difficulty of reforming the same; that these two things, whose offence is so vnequall, should admit an equality of punishment, is against all rules, both of equity and iudgement.</p>

               <p>This tenth obiection may be thus collected: <hi>All religious images are forbidden vnto vs in the second commandement. But the signe of the crosse is a religious image:</hi> Ergo; <hi>It is forbidden in the second commandement.</hi> For your <hi>Maior</hi> proposition: if by <hi>religious images</hi> you had vnderstood onely such as are made to bee religiously adored, wee should quickly haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed: but you taking the name of [<hi>Religious</hi>] in a sense of such enormous largenesse, <hi>viz.</hi> for any thing, that any way, may helpe vs in religion, as appeareth in the exposition of your <hi>Minor</hi>; I must needs require some better reason then your owne coniecturall conceipt, that all such images are in that commandement forbidden: Otherwise, your proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I deny as false; and that for these reasons: First, because I dare not condemne, all those famous and renowned chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which euen from <hi>Christs</hi> time vnto ours, haue vsed the crosse, to haue beene idolatrous; nor those ancient, learned, and godly Fathers, which haue thought and taught so reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of it, to haue beene idolaters: which absurdity must needs follow, if either this obiection, or your fourth, haue any waight in them. Secondly, because I finde the whole streame of expositors to bee against you: amongst whom I haue giuen instance both in <hi>Caluine</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> and of our owne translators of the <hi>Geneua</hi> Bible. pag. 21. Whose instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I wish you more deepely to consider of, and how farre
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2680:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their iudgement differeth from your proposition. Thirdly I finde the practise of God himselfe to be against you in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the <hi>Cherubines</hi> to bee placed in the Tabernacle; which (as Bishop <hi>Babbington</hi> truly collecteth) must needes make GOD contrary vnto himselfe,<note place="margin">Babbing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the second comman.</note> if all religious images were so simply forbidden in the second commandement, as you affirme in your proposition. Fourthly (to come to our owne particular instance) if the signe of the crosse were sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply forbidden in the second commandement, then were not only Gods practise contrary to his precept, but also one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept were contrary to another. For he commandeth expresly in the prophecie of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 9.4.</note> to marke certaine men in the fore-head with the signe of the crosse, which there he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Signum Tau</hi>; which being by <hi>Character</hi> expressed (as there it is commanded) hath none other forme then the signe of the crosse,<note place="margin">Hier. in Ezec.</note> as S, <hi>Hierom</hi> expresly expoundeth that place: <hi>Thau litera, crucis haebet similitudinem, quae in Christianorum frontibus pingitur.</hi> Therefore this second commandement, doth neither particularly forbid the signe of the crosse, nor generally all kinds of religious images, but onely, <hi>in ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one ad cultum</hi>: to which purpose the crosse is not vsed in our Church, where (as you know) it is not worshipped.</p>
               <p>Now for your <hi>Minor,</hi> that <hi>our crosse is a religious image:</hi> that is more false then the former was. An image, our crosse cannot be called, but in a very constrained sence: seeing that, in making it, we do not intend, either to expresse, or to honor that materiall crosse, wherevpon our Sauiour suffered (whose image you would insinuate that signe to be) but onely to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie by that outward signe, that we are not ashamed of the sufferings of <hi>Christ.</hi> As for the outward scheme &amp; represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the crosse, it more properly may be called a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then an image, as I shewed you before in the letter <hi>Tau,</hi> whose character is the perfect forme of the crosse, as is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the <hi>Romane</hi> T. as <hi>Tertullian</hi> obserueth;<note place="margin">Tertul. lib. 3. cont. Marcion. cap. 22.</note> seeing that we referre it, not <hi>eiconically</hi> to represent the crosse of Christ, but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2680:85"/>
                  <hi>Symbolically</hi> to represent his passion, by that character. Now, that characters and images bee of two diuerse natures, the <hi>Turkes</hi> plainly shew vs, who are most superstitious in auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of images, &amp; yet they do willingly admit of characters, as appeareth in their coines. So that the crosse can no more propperly be called an image, then the letter T. can. Yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the Papists themselues deny it to bee an image, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by their distinguishing of <hi>imago crucis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bellarm. de imagin lib. 2. cap. 28.29.</note> from <hi>signum cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> which is much more true in vs, whose signe of the crosse, is made rather to represent the sufferings of Christ, then the crosse whereon he suffered. But, if our signe were a perfect resemblance of that crosse, yet, as long as we vse it not, in any such sense, it ought not, as an image to bee obiected vnto vs. The <hi>Hieroglyphiks</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> were (in their shape and proportion) the images of birds, and beasts, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, amongst which was also the crosse, as <hi>Ruffin</hi> reporteth, vnder which they signified <hi>the life to come</hi>:<note place="margin">Ruffin. lib. 2. eccles. hist. cap. 29. pag. 7.</note> but yet because they vsed those figures but only as <hi>Characters,</hi> they are there to bee reputed, not as images, but as letters. And therefore the signification of images is stretched and strained very far when such a poore character, (cleane contrary to the vse of it) yet is fetched within the compasse of them.</p>
               <p>I haue beene the more carefull to vindicate the crosse from this opinion of beeing an image, not that it would hurt or preiudice the cause any whit if it were granted to be one, but because I do see, that <hi>T.C.</hi> and his followers haue such an notable art in making of images &amp; idols, that if they happen to myslike any thing whatsoeuer, they can presently trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the same into an idol, &amp; make it as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto Gods commandement, as it is vnto their owne priuate fantasie and conceipt. In this place you make the crosse an image; and, in your 4. obiection,<note place="margin">Whitg. pag. 290.723.</note> you make it an idol; So likewse <hi>T.C</hi> in one place maketh the <hi>surplice</hi> an idoll, calling it a wouen image: in an other place, he calleth a Bride an idol because her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band saith, <hi>with my body I thee worship.</hi> And thus euery thing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2680:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which they misconceipt, is by and by mishaped into an idol. Wheras it is most true, that they make an idol of their owne idle fancy, and priuate conceipt, for the honor of which bable, they despise magistrats, violate lawes, &amp; force the very scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themselues. But, to returne. You cal the crosse, not only an image, but also a religious image, and yet (as you know) we do not worship it: nor place any holines or religion in it, more then in other ceremonies: neither make we it a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial part of Gods seruice, but onely circumstantiall: vsing, it only as an ecclesiasticall ceremonie, appointed in our church by humaine authority, and not inioyned by God, vpon mere necessity.<note place="margin">Cal lib. 4. Instit. cap. 1.</note> And therefore whensoeuer our church (whom wee ought dutifully to obey in all things, as our mother) shall cease to command vs the vse of that ceremony, we may then cease it lawfully, neither euer wil call for it as a matter of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity: but will truly professe with <hi>Minutius Felix,</hi>

               <p>For the rule of our conscience, you rightly define it to bee the word of GOD. And therefore, seeing this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the crosse hath no particuler testimonie, either <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>contrà,</hi> in the word of God; that generall rule of the

            <div type="section">
               <head>The proposition is thus backed.</head>
               <p>First, a monument being nothing but that which admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth our minde of any thing, it must needs bee, that being abused to idolatry (being no way of Gods creation nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance) and remaining to posterity immediatly after the abuse, are reliques and monuments of idolatry. Concerning which,<note place="margin">Deut. 12.3.</note> God hath plainly declared his will, where hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2680:88"/>
to cut downe the groues, and to burne them, to ouer-throw the altars, to breake the images in peeces, &amp;c. <hi>And thou shalt not doe so to the Lord thy GOD.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 30.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Also thou shalt pollute the couering of the Images of Siluer, and the rich ornaments of the Images of golde, and cast them away as a menstruous cloath.</hi> Where necessarily in cleere reason, wee must vnderstand, that GOD will haue done away all of this kinde, as well as these particulers here named: yea, all that hath any neerenesse or affinity with idolatry, and which may bee as inticements to turne vs from God and his pure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, from which we are so apt to decline, if we haue the least occasion. Such is mans extreame propension vnto superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as the example of the Iewes euidenceth. Vpon these grounds our church worthily (in a religious care of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs sincere in Gods seruice) hath abandoned rood-lofts, wax-candles, and other infinite reliques and monuments of idolatry.</p>
               <p>For the Assumption: The signe of the crosse to bee none of Gods creatures or ordinances, but the inuention of men, it is cleere. Also, that it was idolatrously abused of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, by whom it is immediatly left vnto vs. And it hath a certaine fitnesse to bring their idolatrie to minde, as often as it is vsed in diuine seruice: therefore a monument of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, howsoeuer vsed by vs vnto another end, which might haue kept in all other monuments of superstition whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, euen Heathenish idols; for it is an easie thing to deuise a different end and vse of them, from that where-vnto they were applyed by idolaters.

               <head>Answere.</head>
               <p>As concerning your <hi>Maior</hi> proposition, That <hi>all monuments
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2680:89"/>
and reliques of idolatry are vnlawfull,</hi> it must first bee exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and distinguished, before it bee either admitted or denyed.</p>
               <p>First therefore as concerning these two words, of [<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi>] and [<hi>Monument</hi> what your meaning should bee in them, it is not plaine and apparant. A <hi>Relique</hi> in his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sense, is properly nothing else, but the remainder of some body,<note place="margin">Orig. hom. 5. in Psal. 36.</note> which is for the greatest part consumed, as <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> noteth. <hi>Quae superest pars corporis, reliquiae nominatur.</hi> A monument, is some new worke, erected and instituted for the remembrance of that old body, which before was decayed. Both these words, by the common and ordinary Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vse of them, imply, that both a <hi>relique</hi> and a <hi>monument</hi> are purposely destinated, to preserue the remembrance of that subiect,<note place="margin">Festus in voce, Monimentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of which it is either a <hi>relique</hi> or a <hi>monument</hi>: as <hi>Festus</hi> noteth.</p>
               <p>Now if you take a <hi>relique</hi> or a <hi>monument</hi> of Idolatrie in this sense, for either a remainder of that old idolatry which is now decayed, or a signe newly erected of purpose, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the remembrance of it, for the loue and reuerence which wee beare vnto it: then I yeeld your proposition to bee very true, that all such <hi>reliques</hi> and <hi>monuments</hi> of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, ought to bee rooted out, and none of them vsed in the seruice of God. For that were to mingle <hi>light with darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> Christ <hi>with</hi> Beliall,<note place="margin">2. Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.16.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Temple of God with Idols,</hi> as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh.</p>
               <p>But, if you take the name of a <hi>relique</hi> of idolatry, for any thing which hath in idolatry beene vsed, though the abuse thereof bee now reformed, and the nature thereof (by an other vse) cleane changed, as it is in our signe of the crosse: Or, if you take the name of a <hi>Monument,</hi> for any thing what-so-euer may bring into our mindes the remembrance of idolatry, though not <hi>ex instituto,</hi> but <hi>ex accidente,</hi> then doe I vtterly denie your proposition, as false. And that for these reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:2680:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>First, because your selfe, euen in that proposition where you would eradicate all monuments of idolatry, yet doe it with this reseruation, <hi>If they be not either the creatures or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God.</hi> So that you seeme to grant a speciall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, vnto certaine monuments of idolatrie, to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againe into Gods seruice,<note place="margin">Looke p. 22.23.</note> namely if they be eyther Gods creatures or ordinances. Which (for ought that I know) haue by the word of God no greater immunities or exemptions, then haue mans ordinances and inuentions: as euidently appeareth by <hi>Agags sheepe,</hi> which were Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and the brazen serpent, which was GODS ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: both which were destroyed, not-with-standing that indulgence which you seeme to giue them. So that the creatures of GOD haue no greater priuiledge, beeing monuments of idolatry, then other things haue. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know, either the place where, or the case when, or the cause why, such priuiledge is granted them? For I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that this clause of exemption, is but cunningly inserted into the proposition, onely to auoide the force of those eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent examples which may be brought of GODS creatures and ordinances abused to idolatrie, which yet haue beene restored vnto their vses of piety: and to tye vs onely vnto the inuentions of man, wherein you suppose wee can bring you none instance.</p>
               <p>So that, from this clause of your exemption, I thus argue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The creatures of GOD haue no greater priuiledge then the ordinances of the Church: But the creatures of GOD (by your owne confession) are priuiledged from destruction, though they haue beene abused vnto idolatry.</hi> Ergo. <hi>The ordinances of the Church are likewise priuiledged</hi>: and consequently the crosse.</p>
               <p>So that either you must shew by the testimonie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where that speciall priuiledge is granted vnto Gods creatures, or else will wee plead it as a common lawe for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2680:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ceremonies, and for mans inuentions, as it pleaseth you to call all ecclesiasticall constitutions, though <hi>T.C.</hi> haue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion of them, as you heard before pag. 16.</p>
               <p>The second reason which moueth mee to deny your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, is the iudgement and practice of the primitiue church against it, who haue admitted of diuerse inuentions of men in the seruice of God, which had formerly beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused vnto idolatry, euen with deuils. To giue you one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, aboue all exceptions.</p>
               <p>The Christians in the primitiue church, conuerted those same temples into the houses of God, which had before bin consecrated vnto heathen idolls. These idolatrous temples are mans meere inuentions, erected not only without any warrant, but also directly against Gods commandement: and yet you see, that the primitiue and purest church made no scruple at all of vsing those temples, though they were the same <hi>indiuidua</hi> that had beene abused,<note place="margin">Deut. 12.2.</note> and haue an expresse commandement to be destroyed. Whose example (contrary to your position) all the reformed churches of Christendome do imitate, in vsing without scruple, those very same chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which haue manifestly and manifoldly beene polluted with popish idols: which practise euen <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>Neque nobis hodie religio est,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cal. Exposi. in Exod.</note> sayth he, <hi>templa retinere quae polluta fuerunt idolis, et accommodare in vsum meliorem.</hi> Now, what can bee the reason, why both the primitiue church and ours should so fully conspire in vsing the same temples which haue beene abused, (contrary vnto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and particular commandement of God as you imagin) but only this, that they thought not themselues there bound to vse destruction, where the things abused would admit a reformation, as it hath apparently done, no lesse in our cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, then in our churches.</p>
               <p>If you call those temples, the creatures of God, because the wood and stone, and other materialls whereof they were made, are the creatures of GOD, you apply that name

               <p>Ob. <hi>The third proofe of your proposition, is drawne from the example of our owne reformed church, whose practise sheweth his iudgement.

a wrong vse, they cannot be called the monuments of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but in a very forced and equiuocall sense, if our church should retaine them in an other vse.</p>
               <p>The Godly care of our church, in abandoning all true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of superstition, doth not inferre that the crosse is one: but rather proue that it is none, because our church hath not abandoned it.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>But you seeme to insinuate that our church hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in erred, hauing as great a reason to abolish the crosse as either Rood-lofts, or crucifixes, or wax-candles, or any other like monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of idolatry which she hath reiected.</hi>

               <p>But as concerning that discretion which our church hath made, in the abolishing of some things, and retaining of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, you are to vnderstand, that al the things she hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished be not of one nature; nor for one cause reiected. Some things she hath abolished of meere necessity, because they were simply vnlawfull, as the image of the crucifix, set vp vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Alter, of purpose to bee worshiped, and so knowne to bee notoriously abused. Other things shee hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, onely vpon conueniency, because they were lesse profitable, as <hi>Salt, Oyle, Wax-candles</hi> and such like. These things shee hath abolished, not as monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of idolatrie, and things simply vnlawfull, but as needlesse ceremonies, and things not greatly profitable;

definition of a <hi>Relique.</hi> But our signe of the crosse is no part of theirs: and therefore, it cannot be a <hi>Relique</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>That it is no part of theirs, appeareth by this reason: That euery part is either an integrall part, that is, a member of the same indiuiduall body: or else, an vniuersall part, that is either an <hi>Indiuiduum</hi> of the same <hi>Species,</hi> or else, a <hi>Species,</hi> of the same <hi>Genus.</hi> But our crosse (as we vse it) is none of all these: it is neither a part of the same <hi>Indiuiduall</hi> action, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the <hi>Papists</hi>; nor a whole <hi>Indiuiduum</hi> of the same <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>: no, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Eundem fluvium vis intrare</hi>: taking <hi>eundem</hi> there, for <hi>cundem numero.</hi> And so may I say as truly, that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for any man, <hi>Eandem actionem vis peragere.</hi> For though the priest bee the same, and the hand the same, and the forehead the same, and the end the same, yet the action repeated is not the same: when he once hath made one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular crosse, he can neuer make the same crosse ouer againe. The same <hi>opus indiuiduuo</hi> hee may make againe; as a man may cast the same bullet in the same mold a thousand times ouer: but the same <hi>Action in indiuiduo</hi> (<hi>verbo causa</hi> his first casting of it) it is vtterly vnpossible hee should euer do againe. For to make a singular action againe, all these sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulers must concurre: <hi>Idem agens, idem patiens, idem agendi modus, finis, tempus,</hi> all which are vnpossible to concurre any ofter then once. So that our crosse is so farre from
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2680:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being an integrall part of theirs, that one of their owne crosses is no part of an other. And therefore our crosse can no more properly bee called a relique of theirs, then a bone of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> body, can a relique of <hi>Iudas,</hi> of which it is no member.</p>
               <p>Let vs now see whether our crosse be a part of the same <hi>totum vniuersale,</hi> seeing it is no part of the same <hi>totum inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grale.</hi> This point I thinke, if it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By this <hi>Series</hi> it appeareth, that our crosse is neither an <hi>Indiuiduum</hi> of the same <hi>Species</hi> with the Papists, nor yet a <hi>species</hi> of the same <hi>proximum genus</hi>: but seperated from it, by three substantiall differences. The first is taken from the <hi>Agents,</hi> that theirs is the crosse of Papists, ours of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants: which maketh that these two actions cannot bee <hi>indiuidua</hi> of the same <hi>species.</hi> For a Protestant an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

differing in <hi>Species,</hi> as bee their agents. The second diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene their crosse and ours (which maketh them yet more distant) is taken from their differing ends: a point which altereth the very nature of the actions. The Papists make their crosse as it were a kinde of <hi>Exorcisme,</hi> to keepe them from euill spirits: but wee doe make our crosse to no such superstitious end, but onely (as by a significant cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie to admonish our mindes of <hi>Christs</hi> meritts towards vs and of our duties towards him. These two differing ends, doe yet put a further difference in the actions. There is yet a third difference, which still remoueth them further: and that is, that that very <hi>remotum genus,</hi> of <hi>Sacra actio,</hi> vnder which, both the Papists crosse and ours is contained, yet doth not <hi>praedicari vni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegor. cap. 1.</note> and of theirs, <hi>aequiuocè</hi>: as <hi>Homo</hi> doth of <hi>pictus</hi> and of <hi>viuus homo.</hi> For their crosse, though it be in name <hi>Sacra actio,</hi> yet is it in truth and in deed, <hi>profana.</hi> So that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisticall crosse and ours, agree but in two things: First, in the name, that both are called <hi>Crosses</hi>: and secondly, in the scheme and outward forme of the action, in that both of them bee made of one figure and fashion. But they differ in three points, of farre greater waight.</p>
               <p>First in the nature of the actions, in that the one is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a religious action; the other aequiuocally religious, truely superstitious. Secondly, in the nature of the Agents: The one beeing sincere worshippers of the true GOD, the other corrupt worshippers of abhominable Idols. And thirdly in the end of the actions; the one beeing desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated vnto true pietie, the other likewise vnto impious idolatrie.</p>
               <p>Thus doe our crosse and their <hi>toto genere differre,</hi> so that the corruption of the one, cannot transfuse infection into the other: but that we may as lawfully vse ours, notwithstanding their vnlawfull abuse of theirs, as we may breath of the same ayre, into which Idolaters haue fumed their incense; or

               <p>Thus our crosse (as you see) is no relique of their crosse, of which it is neither a member, nor a part. Now let vs see whether it be a <hi>Monument</hi> of idolatry, or no: your selfe do bring this <hi>Etymon</hi> of that name,<note place="margin">Isidor. lib. 14. Orig. cap. 11.</note> that <hi>Monimentum,</hi> is <hi>quasi monens mentem,</hi> which is <hi>Isidores</hi> deriuation: which eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently sheweth, that the end of all <hi>monuments</hi> is admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to keepe in our mindes, the remembrance of those things, which (otherwise) might happily decay amongst vs. Hence, temples, and Sepulchres, are propperly called their <hi>monuments</hi> vnto whom they bee dedicated. So that a <hi>Monument</hi> of that, in remembrance of which it was purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erected, and not of any other thing, which by an other mans fantasie is thereby imagined. In this sence, our crosse, may truly be called a <hi>monument of Christ</hi> our Sauiour cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for whose remembrance it is purposely intended; but why it should be called a <hi>monument of idolatrie,</hi> it hauing no such end or purpose, as to conserue the memory of it, I can see no reason.

A man oft times is admonished to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber some one thing, by another which is of a contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (as the prodigall child was,<note place="margin">Luk. 15 17.</note> who by seeing the base estate wherein himselfe was, remembred the good estate wherein his fatners seruants were) yet cannot the one of these, bee called a monument of the other: because this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition is meerely casuall, and not naturall. If then any man bee casually admonished to remember the idolatrous crosse of the <hi>Papist</hi> by seeing of ours, this admonition proceeding, not <hi>ab intentione agentis,</hi> but <hi>à corruptione spectantis,</hi> cannot make our crosse a monument of theirs, no more then a Birde flying, or a man swimming, or a plowe going, or a ship sailing, may bee called a monument of the crosse, because by all these figures a man may bee put in minde to remember it, as diuerse of the Fathers haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. <hi>Iustine Martyr. orat. ad Antonium Pium. Ambros. Serm.</hi> 56. So that our crosse can neither bee a relique of theirs of which it is no part; nor yet a monument, of which it is no signe, and therefore your assumption (as I hope you see) is false.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. But you confirme the same vnto vs, by three speciall proofes which demonstrate our crosse to bee a monument of superstition. The first is this: Because it was by the Papists idolatrously abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, who ascribed vnto it, diuine Holinesse, Power, and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The second is, because it is from them left immediatly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. The third, because our pretence of a differing end in vsing it, is not a sufficient defense for it. Because by that reason, all other</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:2680:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
monuments of <hi>Idolatry, yea euen idols themselues might bee brought in againe. This is the summe of that fortification whereby you indeuor to make good your</hi> Assumption, <hi>that our crosse must needs bee a monument of idolatry. Let vs therefore consider of all these things apart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> For your first <hi>Obiection</hi>: that our crosse hath beene idolatrously abused, nay made a very idoll, you proue it by three instances: whereof the two first are insufficient. For, what if they thought the signe of the crosse to haue either greater holines, or greater power, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indeed it had; must this needs make it become by and by an idol?<note place="margin">Isai. 1.21. Ier: 7.4.</note> The <hi>Iewes</hi> thought both their holy citty <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and the temple therein contained, to be a great deale holier then indeed they were: did this opinion of theirs therefore make those two thinges idols?<note place="margin">2 King: 4.29.31.</note> 
                  <hi>Elisha</hi> in like manner, when he sent his staffe to raise the childe to life, did thinke it to haue had a greater power, then it had: yet did not that opinion make the staffe become an idoll. So likewise the <hi>Papists,</hi> in thinking the crosse to haue either a kinde of holynesse to sanctifie the vsers, or a kinde of power to driue away the diuills; in these fancies they declare, rather the errour of their opinion, then the idolatry of their religion.</p>
               <p>But your third instance of adoration, (if it bee ideed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine which they giue vnto it: for all agree not in this point) that is a good demonstration,<note place="margin">Bellar. Tom. 1. cont. 7. lib: 2. cap. 22.24.</note> that to them it is an idoll. But what is that to vs? how followeth it, that our crosse must needs be a monument of idolatry, beecause theirs is an idoll any more then our oxen are monuments of idolatry because the <hi>Egiptians</hi> oxen were their idols? Whether all oxen are made vnlawfull for the seruice of God,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.26.</note> because some were made idols, that is an other question; but that all oxen must be monuments of idolatry (if our crosse be one) that is out of question. For, the reason which you make against the crosse, doth hold as strongly against the oxe; yea euen to the banishing him from all vse of the tabernacle (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2680:97"/>
your inserted clause of exemption) if there bee any sound truth in your generall proposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> For your 2. obiection; that the crosse is a monument <hi>of idolatry because it is immediatly left by the Papists vnto vs.</hi> That is faulty in all parts: for this must needs bee the summe of your argument, if it haue any argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatsoeuer is left vs immediatly by the Papists, that is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of of idolatry. But the crosse is left vs immediately by the Papists.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> In which argument, both your <hi>Maior</hi> and your <hi>Minor</hi> be false. First for your <hi>Mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r</hi>: It is not the leauing of any thing vnto vs by idolaters, which maketh the thing left, a monument of idolatry, vnles it bee also a part of their idolatry. For, both the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are left vnto vs (in your sense) by the <hi>Papists,</hi> who are knowne to be notorious idolaters: and yet neither of these (I hope) will you call, the monuments of idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. But these (you will say) be the ordinances of</hi> God, <hi>and so may haue vse in the seruice of</hi> God, <hi>by that clause of exemption, which you haue inserted into your first proposition, that no monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of idolatry (beeing neither the creatures, nor ordinances of</hi> God) <hi>can haue any vse in the seruice of</hi> God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> Though that clause of exemption admit them into the seruice of God; yet doth it not exempt them from being monuments of idolatry, if this bee a good reason which you here alledge why the crosse should be a monument of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, beecause it is le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Now, for your <hi>Assumption, That the crosse is left vnto
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2680:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs immediatly by the Papists,</hi> that is as false as your propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was. For that only may properly be said to be left vs, which is <hi>de manu in manum</hi> deliuered vnto vs,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.23.</note> as the Apostles did their <hi>Traditions</hi> vnto their successors. In a second and a more proper sense, that also may be said to be left vnto vs, which by immitation we borrow from others as the apostles againe did, their law of <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>strangled,</hi> from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, in the law.<note place="margin">Act: 15.20.</note> But neither of these wayes can the crosse bee said to be left vs by the <hi>Papists.</hi> For, first, vnto vs (whome they count heretikes) they could not leaue any thing which they hold so precious: and secondly, from them (whome wee count idolaters) wee would not borrow any thing, which wee held so superstitious. So that, neither of these two waies, is it left by them vnto vs. And much lesse the third way, which is, by <hi>Desertion,</hi> as though wee had come vnto it, <hi>tanquam in vacuam possessionem,</hi> for they still do fight for it, <hi>tanquam pro aris et focis.</hi> So that, I cannot see, how the crosse can be said to bee left vnto vs, by them, vnles you thereby intend that we haue as it were wrung it out of their hands; and that so they left that to vs, which they could not with-hold from vs.</p>
               <p>If you take this phrase [<hi>left vnto vs</hi>] in a sense so prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally and prodigiously large, that you count all that to bee left vnto vs, by those men which haue vsed the same things before vs: then may both the sunne and the moone, and all the elements bee said to bee left vnto vs by idolaters, and consequently to be <hi>The monuments of idolatry.</hi> and so what is there any where, which (in this so large and so laxe a sense) may not be called <hi>A monument of idolatry</hi>?</p>
               <p>As for this point, therefore, we truly professe, that wee borrow not this ceremonie from the <hi>Romish Synagogue</hi> (though they haue more lately vsed it) but from the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, who first ordained it. So that as it cannot tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee said, that the <hi>Papists</hi> haue left vs either the Lords praier, or the Apostles creed, or the holy sacraments, but that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2680:98"/>
wee take all these (by our owne right) out of the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">Nostrum quippe est, quodcunque de nostris, sumpsisse et tradidisse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigit illis. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ul. lib. de tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>But if it were granted, that this ceremony of the crosse, though left vnto vs by the primitiue church, yet were brought vnto vs by the hands of Papists, doth that present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make it a <hi>monument of idolatry</hi>? if one should receiue a token by the hand of a Pagan which were sent vnto him from a <hi>Christian</hi>; is it therefore made a <hi>monument of idolatry,</hi> because he that brought it was an idolater? <hi>Holy orders</hi> were giuen vnto the first <hi>Protestants,</hi> by the hands of <hi>Papists</hi>: doth this so defile the orders of our ministery, as to make them presently the <hi>monuments of idolatry</hi>?
