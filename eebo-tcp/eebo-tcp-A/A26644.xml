            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN the two late Diſcourſes concerning <hi>The Adoration of our Bleſſed Saviour in the Holy Euchariſt,</hi> were firſt printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the World expected they ſhould receive an Anſwer from the ſame place, from whence they had defy'd the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I was vain enough to think it might fall to my lott to Anſwer them. For I fancy'd ſo trivial a Pamphlet was below the regard of other men, who do God and the Church bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſevice in another ſtation: and preſum'd that while they offer'd Sacrifice, a mean man might ſerve to drive away the Flyes. Wherefore I committed to paper, what I thought I ſhould ſay, ſuppoſing that Province were aſſigned me, but having neither order nor inclination to appear in Print, I proceeded as my leiſure would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me: and was not ſo aſſiduous as I ſhould have been to perform a task. Beſides I indulg'd my curioſity in a ſtrict examen of the Quotations, which (ſome of the Books being ſcarce, and moſt of them of a competent bulk) between procuring and reading them coſt me twice the time, that it did to write my Reply. This ſearch I grant was not abſolutely neceſsary to my purpoſe, for a man that knows the Doctrine of our Church, will not stick at any of the Quotations ſave only thoſe out of <hi>Mr. Thorndike:</hi> yet I do not regrett my pains: for I gain'd a more just and lively Idea of the <hi>Diſcourſer</hi> then I had before: and a freſh peruſall of our own excellent Authors, renewing thoſe impreſſions I had formerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from 'em was it ſelf a very great reward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66095:3"/>So much work cut out for one that was in no great hast: being neither very fond of labour, nor lying under any obligation: muſt needs proceed as ſlowly as ever <hi>any</hi> Church-work did: ſo that no man need wonder if a <hi>London</hi> Anſwer was publiſh'd when there yet remain'd neare a third part of mine to finiſh. Peruſing that Reply I threw aſide my own papers as ſuperfluous, and reſolv'd to proceed no farther in ſo needleſs a deſign: the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe it was reported with great confidence, that another Anſwer was at that time ready, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing for the preſs. But ſome that impatiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this ſecond anſwer, finding after a fortnights expectation, there was no good ground for that report: and being poſseſs'd with an opinion that there ought to be an <hi>Oxford</hi> Anſwer; having likewiſe ſeen in what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I proceeded; and how far I was advanced: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd me first to finiſh my Reply though it were but for their ſatisfaction: and at laſt extorted my conſent to print it; upon condition no other Anſwer ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the reaſons why it was made public, and why ſo late. If any man find leiſure to peruſe it, I must beg him as he reads the Anſwer to read the Diſcourſes along with it, for that's a piece of juſtice due to every book that's anſwer'd, and in confidence it would here take place, I have frequently worded my Reply, ſo that it cannot be throughly underſtood, without comparing my words with thoſe in the Pamphlet they reply to.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. The Introduction.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ſomewhat ſurpriſing that one, who has left the Church of <hi>England</hi> to go over to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould attempt to juſtifie his deſertion by pretending both Churches are agreed; and if they are ſo, his conduct is the more amazing, who quits the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of 'em both, and goes to ſettle the point he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for upon <hi>new Notions</hi> of his own: which by the way is ſo plain a confeſſion, that he thinks the Popiſh Principles cannot juſtifie their Practice, that I doubt the Gentlemen of that Communion will ſcarce thank him for his undertaking. One would likewiſe have expected, that a man of the Editors reputation, the famous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler of an <note n="*" place="bottom">Ars rationis Oxon. è Theatro 1673.</note> 
               <hi>Art of Reaſon,</hi> ſhould neither have writ nor publiſhed any thing, wherein the Author did not reaſon like a man of art; or at leaſtwiſe talk as coherently as ordinary men uſe to do by the pure ſtrength of natural reaſon. Yet it pleaſes the Author of the Pamphlet to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play his great ſearch and quickneſs, in ſuch illations as theſe; <note n="*" place="margin">Diſc I. ch.

               <hi>Gloria in excelſis, is put in the Poſt communion,</hi> Ergo, <hi>The Church that put it there diſowns the Real Preſence,</hi>

               <hi>Nihil magis incredibile</hi>: Ergo <hi>Not this more incredible that Idem corpus poteſt eſſe in diverſis locis ſimul.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>This thing is above our reaſon,</hi> Ergo <hi>'Tis contrary to it</hi>: with other ſuch deep diſcoveries; to ſhew us that his talent in Logic is as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular as his judgement in Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="[2]" facs="tcp:66095:4"/>But I have no commiſſion to queſtion any man for making bold with himſelf; or expoſing his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to what degree he thinks fit: and ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have taken no notice of this Pamphlet, had it been any where printed but at <hi>Oxford.</hi> I ſhould not have thought my ſelf obliged to cenſure the extravagant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of a private fancy; ſuch eſpecially as are not likely to do any miſchief to the Public: and ſuch I eſteem the notions of this Pamphlet; which is too perplex'd for a common Readers underſtanding, and too ſophiſtical to impoſe upon the more intelligent. But conſidering the falſe and ſcandalous reports, that are of late ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſpread about the Nation: as if <hi>Oxford Converts</hi> came in by whole ſhoals, and all the Univerſity were juſt ready to declare: I have reaſon to believe this Pamphlet was deſignedly printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to countenance thoſe reports. For no doubt the Popiſh Preſſes were at the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors ſervice; and to uſe them, inſtead of ſetting up a new one, hand been leſs trouble and better husbandry. But the ſecret is, theſe Papers are to paſs with unwary people for a ſpecimen of the Univerſities judgment: much ſuch a one indeed as the <hi>Tile</hi> was, which <hi>Hierocles's</hi> Scholar brought to market for a ſample of the <hi>Houſe</hi> he had to ſell. Now there are diverſe agravations of this foul play, which make it yet more inſupportable. As why is this queſtion now reviv'd which the members of our Church have of late ſo carefully declin'd out of pure reſpect to thoſe ears, which if it be poſſible they are not willing to offend? Or why are we of the Univerſity attacqu'd in our own quarters? and ſo defy'd to our teeth, that we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in honor nor honeſty decline an anſwer, tho, we are well aware with what deſigne the ſcene of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is laid in <hi>Oxford</hi>? Or how can we brook this uſage from <hi>our companion? our own familiar friend whom we truſted?
<pb n="[3]" facs="tcp:66095:4"/>
with whom we have taken ſweet councel together? and walked in the houſe of God as friends</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſ. LV.14, 15.</note>? Theſe are ſuch cutting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as no armor of patience is ſufficient proof againſt.</p>
            <p>For theſe Reaſons, and not for any worth in the Book, I have ventur'd to anſwer it; and comply'd with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere task the Author ſets me to make brick and find ſtraw too. For the Pamphlet duly conſider'd will not furniſh ſufficient matter for a Treatiſe. Strip it of its garniture, and it comes to no more then this, That <hi>the Author ſuppoſes</hi> the Church of England to hold ſuch a Real Preſence of Chriſt's natural body in the Euchariſt, as <hi>he thinks</hi> a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to adore the Elements: To which we need only reply; That as the Church ever held a real, ſo ſhe ever deny'd a corporal <hi>i. e.</hi> a local preſence; and for that reaſon forbid the adoration of the Symbols. For, to ſay no more at preſent, the ſame arguments that will juſtifie our adoring them upon the ſcore of any, but a local pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſts natural body, will excuſe not only the Popiſh, but even the groſſeſt Heathen Idolatry.</p>
            <p>This I take to be a full and ſufficient anſwer to what our Author has ſpun into two Diſcourſes: However that I may leave no room for cavil, I ſhall take a diſtinct view of the whole Pamphlet, and reply particularly to the Chapters and Sections of each Diſcourſe as they lie in order.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. A Reply to the firſt Chapter of the firſt Diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>THIS Chapter is taken up chiefly in recounting ſome little Alterations that have been made at ſeveral times in our <hi>Rubricks</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi>: from which the Pamphlet would infer that our Church has <hi>waver'd</hi> in her <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to my apprehenſion, this Deſign let it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted how it will, is very impertinently undertaken. For admit that the Church had waver'd (as ſhe has not) what's that to his purpoſe of proving, that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al tho' not Corporal preſence is ground enough to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Elements in the Euchariſt? Again, admit it were pertinent to prove, that the Church had waver'd in her Doctrine; how impertinent is it to allege no proof, ſave out of the Rubricks and Articles, which contain only terms of her Communion? omitting the Homilies and Catechiſms ſet forth by her Authority, as a ſolemn declaration of her Doctrine? We grant that the Church having always held a Real Preſence, ſo far as a Real Participation imply's one; but always deny'd it if by Real we mean Corporal and Local; has not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought it requiſite, to make the declaration and ſubſcription of this Doctrine, a term of her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: and if the Author has any thing to object to her upon this ſcore; it may poſſibly be to the purpoſe, and then we are ready to anſwer it. Allways pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he forbear that ſhrewd way of arguing, which he gives us a taſt of in <hi>the ſecond paragraph</hi> of his <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſection</hi>: for to ſuch kind of ſequels as he makes
<pb n="[5]" facs="tcp:66095:5"/>
there, we ſhall not think fit to reply; but leave 'em to be ſeen through and deſpis'd by the Freſhmen.</p>
            <p>But a man, that is not mov'd by thoſe arguments, may perhaps be put in mind by the premiſſes, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire why theſe Alterations were made? I anſwer that 'tis eaſy to aſſign <hi>good</hi> reaſons<note n="*" place="bottom">The reaſons here aſſign'd are (it may be) not the true ones why the changes were made, but may ſerve to make a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber man acquieſce in theſe alterations, nay prefer them now they are made: and the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> not the <hi>Prudence</hi> of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches conſtitutions is the main point to be conſider'd by the members of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. 'Tis no matter what <hi>Politick</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might induce the <hi>Government</hi> to make theſe changes, as long as in making them it did not deviate from the rule of Scripture. But the Reader that is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd may gratify his curioſity as to this point too; by conſulting <hi>Dr. Burnets Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Reformation vol.</hi> 2 <hi>pag.</hi> 170.190.392.394.405. <hi>Foxes and Firebrands par.</hi> 2. <hi>pag</hi> 10.11, 12, 13. <hi>Diſcourſe of the holy Euchariſt newly printed at London pag</hi> 72, 73. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But when this note of direction (<hi>when to take the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> &amp;c.) was omitted, the practice of take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it did not ceaſe.

by common practice. But when falſe brethren took advantage from the omiſſion to perform the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny awkwardly and lamely, the directions were reſtor'd in the edition of ſixty one.</p>

But withal he tells us, the firſt of theſe Forms deſcends to us from Antiquity: and he finds no fault with the ſecond, which is entirely agreeable to the words and end of the Inſtitution. So that we are yet to ſeek, where the harme lies of uſing either Form ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, or both of them together? and yet farther to ſeek to what purpoſe this obſervation is made? ſince 'tis manifeſt that neither Form ſingle nor both of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, either owns a <hi>Corporal</hi> or denyes a <hi>Real</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>He addds that the <hi>Scotch Rubrick</hi> keeping the firſt Form requires the Communicant to anſwer to it <hi>Amen:</hi> which without a Rubrick ever was and is ſtill the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church of England (for what more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral then to anſwer <hi>Amen</hi> to a prayer?) and ſo were divers other things (as for inſtance <hi>ſtanding up at the Goſpel,</hi> and ſaying <hi>Glory be to thee O Lord,</hi>) which the Compilers of the Scotch Liturgy having good reaſon to approve, thought fit to injoyn by a Rubrick; that the Puritans might have no pretence for Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Communicants anſwering <hi>Amen.</hi> the Pamphlet truly obſerves it to be according to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of Antiquity: but I doubt the proofs it quotes are not very judiciouſly choſen.

            <p>The Pamphlet farther obſerves that in K.

This omiſſion by the way is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing injudiciouſly obſerv'd; becauſe it ſhews us that the Clergy of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had no ſuch thoughts of the Real Preſence as the Pamphlet would ſuggeſt they had.

            <p>I muſt beg the Readers pardon, if out of a deſire to leave nothing unreply'd to, I have particularly ſpoken to theſe inconſiderable obſervations, which the Author himſelf does but skirmiſh with. But we are now come to the Rubrick, before which he intends to ſit down: <hi>viz.</hi> that for explaining why we Kneel at the Sacrament.

            <p>He obſerves farther that <q>both this <hi>Rubrick</hi> and the <hi>explanatory Paragraph</hi> in the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

To which we have already anſwer'd, that this at the utmoſt implyes but a change in the terms of our Communion: and if he think fit to challenge the Church upon that ſcore we are ready to give him ſatisfaction.</p>

            <p>Had our Author had the ingenuity to expreſs himſelf after this manner, he had been no leſs kind to himſelf then juſt to the Church of England; for he might have avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded divers errors he commits in the three next Chapters, by avoyding the grand impertinence of having written them at all.</p>

was born of the Virgin Mary, crucify'd &amp;c. is preſent <hi>as in Heaven ſo here</hi> in the Holy Sacrament, <hi>either</hi> to the worthy receiver, <hi>or</hi> the Symbols.</p>
            <p>By learned Proteſtants I preſume he means thoſe of the Church of England; for ſo he ſhould mean ſince he draws his <hi>Obſervables</hi> from a Rubric in their Liturgie. Now he would have told us ſome news, had he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but one of theſe learned Proteſtants, who pretending to give the ſenſe of the Church of England does not hold, that the ſame numerical body which was born of the Virgin Mary, crucify'd &amp;c. is <hi>locally</hi> preſent in Heaven, and <hi>virtually</hi> preſent in the Euchariſt; not to the <hi>Symbols,</hi> but the <hi>Faith</hi> of the worthy receiver: or if by thoſe words, <hi>as in heaven ſo here</hi> he means <hi>locally</hi> in both; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he muſt mean, if his next Chapter be at all perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; he would have told us no leſs news, had he brought but one quotation that could be honeſtly taken in that ſenſe. But if he have any third meaning it would have been a favour to explain himſelf, for we pretend not to any talent in divination.</p>

But inſtead of theſe we have only the teſtimonies of ſome other <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent,</hi> but <hi>private</hi> men; all miſerably mangled and disjoynted; ſome of them Conciliators too, whoſe very deſign obliges them to a looſer kind of expreſſion, then a true and adequate ſtandard of the Churches judgment will allow. Now ſhould any of our private writers, either in heat of diſputation, or out of zeal to peace, or deſire to explain a great myſtery; a little deviate in their expreſſions; we can eaſily forgive an error, that proceeds from ſo allowable a cauſe; but ſtill the Church is not bound to juſtify that error.</p>
            <p>But the quotations in the Pamphlet will not put us upon this Apology. Not an author he quotes (except only Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> of whom we ſhall ſay more by and by) but ſpeaks the ſenſe of the Church; and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly drives at a point quite contrary to the Pamphlets deſign; which diſcovers a great flaw either in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors judgment or honeſty. I grant the authors as he has mangled 'em looke as unlike thoſe worthy champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Church, as the ſhape that appear'd to <hi>Aenaeas</hi> did to the true and whole perſon of <hi>Hector.</hi> But I deſire the Reader neither to truſt the Pamphlet nor me but his own eys; to conſult the quotations as they lye intire in the authors themſelves; and conſider 'em with their ſeveral contexts. For my own part having taken that pains, I profeſs to find ſuch dealing as I do not care to report, becauſe I cannot expect to be believ'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſomewhat unaccountable that a man of ſenſe, having read the book of Biſhop <hi>Taylor's,</hi> which the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet quotes; ſhould ſplit upon the very Fallacy, which that Biſhop ſpends allmoſt the whole firſt Chapter in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting. He makes it his buſineſs there to ſhew, that Proteſtants in explaining the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> may lawfully
<pb n="[13]" facs="tcp:66095:9"/>
uſe the ſame terms that Papiſts doe. But they neither can nor doe uſe them in the Papiſts ſenſe, and he that will urge the Proteſtants with thoſe words, muſt take the Proteſtants meaning along with him. This ſeems to be a very equitable propoſal. How far the Pamphlet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes with it, I dare leave to the meaneſt Reader, when he has perus'd this ſhort and plain account of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doctrine in this point.</p>
            <p>The natural body of our bleſſed Saviour comes under a twofold conſideration in the Euchariſt. 1. <hi>As a body dead</hi>; under which notion we are ſaid to eat it in the Sacrament, and to drink the <hi>blood as ſhed</hi>; as appears by the words of the Inſtitution, <hi>Take and eat, this is my body which is given or broken for you; Drink ye all of this, for this is my blood which is ſhed for you:</hi> in which words (<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts and Monuments. pag. 1611.</note> as Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> long agoe obſerv'd) what God has joyn'd we are not to put aſunder. 2. <hi>As a glorify'd body</hi>; in which condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it now ſits at the right hand of God, and ſhall there continue till the reſtitution of all things, imparting Grace &amp; Influence and all the benefits purchaſed by the Sacrifice of the dead body, to thoſe that (in the holy Euchariſt moſt eſpecially) are through Faith and by the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous operation of the holy Ghoſt incorporated into <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and ſo united to him that they <hi>dwell in Chriſt and Chriſt in them; they are one with Christ and Chriſt with them; they are made members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones</hi>: and by partaking of the Spirit of him their head, receive all the graces and benefits, purchaſed for them by his bitter death and paſſion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is evident that ſince the body <hi>broken</hi> and the blood <hi>ſhed</hi> neither do nor can now really exiſt, they neither can be really preſent, nor literally eaten, or drank, nor can we really receive <hi>them,</hi> but only the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66095:10"/>
purchaſed by them. But the body which now exiſts whereof we partake, and to which we are united, is the glorify'd body: which is therefore verily and indeed received (as we ſhall ſee anon) and by conſequence ſaid to be Really preſent notwithſtanding its Local Abſence; becauſe a real participation and union, muſt needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Real preſence, though they do not neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Local one. For 'tis eaſy to conceive how a thing that is Locally Abſent may yet be Really Receiv'd, as he <hi>that receives a Diſciple</hi> is ſaid to <hi>receive Chriſt</hi>; as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples themſelves <hi>receiv'd the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; as the King in the Goſpel <hi>receiv'd a Kingdom</hi>; or as we commonly ſay a man <hi>receives an Eſtate or Inheritance</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Deeds or Conveiances of it. In all which caſes the reception is confeſſedly real, tho' the thing it ſelf is not locally or circumſcriptively preſent, or literally graſp'd in the arms of the receiver.</p>
            <p>This by the way may ſerve to ſhew the vanity as well as falſhood of Tranſubſtantiation, which was firſt devis'd to ſolve the literall eating of the glorify'd body of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: whereas though the body that <hi>is</hi> glorify'd, be nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically the ſame that <hi>was</hi> broken; yet the body which is <hi>eaten as dead,</hi> and the body which is <hi>preſent as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,</hi> are two as different things as can well be imagin'd.</p>
            <p>This may likewiſe ſerve to ſhew, that there is no great diſagreement among thoſe Proteſtants, whom the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts too haſtily charge with it. For they all agree that we ſpiritually eat <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body and drink his Blood: that we neither eat nor drink nor receive the <hi>dead body</hi> nor the <hi>blood ſhed,</hi> but only the <hi>benefits</hi> purchaſed by them: that theſe benefits are deriv'd to us by virtue of our Union and Communion with the glorify'd body: and that our partaking of it, and union with it, is effected by the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious and ineffable operation of the holy Spirit. The

only difference is, that one part from the premiſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be truly ſaid to be <hi>Really Preſent</hi> in the Euchariſt; whereas the other ſcruple at the uſe of <hi>that expreſſion</hi> (becauſe the local abſence of his body is confeſſed on both ſides) notwithſtanding they agree in all the points which the other party think requiſite to defend it.</p>
            <p>Now tho' it be eaſy as I ſaid before to conceive how a natural ſubſtance may be ſaid to be <hi>Really Receiv'd</hi> though not <hi>Locally Preſent</hi>: it is not ſo eaſy to conceive it <hi>Really Preſent</hi> when at the ſame time it is <hi>Locally Abſent.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of <hi>England</hi> has wiſely forborn to uſe the term of <hi>Reall Preſence</hi> in all the Books that are ſet forth by her authority. We neither find it recommended in the <hi>Litugy,</hi> nor the <hi>Articles,</hi> nor the <hi>Homilyes,</hi> nor the <hi>Churches,</hi> nor <hi>Nowell</hi>'s <hi>Catechiſm.</hi> For although it be once in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and once more in the <hi>Articles,</hi> it is mention'd in both places as a phraſe of the Papiſts and rejected for their abuſe of it. So that if any Church of England-man uſe it, he does more then the Church directs him, if any reject it he has the Churches example to warrant him: and it would very much contribute to the peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom if all men would write after ſo good a Copy.</p>
            <p>Yet it muſt not be deny'd but the term may be ſafely us'd amongſt Scholars; and ſeems to be grounded upon the language of Scripture it ſelf. For when our Saviour promiſes <hi>to be in the midſt of them that call upon him</hi>; and <hi>to be with his Church always to the end of the World,</hi> no doubt he promiſes to be <hi>really preſent</hi> with them, though he does not mean that his Naturall Body ſhall be <hi>locally preſent</hi> amongſt them. So S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>abſent in Body</hi> but <hi>preſent in Spirit,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor. V.</hi>3.

In ſhort whatever we enjoy, uſe, and reap the benefit of, as truly as if it were <hi>prae ſenſibus,</hi> is as <hi>Really</hi> preſent as if it were <hi>Phyſically</hi> ſo: nay no doubt when virtue went out of our Saviour's body to heal the woman in the Goſpel; though the Jews throng'd him, and ſhe did but touch his garment, yet his body was <hi>more really</hi> preſent to her whom the virtue of it heal'd then to them whom the ſubſtance of it touch'd.</p>
            <p>So much for the uſe of the word: which when we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> uſe, we mean thus. A thing may be ſaid to be <hi>really receiv'd,</hi> which is ſo conſign'd to us, that we can readily imploy it to all thoſe purpoſes, for which it is uſefull in itſelf, and we have occaſion to uſe it: And a thing thus <hi>really receiv'd</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>really preſent</hi> two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> either <hi>Phyſically</hi> or <hi>Morally,</hi> to which we reduce <hi>Sacramentally.</hi> A <hi>Phyſicall</hi> preſence (now we ſpeak of a natural Body) is <hi>locall; antecedent</hi> to the reception and <hi>independent</hi> upon it: the thing is firſt <hi>really preſent</hi> and then <hi>really receiv'd</hi>; and though it were not <hi>receiv'd,</hi> would be ſtill <hi>really preſent.</hi> A <hi>morall preſence</hi> is only <hi>virtuall conſequent</hi> to the reception and <hi>dependent</hi> upon it: the thing is firſt <hi>really receiv'd,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſaid to be <hi>really preſent</hi>; but it is not at all <hi>preſent,</hi> to them that do not <hi>really receive</hi> it. Thus in the holy Euchariſt, the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is <hi>Phyſically,</hi> the <hi>res Sacramenti, Morally</hi> preſent: the <hi>elements Antecedently</hi> and <hi>Locally,</hi> the <hi>very body Conſequentially</hi> &amp; <hi>Virtually</hi> but both <hi>Really preſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="[17]" facs="tcp:66095:11"/>From hence it is evident, that if we rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Preſence, it is not material with what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs we affirm it. We may ſay it is <hi>Really, Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> nay <hi>Corporally</hi> preſent: that is, it is <hi>preſent</hi> in as much as it is <hi>Really receiv'd</hi> to all intents and purpoſes, for which the <hi>Res ipſa</hi> the <hi>Eſſence</hi> the <hi>Subſtance</hi> the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body</hi> would be uſeful to us, if it were <hi>Phyſically</hi> and <hi>Locally</hi> preſent. And the difference between us and the Papiſts is plain. They (however they expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) underſtand a <hi>Local</hi> preſence, which we deny and therefore reject their expreſſion. We (whatever term we uſe) mean only a <hi>Spiritual and Virtual</hi> Preſence, and explain the term we make uſe of to that effect. Thus the Proteſtants in K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, that ſufferd upon the ſix Articles, deny'd the <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> (i. e. the Popiſh ſenſe of it) but meant the ſame thing with us, who think, we may lawfully uſe that term. On the other ſide that excellent Perſon and glorious Martyr Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts and Monuments p. 1608.</note>, <hi>I do believe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that Chriſt is</hi> Corporally <hi>preſent, at and in the due Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrament.</hi> But he adds this expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>By this word</hi> Corporally <hi>I mean that Chriſt is preſent Corporally</hi> unto Faith.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe evident, that when we ſay Chriſt is <hi>Preſent,</hi> or <hi>Adorable in the Sacrament,</hi> we do not mean <hi>in the Elements</hi> but <hi>in the Celebration.</hi> We affirm his naturall Body to be <hi>Locally</hi> in Heaven and not here; and that we, who are here and not in Heaven, ought to Worſhip it as <hi>Locally preſent in Heaven</hi> while we celebrate the Holy Sacrament upon Earth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly it is evident that this Doctrine is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remov'd from what the Pamphlet calls <hi>Zuinglianiſm,</hi> how truly I will not now inquire. For we do not hold that we barely receive the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> of
<pb n="[18]" facs="tcp:66095:12"/>
Chriſt's Body: but we hold it <hi>Really Preſent</hi> in as much as it is <hi>Really receiv'd,</hi> and we actually put in poſſeſſion of it though <hi>Locally abſent</hi> from us. So that while we <hi>Spiritually</hi> eat Chriſt's Fleſh and drink his Blood, we through Faith, in a myſterious and ineffable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in us; we are one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with us: and by virtue of this <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Myſtical</hi> yet <hi>Real participation,</hi> we receive the <hi>Benefits conſequent</hi> to it; even the remiſſion of our Sins and all other benefits of Chriſts Paſſion.</p>
            <p>This in ſhort is our meaning; and to this effect all true Church-of-England-men declare it. Whether we expreſs our ſelves in proper and accurate terms is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion, wherein if the Editor think fit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, we are ready to anſwer him. In the mean time we deſire him and the reſt of his Communion, not to catch up our words, and bait them in their own ſenſe, which is too like the dealing of the <hi>Old Romans</hi> with the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains that we ſay a word or two concerning Mr. <hi>Thorndike's</hi> Teſtimony, and ſo diſmiſs this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The reader may pleaſe to take notice, that the whole deſign of this Pamphlet is to furbiſh, and rig out a notion of Mr. <hi>Thorndike's</hi> in his <hi>Epilogue to the Tragedy of the Church of England.</hi> The notion is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of Englands, nor as I believe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches: nor does he ſo much as pretend that any other man, much leſs any Church ever taught it. He only thinks it is * <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>analogy of Faith, not trenching</hi> (as he ſays) <hi>upon any ground of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and ſeems to propoſe it as a peaceable expedient, for complying outwardly with the Popiſh adoration of the Euch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap> a practice, which, when he wrote his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> thought adviſeable if it could be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66095:12"/>
for he was then upon a project of Uniting <hi>all Chriſtians in one Communion</hi>: and wrote his Epilogue on purpoſe to ſerve that deſign: not pretending to give the true ſenſe of any party; but ſo to blanch the opinions of them all, that the difference of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might not hinder their Uniting. Wherefore he profeſſes to expect <note n="*" place="bottom">Preface to the Epilogue p. 45 &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>the Lot of Reconcilers, to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by all parties</hi>; and owns that he ſayes thoſe things which he ſhould have diſſembled had the Church of England continu'd. But it ſeemes he thought as ſome others did, when the King was Murther'd, that the Church of England was utterly and irrecoverably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd: and that it was neceſſary to hold Communion with ſome Church: and if it were honeſtly practicable with the Church of Rome rather then another. 'Tis probable <hi>the Editor</hi> was of the ſame mind, for I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to have heard this very plea made in his defence, by a friend of his about ſome Eighteen years ſince.</p>
            <p>But whatever Mr. <hi>Thorndike's</hi> opinion was when he wrote his <hi>Epilogue,</hi> 'tis certain when the King return'd, he was a member of that Convocation that revis'd the Liturgy; that he conſtantly attended there; and had a hand more then ordinary in the <hi>Edition of ſixty one.</hi> That he declar'd his unfeign'd aſſent and conſent, to all things in the Liturgy as it was then alter'd: that he conform'd to it all the reſt of his Life, and at laſt dy'd in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Church that impos'd the uſe of it.</p>
            <p>So then we have here quoted out of the Epilogue, a private opinion of a private man, and what's that to the Church? eſpecially ſince for ought then appear'd he was ſingular in it while he held it; &amp; when occaſion offer'd, he forſook it: profeſſing his unfeign'd aſſent to that Rubrick, which the Pamphlet would confront with his Authority.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Diſc. 1. §. 19 p. 13.</note>The Author's purpoſe in the third Chapter, is to <q>combat this aſſertion in the Rubric, that <hi>it is</hi> againſt the truth of a natural body to be (<hi>i. e. as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it, that</hi> a natural body cannot truly be) in two places at once.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a kind of inauſpicious ſtumble at the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.

For ſhould we ſuppoſe as he would have us, that God ſhould make one of our bodys be in two places at once; when God had done this, it would truly be in thoſe places; but before he did it he muſt change the nature of the body, and make it ceaſe to be a true natural body.</p>

               <hi>Taylor</hi> is Quoted ſaying <q>that if Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation were plainly reveal'd he would burn all his arguments againſt it and believe it without more adoe.</q>
And ſo ſay I too: yet I would not believe that a contradiction could be verifyed; but rather that they were deceiv'd who thought that doctrine to imply a contradiction: for if it were plainly reveal'd, it would be certainly true; and if it were true it would not imply a contradiction. For a <hi>true propoſition</hi> has a <hi>true meaning</hi>: but a contradiction has <hi>no meaning</hi> at all: 'tis an empty ſound of words without any <hi>res ſubſtrata:</hi> whatever one part of it means, the other unmeans again, and ſo the whole means nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beſides of two contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries one is always fals, ſo that to aſſert a contradiction is to affirm a falſhood for a truth, and this we are ſure God cannot do, becauſe he has told us <hi>he cannot lye.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Author himſelf ſeems to own that God cannot verify a contradiction and he gives a very wiſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous reaſon for it which I leave to the Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
            <p>Again Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> is Quoted ſaying,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <q>that the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> does as much violence to Philoſophy as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
               </q>
And ſo ſay I too: yet I profeſs I can eaſier conceive it then I can Tranſubſtantiation. For this ſuppoſes that a natural body being <hi>unum numero,</hi> is at the ſame time <hi>fifteen hundred</hi> bodies all <hi>numerically diſtinct</hi>: whereas the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> ſays the <hi>three</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are <hi>one God,</hi> but it does not ſay they are <hi>one perſon</hi>: ſo that here's no <hi>ad Idem</hi> as there is in the other caſe, which implyes a manifeſt contradiction, while the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity implyes none at all. The Doctrine
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66095:14"/>
of the Trinity <hi>tranſcends</hi> natural reaſon; Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contradicts it in its own ſphere: both of them do <hi>equal</hi> i e. both of them do <hi>alike</hi> ſo far offer violence to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon, that it cannot frame an adequate notion of either. Yet ſtill it can conceive what obſtructs the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility of both; and that more things do ſo in one caſe then another: it can eaſily diſcern that what tranſcends it may for all that be true; but what contradicts it in its own ſphere muſt needs be falſe. And this it can do <hi>without Scripture</hi>: but <hi>by Scripture</hi> it can further diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that the Doctrine of the Trinity <hi>is</hi> true, and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation utterly falſe. Theſe things are ſo plain and common, that it is nauſeous to be forced by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking writer to inculcate them. Whoever knows any thing of the reaſon of his Religion, knows all this and how to apply it to Dr. <hi>Taylor's</hi> words without my telling him: and yet if I had truſted to that, theſe Quotations might perhaps have gone for unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>In the next Section we come to a point.
<q>
                  <hi>For ſince all contradictions</hi> are <hi>equally poſſible</hi> and <hi>credible</hi> why <hi>(ſays he)</hi> may not this contradiction that Idem corpus poteſt eſse <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </note> bid as fair for our belief as another?</q>
No doubt it may; and that for this reaſon that all contradictions are <hi>equally,</hi> i. e. all of them <hi>abſolutely, impoſſible, and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible</hi>; we may as well believe this as another, becauſe we can beleive none at all.
<q>Why then <hi>(ſays he)</hi> I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how you believe a real preſence.</q>
If he cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it,<note place="margin">Ibid. §. 22. p. 15.</note> we cannot help it; we do all that a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man need deſire to make him apprehend it; we ſpeak in plain and intelligible terms; We tell him that we think it implyes no contradiction to believe God can do things far above our comprehenſion; and therefore when God tells us, that <hi>the bread which we break is the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66095:14"/>
Communication of Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>body,</hi> tho' we cannot explain this myſtery, we can believe it without believing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; and granting <hi>this communication,</hi> the <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> may be eaſily underſtood and explain'd: at leaſt it is no contradiction to ſay, that a body thus <hi>myſtically com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,</hi> may be <hi>really preſent</hi> when 'tis <hi>locally abſent</hi> as was ſhew'd before.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But the Author who has a peculiar way of thinking,<note place="margin">Ibid. and §. 23, 24.</note>
can think but of two expedients to evade a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in affirming a <hi>real and ſubſtantial, contra diſtinct to</hi> a Zuinglian <hi>Real preſence:</hi> one of which is by <hi>holding</hi> a Zuinglian Real Preſence.

That's a Conſequence which I leave to ſhift for it's ſelf among the Freſhmen: But I would fain know what the Souls Ubiety makes here? for if it ſerve to any purpoſe in this queſtion 'tis to illuſtrate a <hi>Zuinglian Real Preſence</hi> as he calls it, for as the ſubſtance of the Soul not being coextended to the dimenſions of the Body, is lodg'd but in ſome one part; but the virtue informs them all as effectually as if it's proper <hi>

why I think they might as well have ſtaid on; for the Soul will be Preſent as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the Subſtance where it was before, and the Virtue in the Legs as it was before. Well but let him ſuppoſe what he can't explain, that God by his Omnipotence may make a Soul be in too <hi>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66095:15"/>
Not that the Soul is or may be ſo, for a thing is never the truer or more poſſible for his ſuppoſing it, but only that if a man <hi>ſuppoſe God can make</hi> a ſoul be in two <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bies,</hi> then he muſt <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> that a ſoul <hi>may be</hi> in two <hi>

Not a Syllable that I can find to ſhew the equity or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of it; not a Syllable to take of the impoſſibility. But here is the Divine Omnipotence unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſummon'd to vouch an impertinent Bull, which if it be granted we are never the nearer.

To which we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66095:16"/>
have already anſwerd, that K. <hi>Edwards</hi> Reformers not only thought but ſaid ſo.
<q>In the <hi>twenty ſeventh Section</hi> he is at it again,<note place="margin">Diſc I. pag 20.</note> that the abſurdity of <hi>Idem Corpus, &amp;c.</hi> preſſes us as much as the Papiſts: and again in the <hi>twenty eighth</hi> that all he has been ſaying from the <hi>twenty ſecond</hi> is to ſhew that to his apprehenſion, we muſt either hold <hi>this</hi> contradiction, or another <hi>equivalent,</hi> or ceaſe to hold a Real Preſence contradiſtinct to that of the <hi>Zuinglians.</hi>
               </q>
To this we have likewiſe anſwer'd, that if he will apprehend things aukwardly, we cannot help it. We have told him very plainly how we hold a <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> and ſhewn it to be far enough from what he calls a <hi>Zuinglian</hi> preſence: and all this without hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any contradiction; or ſo much as medling with that queſtion <hi>whether two Contradictories may be both true</hi>? But the Papiſts (and he if he were one of them) neither do nor can explain <hi>their</hi> Preſence without holding a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; which is one of the very many arguments, we urge againſt that prodigious doctrine.</p>

               <note place="margin">Diſc I. §. 29 30.</note>The two next Sections are quotations out of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant "writers to this effect.
<q>That we care not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute the Extent of God's Abſolute Power; that it is not pertinent to this queſtion; that ſome men are too bold in ſetting bounds to the Almighty; and others too forward in pronouncing what implyes a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and therefore the ſafeſt way is to wave theſe points, and ſtick to what is reveal'd.

We grant that no Judicious or Pious man would diſcours of Gods abſolute power <hi>more then</hi> he has <hi>reveal'd</hi>; or preſs the Papiſts with <hi>Idem Corpus,</hi> &amp;c. were it only a Philoſophical argument: much leſs would a Judicious man ſpeak to either of the points, when they were not pertinent to his purpoſe. But when God has
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66095:16"/>
declar'd he cannot verify a contradiction; <note n="*" place="bottom">For example, we read in Scripture that <hi>Chriſt was made in all things like unto us, Sin only excepted</hi>; and that <hi>the Heaven of Heavens muſt contain him</hi> (i e his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Body) <hi>till the reſtitution o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore when the Scripture ſays that Chriſt's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Body is and muſt continue to be Locally in Heaven; we have Gods own warrant to affirm, that even the Divine Omnipotence cannot make it to be Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Preſent at the ſame time upon Earth. This the Angel in effect affirms when he ſays to the Women that ſought Chriſt's Body, <hi>he is riſen, he is not here</hi>: for ſuch an anſwer would but ill become the mouth of an Angel, if it were poſſible for his Body to be riſen, and yet be there at the ſame time.</note> and the maxim of <hi>Idem Corpus,</hi> &amp;c. is apply'd in Scripture to our Saviours natural body; when we wave this where it is not neceſſary; to wit in explaining our own doctrine; and imploy it only againſt thoſe that do, and muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the contrary; we preſume that neither the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor Piety of our Writers will be queſtion'd by any man that has but a grain of either. Though it would not be altogether impertinent, even while we confine our ſelves to revelation, if finding that <hi>Idem Corpus,</hi> &amp;c. is a truth allow'd in Scripture, we inferr that the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it muſt be falſe and therefore cannot be reveal'd. And certainly did a man that conſider'd what he ſaid apply himſelf to anſwer this argument, he would endeavour to take off the contradiction, and ſhew it was not real but apparent only; and not, as this unthinking Author does, maintain that contradictions may be verify'd; which poſition were it once granted, 'twere in vain to diſpute or but aſſert any thing; and impoſſible to give a firm aſſent to any concluſion either in Reaſon or Religion. Wherefore it is ridiculous and impious in this man &amp; <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> and the reſt of them to invoke the Divine Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence when they run their heads againſt a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.

            <p>The <hi>thirty firſt Section</hi> containing only old matter has been ſpoken to before.<note place="margin">Diſc. I. pag. 23.</note> I only add that if the Author allow Dr <hi>Heylin's</hi> reaſon, why does he give a different one of his own? if not, why does he quote it?</p>

<q>He cannot diſcern he ſays why it ſhould not be a contradiction for a Body to be <hi>Locally</hi> in one place and <hi>Really Receiv'd</hi> in another?</q>
He ſhould read Mr. <hi>Walker's Logic</hi> which will tell him that two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories have the ſame Subject and Predicate.
<q>He
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66095:18"/>
ſays it is inſidious in the Rubrick not to ſay that the Body <hi>Locally Abſent</hi> is <hi>Really Receiv'd,</hi> and may tempt a man to doubt whether the Church thinks it to be ſo. Now I fancy not; becauſe the Catechiſm is very expreſs. He is troubled we refuſe other mens contradictions, and expect our own ſhould paſs cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.</q>
But we have told him that we neither hold nor meddle, that we know of, with any contradiction in explaining our own Doctrine, and he has not yet vouchſafed to make it appear we doe.</p>
            <p>From hence to the end of the Chapter he is as buſy as if he were playing with <note n="*" place="bottom">Book of Education part. 1. chap. 11. pag. 145. printed 1677.</note>

                  <hi>If by</hi> Really <hi>and</hi> Eſſentially <hi>be meant</hi> ſuch a Preſence of Chriſts body to our ſouls as the Papiſts hold there is to the Elements, <hi>i. e.</hi> by aboliſhing the ſubſtance of the Soul and ſubſtituting Chriſt's body in the room of it &amp;c. and ſo for the two next.</q>
The fourth ſpeaks imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,<note place="margin">§. 36. pag. 25.

               <q>To this he objects that then Chriſt would be no more preſent in the Euchariſt then in any other Sacrament, wherein the <hi>Spirit</hi> is confer'd.</q>
In which I ſee no inconvenience; nor do I believe the Fathers did, when they ſaid Chriſt is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> as he is in <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> He objects far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther "that ſuch preſence is properly <hi>of the Spirit</hi>:<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> which

I hope for his credit is onely a miſtake of the Preſs; and that the written copy had it <hi>by the Spirit.</hi> The fifth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is likewiſe imperfect, if he apply it to the Church of England; which does not hold a <hi>bare reception of the benefits</hi>; but <hi>a Real participation of the body,</hi> &amp; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the effects and benefits. But the great and killing objection againſt all explications, he diſlikes, is <hi>their not advancing us beyond Zuinglianiſm.</hi> Whether the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he brands by that name, be truly aſcribed to <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and really ſo great a bugbear as this Author ſeems to apprehend, I need not now ſtay to inquire; 'tis ſufficient to my purpoſe that the Church of England does advance beyond it. Yet the words of the <hi>Judicious</hi> and <hi>Venerable</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> are very well worth our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<q>It ſeemeth <hi>(ſaith he</hi> lib. <hi>5.</hi> Sect. <hi>67.</hi> pag. <hi>308.)</hi> much amiſs that againſt them whom they term Sacramenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſo many invective Diſcourſes are made, all running upon two points, that the Euchariſt is not a bare Sign and Figure only, and that the efficacy of his Body and Blood is not all we Receive in this Sacrament. For no man having read their Books and Writings, which are thus traduced, can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that both theſe Aſſertions they plainly confeſs to be moſt true, they do not ſo interpret the words of Chriſt, as if the Name of his Body did import but the Figure of his Body and to <hi>be</hi> were only to <hi>Signifie</hi> his Blood. They grant that theſe Holy myſteries Receiv'd in a due manner, do inſtrumentally both make us Partakers of the Grace of that Body and Blood, which were given for the Life of the World, and beſides alſo impart unto us, even in <hi>True and Reall</hi> though <hi>Myſtical</hi> manner, the very Perſon of our Lord himſelf whole perfect and intire as hath been ſhew'd.</q>
Theſe words may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive farther light from <hi>Biſhop Coſins's Hiſtory of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13.17, 18. Now they that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thus much, hold a <hi>Real Participation and

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi>; which is all that is requiſite to affirming a <hi>Real Preſence.</hi> And if they deny a Real Preſence they only reject <hi>a Term</hi> which may well enough be us'd; but perhaps be better let alone. The truth is what the Pamphlet attributes to <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> was as <hi>Bucer</hi> reports the tenent of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>; and as Mr <hi>Thorndike</hi> ſays of ſome <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> in the beginning of the late Rebellion.

to be prov'd, is that <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to the quotations <hi>is ſo Really Preſent</hi> in the Euchariſt, that the <hi>Elements</hi> ought to be Divinely worſhiped upon that account.
And if this be ſo, as I think I have plainly ſhewn, I leave the Reader to conſider with what confidence the Author quotes either Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> for his purpoſe, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly in the very quotation declares himſelf againſt him, ſaying <q>

I will not take advantage of his ambiguous expreſſions; but tell him that the <hi>King's,</hi> the <hi>Biſhop's,</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> meaning is very plain, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſince Chriſts Natural Body is not to be ador'd but where it is Corporally &amp; Locally Preſent; &amp; it is not ſo Preſent in the Euchariſt: that therefore in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (i. e. in the celebration) the worthy Communicant, to whoſe Soul that Body is really preſent, is to adore the perſon of Chriſt in heaven where alone his Body is Locally Preſent. This I doubt the Author very well knew, and ſaw it was no way contrary to the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherefore he ſeems to lay no great ſtreſs upon this firſt inference, but goes on <hi>Or at least</hi> 2<hi>ly.</hi>
               <q>And

here hee would have it bee infidious in the Church to <hi>deny</hi> that <hi>Adoration</hi> is due <hi>to a Corporal preſence,</hi>

               </q>
Now I cannot imagin that <hi>even this Author</hi> has the <hi>confidence</hi> to ſay the Church of England has not ſufficiently taught that Chriſt in Heaven is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable; or the ignorance to think that any good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is not ſufficiently aſſur'd of that point.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Title</hi> of this ſecond Diſcourſe does but ill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the deſign of it. For all the world knows that <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who ſhould be the <hi>Catholics</hi> this Author means, by a <hi>Real and Subſtantial</hi> underſtand a <hi>Corporal</hi> Preſence, and ground their Adoration upon it. Whereas the ſcope of this Diſcourſe is to ſhew, that the Papiſts in Adoring either do or may <hi>preſcind</hi> from Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation; and ground their Adoration <hi>preciſely</hi> upon the Reality of the Preſence: and by conſequence that Proteſtants eſpecially of the Church of England, who hold Chriſt Truly Preſent and Adorable in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt; ought upon their own Principles to joyn in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh adoration; or at leaſt abſolve them that do ſo from the guilt of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>What the Writers of the Church of England mean when they hold a <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> and in what ſenſe they teach us <hi>to Adore Chriſt's Body</hi> in the Sacrament; I hope I have already explain'd ſo fully, that I need make no repetition: ſo that the firſt ſix leaves of this Defence, will afford us little new matter, being chiefly taken up in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating ſome quotations in the firſt Diſcourſe; and aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at no more then a ſpecimen of Proteſtant conceſſions, which by what we have ſaid are ſufficiently guarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sophiſtry of his interpretations.

thereby puzzle the cauſe, I ſhall make it the buſineſs of this Chapter to ſpeak briefly to thoſe other paſſages that are moſt obſervable in the eight firſt Sections of this Defence.</p>

Nor ſhould we have demurr'd to <hi>the third,</hi> if we were not now acquainted with his inſidious and ſhuf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing way of talking.
But if we may explain our ſelves we grant him that <q>
                  <hi>Wherever the Body of our Lord is</hi> Locally <hi>Preſent, it is ſupremely Adorable</hi>
               </q>. We likewiſe grant him <q>that the Omnipreſent God may be ador'd, <hi>before</hi> or <hi>in the Preſence of</hi> any Creature</q>, (we on earth cannot wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him but in the preſence of ſome Creature) provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed allways we <hi>direct</hi> our Adoration <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>ſolely</hi> to <hi>him</hi>; not conſidering the Creatures preſent, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the outward act, much leſs the inward worſhip of the Heart, to any Creature upon the ſcore of Gods preſence.
For (taking <hi>Adoration</hi> for <hi>divine Worſhip</hi>) it is certainly <hi>Idolatry</hi> not only to adore a Creature, but even to make it (as I may ſo ſay) the <hi>vehicle</hi> of that adoration which wee direct to God, and terminate upon him alone. 'Tis true Chriſts natural Body abſtractedly conſider'd is a creature: but then it is for ever hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically united to the Deity; ſo that the whole perſon of Chriſt is that very Lord our God, <hi>whom wee muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and whom</hi> alone <hi>wee must ſerve.</hi> But no other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo united by virtue of God's preſence <hi>to</hi> or <hi>in</hi> or <hi>with</hi> that creature: and even that body is not ſo (i. e. hypoſtatically) united, but as it exiſts like other human bodies within ſome determinate local circumſcription: wherefore no other creature may bee ador'd; nor even Chriſt's Body but as it exiſts and is united, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by becomes adorable, where it is Locally preſent.</p>

This we likewiſe grant him, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready explain'd it according to the mind of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and ſo paſs over the quotations which take up the two next ſections, together with abundance of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that an adverſary might take: for we are now in purſuit of an argument, that is in ſome danger to be loſt in this miſt of quotations.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all the Conceſſions wherein the Church of

I ſee not what advantage this conceſſion gives to his cauſe, or how it is any way prejudiciall to ours. For the Lutherans hold a Local Preſence; wherefore ſome of them think they may adore; and if we could believe their <hi>Preſence</hi> we ſhould not conteſt their <hi>Adoration.</hi>

For, if he grant more then the Church of England does, ſhe is not bound to defend him: tho' in this caſe I think he does not; and ſo we may ſafely joyn with him in his conceſſions. For the reaſon why we cannot Communicate with the Church of Rome, is not barely becauſe ſhe holds an Error, but becauſe ſhe propoſes it under an <hi>Anathema</hi>; and grounds an <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous</hi> practice upon it; and requires our conſent to both theſe things as a <hi>term of Her Communion.</hi> This the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans do not: and therefore tho' their opinion be Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, their Communion need not be unlawful. Now to ſee with what judgment the Defender makes uſe of this conceſſion. He's to prove that Proteſtants by their own rules ought to joyn in the Popiſh adoration; and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is that <hi>Monſ.

               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 12.</note>Once more this Judicious Author appeals to <hi>M.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66095:25"/>
it were poſſible to adore one that is not Conſecrated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out committing <hi>formal</hi> Idolatry. Likewiſe <hi>He</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> grant that when Chriſt was upon Earth (where his perſon was confeſſedly adorable) a man that by inculpable miſtake had ador'd another perſon for him, might have likewiſe been abſolv'd from the guilt of <hi>formal</hi> Idolatry. And both theſe conceſſions are as certainly true, as certanly alleg'd to no purpoſe. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Author means the reaſon only, not the inſtances, to be pertinent, and would infer no more but that Papiſts by our own conceſſions may be no Idolaters though they Worſhip a Creature; becauſe they may do this by an <hi>inculpable miſtake.</hi> This I grant may be ſomething (not to his but) to the Papiſts purpoſe, if he prove them incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably miſtaken; but that <hi>We</hi> ſhould ſuppoſe them ſo, I cannot ſee why he ſhould pretend. For he knows that we think Tranſubſtantiation to be more then a miſtake; a flat and manifeſt defyance of Senſe and Reaſon, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Tradition; and in that reſpect more culpable then the groſſeſt Heathen miſtake: for they (to mention no other diſparity) wanted the Light of Scripture, which the Papiſts have, and ſhut their eyes againſt; and this in our opinion makes a vaſt difference between the Popiſh and Heathen Idolatry.</p>

               <q>Catholics affirm there is in the Euchariſt after conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, <hi>a Sign diſtinct</hi> and having a <hi>divers exiſtence</hi> from the <hi>thing ſignify'd.</hi>

A Sign there muſt be, ſays his own quotation out of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi> or there can be no Sacrament. Wherefore we preſume they hold a Sign. But then the Sign as they explain it, is neither the Sign inſtituted by Chriſt, (which doubleſs a Sacramental ſign ought to be) nor indeed any other Sign, but a Sign that ſignifies nothing. Then for the ſeparate Exiſtence of it, ſome Papiſts do not hold that neither; as the Author could not but ſee in that very place of Dr <hi>Taylor,</hi> which he refers to <hi>in this Section</hi>: which makes it ſomewhat ſtrange, that ſo liberal a quoter ſhould here be ſo unſeaſonably ſparing, as not to afford us one teſtimony that expreſsly owns this ſeparate Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence. But all Papiſts that will talk conſiſtently muſt deny it: not only becauſe an accident cannot exiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inherence; but becauſe they hold the Species uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Body to make one intire object of Adoration; which cannot be without a Hypoſtatical Union.

It ſeems that <q>they to the <hi>Sacramentum</hi> give an inferior <hi>cult</hi>; but Divine adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which I wonder why he would not call <hi>latry</hi>) to the <hi>Res Sacramenti</hi> only,<note place="margin">Ibid</note>

How <hi>Judicious</hi> this remark is, and how much for the Council's honor, may perhaps be queſtion'd: but how well 'tis apply'd to the preſent caſe, where the <hi>Canon</hi> is more <hi>ambiguous</hi> and therefore <hi>leſs exact</hi> then the <hi>Chapter</hi>; is a thing will admit of no diſpute: nor will any man conteſt <hi>this Author's</hi> title to ſo <hi>Judicious</hi> an application.</p>

               <q>That <hi>to adore the Sacrament</hi> is at moſt but an <hi>improper expreſſion.</hi> And ſays as <hi>magiſterially</hi> as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Soave</hi> did, that dutifull Children ought to learn of their Mother how to ſpeak</q>;<note place="margin">Diſc. 2. p. 17.</note> provided always (ſay I) that their <hi>Mother</hi> do not teach them to abuſe their <hi>Father</hi>; and if they cannot come at their Mother, or cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

            <p>HItherto the Author has been ranging; in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Section he ſeems to make a ſet.<note place="margin">Diſc. 2. pag. 19.</note>
               <q>He deny's that the Proteſtants give a true ſtate of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and his inſtance is in Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> whom his evill Genius ever prompts him to attacque; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his briskeſt attempts ſo conſtantly &amp; ſcandalouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſcarry.</q>
To him he joyns Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Taylor</hi>; whoſe words if they be pertinently apply'd here, are ſo diſingenuouſly quoted in other parts of this Pamphlet, that I doubt the Author's dealing will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a very <hi>improper expreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if Proteſtants ſtate the queſtion wrong; let us heare how this Author himſelf ſtates it.
<q>He reduces the whole controverſy to theſe two queſtions 1.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 20.</note> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Body and Blood of Chriſt (<hi>preſcinding</hi> from whatever ſymbol is or may be there) is adorable, as <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent</hi> in the Sacrament with the ſymbols? 2<hi>ly</hi> Whither the adoration of Chriſt's Body (and ſo of Chriſt) as preſent, if it ſhould not be ſo, will amount
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66095:28"/>
to <hi>Idolatry?</hi> allways ſuppoſing as he adds in the 17<hi>th Section,</hi> that we continue to adore the <hi>ſelf ſame object</hi> as the Papiſts now do, in the <hi>ſelf ſame place,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag 21.</note> with <hi>all the ſame circumſtances</hi> wherewith their adoration is now perform'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that I cannot take it upon this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's word, that Popes and Councils with the moſt and beſt of the Romiſh writers, have ſo abandon'd all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and ingenuity, as to ſay and practice what they have done, if they really meant no more then he pretends. For this were an <hi>improper expreſſion</hi> with a witneſs; an inſincerity that an honeſt Heathen would tremble at. Nor if one or two School-men were really of his mind, ſhould he that <hi>in the Guide</hi> is ſo great a ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler for <hi>majorities,</hi> here propoſe the opinion of a few for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn members, for the ſtanding Judgment of the whole Church. The true ſons of the Church of Rome are more ingenuous; and own that they believe, the ſpecies together with the Body, to make <hi>one intire object,</hi> to which they pay <hi>one intire act of adoration.</hi> For the truth of this together with a full ſtate and deciſion of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion I refer the Reader to a <note n="*" place="bottom">Printed at London 1685. for Brab. Ailmer and lately reprinted.</note> late excellent <hi>Diſcourſe concerning the Adoration of the Hoſt.</hi> For it is not my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent buſineſs to diſpute with Honeſt minded <hi>Papiſts,</hi> whoſe errors I heartily lament, and beſeech God to open their eyes; but with this <hi>ſhuffling writer,</hi> who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of no Church, would fain pin himſelf <hi>now</hi> upon the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>This</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is affirm'd by Catholics; more then this need not be ſo,</hi> and again,<note place="margin">Diſc 2. pag 20. l. 7. Ibid l. 2 Diſc 2. pag. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>The Roman Church owns or impoſes no more.</hi> So likewiſe §. 13. The definition of this Council in the ſixth canon, (<hi>more then which is not requir'd to be profeſs'd by any Son of the Roman Church</hi>) is this <hi>Si quis dixerit &amp;c.</hi> That is (as is declar'd more
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66095:29"/>
at large <hi>in the fifth diſcourſe of the Guide</hi>) the ſtreſs of all lyes upon <hi>ſi quis dixerit</hi> &amp; <hi>ſi quis negaverit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 186. p. 133.</note> So that if a man be but a little complaiſant in his practice and keep a good tongue in his head, let him be what he will in his heart, he may ſtill be one of <hi>this Author's Catholics,</hi> though I doubt none <hi>of the Church of Rome's.</hi>
               </q>
For though the greateſt ſins are with him but <hi>improper expreſſions,</hi> yet all honeſt men of the <hi>Roman</hi> or any other communion, will call his dealing by a <hi>proper expreſſion</hi> which I do not now care to name.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Controverſy between us and this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (for the Church of Rome is no way concern'd in his dreams) is briefly this.
<q>Whether <hi>preſcinding from Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and a Corporal Preſence, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>only</hi> a Real Preſence as the writers of the Church of England do, it is <hi>Idolatry</hi> to pay the <hi>ſelf ſame adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> with the <hi>ſelf ſame ceremonies</hi> to the <hi>ſelf ſame object</hi> in the <hi>ſelf ſame place and manner,</hi> that the Papiſts now pay it to the <hi>Conſecrated Elements?</hi>
               </q>
To this I anſwer <hi>Affirmatively</hi>; and hope I have already <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 7. par. 2. of this Reply.</note> given a good and ſufficient reaſon why I do ſo. It remains that I examin what the Author has to ſay for the <hi>Negative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt he ſaies <q>thoſe Proteſtants who abſolve the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> from Idolatry,<note place="margin">Diſc. 2. §. 19.</note> may, as he has ſtated the matter, as well abſolve <hi>his Catholics.</hi>
               </q>
To which I am not concern'd to anſwer, tho' tis falſe and eaſily confutable, becauſe his own ſtate excludes the conſideration both of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Lutheran</hi> Preſence as farr as either of them differ from the <hi>Church of England's</hi> Real Preſence.</p>
            <p>Come we therefore 2<hi>ly</hi> to the <hi>twenty firſt ſection,</hi> where he ſuppoſes both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> in an error; both <q>miſtaking Chriſt the true object of ſupreme Adoration to be in a place where he is not.</q>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 25.</note>
He ſhould add, and the Papiſts upon that miſtake adoring an object that is not at

all Adorable.
<q>Now this he ſays cannot be term'd any <hi>ſuch Idolatry,</hi> as is the Worſhip of an object not at all Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</q>
               <hi>Such</hi> or <hi>not ſuch</hi> is not properly the queſtion, but whether it be <hi>Idolatry</hi>? Wherefore I paſs by his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent trifling with <hi>his Angel</hi> and <hi>his Serpent</hi>; for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he ſhould anſwer is this. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees,</hi> who directed the <hi>outward</hi> act of adoration <hi>to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> were accounted <hi>Idolaters</hi> by God and the Primitive Church; notwithſtanding their own ſuppoſing, or the Author's ſuppoſing for them: and we by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſay that whoever pays the adoration aforeſaid <hi>to the Conſecrated Elements,</hi> let him ſuppoſe what he will, will for all his ſuppoſition commit <hi>an improper expreſſion</hi> which God and the Church will account <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

               <q>He ſays <hi>his Catholics</hi> freely grant, that a good intention grounded upon <hi>culpable</hi> ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance can excuſe none from <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </q>
We accept this Conceſſion and deſire to know if Popiſh ignorance be not Culpable how 'tis poſſible any Ignorance ſhould? 3.

                  <hi>He</hi> ſays that Monſ.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Daillé (and he ſuppoſes other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants with him) allow that a Ground or Motive of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration which is <hi>Reaſonable</hi> though not abſolutely <hi>certain,</hi> but actually <hi>miſtaken,</hi> is ſufficient for avoiding the <hi>juſt</hi> imputation of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Whence he infers that if Catholics can produce a rational ground of <hi>their</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Chriſt preſent in the Euchariſt, tho' poſſibly miſtaken in it, they are to be excus'd from Idolatry</q>: at leaſt by thoſe Proteſtants who excuſe the Lutherans: and ſo he proceeds to ſhew his Rational Grounds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:66095:30"/>I think it an eaſy undertaking to ſhew a vaſt diſparity between the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> in this point; but not very pertinent at this time. For neither of thoſe parties is concern'd in the queſtion as 'tis now ſtated by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.

Now to this the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop excepts <hi>p.</hi> 251. as a Synod pack'd and overaw'd by that exorbitant Pope, which neither had nor alleg'd any Scripture to vouch their definitions: A truth, of which the whole world is by this time very well ſatisfi'd. But to ſpeak diſtinctly of theſe eight Supreme Univerſall Church-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities; <note n="*" place="bottom">See Bp.

Wherefore the Gallican Churches defy'd 'em both, and <hi>Victor</hi> was fain to ſend <hi>Hildebrand</hi> into France; where he pick'd up another little Synod at <hi>Tours,</hi> and once more condemn'd <hi>Berengarius.</hi> The expreſs Judgment of theſe three ſmall Univerſal meetings is not certainly known: But if we may gueſs by the deciſion of the next Roman Synod under <hi>Nicholas II</hi> they believ'd according to the form, which <hi>Humbert</hi> and <hi>Hildebrand</hi> then contriv'd for <hi>Berengarius</hi> to recant in. About 18 years after, when <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand</hi> himſelf was Pope, and his infallibility began to blome, he conven'd another Roman Synod, and propos'd a more correct form; which he forc'd <hi>Berengarius</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to; <note n="*" place="bottom">Labbe.

So that five of theſe eight Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Univerſal Church-authorities, were govern'd by one man, who ſcarce knew his own mind: and one whoſe character; as many of the Papiſts give it; would have made Sr. <hi>Thomas More</hi> ſay of him too, that <hi>he would not for

A Council that defin'd Angels to be Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, and Stocks and Stones to be worſhipped: in ſhort a Council that ſhould have defin'd Tranſubſtantiation, though it did not: for the world never ſaw an aſſembly better fitted, to define a condradiction to Scripture Senſe and Reaſon. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Bp. Coſin's Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Tranſubſtantiation cap. 7. §. 30.</note> Yet even this Council came not up to our Author's terms, any more then the <hi>Council of Florence,</hi> which he quotes to as little purpoſe.

Now to muſter up the forces of theſe nine Generall Councils; here are ſeven of 'em nothing to the purpoſe; the Eighth of very doubtfull, if not very ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Authority; the Ninth leaves our Faith at liberty, and would only bridle our Tongues; propoſing no grounds of believing, but a ſwinging curſe for talking.</p>
            <p>Our Author himſelf ſeems a little diffident of this ground,<note place="margin">Diſc. 2. pag. 29. §. 26.</note> for a better reaſon too then a man would expect from <hi>him.</hi>

Wherefore he endeavours to goad up his pretenſions ſome two or three hundred years higher; though all in vain as long as he is deſtitute of truly primitive Antiquity.

But to ſave him that labour if we can; let us firſt ſee what will become of us if we grant this ground; viz. the Univerſal Doctrine and Practice of the later both <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches till Luther's time. Now to this ground likewiſe the Arch-Biſhop has effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in divers places. <hi>p.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 380. <hi>and eſpecially from p.</hi> 405. <hi>to the end of the Book.</hi> The ſumm is that the true Church &amp; Doctrine are to be judg'd by their agreement to Scripture &amp; Antiquity; not always to be meaſur'd by the majority of viſible Profeſſors. For that may be often overrun with dangerous error; (as de facto it was among the Jews even by our Authors own confeſſion, <hi>in his book of the benefits of our Saviour cap.</hi> 9.) Wherefore the general Example is not always a rational ground of Practice; and a reaſonable man will conſider the reaſon of the practice, he complies with; and bring a Doctrine <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa VIII.20.</note> 
               <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimnyo,</hi> before he yields up his aſſent to it. This we preſume <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. XI.4. 1 King.

               <hi>little flock</hi> which God hath ever had and will have to the end of the world; not ſwimming with <hi>our Author's ſtream</hi> though never ſo impetuous,<note place="margin">Diſc. 2. §. 27. p. 31.</note> but weighing all things in <hi>the ballance of the Sanctuary.</hi> For if prevalence and preſcription were a rational and ſufficient ground of practice, and the viſible

majority of the Church ſhould fall into a Damnable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, (which thing certainly may be, becauſe it has been) the Church might lawfully perſiſt in that Damnable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, nor would it be oblig'd to eject the moſt ſcandalous corruption that had once got peaceable poſſeſſion. This we think a ſufficient, and give it as the ſhorteſt, anſwer to <hi>this ground</hi> conſider'd with the utmoſt advantage whereof it is capable; viz. ſuppoſing (<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. Feild's Appendix to his third Book of the Church, wherein he proves that the Latin Church was and continu'd a true Orthodox and Proteſtant Church and that the maintainers of Romish Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors were only a Faction in the ſame at the time of Luther's appearing.</note> what is falſly challeng'd) <hi>the univerſal doctrine and practice of the later Church till Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> But otherwiſe we could both tell him, and prove beyond all poſſibility of a fair Reply, that the controverſy laſted above three hudred years before Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could be lick'd into any ſhape; and that at laſt it was ſetled in an age, of which the Papiſts themſelves give ſo ſcandalous a Character, that no Hiſtory can tell us of a majority more unlikely to ſway a knowing or a virtuous man. We could ſhew him that the Univerſality, he talks of, muſt exclude the <hi>Abiſſines,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> the <hi>Maronites,</hi> and abundance of other Chriſtians; nay the much more valueable part of the <hi>Latin Church</hi> it ſelf. For though the Pope, when he was ſtrong enough to exerciſe <hi>the Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his Power,</hi> made his Enemies and their Writeings as inviſible as fire and ſmoke could; yet ſtill there remain the undoubted Monuments of a long viſible Succeſſion all declaring againſt Tranſubſtantiation; for a collection of whoſe Teſtimonies the world has lately been oblig'd to a member of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion.</p>
            <p>His <hi>laſt ground</hi> is the ſame with the foremoſt of his firſts; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Conceſſions of Proteſtants.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diſc. 2. § 28. p. 31.</note>
               <q>For he's at it once more that the Genuine Sons of the Church of England hold our Saviour to be Really Preſent and Adorable in
<pb n="[58]" facs="tcp:66095:34"/>
the Sacrament.</q>
Which has been ſo often ſayd, &amp;, I hope, ſo fully anſwer'd before, that I ſhall take no farther no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it now. I ſhall only tell him as the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tells <hi>Gardiner</hi> upon the like occaſion, that he ſeems to be in great diſtreſs, when he flyes for refuge to thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, whom at other times he abhors as Heretics; but his application to them is in vain; for they are far from meaning any ſuch thing as he pretends.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 32.</note>
               <q>In the <hi>cloſe of this Paragraph</hi> he looks back upon all theſe Pleas of Catholics, and invites us to ſee if they will not make up at leaſt a <hi>reaſonable</hi> Ground or motive of their Adoration.</q>
Now I muſt profeſs that I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it, as he has order'd the matter. For though I believe a man of art out of theſe five grounds, might have made a <hi>plauſible</hi> though not a <hi>rational</hi> plea; to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion this Author has left the Papiſts in a much worſe caſe, then he found them. For 1. he offers nothing to excuſe them from Idolatry, but the Conceſſions of one or two Proteſtants, which 'tis evident come not home to his purpoſe; becauſe they whom the Proteſtants excuſe are ſuppos'd inculpably miſtaken; and not at all miſtaken in the object of their Adoration. 2. He ingages the Papiſts upon a very difficult, or rather an impoſſible <hi>preciſion,</hi> both becauſe it is contrary to what they have been taught; and becauſe they are all bound under a ſevere Anathema to believe Tranſubſtantiation; ſo that a Papiſt can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver explain this term [<hi>Reall Preſence</hi>] to himſelf, but by this other of [<hi>Corporal Preſence effected by Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>] 3. Having invited the Papiſts to wave that Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Preſence, for which they think they have a great many arguments; he propoſes Adoration founded on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other notion; for which he has not offer'd them ſo much as one argument. So that in ſhort he propoſes what no body is like to practice, upon the ſole ſtrength
<pb n="[59]" facs="tcp:66095:34"/>
of a Doctrine for which he has nothing to ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In the next place he complains that <hi>theſe five Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal grounds</hi> are not ſtrictly examin'd by the Proteſtants.</q>
               <note place="margin">Diſc. 2. §. 29 p. 32.</note>
But we think otherwiſe; and muſt leave the indifferent Reader to Judg between us. We think they were effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally anſwer'd by the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> above an hundred years agoe; and by divers other writers ſince; eſpecially the Author of a late Incomparable <hi>Diſcourſe againſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi>: which all the <hi>Poſſe</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will never be able to anſwer any otherwiſe then they did the <hi>Arch-Biſhop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore the Defender muſt allow us to retain our old opinion of thoſe Proteſtants, whom he cenſures ſo freely in <hi>the remaining part of this paragraph.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 33.</note> We ſhall ſtill think that <hi>Monſ. Daillé</hi> had reaſon; and made a true reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>Popery</hi> into <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi>; that <hi>Biſhop Taylor</hi> has prov'd as well as ſaid, that <hi>the Papiſts pretences to the Fathers are but few and trifling</hi>; that what the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender quotes out of <hi>Liberty of prophecying,</hi> is a very good argument againſt the literall ſenſe; and that the Biſhop while he pleaded for the Papiſts did <hi>prudently</hi> to omit Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic tradition; which he knew was not on theyr ſide. We ſhall ſtill profeſs with Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> that the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Idolatry in the world has as fair a plea as the Popiſh; and conclude that this Trifler finding fault with him, has not <hi>ex- but inexcuſeably miſtaken</hi> the Doctor's argument; as will appear by comparing his words with what the Dr. ſays <hi>Rom: Idolatry cap.</hi> 2. §. 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 132.133. Laſtly we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that if Tranſubſtantiation were warranted by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic tradition, Adoration were ſufficiently grounded; and cannot but ſmile, as <hi>Craſſus</hi> did upon a like occaſion, to ſee how gingerly the Defender nibbles at this conceſſion.
<q>He ſeems to ſay that Tradition is for Tranſubſtantiation,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> yet he waves that, and pleads only for a Corporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</q>
               <pb n="[60]" facs="tcp:66095:35"/>
which for any thing he ſays here may be taken in a Lutheran ſenſe; though (to talk with him in his own language) if Tranſ— be true Conſubſtantiation muſt needs be fals.
And what's all this to <hi>his</hi> purpoſe, who pretends to <hi>abſtract</hi> from both? and ground his Adoration <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely</hi> upon a Real Preſence?</p>
            <p>And now 'tis my turn to addreſs to the <hi>indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>; and if he have either read Mr. <hi>Thorndike's Epilogue,</hi> or but carefully conſider'd this Author's quotations out of it, to ask his opinion about theſe two or three queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. Whether this Author has in all this whole Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet expresſly own'd himſelf a <hi>Roman-Catholic?</hi> or rather skulk'd under the general name of <hi>Catholic</hi> taken in the ſame latitude, Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> takes it in his <hi>Epilogue?</hi> 2 Whether all his ſhuffling be not only to advance Mr <hi>Thorndike's</hi> new and ſingular notion of <hi>a preſence of Chriſt's body in, or with, or under the Elements</hi> (§. 28. p. 32.) diſtinct from the Church of Englands Real, and the Papiſts and Lutherans Corporal Preſence? In ſhort, not a Virtual, nor Spiritual, but a Corporal Preſence, <hi>effected neither by con — nor Tranſubſtantiation, but after ſome other unknown manner diſtinct from both</hi>? (§. 17. p. 21.) 3 Whether a new and upſtart doctrine which was probably never thought of before Mr <hi>Thorndike's</hi> time, ought to paſs for a doctrine of the Primitive Church? 4 Whether the man that plays theſe tricks be an honeſt Papiſt? And whether the <hi>humble Christian</hi> that ſwallows them muſt not have a very <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble underſtanding</hi>?</p>

So that the charge of it would in his opinion light heavy upon the Papiſts; and at the rebound equally hurt the Church of England,
<pb n="[62]" facs="tcp:66095:36"/>
which derives her Succeſſion and Ordination from the Church of Rome.
This miſtaken opinion the Defender greedily lays hold on; and ask's with great briskneſs <q>
                  <hi>What Church or Sect of religion can be apoſtate at all,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>if not a Church committing and commanding Idolatry</hi>?</q>
I muſt deſire him to reconcile this pert queſtion with another as pert, in the book <hi>of the Benefits of our Saviour chap.</hi> 9. §. 14.
<q>
                  <hi>And now</hi> (ſays he) <hi>what can hinder God's goodneſs, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay the Church, ſince 'tis plain that ſin cannot?</hi>
               </q> even the ſin of <hi>Idolatry</hi> as is proved at large in the two foregoing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For when he does this, he will return the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon anſwer to that objection wherein he now ſides with Mr <hi>Thorndike.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>The next is Biſhop <hi>Forbes</hi> in his <hi>Conſiderationes modeſtae &amp; pacificae</hi>; whoſe deſign and character is ſo well known, and ſo obvious to any man that has but ever look'd upon his book, that I think the Reader will need no farther information how <hi>exceſſive</hi> his charity was in this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 35.</note>Thirdly Arch-Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> concludes that very Section, which our author quotes, with theſe words.
<q>Tho' the Church of Rome do give divine worſhip to a Creature (or at leaſt a party among them) yet I am ſo <hi>charitable</hi> as to hope they intend it to the Creator.</q>
It may be the Defender will reply now that he does not ſay <hi>exceſſively charitable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>Fourthly 'tis notorious that Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> wrote his <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of prophecying</hi> to ſerve the intereſt of the Church of England; which at that time was to obtain a general to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration. Wherefore it concern'd him in that book to be <hi>more then a Conciliator,</hi> and repreſent Popery with the utmoſt favour it would bear. Yet he could not even in that book ſo diſſemble his Zeal againſt Popery, but that in the <hi>very Paragraph, our Author quotes,</hi> he accuſes the Papiſts <hi>confidence,</hi> and <hi>Fancifull Opinion,</hi> which makes them
<pb n="[63]" facs="tcp:66095:36"/>
               <hi>doe violence to all Philoſophy, and the Reaſon of man, and undoe and cancel the Principles of two or three Sciences.</hi> And theſe words, which, one would think, are not ſo very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable and abſolving, lye juſt between the two ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Defender has tranſcrib'd. In the next paragraph he calls <hi>Idolatry the crime which Papiſts formally hate, and we materially avoid.</hi> And again, in the next to that, ſays <hi>If they who do as the Papiſts do, are not formally guilty of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try there is no danger their diſciples ſhould be ſo.</hi> So that he plainly owns them guilty of material, and dares not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to acquit them even of formal Idolatry.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Notwithſtanding the Defender goes on at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">Diſc. 2. pag. 31. §. 35.</note>
and will have it <hi>a fault</hi> in Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> to ſay in <hi>one book,</hi> that if Papiſts are deceiv'd in Tranſubſtantiation, it is certain they commit an act of Idolatry; whereas he ſays <hi>in another</hi> that <hi>'tis evident the Object &amp;c. is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true and Eternal God &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> which ſeems to be a very courſe Complement to his Reader; for it either ſuppoſes him ſo Lazy as not to look back, what words thoſe <hi>&amp; ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera's</hi> ſtood for, or (if he did) ſo dull as not to ſee, that Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in both theſe quotations only charges the Papiſts with <hi>material Idolatry.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
               <q>He will likewiſe have <hi>M. Daillé</hi> to be <hi>faulty,</hi> for oppoſing the Papiſts with ſuch a form of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as would prove the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to worſhip a mite.</q>
But inſtead of his miſerable <hi>that-which ſolution,</hi> let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the word [<hi>joyned</hi>] in the <hi>major</hi> of his own Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm, by [<hi>Conſubſtantiate</hi>] (as he muſt do, if he mean to oppoſe the <hi>Lutherans</hi>) and hee'll find that it has four terms.
In the third place, faulty with him is Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> for two or three reaſons, <q>which as they have been urg'd, ſo they have been anſwer'd before.</q>
But he tell's us in good time, <q>that Catholics grant as much as the Dr. that the Preſence of the Divine Nature in any thing is no good ground to pay Divine Worſhip
<pb n="[64]" facs="tcp:66095:37"/>
to that thing.</q>
For he hop'd we had forgot his <hi>abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> from a Corporal, and grounding his adoration <hi>preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> upon a Real Preſence, we deſire he will ſtick to this grant and that ſuppoſal, and then ſhew what trick he has left to evade Idolatry.<note place="margin">Diſc. 2. pag. 36, 37. § 31.</note> "He concludes, <hi>All theſe are faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I ſay.</hi>
               <q>Why ſo Poſitive good Sir? why becauſe they charge the Papiſts with worſhiping a Creature inſtead of Chriſt, from which other Proteſtants cleare them.</q>
But what if the Chargers give better reaſons then the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? Or what if the Chargers are the far greater number? is a <hi>majority the Guide's</hi> beloved argument, grown out of Favour? Or what if the Chargers and the Clearers both agree in the matter of fact? as indeed they do: for the one part only ſays that the Papiſts worſhip Bread; and the other that 'tis true they do ſo, but 'tis more then they mean to do. To conclude, the Papiſts direct the act of adoration to the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> ſuppoſing Chriſt to be Locally preſent under them: but if Chriſt be not ſo, but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread inſtead of him (as the Proteſtants affirm and prove) then the Papiſts who intentionally worſhip Chriſt, do actually pay their Worſhip to Bread inſtead of him; which is all the Proteſtants accuſe them of: For that act is as certainly a ſpecies of Idolatry, as the object has the ſpecies of Bread.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Diſc. 2. pag. 37. §. 35.</note>The fifth and laſt Proteſtant Author, that is quoted, is the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>; <q>who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Defender ſeems to Charge the Papiſts rather with a material then Formal Idolatry: and this mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Idolatry, we are told, like material Adultery may in many caſes be committed without Sin.</q>
This latter Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I believe is none of Dr. <hi>Hammond's,</hi> for tis contrary to plain Scripture. For when <hi>Abimelech (Gen, XX.)</hi> had like to have committed material Adultery with <hi>Sarah</hi> and being reprov'd in a Dream, pleaded <hi>the innocence of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>;
<pb n="[65]" facs="tcp:66095:37"/>
God acknowledges this innocence, and ſays, <hi>For I alſo with-held thee from ſinning againſt me therefore I ſuffer'd thee not to touch her v.</hi> 6. ſo that it ſeems the <hi>act</hi> had been a ſin againſt God,<note place="margin">v 5.</note> notwithſtanding <hi>Abimelech</hi>'s doing it <hi>in the integrity of his heart and the innocence of his hands.</hi> But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>; 'tis plain he has heartily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſtrain his charity, and yet for all that cenſures the Papiſts as ſeverely as any ſober Proteſtant ever did. And the Reader will be fully ſatisfy'd of this truth; if he pleaſe to conſult (for it would be too much to tranſcribe) the <note n="*" place="bottom">§ 63. He delivers himſelf to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. To Worship the Bread in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament muſt certainly be Idolatry, in the literal notion of the Word, and they that do this upon any the ſubtileſt ground, that by any error or miſtake (be it never ſo piouſly taken up) believe it not to be Bread, but very Chriſt incarnate, and thereupon Worship it: theſe, I ſay, in caſe they be miſtaken, though they are not guilty of Idolatry in <hi>all</hi> the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that belong'd to it among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; yet I cannot free them from the Charge of Worshiping an Idol, &amp;c.</note> nine Sections which the Dr has writ upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; beginning §. 63. <hi>of his diſcours of Idolatry,</hi> I aſſure my ſelf the mildeſt cenſure, that can be paſſed upon the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, will be, that he never read that <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>
But he thinks he has launc'd us to the quick:<note place="margin">Diſc. 2. pag. 37. § 32.</note> 
               <q>when he puts us in mind of our Forefathers, who for many centuryes were ſuch Idolaters, as we make the preſent Papiſts.</q>
Poor man! where has he been ſleeping theſe fifty years? that he knows not this ſtale objection has been ſo often urg'd and anſwer'd, that all underſtanding Papiſts are now aſham'd to make uſe of it.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this we are likely to part good friends for he tells us <q>
                  <hi>his</hi> Catholics grant it is unlawful to worſhip the bread, if we do not believe it to be God;<note place="margin">Ibid. §. 33.</note> or direct the outward act to our Lord as [Corporally] preſent in the Sacrament, if we do not believe him ſo preſent.</q>
Thus inſtead of defending <hi>his</hi> Catholics for adoring, he graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſolves the Proteſtants for not adoring. As for what he adds of <hi>ſubmitting our Judgment to the Church</hi>; that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="[66]" facs="tcp:66095:38"/>
to the preſent purpoſe: For he knows that we inſiſt upon it that Popery in this point, does directly and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly overthrow all the principles of Senſe, of Reaſon, &amp; Religion, and we are not ſo ſingular in this opinion, but that Papiſts themſelves own, they cannot in this queſtion pretend to Scripture without firſt defying Senſe &amp; Reaſon.</p>
            <p>In the laſt Section the Defender propoſes two Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he thinks the moſt material in this diſpute.
<q>1.<note place="margin">Diſc. 2. pag. 38. § 34.</note> Whether the Popiſh <hi>grounds</hi> of believing Chriſt's <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> Preſence [viz: as effected by Tranſubſtantiation] be <hi>Solid and true</hi>? to which we anſwer <hi>Negatively.</hi> 2. Whether the Church of Rome, <hi>as a term of communion in this point, exact</hi> any more then the acknowledgment of <hi>a Real Preſenſe?</hi> to which we anſwer, that to our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion ſhe does.</q>
For ſhe requires us under an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi> to believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi>: which whoever does, muſt define a Real Preſence to be a Corporal Preſence ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Tranſubſtantiation. So that the preſcinding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient this Author offers, would have us preſcind from the definition of the object, <hi>i. e.</hi> to conſider a thing, preſcinding from the thing that we conſider; which the Papiſts have more wit then to propoſe to us. 2 that if ſhe did not,<note place="margin">Diſc. 2. §. 17. p. 21.</note> it would not ſerve the turn. For ſhe requires us even by this Author's confeſſion, to bow down before the Elements; which, if Chriſt's Body be not Locally Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Euchariſt, we have prov'd to be Idolatry, be the bow never ſo preſcinding. For to worſhip the true God by an <hi>Hoſt,</hi> is in effect all one as to worſhip him by an image; which is as truly, though not ſo groſs, Idolatry as to worſhip an image inſtead of him.</p>
            <p>And now (as the Defender ſays) <hi>Hitherto of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy:</hi> wherein if I have chiefly conſider'd my Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye's management, 'tis becauſe a Scholar ſhould be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd; but a Jugler need only be detected.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>The Cloſe.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Having taken ſo diſtinct a view of both the Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I know not whether I muſt beg the Reader's pardon for conſidering ſo much of 'em; or demand the Author's thanks for ſparing what I have paſs'd over. The Controverſy it ſelf would have lain in a little room; but the Author's handling it gives an adverſary ſo large a field of matter, as would eaſily furniſh a very voluminous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. My aim in this was to make it as ſhort as was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without omitting any thing material; and I'm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident I have not, I'm ſure I have not willingly, omitted or diſſembled the force of any one line, that ſeem'd to make againſt the Church of England.</p>
            <p>The Quotations in the Pamphlet are many and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tedious; none of 'em ſincere, and moſt of 'em twice or thrice repetaed. To have-publiſh'd 'em intire, would have taken up more paper then this anſwer does: nor would a recitall have ſuffic'd, without ſome reflexion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; after all the Reader is no more bound to truſt me then him; but for full ſatisfaction muſt recurr to the Authors themſelves. Wherefore I concluded it the ſhorter &amp; better way, to give the ſenſe of our Church and thoſe Authors in plain &amp; eaſy terms; ſo that the common Reader might be his own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter; and without any farther aſſiſtance make a right conſtruction of what the Pamphlet would pervert.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps may fancy my Reflexions are ſometimes too ſevere, upon ſo little ſeeming provocation; and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times too light for ſo ſerious a ſubject as I treat of. I confeſs I could not always diſſemble my juſt abhorrence of the Author's inſincerity; which I take to be the Sin in the world that an honeſt man can leaſt pardon. Had the Author been a true ſincere Papiſt, as well my inclination
<pb n="[68]" facs="tcp:66095:39"/>
as my duty would have made me treat him with reſpect, for ſimple error is an object of compaſſion to be dealt with in the ſpirit of meekneſs: but Hypocriſy is the common averſion of God and Man; and ought to be abhor'd and ſtigmatiz'd. As for lighter Anſwers, I think I have never given them, but when they were requiſite in reply to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical objections; for nothing can be more ridiculous then a ſolemn confutation of a Jeſt. The Author indeed ſeems to talk with great gravity all the way; but his matter for the moſt part is of a quite contrary Character: and in ſuch a caſe the Grimace does but add to the Comedy and make it the more neceſſary to return an anſwer in kind.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid has been the ſhorter, becauſe my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary has been twice anſwer'd already: both profeſſedly by the Author of the late <hi>Reply printed at London</hi>; and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally by thoſe other worthy men that have conſider'd the ſeveral parts of the <hi>Guide in Controverſy.</hi> For there is not an argument, nor a quotation, nor ſcarce a ſentence in either of theſe Diſcourſes, but is almoſt <hi>verbatim</hi> in that Guide aforeſaid; which contains the whole ſtock of the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; the ſumm and ſubſtance of all they have to ſay, if they write as many books as <hi>Toſtatus.</hi> 'Twas but t'other day that a great part of theſe Diſcourſes was again prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Book of Church-Govenment</hi>; and for ought I find we muſt expect the ſame ſtuff word for word, in every book they are to publiſh. But at this rate inſtead of being anſwerd they deſerve to be indicted for extortion. For the buyer of their book pays unconſcionable uſe upon uſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the nauſeouſneſs of the tautology. Wherefore for my own part I now take my final leave of them; and reſolve, not ſo much as to inquire what other books the Editor's preſs is big with. And perhaps when other Readers are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of his proceedings, the edition of his books will not need to be ſtinted to twenty thouſand of a ſort in a year.</p>
