            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

former expresse incouragements ministred to us by pregnant passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of great note and observation with us in certain Declarations
or Ordinances of Parliament, which except need be, we are loath
to repeat) God had lately put it into the heart of the Parliament,
to consider the just and mercifull accommodation of tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.
Which makes us the more amazed and astonished at the
sudden prejudice wee seeme to have received in their affections,
and the varied, yea, contrary aspect both of Parliament and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
upon us, who are no other then wee were before, and have
continued in your severall and respective service and assistance,
with the same faithfulnesse since as ever: Wherein God hath been
very mercifull unto us, (whether it be acknowledged to us or no,
it must be acknowledged by us to him) that hath made us faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

<hi>Esau</hi>) to sell our Birth-right for a messe of pottage, nor our hopes
in your Justice and Clemency, for the quiet injoyment of it, for a
thing of naught. Wee hope this seeming remission and intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of these Counsels of peace in behalfe of us, shall but make
them rebound the higher, and run the stronger. And therefore
wee cease not to pray for you, (most just Senators) that God
would hide repentance from your eyes; that the Lord that stirr'd

(under Christ) wanting to make us live quietly by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

setting the Fathers, the nursing-fathers of the Church (those that
should be so) against their children? And indeed excuse us, if when
wee consider how faire wee were for a good issue of the common
troubles of late, when God gave us those many Occasions, and
those solemne opportunities of praise and thanksgiving, when some
can say (if ever) they found their hearts then drawn forth in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

sense of the words and phrases commonly, holding forth to us a

in Christ, but to be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Him:
Or your intention was reall, as indeed purposing to gratifie and
accommodate us after the Rule agreed upon for the Kingdome;
and so there was reality in your words, which is that alone that
honest men will offer, and wise men consider; and if so, this design
was either good or evill: if evill, then it might not be undertaken
for the greatest good that could come thereof; and why do you
not retract and repent publikely of giving such hopes in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations?
But if it were good and just, why is it not pursued?
Whether these do call upon you audibly, being your own words,

they fain would, but cannot live upon it? God forbid all our
priviledge should be, that wee shall be last eaten, that when you
have done with the more dangerous enemy, you should turn your
hand upon us; shall this foul blot of ingratitude lie upon you?
Will you so bury all your fame and glorious achievements in so

who hope for this, as an additionall recompence (next to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties

<hi>for such</hi> things so deeply, and is not the bridge of retractation

            <p>Consider these things, and take heed what you doe unto these
men; the Lord hath made <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a burdensome stone, that shall
crush all that attempt to remove her. If our Way be of God, you
cannot overthrow it; You may shew your selves fighters against
God, and get the reward of such, and that's all. Take heed of
walking contrary unto God, of casting shame on those, on whom
he hath reflected such eminent honour, both in the Army and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise:
For I aske you, By whom hath God more deliver'd us

who have oftner put to flight the <hi>Armies of the Aliens</hi> in the North,

            <p>I would end, as I began, in the spirit of love and meeknesse;
<hi>Consider your calling Brethren, that you are called unto peace;</hi> and take
our Lord Jesus Christ for an example, who though he was Lord
of all, yet became a servant unto all. He was further above his
Disciples in knowledge and understanding, then the wisest among
us above the simplest Infant; yet he disdain'd them not, provoked
them not, upbraided them not, punisht them not, taught them as
they were able to beare; after his resurrection comes to them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

            <p>Were not the nature of my discourse indifferent and generall,
I might say somewhat, which might not onely induce liberty, (as

the <hi>Congregationall way</hi> in speciall. I will say but this;<note n="a" place="margin">The <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall way</hi> characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</note> 
               <hi>The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of this societie grow up freely unto it; act freely in it to mutuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and edification; they meddle with their own things, and are not busie
with others, without authoritie from Christ: They are ready to advise,
and be advised upon every lawfull call and needfull occasion: They count
not themselves perfect, but stand ready to receive further light, yea, though
from the meanest of the Brethren: They aspire to be punctuall, yet they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
many graines to other Churches, so they have the substance: They are
no otherwise Independent, but as they depend more upon Christ, and lesse
upon men: Though their first and immediate ragards be to their own, yet
they count themselves debters to all the Churches and members of Christ:
They will doe what good they can to rectifie the mistakes of others that are
not of them, but know no remedy but patience, if the truth fall not upon
all mens apprehensions: They say not more might not be done or devised to
reclaime men from errours, but they say they have Commission for no more
then they practise, and they dare not say a Confederacy with any meanes,
with which the Lord hath not said a Confederacy by his Institution: They
boast not in their Way, as approving it selfe to flesh and bloud, but as a
way of faith, justified onely of the Children of Wisdome, that have
learnt to put off their owne understanding and fleshly dependance in the
things of God, and to lay the weight of all on Christ, who hath given his
Word for it. Lastly, They will communicate in all Ordinances with any
true Church of Christ, that walks up to their light, and shews a readines
to receive whatsoever more shall be shewed them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now take this <hi>Way,</hi> and compare it with any other, wisely, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
and impartially, according to that<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Saviour; and wee will stand to the issue and arbitrament of it.
Let that Way which rases the foundation of mans glory, and

or doe, resolving all into his care of them, and presence among
them; be acknowledged, countenanced, and practised among us,
as the Way and truth of God, having no unrighteousnesse in it.</p>
            <p>And let that Way which neglecting or denying Christs suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency

of power and authoritie, be discarded as the way of man.</p>
            <p>And if wee after all our casting and contriving, cannot come to
you, see (if you would not be wanting to this Accord which you

question, but <hi>all</hi> that are godly could most heartily doe, as some
of you have exprest in termes upon serious consideration of our
Way, (for what is there to offend you, but a further degree of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
aymed at in the body, the worship being alike in both?)
and others in termes aequivalent, as that they beleeve it will not
cease till it come to this Way, which they grant was the Primitive
way, and is the purest, and the <hi>Presbyterian way</hi> is but a step there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and will rest here as its center, and end in this as its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For our parts, wee have waited mannerly all this while, and
wee are heartily grieved, that the particulars of difference between
us remaine yet so many, nay, that there are any, and especially
so important, that we cannot yeeld to you therein. For as he said
