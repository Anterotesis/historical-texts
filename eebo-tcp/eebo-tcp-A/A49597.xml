            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough all the parts of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> have their ſeveral <hi>excellencies,</hi> and <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> yet may we juſtly, in point of <hi>extent,</hi> aſſign the preheminence to <hi>Morality.</hi> For, if the Dictates of <hi>this</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53906:3"/>
laſt, by a natural currency, diffuſe themſelves into all humane <hi>Tranſactions,</hi> ſo as that whatever is done by Man derives its approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſallowance from a conſonancy or oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereto, what can be leſs ſaid of It, then that it hath a general influence over <hi>Mankind,</hi> that all <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Nature</hi> is its adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate ſubject, and that all <hi>Action,</hi> as well that of thoſe of the higheſt, as thoſe of the loweſt rank, falls under the verge of it's <hi>Direction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53906:3"/>
Hence came it, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ancient <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> they who moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly apply'd themſelves to the cultivation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of <hi>Morality,</hi> were look'd upon as the greateſt <hi>Exemplars</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and had, from their nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Auditors, all the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and reſpects, which generous Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the happy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and civilization of their Countries could with juſtice expect: whilſt thoſe others, whoſe ſtudies

tranſcended the capacities of the <hi>Many,</hi> were forc'd to content themſelves with the applauſe and acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, this Conſideration may be preſs'd yet further, if we come to weigh the obligations, which the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> parts of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> have to <hi>This.</hi> For, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we reflect on the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts,</hi> ſearching into the miraculous abyſſes of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> or on the <hi>Politician,</hi> contriving the <hi>Government</hi> of Nations, by a ſtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
<pb facs="tcp:53906:4"/>
into their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> or laſtly on the <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomiſt,</hi> regulating his <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> and <hi>domeſtick</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, we muſt affirm, that their ſeveral attempts will not attain their propoſed accompliſhment, without the concurrence and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Morality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, Sir, were the Prerogatives of <hi>Morality</hi> while its <hi>Precepts</hi> were gently conducive to the happy <hi>conduct</hi> of mens <hi>lives.</hi> But into what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
<pb facs="tcp:53906:5"/>
hands it hath fallen of late years, and how it hath been diſorder'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd into peſtilent and pernicious deductions, I am unwilling to preſs at this time; wiſhing only, that the preſent Age may be ſo happy, as to weather out the miſchievous <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> wherewith extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant <hi>Caſuiſme</hi> hath ſo ſtrangely peſter'd it.</p>
            <p>As to the preſent Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of <hi>Maximes,</hi> I am to acknowledge, that the greateſt part of it was
<pb facs="tcp:53906:5"/>
made by a perſon of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Quality in <hi>France.</hi> The ſeveral Editions of it <hi>there,</hi> and in the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> ſufficiently argue its kind reception among the Ingenious, in thoſe parts. That it will be in ſome meaſure kindly entertain'd here, I have ſome encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to hope; and this, partly from the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> and <hi>Novelty</hi> of the things themſelves, and partly from their <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to a Perſon, who, by his engagement in <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies</hi>

God only, who hath the guidance of all mens hearts, and the abſolute diſpoſal of their inclinations, brings the things dependent thereon to their due effect. Whence we are to make this concluſion, that all the commendations we give our Prudence, whether out of ignorance or vanity, are ſo many injuries done by us to his Providence.</p>

               <p>Self-love is a fond conceit in any one, that his affection to all other things ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the purſuit of his own concerns. Its ſubtlety and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation tranſcend thoſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe. It makes men Idolaters of themſelves, and would make them Tyrants o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver others, if Fortune gave them the means to be ſo. It is never at reſt out of it ſelf, and makes no ſtay in other ſubjects,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53906:37"/>
but as Bees do upon flowers, to get out of them what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes its own intereſt.

A man cannot ſound the depth of its projects, nor find any paſſage into the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its receſſes: there it defies the ſharpneſs of the moſt piercing Opticks. It there makes a thouſand turnings and windings; nay it is there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

times inviſible even to it ſelf. There it conceives, there it nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, there it raiſes up (not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it) a multiplicity of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Averſions: Of theſe it many times frames ſome ſo monſtrous, that when it hath brought them to light, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims all knowledge of them, or cannot be prevailed with to own them. From this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherein they are involv'd, ſpring thoſe ridiculous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions which it hath of it ſelf. Thence proceed its er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, its ignorances, its ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and its ſimplicities, as to what relates to it ſelf. Thence it comes, that it imagines its ſentiments to be dead, when they are but laid aſleep, that it thinks it hath no

further deſire to run, when it does repoſe it ſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits it hath loſt all the guſts, which it hath ſatiated. But this great obſcurity, which deprives it of its own view, hinders not its perfect ſurvey of whatever is without it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which conſideration it may be compar'd to our eyes, which diſcover all about them, and are blind only as to themſelves. To be ſhort, in its greateſt concerns, and moſt important affairs, wherein the violence of its wiſhes ſummons all its attention, it ſees, it reſents, it underſtands, it imagines, it ſuſpects, it penetrates, it gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at all things; ſo that it raiſes in others a temptation of believing that each of its paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53906:38"/>
hath a certain enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment peculiar thereto. There is not any thing ſo cloſe and ſo ſtrong as its engagement, which it vainly endeavors to diſſolve, upon the firſt ſight of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary misfortunes which threaten it. And yet it often does in a ſhort time, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violence, what it could not have done with all thoſe efforts, whereof it is capable, in the courſe of ſeveral years. Whence it might with much probability, be concluded, that its deſires are inflamed by it ſelf, rather than by the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and excellency of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; that its own guſt is the motive whereby they are heightned, and the paint whereby they are embelliſh'd;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53906:39"/>
that it purſues it ſelf, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows only what it has propos'd to it ſelf. It is a confus'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture of contraries, as participating of imperiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſubmiſſion, ſincerity and diſſimulation, clemency and cruelty, timorouſneſs and audacity, and it betrays a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of inclinations, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby it is turn'd and directed to the purſuance of repute, wealth, or pleaſures. And in theſe it admits of a change and viciſſitude, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the difference of our Ages, our Fortunes, and our Experiences: but it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to it, whether it have many of thoſe inclinations, or that it hath but one, becauſe it
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53906:39"/>
hath the knack of dilating it ſelf into ſeveral of them, or contracting it ſelf to one, when it thinks requiſite, and as it thinks fit. It is inconſtant, and beſides the changes which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to it from other cauſes, there are an infinite number of ſuch flowing from it ſelf, and ariſing upon its own account: This Inconſtancy alſo proceeds from different motives, as pure fickleneſs, love, novelty, wearineſs, and diſguſt. It is humorous to extremity, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it is ſometimes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed with the greateſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs imaginable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible pains-taking, about the attainment of things, which are ſo far from being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, that they are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53906:40"/>
to it, and it is engag'd upon the purſuit of them, out of no other reflection than that it would needs have them. It is fantaſtick, and thence it comes alſo, that it is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intentive in the moſt frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous employments. It finds a height of pleaſure in the meaneſt occupations, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates nothing of its ardency in the moſt contemptible. It poſts it ſelf in the ſeveral ſtages of life, and ſpreads it ſelf into all conditions and qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It finds a being every where, it lives on any thing, and can make a ſhift to ſubſiſt without any thing, making its advantage of things, and of their privation. Nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, out of pure compaſſion,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53906:40"/>
it ſides with thoſe who profeſs an hoſtility againſt it. It finds a way to creep into their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and, what cannot be conſider'd without admiration, it raiſes in them an averſion for it ſelf, conſpiring its own deſtruction and promoting its own ruine. In fine, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not where it hath a being, ſo it have one, and in order to that, it is content to be its own enemy. Nor is it to be wondred at, that it ſhould ſo confidently enter into an aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation with the ſevereſt pity, when it contributes to its own deſtruction, in regard that at the very ſame time that it is ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined in one part, it is re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in another: when it is imagined, that it quits its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53906:41"/>
it does only change it into ſatisfaction: and when a man gives it over for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, and thinks himſelf rid of it, he meets with it again rallying in the triumphs of its defeat. This may ſerve for a Deſcription of ſelf-love, whereof all humane life is but a great and long agitation. The Sea is the moſt ſenſible repreſentation we can propoſe to our ſelves of it; inaſmuch as ſelf-love finds, in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of its continual waves, a faithful expreſſion of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive and reciprocal diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of its own reflections and perpetual motions.</p>

               <p>But we have this further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark to give of ſelf-love; that, as if it were not enough for it, to have the virtue of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it ſelf, it has alſo that of transforming the objects on which it works; which it does after a ſtrange and ſurprizing manner. For it not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes them ſo well, that it is it ſelf deceiv'd therein, but alſo as if its actions were mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, it makes, in effect, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected change in the ſtate and nature of the things. When any perſon oppoſes us, and employs all the hatred and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution he can againſt us, it is our own ſelf-love that judges

of his actions.

All his advantages are then ſuſceptible of all the Biaſs we can give them, and we look on them accordingly. All
