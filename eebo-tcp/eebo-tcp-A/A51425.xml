            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and also thereby signifying,<note place="margin">Theophil. Chrysost. ubi supr.</note> That as Naturally there can bee but
one Father of one Childe, So Politiquely there should be but one
Prince and Monarch of one People and Nation. Whereupon God
did not create two men (no nor <hi>Eve,</hi> but out of the rib of <hi>Adam</hi>)
that so from them all others should issue, and they might rule
promiscuously, or that each of them should rule such as would
make choice to be under his government, rather then under the
others,<note place="margin">Gen 10. 9, 10.</note> (although perhaps propagated of the other) Nor that the
mightiest Hunter, he, that could get most, should governe most,
as afterwards it fell out in the degenerating dayes of <hi>Nymrod.</hi>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62522:4"/>
that all other lormes of government are against the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
different from the patterne of heaven, diverse from divine

If they be compared with Monarchie; Which made

            <p>Oh! how much therefore are those too blame who goe about
to alter this forme of government, and to introduce a new defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

not agreed, whether they shall be stiled, 1. The States of England
as some of their Preachers (forgetting the King in their praiers)
have sycophantically phrased them; 2. Or whether they shall
be entituled, The perpetuall Senate, or Assessours of the kingdom,
as some have endeavoured to derive their stile, as the Impresse of
a Republick; 3. Or whether they shall be dignified with the
Princely Attribute of Gentlemen of the Crowne of England (to
which should be annexed the power of electing their King al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hereditary) as some of themselves have ambitiously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
their affectation in assimilation to that of Poland; onely
to the end that themselves might be sharers in Supremacy. A
Government which admitting a Monarch whom yet they dare
not deny, is neither Monarchie, Aristocracy, Democracy, nor O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligarchie;
and Anarchie, I dare say, they would not have it intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
A Government which if <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself were to sit in

nor practised in any established Common-weale. And what fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Deo consecutum, &amp; solo Deo minorem:</hi> For no true Christian can
be an enemie to his King or Emperour, whom he knows to be
placed over him by God, and therefore upon necessity must love
him, reverence him, honour him, pray for him, and desire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
his safety as the safety of the Kingdome; as being next
to God, lesser onely then God, and endowed with the power
which he hath from God, over all the men in his Dominions.
Hereupon was it that the Christians fought so many valiant bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
and obtained so many glorious victories, even for Heathen
and persecuting Emperours, yea even for <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata
himselfe: but never did they fight any battel, pitched any Field,
arrayed any Army, armed any Legions, or so much as entred into
consultation against their Emperour. And thus you see, <hi>Qualibus,</hi>
to what manner of Princes we must be subject. And I think all
will willingly conclude, <hi>Si parendum est magistratui prophane,
certè multo magis obedire oportet Sancto &amp; Christiano,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Matth. 22. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Bez.</hi> If
Heathens were thus obeyed, much more should Christians; If
persecuting, much more pious Princes, such as our Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
whose clemencie may challenge our love, as wel as his
power command our duty, whom God preserve, and prosper long
over us in honour and felicity, and give us the grace and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to be subject, <hi>not onely for feare, but even for conscience sake.</hi>
And so I come to consider</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In Quibus?</hi> In what things we must be subject? Wherein
the true stating of the Question is much differenced from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
and mistaking Tenents of many of these times, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and would beare the world in hand.</p>
            <p>1. That they are bound no further to Subjection, then with a
Rightly Regulated Conscience, they may performe Active Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to all their Superiours Edicts and Commands.</p>
            <p>2. That they are not bound to Active Obedience, where they
have a doubting conscience, although not fully informed by the
right rule of Reason, or expresse authority of Gods word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62522:9"/>
3. That the Supreame Magistrate, must have expresse affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
warrant in the word of God for all his injunctions, or else
the Subject needs not obey them.</p>
            <p>Whereas the truth is,</p>
            <p>1. Concerning the first, That although Active Obedience
binds onely in the Lord, yet absolute subjection is due without
any resistance for the Lords sake, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 1.</note> To humane Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
(<hi>1 Pet. 2. 13.</hi>) Even when man ordaines; not the Load
(<hi>1 Cor. 7. 12.</hi>) yet such a man as is ordained of the Lord, and so
presumed to ordain according to the Lord, wee may not in any
wise resist.</p>
            <p>2. And as concerning the second, Although when man is left
to his own liberty, The rule is to be observed, <hi>Quod dubitas ne
feceris,</hi> because he that doubteth is condemned of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
yet when we are Commanded by Authority,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> and wee
onely doubt in our selves whether that bee good and lawfull
which is comanded, or not, The Rule of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> must
be observed <hi>Si dubitas feceris,</hi> If you onely doubt doe it, except
you have expresse warrant out of Gods word, or the Analogie
of faith, and undeniable necessary Consequence to the contrary;
Authority must turne the scale of thy doubting conscience, and
weigh downe thy Judgement to Active obedience, so that</p>
            <p>3. The Magistrate is not bound to expresse Text for warrant
of each of his particular edicts; It is sufficient that it is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his generall Commission <hi>Dixi Dii estis,</hi> I have said ye are
Gods. (<hi>Psal. 82. 6.</hi>) and therefore have committed my delegated
power to you, <hi>Per me Reges Regnant,</hi> By me Kings Raigne (<hi>Pro.
8. 15.</hi>) And therefore by my authority may lay injunctions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Subjects, and they are obliged to Active Obedience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they can produce a negative Act of Parliament out of the
high Court of Heaven; for Princes are not onely instead of God
by representation (<hi>Exodus 4. 16.</hi>) but they have the power of
God over those to whom they have commission (<hi>Exod. 7. 1.</hi>)
I have made thee <hi>Pharoahs</hi> God, yea and put case the Subject
could produce a contradictory command of God to that of his
King, yet is not his passive obedience dispensed withall, nor any
part of his absolute subjection dissolved or cancelled,<note place="margin">Ambros. To. 3. Epis. l. 5. Orat.</note> But wee
must needs be Subject, (at least by suffering if not by doing) in
all things, even against the dictate of a doubting, yea, or a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62522:10"/>
3. But then in the next place it remains to be resolved by what
meanes, or in what manner this subjection is to be expressed,
which must be by these seven meanes following; where there are
not <hi>Iura Regni</hi> by mutuall consent of Prince and people to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sede
them, or dispence with any of them.</p>
            <p>1. First by praying for them (<hi>1 Tim. 2. 1. 10. 4.</hi>) I exhort
therefore that first of all, Supplications, Prayers, Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and giving of thankes, be made for all men, for Kings and
all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable
life in all godlinesse and honesty, for this is good and acceptable
in the sight of God our Saviour, who wil have all men to be saved,
and to come unto the knowledg of the truth. Where observe
we must pray, 1. To the end that we may live godly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
when we did not live so before: 2. That they may come to
the knowledge of the truth, when they knew it not before: 3. And
that they may be saved, when they were not in that state before.
None so bad then, to and for whom we are not to expresse our
subjection by this duty.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly,<note place="margin">Li. Tit. 3. 1, 2. Citat.</note> we must speake no evill of them; (<hi>Exod. 22. 28.</hi>)
Thou shalt not revile the Gods, nor curse the ruler of the people.
Is it fit to say to a King, thou art wicked; and to Priuces ye are
ungodly? (<hi>Iob. 34. 18.</hi>) No certainly, nothing lesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow the counsel of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtialis,</hi> who lived in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times, learned of the Apostles, and taught to succession
<hi>A murmuratione custodite corda vestra;</hi> Keepe not onely your
hands from mutiny, and your tongues from muttering, but even
your hearts from repining.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, we must not dispute their Commands, for where
the word of a King is, there is power, and who may say unto
him, what doest thou? (<hi>Eccles. 8. 4.) (i. e.</hi>) Not publikely and
illegally to raise opposition against him, onely we may privately
informe our own judgement, to prepare as peaceably either for
active obedience or for Martyrdome.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, we must expresse our subjection by doing all their
commands which are not directly against God,<note place="margin">Josh. 1. 16, 17.</note> resolving with
the <hi>Israelites,</hi> All that thou commandest us we wil do, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoever
thou sendest us we will goe, onely the Lord thy God
be with thee.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, we must expresse it by suffering all punishments pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62522:10"/>
without any resistance; for those things which we dare not
do when they command them, because they appeare (not seem)
to be directly against God, (as hath been before demonstrated;)
imitating S. <hi>Chrysostome, (Epist. ad Cyriacum) Cum à civitate fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garer,
dicebam intra meipsum, si quidem vult Regina me exulem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,

Queene will have me go into banishment, let her banish me;
The earth is the Lords, and all that therein is. If she will have me

she will confiscate my goods,<note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 10.</note> I am contented; Naked came I out
of my mothers wombe, and naked must I returne again. Behold,
this must be the patience of the Saints.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, by supplying meanes, <hi>Ad necessaria secundum statûs sui
conditionem; Lyr.</hi> paying due tribute to our Princes; for this is the
manner, <hi>Quomodo velit te subjici protestatibus, redere jubens cui

call them to accompt for their imployment of what is expended
which I conceive to be intended where there are not <hi>Pacta inter
Principem &amp; Populum:</hi> nor fundamentall Lawes of the Land to
the contrary.</p>
            <p>Seaventhly, we must expresse our subjection by guarding of the
Princes person, fighting for him upon occasion, and sparing him
from going out with us to battell,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 8. 11, 12.</note> lest he should quench the
light of <hi>Israel,</hi>

Tents in the field, when they return to their own houses, I leave

to consider: and so proceed.</p>
            <p>3. To the third part of my Text, which is the necessity of this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62522:11"/>
duty of subjection, implyed in these words <hi>[must needs.]</hi> Must is
for the King, and so it is indeed: and so is this: And therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies

fit that we be subject (<hi>i.e.</hi>) for order sake. 3. Or it is profitable

What is it but subjection which can continue Peace, Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

Whereas Rebellion brings forth War, Waste, Wickednesse, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion;

and their company against his commands, as if resisting for the
cause of God (as they pretend) they were to be accounted Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;
for they are no more capable of Martyrdome, dying in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of lawfull Magistracie, then the Idol Priests, or the devils
themselves were by the subversion of their Temples, or ceasing
of their Oracles, by vertue of our Saviours Incarnation; or by
the command of the Emperour, converted to Christianity: <hi>Aug.
ubi supra.</hi> But on the contrary it may be verified, that they who
under the royall command of a rightfull King, obediently, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionably,
zealously, and couragiously fight against a Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
or Hereticall Rebellious people, (who make Religion the
pretext for Rebellion) if they die, they dye Martyrs, if they
live, they live Confessors: and therefore we must feare even the
Princes sword. That I may not insist upon losse of favour, friends,
honour,<note place="margin">Prov. 20. 2.</note> credit, and the like; Although a wise man will consider
even in this, that the indignation of a King is as the roaring of a

Not onely because they are armed and can over-master us, for so
men suffer injuries from private men, because they cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them: but the Apostle teacheth, that a Christian is bound
to subjection to his Soveraigne by the Word of God; and the tye
of conscience more firme and close, then by a Souldiers Belt, or
Jaylors Boles and Manacles:<note place="margin">Ambros.</note> So that, <hi>Etiamsi certò constaret nos

presume to neglect him any more, then if we did see Armes and
Armies, Racks and Gibbets, and all engines for execution prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before us: <hi>Quia nisi omnino subjiciamini Principi polluta esset
conscientia vestra obvians divinae ordinetioni, Bruno.</hi> Because un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we be absolutely subject to our Prince (pretend what purity
we will) our conscience is defiled, and every step wee march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, we set our selves in battell array against the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God: And indeede I cannot but wonder what hard
hearts and cauterized consciences those men have, who doe not
presently smite themselves, and their hearts die within them like
<hi>Nabals</hi> when they find themselves guilty of subtracting subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from their Prince,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 37.</note> (a greater ingratitude then which cannot
be excogitated, and ingratitude is one of the greatest sinnes;) for
Subjects are obliged.</p>
            <p>1. By the rule of right Reason, to obey him, without whom
we cannot be safe; but without the King the Common-weale
cannot bee safe, nomore then a ship without a Pilot in a stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

Ocean; And therefore by the rule of right reason we must
obey him.</p>
            <p>2. By naturall equity, which bindes to do good to them which
do good to us, but Kings and Princes do good to us, for by their
meanes we obtaine great quietnesse, and by their providence
many worthy things are done to our Nation:<note place="margin">Act. 24. 2.</note> By them we receive
honour, enjoy riches, peace, plenty, and freely professe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
piety: and therefore even for naturall equity, <hi>We must needs
be subject,</hi> which is the least good we can doe to them.</p>
            <p>3. By morall civility we are bound to be subject to him who
protects us: But Kings and Princes protect us from evill doers,
who would violently take away our lives, insolently usurpe our
lands, prodigally mispend our goods, laciviously deflowr' and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
our wives, &amp; mercilesly slave our children, yea, they are the
Protectors and defenders of our faith, and therefore we are bound
at least not to rebell sithence all these mischiefes have been, are, &amp;
will be the effects of such disobedience, from which <hi>Good Lord
deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. By Christian Religion and conscience, which enjoyns, that
we must not resist the Ordinance of God: but Kings and Princes
are the Ordinance of God, and therefore we must not resist them.
<hi>vers. 1, 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And doe 1. Right reason, 2. Naturall equity, 3. Morall civility,
4. Christian Religion and conscience oblige us to subjection? Oh
then take heed, and never trust any (though never so faire Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors)
who pretend conscience to countenance disobedience, at
least to cast off subjection, as it is hard to disobey and not to rebel.
Yet such alwayes have been the faire pretence of the foulest pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises.
Thus the colour of the common good to free the people
from Subsidies, Taxes, and Oppressions (which then seemed by
their Governours to lye upon them) led the people of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
yea and some <hi>Romans</hi> too, to follow <hi>Theudas, Iudas</hi> of <hi>Galile,
Catiline,</hi>

the holy Church, making Religion the Patronesse of their impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62522:13"/>
and villany.<note place="margin">Hollinshed Rich. 2. p. 429.</note> Thus the Rebellion in the <hi>Nortb, Lincolnshire,</hi> and

2. Freedome of Conscience,<note place="margin">Grafton p. 330, 331.</note> and 3. Bettering the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale,
yea, and they are alwayes masked under the vizard of,
<hi>1. Pro Lege, 2. Pro Grege, 3. Pro Rege;</hi> whereas indeed they are
against the King,<note place="margin">L. 2. de Bello Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daic. c. 16.</note> break the Laws; and make spoile of the people,
as <hi>Iosephus</hi> relates the story of the Rebellious <hi>Iews,</hi> pretending
onely against <hi>Florus</hi> harsh, unjust, and cruell usage, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Romanes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Naucler.</note> But as King <hi>Agrippa</hi> cleares it by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance,
They did but onely say so; for their actions were such
as worse could not have beene done by the greatest Enemies of
the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, for they sacked the Townes, robbed the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suries,
burnt the Houses, wasted the Fields; neither were they the
Townes, the Treasuries, the Houses, the Fields of <hi>Florus,</hi> but of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire. I will not make Application, but sithence these
things have ever been so,<note place="margin">Prov. 24. 21, 22.</note> I will onely conclude with <hi>Solomons</hi>
Admonition: <hi>My son, feare God and the King, and meddle not with
them that are seditious; for suddenly shall their destruction come, and
who knoweth the ruine of them?</hi> Yet certaine it is that ruined they
shall be, and perhaps when themselves least suspect it, suddenly
as with the Arrow of Lightning shot from the Bow of God,
which may serve as a Corollary to our Apostles premises to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
this conclusion, <hi>[Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not onely
for wrath, but even for conscience sake.]</hi> Which God grant us all
grace to be, for Jesus Christs sake, the Patterne and Patron of
perfect obedience; to whom with the Father and the holy
Ghost, be all honour, glory, power, might, majesty, and dominion,
from this time forth for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
