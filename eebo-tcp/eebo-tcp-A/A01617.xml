         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It was my fortune, some two yeares past, to bee sent for into the company of one Maister <hi>Iohn Ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3185:6"/>
and further, I deliuered to him certaine principall notes which hee seemed greatly to esteeme; for that hee said that hee did mind to shew them vnto the right Honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, whereupon I entred into the cogitation of writing this true relation out of my owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and knowledge, touching the Inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable summes of money taken yearely for fish and herrings out of his Maiesties Seas by stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, whereby they haue not onely maintained their warres many yeares against the Spaniard, both by Land &amp; Sea, he being one of the great Monarkes of the world, and at length, they haue not onely wearied him in the wars, and brought him to good termes &amp; reasonable composition; but also it is most apparant not withstanding the huge charge of their warres so long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, which would haue made any other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on poore and beggarly, they to the contrary are growne exceeding rich and strong in fortified Townes and beautifull Buildings, in pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

admire them.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, whereas one Hauen in one of their Townes did in former times containe their ships and shipping with infinite cost, now they haue cut out two Hauens more to a Towne, and at this present, are all three Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens scarce sufficient with roome enough to containe their Ships and shipping, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their industrious Fisher-trade, not one of their people are idle, nor none seene to begge amongst them, except they bee some of our owne English Nation.</p>

            <p>I can scarce affoord these men of that water the name of Fishermen, for that their chiefest trade is dreggin of Oisters; yet haue they in the Summer some eight or ten boates in the North-seas for Cods, which if that they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to spend all their salt, and to speed well, they may get some twenty pound in a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cleere: but heere by the way, I will make knowne a great abuse that is offered to the Common-wealth, and especially to all the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fishermen of England, onely by those men of Colchester water.</p>
            <p>For these men from S. <hi>Andrew</hi> vntill <hi>Candlemas,</hi> &amp; some times longer, do set forth stale-boates, amongst the sands, in the Theames mouth, for to take sprats, with great stale-nets, with a

            <p>If that rhey could take the Sprats it were good, for they be good victuals for the Citty, but for euery Cart-load or Bushell of Sprats, they take a hundred Cart-loads, or Bushels of these yong herrings, which be the very spawnes of the Skoales of the herrings that commeth from Shotland euery Summer, and when as they come into Yermouth Seas yearely about S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and sometimes before, if that it do blow a hard Easterly wind, do alwaies at that season become Roope-sicke and do

            <p>The next to Colchester, is Harwich water, a royall harbour, and a propper Towne, fit for the vse of Busses, no place in all Holland comparable, for their is both land and strand and dry beach enough for foure hundreth
