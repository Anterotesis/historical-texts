            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> By one man sinne entred into the World,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> and Death by sinne, and so Death went over all men, forasmuch as all men have sinned.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Whereas God had threatned unto our first Parents,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever day they did eat of that forbidden fruit they should certainly die. They beleeving ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the word of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill that they should not

dye, and subscribing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his reproachfull blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, whereby hee charged God with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy towards their estate, as if hee had therefore forbidden the fruit, least by eating thereof they should become like God himself, entred into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of rebellion against the Lord who made them, and openly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.4. Gal. 5.19. Col. 2 3, 9, 10.</note> the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature, called originall sinne, derived
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:31928:38"/>
by continuall discent from Father to Sonne, wherewith all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the soule and body are infected, and that in all men equally, and then actuall sin ariseth from hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shew how the principall powers of the soule are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by this corruption of our nature?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is blinded with ignorance and infidelity.<note place="margin">Titus 1.15.</note> Secondly, the memory is prone to forget the good things which the understanding hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Thirdly, the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:31928:38"/>
will is disobedient unto the will of God, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood and remembred by us, the freedome and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse which it had at the first being lost, and is now wholly bent to sin. Fourthly, the affections are ready to overrule the wil, and are subject to all disorder. Lastly, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science it selfe is distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and polluted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In what sort is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science thus distempered?</hi>

For the second, it sometimes giveth no judgement at all, nor checking the offender as it should; but being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed, and as it were
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:31928:39"/>
seared with an hot yron; It sometimes giveth judgement, but falsly condemning where it should excuse, and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing where it should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, thereby filling the mind with false fears, or feeding it with vaine comforts, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times giveth true judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fearfull, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the guilty soule as it were with the flashes of hell-fire.</p>
