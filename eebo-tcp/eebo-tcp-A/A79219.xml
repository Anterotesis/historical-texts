         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving received an Overture from ſeveral of our Loving Subjects in our Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein is expreſſed very ample teſtimonies of their good affections to our Self, and their Solemn Proteſtation to endeavour to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their power, the eſtabliſhing Us in the Royal Throne and Dignity of our Father, to the end that all our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Subjects may be redeemed from thoſe horrid outrages, that they are now under, by that ſad and deſtructive Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mercileſſe Sword.</p>
            <p>For the ſatisfaction of all Our loving Subject, we have thought it very ſutable to the duty of Our place, to do Our part to ſo good a work, in which we ſhall not think it below our Kingly Dignity, to Deſcend to any particular which may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and ſettle the affections of Our meaneſt Subjects, ſince we are ſo conſcious to Our Self of ſuch upright intentions and endeavours, and only of ſuch which are for the Peace and Happineſſe of our bleeding Kingdoms; in which the proſperity of Our Subjects muſt be included, that we wiſh the moſt ſecret thought of our heart, were publiſht to their view and examination.</p>
            <p>We have ſeveral times done all that we could, to manifeſt the clearneſſe and uprightneſs of Our intentions to all our Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Subjects, as likewiſe in Our laſt Propoſitions publiſhd in print by ſome of our friends in <hi>England,</hi> Signed by our Selfat <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> wherein we made proviſion both for all Our loving Subjects and the Souldiery, ſo far as might be with ſafety to Our Self and Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>And now at laſt, being fully ſatisfied of your preſent (we hope ſucceſsful) proceedings, in behalf of our Self and our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament choſen by our Royal Father, do from the bottom of our hearts, without fraud, deceit, or any ſiniſter by end, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to you our Truſty and well beloved Subjects, That we ſhall be willing, and have already provided for your aſſiſtance of our own Native Countey 15000 horſe and foot, being accomodated by the two Chriſtian Kings, with Arms, Ammunition and all other proviſion, neceſſary for the carrying on ſo great a work, to eſtabliſh the Goſpel, and ſettle a true Peace amongſt Our loving Subjects in Our long diſtracted Kingdoms; Being confident, and aſſuring Our Self, that we may put our whole truſt in you, and our honourable Counſel elected by the good people of our Kingdom of <hi>Scoland.</hi> Not doub<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

            <p>We do further hereby Declare, That whereas ſome of Our reproachful enemies have caſt upon Us that falſe aſperſion of forſaking the true Proteſtant Religion (thinking thereby to make us odious in the eys of Our Loving Subjects) and that if we ſhould be eſtabliſhed in the Royal Throne of our Father, we would utterly deſtroy and exterpa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We ſhall now conjure all Our good Subjects (of what degree ſoever) by all the Bonds of Love, Duty or Obedience, that are precious to good men, to joyn with us for the recovery of the Peace of Our Kingdoms, and for the preſervation thereof, to remove all their doubts and fears, which may interrupt their affection to our Self, and all their jealouſies and apprehenſions which may leſſen their charity to each other, And then (if the ſins of ou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
