            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Honourable Sir William Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's
Character of the Epistles
of Phalaris.</head>
            <p>IT may perhaps be further affirmed, in favour of
the Antients, that the oldest Books we have
are still in their kind the best. The two most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
that I know of in Prose, among those we
call Profane Authors, are <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Fables and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi>'s
Epistles; both living near the same time,
which was that of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> As the
first hath been agreed by all ages since for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Master in his kind; and all others of that sort
have been but Imitators of his Original: So I
think the Epistles of <hi>Phalaris</hi> to have more Race,
more Spirit, more force of Wit and Genius than
any others I have ever seen, either Ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern.
I know several Learned men (or that usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
pass for such, under the name of Criticks)
have not esteemed them Genuine, and that <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
and some others have attributed them to <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi>
But I think he must have little skill in Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that cannot find out this to be an Original:
such diversity of passions upon such variety of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and passages of Life and Government, such
Freedom of Thought, such Boldness of Expression,
such Bounty to his Friends, such Scorn of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
such Honour of Learned men, such Esteem
of Good, such Knowledge of Life, such Contempt
of Death, with such Fierceness of Nature and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of Revenge, could never be represented but
by him that possest them. And I esteem <hi>Lucian</hi> to
have been no more capable of Writing than of Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what <hi>Phalaris</hi> did. In all one writ you find
the Scholar or the Sophist: In all the other the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
or the Commander.</p>

            <head>A more indiffrent Character of the same Author
given by another Hand.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THat some of the oldest Books are the best in their kinds,</hi> is
no new Observation: but the choice of <hi>Phalaris</hi>
and <hi>Aesop,</hi> as they are now extant, for the two
great inimitable Originals, is a piece of Criticism of a
peculiar Complexion, and must proceed from a Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of Palat and Judgment. Dr <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Appendix to
Mr <hi>Wotton</hi>'s Reflections upon Antient and Modern
Learning, p. 7. The censures that are made from stile
and language alone, are commonly nice and uncertain,
and depend upon slender notices. So that if I had no
other Argument but the stile to detect the spuriousness
of <hi>Phalaris</hi> Epistles, I my self indeed should be satisfied
with that alone, but I durst not hope to convince eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body else. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 14. To pass by therefore the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
from words and language, to me the very
matter and business of the Letters sufficiently discovers
them to be an Imposture. What force of wit and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the stile, what lively painting of humoursome
fancy they discern there, I will not examine nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
But methinks little sense and judgment is shewn
in the groundwork and subject of them. What an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
and Absurd story is that of Epist. 54. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sichorus</hi>
was born at <hi>Himera, &amp;c.</hi> p. 55, 56. It would be
endless to prosecute this part, and shew all the silliness
and impertinency of the matter of the Epistles. For
take them in the whole Bulk; If a great Person would
give me leave, I should say, they are a fardle of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
places, without any Life or Spirit from
Action or Circumstance. Do but cast your eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Cicero</hi>'s Leters, or any Statesman's, as <hi>Phalaris</hi>
was: What Lively Characters of men there! what descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of Place! what notifications of Time! what
particularity of Circumstances! what multiplicity of
Designs and Events! When you return to these again,
you feel by the emptiness and deadness of them, that
you Converse with some dreaming Pedant with his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blow
on the Desk; not with an active Ambitious Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
with his hand on his Sword, commanding a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of Subjects. All that taker or effects you is a Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Stateliness, and <hi>Operoseness</hi> of Stile: but as that
is improper and unbecoming in all Epistles, so especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
it is quite <hi>aliene</hi> from the Character of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> a
man of Bisiness and Dispatch. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 62, 63.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THe brisk Debates with which the
World hath been of the late so pleasantly
Entertained concerning the <hi>Author</hi> of
the following Epistles gave me the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of viewing in the original the Things
Themselves which had proved the occasion of
so vigorous a Contest. That was what
within the narrow compass of my Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I met with few that had done, and yet
scarce a man that made the least Hesitation
for which of the Antagonists in this <hi>Critical
War</hi> to declare. This made me imagin
that I should perform no unacceptable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the <hi>English</hi> Reader, if I presented him
with a <hi>Phalaris</hi> in his own Language, and
let him see What it is about which he hath
both Heard and Made so <hi>free</hi> Discourses,
What my Opinion is as to the matter in Dispute,
I shall not here Discover. Some little Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it the Observing Reader may col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
from the short <hi>Notes</hi> here and there
subjoyned to some of the Epistles <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which
will also shew him how Mistrustful I am of
my own Performance, and how sensible
of the Exceptions may be made against


<pb facs="tcp:104652:4"/>
it. But as for the meer <hi>English</hi> Reader, he
may save himself the Labour of looking upon
them. They were not designed for him,
nor are they for his use. I know this piece
is like to fall into severe hands, which
ought to have Discouraged an unpractised
Pen from meddling with it. But if any
man be minded to be Quarrelsome, I shall
venture to give him this Advice, That he be
sure he understand the <hi>Original</hi> before he
pass his Judgment upon the <hi>Translation:</hi> and
after all perhaps he will find more Labour
and less Glory in the Vndertaking than he
Expects. For either I am very slow of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
or else this Author requires a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Application of Thought either to be Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in his own Language, or
Translated into another, than upon a
<hi>Transient view</hi> of some of the shorter Epistles
an Hasty Reader would imagin. Some kind
of Defence I were about to have made for the
<hi>Licentionsness</hi> of the Translation. But some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that Nature is already offer'd in the
Notes, and to Apologize farther in so Trivial
a cause would run me upon a Vanity not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of Apology, and expose me to the Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of valuing my self upon performances
of this Nature; which I assvre the Reader I am
so far from doing that I can scarce answer to
my own Thoughts, the having thrown away


<pb facs="tcp:104652:4"/>
any part of my Time so Insignificantly. As for
the <hi>Elegancies</hi> of Stile, I cannot bring
my self to effect them. If the English <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi>
bears any tolerable Resemblance to
the <hi>Greek</hi> one, I have my end: if I have failed
in That, 'twas because I could do no better.
For though I own my self not so mighty an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of my Author, as a Translator ought to
be, and as some persons professedly are, yet I
have no where willingly <hi>Abused</hi> him, but
all along endeavoured to make the <hi>best</hi> of
him that I could. And let Envious Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
say what they will, there is in these
Epistles (whether True or Counterfeit) a
Spirit and Vigor, which will keep them
above Contempt; though I confess I think
<hi>Tully</hi>'s much better. The Copy I followed,
was that of the late <hi>Theatre</hi> Edition: and
what Light I received from the Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
joyned with it, I have not unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledged, as appears by the often Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to them under the Title of <hi>Not. Ox.</hi>
i. e. <hi>Notae Oxonienses.</hi> To whom we are
beholden for them every one knows. Nor
were I for <hi>Sullying</hi> so <hi>Honourable</hi> a <hi>Name</hi>
by making it a meer <hi>Marginal</hi> Ornament
to a Trifle which could not <hi>Grace</hi> it.
As for those two little pieces of <hi>Lucian,</hi>
from the Relation they bear to <hi>Phalar</hi> is
and the use that hath been made of them


<pb facs="tcp:104652:5"/>
in the Controversy concerning him, I judged
them not improper to be printed together
with him. Being now at a Distance from
the Press, and so not having the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of seeing or Collating them with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
I ordered them to be printed <hi>verbatim</hi>
from the Edition of <hi>Lucian's</hi> Works already
published in <hi>English,</hi> which as I have never
perused, so I have no reason to Mistrust.</p>

us hither to consecrate this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and begs of
you not to judge of him by the
rumours of Fame. For he particularly
desires to maintain his Repute with you,
who are as the Councellors, and the Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the God, and he believes your
sentiment will be of great weight through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all <hi>Greece.</hi> We take the Gods to
witness, whom there's no deceiving nor


<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:104652:6"/>
corrupting, that we shall now declare
nothing but the truth. And to begin
with telling you something of our Prince,
before we speak to you of his Oblation:
<hi>Phalaris</hi> was born in the City of <hi>Agrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
in <hi>Sicily,</hi> of a most Illustrious Family;
and being first educated in all the civil
exercises of his contemporaries and equals,
he was admitted to the Government as
well as others, wherein he behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so well, that there was never any
complaint of his Administration. But
being informed, that his Enemies and
Envyers were laying secret Abushes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and contriving all manner of
means to be his ruine, he was constrain'd,
for his own safety, to make himself the
Master of the State, as well to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from their Tyranny, as to put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to the Divisions, which regned at
that time, to the great prejudice of the
Commonwealth. His design, tho bold,
was approved by several Persons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and good Quality, (who contributed
thereunto with all their Power) and was
not followed by any murder, or banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and other such like violences,
which are usually practiced at the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a new Empire. Nay, he did not
so much as revenge himself on those that


<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:104652:6"/>
had conspired against him, but thinking
to win them by softness and lenity, after
having overcome them by force and
power, he pardoned 'em what was passed,
and admitted several of them to his
Councels, and his Table, after certain
Pledges of Fidelity and Allegiance. Then
for the reforming the disorders which had
slipt into the State, he regulated the
publick Revenues, which were ill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced,
through the malice or negligence
of those who had the Administration, and
did it so effectually, that there was no
overplus of money for such things as only
serve for Magnificence or Ornament. He
then took care for the instruction of
Youth, and so contrived, that the Old
men should enjoy in Peace, an undisturb'd
repose and tranquility of Life; he kept
the people within their duty, by Bounties
and publick Sights, without any thing of
force or violence. At length he delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
about quitting the Throne, and
restoring freedom to his Citizens,
when he learnt that his enemies and his
envyers conspired against him, made
Levys of Men and Money, fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the Alliance of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and had sent Deputies as far as
<hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and <hi>Athens.</hi> As the thing was


<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:104652:7"/>
upon the point of execution, he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it in a <hi>Dream,</hi> by the assistance of
the Gods, and afterwards discovered the
Conspiracy by several tokens. Be pleas'd
now, Right Reverend, to reckon his Case
your own, and consider what became him
to do in so fatal a Conjuncture. Ought he
to have pardoned a second time such
ingratitude, such Traytors, and lay his
Throat open to them, (as a man may say)
or rather secure his Life and his Empire,
as he did, by the punishment of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals?
Wherefore he sent for them, and
having first convicted them by their own
Confession, he punished them according as
their Crimes deserved. From that time
forth, he was obliged to keep Guards, and
secure his Life by the punishment of those
whom he had reason to suspect, and who
were ever hatching Treason against him.
In the mean while, the People, who
only mind the effects, without enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after the Cause, call his Justice
Cruelty, as if the punishment of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
was not rather an Action of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
since it preserves the Innocent,
and secures the Lives of Honest men. But
the aversion people have to ill Princes,
makes 'em even often hate the Good,
such as <hi>Greece</hi> has seen several, that have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned


<pb n="v" facs="tcp:104652:7"/>
with all manner of Equity and
Justice. Thus it is not by his severity,
that a man ought to judge of a good or
a bad Governor, but by the reason he
has to be severe, otherwise you your
selves would be unjust in punishing the
Impious and Sacrilegious. You see how
much time Legislators employ in speaking
of Penalties and Punishments, as if the
rest were nothing without this. Now if
they are necessary to any, 'tis without
doubt to them, who have none about
them but treacherous Friends or private
Enemies, and command people which
only obey by force. For Rebellion is like
a <hi>Hydra,</hi> one of whose Heads are no sooner
cut off, than that there arises several in
its place, unless you put fire to't, after
the example of <hi>Iolas,</hi> for the gaining the
Victory. In a word, when you have
once begun to exercise severity, you must
continue it, if you mean not to be undone.
But nought but necessity can drive a man
to that extremity, and I do not believe
there's any Prince so barbarous as to take
delight in hearing Clamours, Bawlings
and Invectives, rather than Blessings and
Praises. How often have we seen ours
weep and groan in the punishment of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,


<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:104652:8"/>
and deplore his condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was constrained to suffer every
day, what he made them suffer once;
and to be all his life long under continual
apprehensions of Death. For otherwise
he is so far from desiring to destroy the
Innocent, that he would rather be his
own destruction, by suffering Criminals to
live. Besides, it's no less painful to a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Spirit to do ill, than to suffer it; and
I know not whether it be better to dye,
tho unjustly, than to be every day in pain
for our own defence and security: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I believe, every man would rather
preserve his own life, than those of his
Enemies, especially when he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them but to his own ruine, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himself. Yet <hi>Phalaris</hi> has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
several, after having manifestly
convicted them. I call to witness <hi>Acan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,
Timocrates,</hi> and <hi>Leogoras,</hi> whom he
loved when he might have destroyed
them. But if you would know our Prince,
you must not enquire about him of those
whom he is constrained to be harsh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
but of others that he uses with all
manner of humaniy. For there are peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
all along the Coast, who give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of those who arrive, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive


<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:104652:8"/>
them according to their merit; and
the Sages of <hi>Greece</hi> have not disdained to
come and see him, and Court his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Witness <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides
with him, having as much esteem
for his Virtue, as he had heard Blame and
Clamours of his Cruelty; and he is fill'd
with compassion to see him constrain'd
to exercise justice so severely. Do ye
think a man that uses Strangers so well,
takes delight in oppressing his own Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
without any reason; This is what we
had to represent to you for his justification.
As to what concerns his Offering, you are
to know how <hi>Perillus,</hi> like you, only
knowing him by hear-sayes, imagining
he could not render him a more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
piece of service, than by inventing
some new sort of punishment, and as he
was an excellent Artisan, he made a Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Bull of admirable contrivance, so as
that the Prince cryed out as soon as he
saw it, that it was an Offering worthy of
<hi>Apollo.</hi> But <hi>Perillus</hi> in reply said, if you
knew for what purpose I made it, you
would talk at another rate. Shut up a
Malefactor in it, and put fire to it, and
thou wilt hear him<note n="*" place="margin">An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument was put in for that purpose.</note> Bellow like a Bull,
which is the only thing it wants to imitate
Nature to perfection. Upon these words,


<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:104652:9"/>
the Prince, having in abhorrence so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
an Invention, made <hi>Perillus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be put into the Bull, to make a
tryal of the truth, and causing him again
to be taken out alive, that so he might not
pollute by his Death, an Offering which
he meant to Consecrate to the Gods, he
destin'd it to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and caused this
History to be engraven thereupon. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
receive this Present, Sacred Sirs, and
set it in the most conspicuous Place of the
Temple, for a Monument of the Piety and
Justice of our Prince:</hi> He will make still
more presents, if <hi>Apollo</hi> preserves him
long, and delivers him as has done from
the ambushes of his Enemies; but the
greatest kindness he can do him, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
him henceforward from seeing so
many executions and punishments. This
(Right Reverend) we had to tell you
on his behalf, and on our own, which
we assert for truth. Now if Subjects
be allowed to intercede for their Prince,
we conjure you, most Holy Fathers,
by virtue of an Alliance, (for we, as
well as you, are originally of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians)</hi>
not to displease a Soveraign who
Courts your Friendship, since he has
given you diverse testimonies thereof,


<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:104652:9"/>
as well in publick, as in particular, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
receive this Offering; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating
it to <hi>Apollo,</hi> make Vows for
Him and for Us, since you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
it without doing an injury to <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
and your God.</p>

            <head>A Continuation
Of the former
DISCOURSE:</head>
            <head type="sub">In an Oration of one of Apollo's
Priests to the rest, to perswade them
not to refuse Phalaris his Present.</head>
            <p>THough I have neither Friendship
nor Alliance with <hi>Phalaris,</hi> and
with the <hi>Agrigentines,</hi> nor any private
reason to embrace their Interests, I do
not think (my <hi>Brethren)</hi> we can refuse
their oblation, which is a Master-piece of
Art, and the pledge of a Princes Piety
and Justice, as well in its Consecration,
as in the punishment of the Delinquent.
Wherefore I fancy on this occasion a
longer deliberation would be Criminal
and that it's no less a Crime to refuse the
offerings which are made to the Gods,


<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:104652:10"/>
than to take away those they hold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in possession. For my own part,
who in the Quality of a Priest and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
of <hi>Delphos,</hi> partake in the Glory of
<hi>Apollo,</hi> and his Temple, I hold we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought, nor can hinder the token
of zeal and acknowledgment of any
Person, without exposing our selves to
Calumny, and making it blurr'd about,
that we mean to render our selves Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Consciences of Men. In a
word, if we reject this offering, no body
will ever make any more. For who
would expose himself to a refusal, or
run the risque of passing for Impious, in
giving testimonies of his Piety? Ye will
wholly Condemn <hi>Phalaris</hi> of the Crimes
whereof he is accused, if you send back
his Present. Never theless, ye know
we are yet altogether unacquainted with
them, and there's no judging by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
of Princes, and great Men. I know
very well that he who spoke before me
has bitterly exclaim'd against the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and other vices of that Prince, but
he cannot know them of himself, but by
reports, which may be false or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
since he never saw the Person he
speaks of, nor was he in his Country.
And though they were true, it is not for


<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:104652:11"/>
us to lay aside the Quality of Priests, to
take upon us that of Judges, nor to enquire
whether <hi>Sicily</hi> be well or ill governed, but
to receive the offerings which are made
us. Let us leave to the Gods the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Mankind, and only take care of
what concerns our selves there's no need
of quoting <hi>Homer,</hi> to prove we dwell
among Rocks and Precipices, and that
all this Country would be a sad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart
without the Piety of Men, who
come hither to make Vows and Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
These are our Vintages and our
Harvests, and which makes us enjoy
without trouble all the Riches of the
Earth, as if we inhabited a fruitful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or lived in the Poets golden Age.
This precious Treasure let us preserve
to our Children, as if we received it
from our Parents, and let's not diminish
by a surplusage or scruple, the glory
and revenues of a Temple, where there's
no mention made in the memory of
man, that Presents or Victims were
ever refused. It only appertains to the
Gods to judge of the Consciences of
Men, since none but they know all the
doubles and foldings of the mind: the
Question here is neither of <hi>Phalaris</hi> nor
his Bull, but of all the Vows, and all the


<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:104652:11"/>
Offerings that ever will be made in all
Ages. You see the immense Riches
this Temple has heaped up since People
have had liberty of coming hither? I
am afraid that by turning Censurers,
you'll have no Subject for your Censures.
So that I am of advice, that you receive
this Offering (my Brethren) according
to the Custom of our Ancestors, which
is conformable to our own interest, and
to that of our God.</p>

you, and finish the Work both for

not as if I distrusted the care of a Mother

cannot but have for his only Son. By
Yourself judge of me. If a Mother be so

nor can a Child too much Reverence
them from whom he derives his Being,

But of the two, 'twere more
pardonable to neglect the Father than
the Mother. For the Father claims up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

those of the Mothers. Besides her Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you in the Womb, her Bringing you

Breasts; a Thousand more are the cares

you: while the Father, without any of the

bearing and breeding up their Children,
shares in all the Comforts of them. And

and Inconsiderate Attempts,
have often proved Fatal to them. In
both these respects your Son hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
himself very Obnoxious. Yet,
though sufficiently provoked by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
behaviour toward me, I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
Spared him. But 'tis for Your
sake, not his Own, that I have done so.
For as for You Yourself, every one gives
you the Character of a right Honest man;
which made me unwilling to punish the
offences of the Son upon the Innocent
Father. For though he be a very Rascal,
yet being an Only Son, and the last Stay
of your Family, you cannot but retain a
Fondness for him: the Affections of a
Father being too strong to be over-ruled
by the Vices of the Son. But if he doth
not mend his Manners, but continue to
shew himself equally Disobedient to his
Parent, and Disloyal to his Prince, you
must not think it strange if I call him to
an account for Both of us, and give him
that Correction which his behaviour both
to You and Me requires. And that he


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104652:23"/>
may not when he comes to feel the Smart
of it, (which if he goes on as he begins, I
assure him he shall) pretend to be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
shew him these lines, and let
him take what is Written to you as meant
to him. Farewel.</p>

possible, but the Avoiding it impossible;
why then should he be curious to know
that, which Known or Unknown remains

that together with the Foreknowing the
Future, he may be also able to Avert it, so

must have run through in this World, he
would never by his good will have been
born into it; so neither could a private
man Foresee the Unhappiness of being a
Tyrant, would he ever covet to change
his Private condition for that of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.
Thus, <hi>Demoteles,</hi> I think it had

is Yours. And why should you Quarrel

is Still Alive. His Fame, his Wit, his
Verse, Live throughout the World. Be
satisfied therefore, ye <hi>Himeraeans,</hi> and
take it as a special favour of Heaven;
That with You <hi>Stesichorus</hi> was born,
with you he grew up to an Hero, with
you he spent the vigour of his Muse,
with you his head grew Gray in Heavenly
Verse. Since therefore you have enjoy'd

the priviledge (which they themselves
wished for, and which you see they are
ready to fight for) of his having laid
down his Carcass with them. But let me
Compound the matter between you.

Do you, <hi>Himeraeans,</hi> to perpetuate the
Memory of his having been born with
you, erect a Temple to <hi>Stesichorus:</hi> and
let the <hi>Catanaeans,</hi> to perpetuate the
Memory of his having Dyed with them,
erect a Monument over him. I should
take this to be a fair Medium in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
But I will not Prescribe to you.
If you are resolved to Fight it out for the
Bones of <hi>Stesichorus;</hi> so long as I have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men or Money, you shall want nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And yet I would have you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
twice before you begin. For to me
your Undertaking seems neither Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
nor Safe. If you beat the <hi>Catanae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and take their City (as without that
you lose you end, for the <hi>Catanaeans</hi>
will rather lose themselves, City and all,
than the Bones of <hi>Stesichorus)</hi> yet for <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians</hi>
to destroy a <hi>Sicilian</hi> City will not
redound to your Honour: or if you take
not <hi>Catana</hi> the <hi>Catanaeans</hi> may take <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera.</hi>
A weighty Point this, and I would
have you well consider of it, whether it
be worth the while to run the risque of
all for Dry Bones. But as for <hi>Stesichorus</hi>
himself, let him sleep quiet in his Grave,
and disturb not his Ghost with your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable

a Tyrannick power is owing to a

disapprove of my proceedings; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as to the matter of the Brazen Bull:
alledging that I ought not after the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of it, <hi>Perilaus,</hi> to have put any other
to that kind of Death; destroying by


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104652:39"/>
these <hi>After</hi> Executions the Applause I
had gained by the Former. But neither
do I value myself upon the Applause, it
seems, I have gained for my Justice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Perilaus</hi> (for I do not Punish to be
Applauded for it) nor fear the Censures
of my Severities exercised upon othes.
The Executions of Justice are Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
upon the Good or Bad opinions of
men. But as to the present case, had
<hi>Perilaus</hi> been as the first, so the last that
dyed in the Belly of his Bull, even he
himself had suffered <hi>unjustly.</hi> For 'twas
not the Curiosity of the Art, but the
Cruelty of the Artist that I punished:
but there had been nothing of Cruelty in
it, had I kept his Bull only for a Shew,
and not applied it to the use he designed.
So that this whole Accusation of Cruelty
terminates in the Inventor of this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Instrument of it, and in those Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Wretches whose unhappy Destiny
carries them to such Extremities. But
if the whole he causelessly charged upon
me, I matter it not, so long as I can
shew that those that dye this death have
done things deserving it. For beginning
with the first that suffered this kind of
Death, by burning whom in his own
Bull I Avenged the cause of all Mankind,


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104652:40"/>
or rather of Humane Nature itself, by
the same Rule let us judge of all that
followed after. For if ye allow <hi>Perilaus</hi>
his Sufferings to be Just, and Applaud
me for inflicting them upon him; ye
cannot Disallow of my having given to
other Offenders their Just deserts, and
made them suffer for the Injuries they
offered to their fellow Creatures. Much
less can you blame me for having made
Examples of those Implacable Wretches
that plotted even my own Destruction.
If in punishing <hi>Perilaus</hi> as a Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to Mankind, I have done Justice to
all of You, and in so doing I am by all
of you approved: I hope you will give
me leave by the punishing my own Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to do Justice to my self. For if I
take care to bring them to punishment
who commit injuries upon other men,
though having never offered any thing
but kindness to me; I may well be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a man strangely incautious, to let
those who have been taken manifestly
designing upon my own Life, escape scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free;
and while to avenge the Cause of
other men, in which I am not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested,
I can be content to be called
Cruel and Tyrannical, yet I must be
afraid of incurring the like censure in


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104652:40"/>
providing for my own security. But as

you to. If this be your Aim, you make
an ill choice: and for that you may take
my word, who have found sad cause
to repent of my ever having taken into
my hands the Sole Dominion; though
not so much Courted by me, as forced
upon me. He that hath tryed both
would much rather choose to Live under
the Tyranny of another, than be a Tyrant
himself. The one hath only One man to
fear; the other fears Every man: and
more his Nearest Friends than his Declared
Enemies: for safer is the Tyrant in the
Field than in his Bedchamber; and amidst
all his Dangers and Terrors, nothing is
he more afraid of than his own Guards.
As therefore no man can wish you better
than your own father, conclude he gives
you good Advice when he bids you keep
yourself within the compass of a Private
Station. Chuse rather to be with Safety
a part of the People with whom you live,
than violently to make yourself the Head

the Children of your Enemies, the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session

having yourself Acted as would the God

something more I must pay you than meer
Words. I have sent you therefore, in
Testimony of your Skill and Fidelity,
and as a lasting Memorial to whom I owe
my life, together with this Letter four
Beakers of the purest Gold, two Silver
Bowls of a workmanship not to be matcht
in our Age, ten couple of <hi>Thericlaeans,</hi>
twenty comely young Slaves, and 50000
<hi>Atticks.</hi> I have also written to <hi>Teucrus,</hi>
the Steward of my House, to make you
the same Annual Pension as is paid to my
Sea Commanders, the Gentlemen of my
Bedchamber, and the principal Officers
in my Army. A small Recompence I
confess for so great a service. But where
the Debtor is Insolvent, payment in part
must pass for the whole, and the rest be
made up in Confession. And that's my
case with you; who have laid me under
an Obligation beyond the possibility of

Why, said I, what wrong have I ever
done to any of you? No wrong, replyed
they, to us in particular, but wrong to the
Publick; for to enslave a Free people
we think a Common wrong, and such as
every one ought to resent as his own. And
what Satisfaction, said I, can you give me for
so insufferable an Attempt? Our lives said
they. No, said I, since you can Dye so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvedly,
you shall not Dye but Live. I
may not punish Virtue though in an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
your generous Resolution hath
conquer'd my Revenge. Thus, <hi>Peristhenes,</hi>
I have (as I thought my self in Honour

took, when his Ambition of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Patriot put him upon those Methods
of serving (as he thought) his Country,
which his grateful Country-men have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with Banishment: But even then
when he was in the Height of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and swam with a full Stream, I tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pitied him, and wrote a Letter to him
on purpose to let him know that I foresaw
where it would end. But my Words
were Wind with him: bewitched with
Popular Applause he was Deaf to the
Reason of them: thinking Me, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
a very Improper person to direct
a man how to behave himself in a Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Government; or perhaps imagining
that the Jealousies a Tyrant must needs have
against a Free State could not suffer him
to be much a Friend to the Man that so


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104652:48"/>
studiously promoted (as he fancied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to do) its Welfare. Thus pufft up
with his own Vain imaginations, he
Swells till he Bursts, and knew not the
ground he stood on, till Fatal Experience
hath at last convinced him, That
<hi>Phalaris</hi> was not so much a Stranger to
the Methods of Popular Government,
because a Tyrant, as <hi>Clisthenes</hi> a Stranger
to the Humours of the Multitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had the Lucky <hi>hit</hi> of Taking
with them for a moment. Popular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
is but a flattering Bait to draw a
man into the Crowd, and when it hath
him there scarce ever fails (in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion)
to Betray him to an End far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the Promising Beginnings.
As for my own part (and any man of
sense, I should think, would be of the
same mind) I had rather be the Hissing
of the unthinking Multitude than their
Idol. For as for their Hatred, 'tis as soon
Laid as Rais'd. Their Passions, as they
take fire at nothing, so 'tis but letting
them alone, and they dye of themselves:
a meer Clap of Thunder, a Flash and a
Noise, and all's over: or if the Grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
hold for some little time, there's no
great danger in it. But Banishment,
Death, Confiscation, or something else as


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104652:49"/>
bad or worse, is the Consequence of the
very Opinion of one's being Deep
in their Affections. To tell you what I
think of the People, <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> 'tis plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this. The People! That is, a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Fools joyned together in one
Herd; Senseless, Helpless, Faithless; Fickle,
Fierce, False; a Voice and that's all; good
for just nothing in the world; pufft forward
backward with the Blast of a mans Breath;
Pleased they know not why, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
at they know not what; in their
Aversions and in their Fondnesses equally
Unreasonable. This is what I think of
the people; and no more do I say of
them than what I have found by them.
So that to take the Measures of ones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
from the Humours of the people,
and strive to Please the Multitude, is but
Inviting them the more Scornfully to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult

in, but, like<note n="*" place="bottom">I am not Antiquarian enough to know whether Bull-baitings were in use in <hi>Phalaris</hi> his days. I incline to suppose the Negative.

your Just Debts, and let every one have
his own again; than that <hi>Phalaris,</hi> in
consideration of your Necessities, having
freely forgiven your Debt, <hi>Periander</hi>
should fairly come and Take up all that
<hi>Phalaris</hi> Laid down. One of these two
therefore you must Resolve upon; either
to Recover your own Rights, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
at the same time to Confirm to your
selves my Grant: or if you are so Able to
lose your Own Money, then you must
Resolve to pay me Mine.</p>

               <p>I Have, upon the Representation of
your Ambassadors, agreed to lend
you the summ required, though by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of my long and expensive Wars, I
am not at present over full of Money.
But that's not my way, to answer my
friends with Excuses instead of Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.
And I hope you will not let
me find the same of you as most men do
of their Debtors, who Bless when they
Borrow, and Curse when they Pay.
When we are to lend we are the best
men in the world with them; but when
to receive our own again, the hardest
names they can find are too good for us.
A thing equally Unjust and Ungrateful.
All Lenders, how different soever in
other Respects, are of one and the same
kind to the Borrowers, that is, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
and ought by them to be treated
as such; at least till they are paid. If
they dislike their Creditor, let them Pay
him first, and Rail at him afterward. If


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104652:53"/>
he be an Honest man, they ought the
more readily to pay him because he is an
Honest man; if he be a Knave, let them
make haste to come out of a Knave's Debt.
For whether I be a Good man, or a Bad
man, 'tis but just I should receive my
own. As for my own part, whether
Lending, or calling in my Debts, I am
the self same man, as much a friend when
I do the one as when I do the other.
But Borrowers (as they say the Camelion
doth his Colours) change both their Stile
and their Thoughts with their occasions.
When I lend, I am a Benefactor, a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
a God to them: when I put them
in mind of Payment; an Oppressor, an
Accursed wretch, not fit to Breathe upon
Earth, or enjoy the common Rights of
Mankind. I know withal that 'tis much
better to lose a Debt by a Private person
than by a Community. For he that is
Defrauded by a Private person makes
himself but One Enemy, and him no
very Dreadful one: but he that is Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by a whole City, as his Loss is not
less, so the Damage is far greater, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself, instead of One, a Multitude
of Enemies. Not that I would imagine
any such thing of you. When I lend to
you, I lend without Suspecting. I know


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104652:54"/>
you to be a People as Grateful upon all
occasions, so particularly most Exact ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers
of your Covenants, and Jealously
maintaining the Honour of the Publick
Faith.<note n="*" place="bottom">I suppose I have taken the true meaning of my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in this last Paragraph, though possibly it might bear an Interpretation somewhat different from what I have given.</note> Nor are you Ignorant that
when Controversies of this nature arise
between a <hi>single</hi> Adversary and a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and the Question lyes, Who hath
offered the Wrong, the <hi>One</hi> or the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>

Single person should think himself able
to Outface a Multitude.</p>

that you would (as in Duty you
were bound) Dedicate them to the Gods
for whom they were designed, and give
them a Standing in their Temple: or
else that Detaining them from the Gods
you would share them among your
selves. Which latter you have done. And
thus under pretence of fixing a mark of
Infamy upon me, as if the Gifts were
polluted by the Guilt of the Offerer, you
have committed Sacriledge upon your
Gods. For when once a thing is Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Gods, what difference is there
whether you steal it before the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
or after? whether you take it
out of the Temple, or will not let it go
in? So that 'tis the Gods you have plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
not Me: For what I once gave to
them, was no longer Mine but Theirs:
and both my Devotion and your Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
needs no other Proof: For they know
both who sent them the Gifts, and who
stole them. 'Tis sufficient for me that I
have made my Oblations, though they
have not Received them. And as for you,
I have my Satisfaction; in that I have


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104652:55"/>
exposed you to the wrath of those Gods
whose Rights you have Invaded, and
who are Able to Avenge their own
Cause. Besides, by the Applying them
to your own Uses you declare there was
nothing of <hi>Impurity</hi> in the Gifts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
unless the same things can be at
the same time of a different nature, Pure
and Impure: Pure,<note n="d" place="bottom">A <hi>Latin</hi> word in an <hi>English</hi> Translation! I'll not Apologize for it.</note>

                  <hi>Quatenus</hi> the Gods have any thing to do
with them. Again; by your own Plea
you Convict your selves of Impiety. For
if one ask your Magistrates, how they
could Confiscate to the Publick, the
things offered to the Gods; they lay it
upon the People, The People, say they,
demanded to have them Condemned for
Lawful Prize, as being the Effects of an
Enemy: but if one ask the people the
same question, they discharge it from
themselves, and cast it upon the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.
Nay, (which is an Impudence
beyond all the rest) ye stick not to
Arraign even the very Gods themselves,
and speak it openly of them (and what
worse could you have said of the worst
of men) that should your Gods accept
of the Gifts of a Tyrant, your Gods were


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104652:55"/>
no better than Traytors. And yet those
very Patriots of yours, to whom you
commit the Administratiou of all your
Publick affairs, though they have more
than once or twice directly offered me
their service (if I would but Pay them
for it) to make me as Absolute a Tyrant
over <hi>Messana</hi> as I am at <hi>Agragas;</hi> these
your Patriots, I say, Honest men as they
are, you have nothing to say against
them. And good reason for it; since in
that matter you know yourselves to be
all alike; and therefore dare not call
others to an account for a Crime which
they could so easily Retort upon their
Accusers: for were that Cause to be
brought under Examination, it would
appear that (how streightly soever you
confine your Gods) you yourselves have
all of you been but too willing to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
gifts. <q>But<note n="e" place="bottom">I somewhat question whether I have taken my Author exactly in these Lines. 'Twas the best sense I could readily strike out, and I am in Haste.</note> do not think that

               <p>PErhaps my having so often written
to your Father concerning you, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing
him to curb your Insolency,
hath made you so much the more Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming;
as imagining that I should not
have employed him to take you off from
your hot-headed Designs against me, had
I not been afraid of them, and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you as an Enemy to be dreaded. That
'tis no such matter, I shall not spend
words to prove. But understanding him
to be an Honest old man, and you his
only Son; in Compassion to his Grey
hairs, and making Allowances for the
Follies of your youth, I have hitherto
forbore you. But you have no Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

without any sense of the danger, of
which you have had so fair warning gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you, still proceed in your wonted

Petulancy. And that perhaps because
I having hitherto let you alone, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
my self with only Admonition,
you may imagin that you have still time
enough before you to think of making
your Retreat. But this is what far greater
persons than yourself have not been able
to do. Consult your safety therefore
while you may, and make your choice
before it be too late. Tread not in the
steps of <hi>Timander;</hi> but rather follow the
advice of an Enemy which would save
you, than that of a Friend, which will
certainly be your Ruin.</p>

case, as foreseeing (and would to
Heaven I had been a false Prophet) the
unhappy Consequences of the Methods
you took, I were most Passionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to have prevented them: So since
they are now fallen upon you, I make
both the Mistake and the Misfortune my

ever feeling what you now feel that I
forewarned you; but since 'tis now (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Assurance with which you Apply your

perhaps 'twas not because the Necessities
of my Country required that Assistance
that made her send me this Embassy, but
her desire to give this Publick Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial

the Petition. For what great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Ambition could a Generous Soul
conceive, than to be looked upon as
the prop of his Country, and wear
the Title (which your Letter gives
me) of a Publick Benefactor? That
what I send you comes later to your
hands, than you could have wished, lay
not the blame either upon me or upon
your Ambassadors, but upon the season
of the year. There was no diligence
wanting on my part to have dispatched
them away sooner: but this Winter hath
been so exceedg Tempestuous, that the
most daring Sailor that is, would not have
ventured himself to Sea. When the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
and what other Effects I have sent
you shall have escaped the dangers of
so hazardous a Voyage, and come safe to
your hands, return your thanks in the
first place to Heaven for its preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them at Sea, and in the next to
your Ambassadors, of whose Faithfulness
in making a true Delivery of the whole.
I have not the least Suspicion. Yet I
have sent along with them the Bearer
hereof, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> as Super-cargo. From
whom, having received an account of


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104652:75"/>
both the Species and number of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Particulars; all the rest you may
dispose of at your pleasure: but the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
I would have employed in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
and Beautifying your City, as I
suppose your own wisdom and care of the
Publick, without my Direction, would
have led you to have done: For Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
men need not be taught their Duty.
But if (a thing I would not so much as
I magin concerning you) what I designed
for the Real and lasting Service of my
Country, you should fling away upon
useless and unnecessary extravagancies;
the Abuse of the Gift will fix a greater
Reproach upon the Receivers of it, than
the having given it can add Glory to the
Donor. For if it may well seem a strange
thing that a man unjustly Banished his
Native City, and never like to see it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
should yet take care to repair its
Breaches, and restore the ruinated foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
in it to their antient Splendor:
much stranger will it seem, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Inhabitants themselves, whose home
it is, should suffer the Foundations, as
yet standing, to fall into Ruines, for
want of bestowing upon them Necessary
Repairs; especially when they might do
it at the Expences of not their own, but


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104652:76"/>
another's Purse: But if you consider that
what I have sent you was not designed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the present use of you into whose
hands it is to be Delivered, but for the
use of your Posterities to come, and of
the Gods you Adore; and accordingly
bestow it upon your Publick Aedifices
and Sacred Temples: You will be more
Admired for your Wisdom and Probity,
than I for my Liberality. The giving
away Money is what every Fool can do
that hath it to give, but to manage it
aright is the Talent of only Wise and
Good men. The Gift may serve to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the good Inclinations of the
Giver; the use of the Gift proves the
true worth of the Receiver. And I had
rather have my Bounty be made the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of your Merits, than of my
Wealth: Virtue being the Beauty of the
Soul, and the true commendation of a
man; Riches only the Gift of Fortune,
and no Praise to the Possessor. I'are ye

I were equally smitten with Admiration
at the Artificialness of the Contrivance,
and Abhorrence of the Cruelty of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and therefore forthwith resolved to
have the first Proof of his new Engine
made upon himself, as not being able to
find out a person more Deserving with
whom to begin the Experiment of such
an Invention, than the Inventor of it.
Into the Belly of his own Bull therefore
we force him to go, and having disposed
the fire about it, according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104652:79"/>
he himself had before given, it
answered our expectations, and fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
verifyed upon the Artist the exactness
of his Art. For neither did we see the
person tormented, nor hear any of his
Out-cries, but the Shrieks and Groans of
the Dying Wretch within were Tuned
by the Brass into the Natural Lowings
and Bellowings of a Bull, so that they
came forth rather a Divertisement than
Horrour to the Spectators. But that
you, O ye <hi>Athenians,</hi> should be so
mightily displeased, as I hear you are,
at my putting the Author of his Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this kind of Death, is what I am
much surprized at, and what I cannot
yet believe. If it be that you think I
have given him too Gentle a Punishment;
my answer is, that I could not find
out any more Terrible. But if it
be the thing it self of my having
put him to any Death at all that you
complain of; then do you your selves,
who Glory so much in your Humanity,
incur the Censure of the Deepest Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
and while you pretend to Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
your Citizen, Condemn your City.
For either it was the Fact of that one
single person, or else the Fact of you All:
and which of these two we must take it


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104652:80"/>
to be, your behaviour towards me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occasion will declare. For if you
grant that he dyed Deservedly, and
hath not left behind him amongst all the
<hi>Athenians,</hi> the like Example of a Cruel
Nature, what should make you Resent
my having put him to Death? Since the
example of his Punishment cannot in
the least Affect any of you so Unlike him
in his Qualities. But if you say he dyed
Undeservedly; then do you plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
your selves to be of the same Stamp
with <hi>Perilaus,</hi> and by defending his Act,
make it your own. Or however, say
you what you will, I shall not think my
self guilty of Injustice, in putting to death
such persons only as I my self in the first
place know justly to deserve death: and
so long as<note n="d" place="bottom">

For though we Tyrants are
commonly supposed very Improper Judges
of Right and Wrong, making all other
Considerations stoop to that of Securing
our selves: yet I am not so ignorant as
not to know, that Justice is the Support
of Power, and that whenever I shall
forsake her Laws, and shew my self a
man that Rewards and Punishes not by
Rule but by Humour; I shall at the


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104652:80"/>
same time forsake my own Security, and
undermine the very prop of Authority.
But that the Projector of new Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Cruelty should have his own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
tryed upon himself, is what I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
neither any of you your selves, nor
any of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> will call an Unjust
Execution; it being but giving to him
the same that he designed to others.
Which to me my self seemed a thing so
exactly Reasonable, that I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any one else to be of a different
Opinion. For though the Horrid Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was by the Contriver of it design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for my service, and to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
upon none but those who should
Plot my Destruction: Yet as by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
it to me he made me his Judge,
I were obliged to proceed upon him
by the Laws of Universal Justice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
therefore laying aside all partial Regard
to my own Private Interests, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what was Simply and in itself
Just or Unjust; I sentenced him not by
what he had deserved of me, but by
what he had deserved of all Mankind.
For as for my own part, I knew very
well, both that the greater Barbarity of
other men would<note n="e" place="bottom">

                  </note> serve to take off
part of the General Odium against my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and that therefore it was for my


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104652:81"/>
Interest not to have punished such a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather to have encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it; and also that for me to appear more
averse to Cruelty than Common Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
supposes me, would but expose
me to greater hazards, by giving a
greater boldness to them that conspire
my Ruin; and that this Example of my
Seventy against one who designed only
my service, will keep back others from
the like forwardness to espouse my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests;
and that considering the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness
of my Enemies, 'tis Force not
Mercy I must depend upon. All this,
though I knew very well, and though
I wanted not other matter to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
my name to Posterity: yet
I could not allow such an Enemy to all
mankind as the Inventor of this New
Torture, to 'scape Unpunished. And
therefore in the same Engine, which he
most <hi>Inhumanly</hi> contrived for the Roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of others to Death, (by whom he
could never pretend himself to have been
any ways Injured,) most <hi>Justly</hi> did I,
(the person whom he pretended to
oblige by such a Gift) cause himself to
be Inclosed. But if, may some of you
say, this be my Rule; that the Inventor
of Cruelty against others, ought himself
to suffer the same which he invented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104652:81"/>
them; what then will become of
<hi>Phalanis?</hi> Or how can all the Furies in
Hell give that single Soul the full of his
Deserts? So that by the Law of my own

               <p>I Hear that the Marriage of <hi>Philodemus</hi>

much sooner than your Letter
signified to me. Fame <hi>Anticipates</hi> the

of that Goddess, how long soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

before the Post. And indeed I have
just cause of Quarrel against her. As
many other occasions have fixed upon
me the unjust Reproach of Cruelty, so
chiefly by her means is it that I am Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

Trumpets out my Name where-ever she

                  <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> too,
and his Complices in the Bull. I were
afraid lest upon my pardoning them,
you should have given over your pushing
your Countrymen upon the beginning a
Quarrel with me. 'Tis a perfect plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to me to hear what work you and
your Mob make with my Name, which
I should be deprived of, should once
the <hi>Camarinaeans</hi> come to have more
Wit, and be ashamed of hearkening to
any thing that such a Tool of an Orator
as you are can say to them; whose im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
Attempts are too Harmless, I
will not say for <hi>Phalaris,</hi> but for any of
<hi>Phalaris</hi> his Slaves to be afraid of. Or
though it had been their Interest to have
made War against the <hi>Agragantines,</hi> yet
to have done it upon your perswasions,
would have been their Infamy. But
now they are like to meet with a War
that will prove more mischievous to
them than even their Orator himself; or
rather their Orator, as he brought this
War upon them, so he is himself a Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Plague to them, than all the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of War. But when you put your
Countrymen upon taking up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, it had been but fair in you
at the same time to have given them


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104652:91"/>
some reason for their so doing: that
while the State, depending upon the
Conduct of so Martial a Spirit as your
self, thought fit to undertake a War,
she might also have had her Manifesto
in Readiness to Declare to all the World
the injuries that forced her upon that
last Remedy. But this was more than you
would do: for after ye had been Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
upon the matter as long as you
could, one offering one Reason, another
another, at last you were content to let
them all drop and leave the cause to shift
for itself. But if one might divide your
Person from your Office, and with a Salvo
to the Reverence due to a Magistrate,
consider what you are of a Man; one
might venture to say, that all the Arts of
Cruelty would be but too gentle a reward
for your Deservings, who after having
sold your House and Land, and (if your
Father left you any) your Houshold
goods, to prove yourself no better an
Husband for the Publick than you were
for your Family, must now be raising a
Mercenary Army against me, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the <hi>Camarinaeans</hi> in New and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
Adventures. As for your own
part indeed, that a man who hath
nothing to lose should be so Daring


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104652:91"/>
an Undertaker, is no great wonder. For
nothing but the thoughts of your own
Desperate Fortune could have made you
run a Tilt at me, at whose hands you
are sure to meet with a Treatment an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to your Merits. But 'twas Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionably

you few Honest men, whom alone I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

promise me a visit, save <hi>Callisthenes?</hi> and

especially since I hear of your Indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

and for that Reason were I the less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to separate your Person from your

what pretence can you make <hi>for being

For what else should be the meaning of

have drawn upon you the Envy of your

been an Accursed thing, and under the

               <head type="sub">Vid. Ep. 131, 135</head>
               <p>I Had designed to have given a visit in
person to <hi>Cleoeneta,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodemus,</hi>
(you know whom I mean, <hi>Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crus)</hi>
upon the Affair of her Daughters
Marriage, but that some other pressing
Occasions, which may not be Postponed,
prevented me: and which are such as
would have made me call you home to
my Assistance, had I not rather chose to
leave you at <hi>Syracuse,</hi> to pursue the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
upon which I now write to you:
and by that you may see how much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
I am about it. Wait upon her
therefore yourself, and engage for the
Payment of five Talents to her Son-in-law,
as soon as her Daughter shall have
made her that new Relation. But so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the matter, that it may not seem the
Giving of a Gift, but the Payment of a
Debt which I owed to her Husband. If
she ask you, how <hi>Philodemus</hi> should come
to have so much Money, you need only
answer you know not how: that you
know no more of the matter than what
you had from me, that so much Money
of <hi>Philodemus</hi>'s I have lying in my hands.


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104652:96"/>
And if you can Fairly bring it about, let
<hi>Leo</hi> be the person. For he hath been
with me to sollicit the Match, and I
readily Assured him of my best Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
and with that promise have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him to you. But if the Mother
of the young Lady shall pitch upon some
other Husband for her Daughter, make
the same Engagement (as to her Portion)
to him, and oppose not their Intentions.
For I would not confine her Choice or
my Liberality only to the person of <hi>Leo,</hi>
nor because I give the Money take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me to make the Match too; as if it
were not <hi>Philodemus</hi> his Daughter, but
my own Friend that I preferr'd. To
whomsoever she shall dispose of her
Daughter, I charge you, be as Quick and
Punctual to your Engagements, as a man
would be that had Appointed not to Pay
Money but to Receive it. Heaven forbid,
that the change of the Person to whom
I wish the Gift, should prevent my Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it, and lay me open to the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Suspicion of catching at the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of <hi>Leo</hi>'s not having her, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the offer which I first made to them
freely, and without any such Reserve!
The Eye that sees all things knows,
how I abhor so base a thought: I look


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104652:97"/>
upon the Money as so much Loss to me,
while it lies in my own hands, nor shall
I till Then think my self the Richer for it,
When the young Lady shall have chosen
an Husband upon whom I may bestow
it. Worse than such a thing as That they
that know nothing of me could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
concerning me. And oh, that
Fame would once do Justice to the Name
of <hi>Phalaris.</hi> and speak no worse of him
than what he deserves! When she shall
be Married, present to her the four
young Damosels, (whose Age suits with
hers, and makes them fit to be her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
and Companions) as also the
Vestments I have sent you for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and 60 pieces of Gold. Forward
the matter as much as you can, for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
it goes on but slowly. And when
the time comes see the Presents delivered
with all Dispatch: since by so doing,
though the Expence be wholly <hi>mine,</hi> a
great part of the Thanks will be <hi>yours,</hi>
and you will come in for a Joynt Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
with <hi>Phalaris.</hi> As to these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
take care to see my Orders ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
And in every things else let
them find such a Friend of you, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Daughter in the absence of her
Father, nor the Wife in the absence of


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104652:97"/>
her Husband, may have any cause to
Complain that their Family wants its Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
Do you provide them with all
Necessaries, and when the Nuptial Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
shall be performed, see them done
with due magnificence, you depositing the
Moneys to answer all Expences. That
on the day made for Rejoycing, there
may be no mixture of Sorrow, nor any
of the Brides Relations be able to accuse
the Fortune of the Family, or call <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi>
an Unhappy man. I'll let the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racusians</hi>

               <p>THe absence of your Husband, my
unvaluable Friend, <hi>Philodemus,</hi>
upon his long Voyage may be the more
supportable to You, as adding a fresh
Lustre to your already established Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
but it doth not fall out alike For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
to your Daughter, who hath
now seen the Twentieth year of her
Age without taking a flight out of the
House of her Father. The longer an
Husband continues absent from his Wife,
the greater opportunity doth he give


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104652:98"/>
her of approving her Fidelity; but the
longer a young Lady, whose years might
expect the change of her Condition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
without an Husband, may bear a
Different Reflection. Common Opinion
(and herein it is in the Right) makes a
Daughter, beyond the Course of Nature,
Undisposed of an Objection against the
Care of her Parents. 'Tis now high time
(and somewhat of the Latest) that your
Daughter should have merited the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
which yourself most deservedly
wear, of making an excellent Wife. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you find it some relief to you in
the Absence of <hi>Philodemus</hi> to have always
in your Eyes, that pledge of mutual
Love, and dear Remembrance of him,
that is your Daughter, as in Her enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of Him. But'tis praeposterous
not to be content to part with your
Daughter, because in her you Enjoy the
<hi>Remembrance</hi> of your Husband, and
yet at the same time to deny her the
Happiness of a Relation, in which you
yourself find such Satisfaction, and of
which her years making her now capable;
the Absence of an Husband, e're long to
return, ought not to be Interpreted by
you a greater Infelicity to yourself, than
the not yet Having one to your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104652:98"/>
Especially when neither her want of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to make that Provision for her, nor
their want of Money wherewith to do it, is
in the cause; as neither is with her, which
renders her Case so much the more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.
For let me tell you. <hi>Cleoeneta,</hi>
what I suppose you little imagin, <hi>Philode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
at his Departure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> put into my hands
five Talents as a Portion for his Daughter.
Nor is that all: While <hi>Phalaris</hi> hath
Money, <hi>Philodemus</hi> and his Family shall
not want it. Why therefore, <hi>Cleoeneta,</hi> since
you have in your hands the means of doing
it, should you any longer defer the bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her upon an Husband? For I see no
reason for your putting it off till <hi>Philode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
his Return. What may conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
be let alone till then let us not
meddle with before: but the Demands
of Nature wait not our Leisure. There
is no putting a stop to Time. While we are
Debating the matter, her Years are flying
away. That <hi>Philodemus</hi> Disposed not of
her himself, he was prevented, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
by some of those Reasons which
force a Father to see his Daughter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married
beyond her time. But for her
being longer detained in the same State,
you can make no pretence. She should
now be past wanting a Father, being a
fitter Companion for a Husband. <hi>Add


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104652:99"/>
not therefore Indiscretion to Misfortune,
nor, by the Cruel fondness of keeping her still
to your self, make the</hi> Absence of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
less a punishment to her, than the
presence of her Mother. Accept the
Advice I give you, and consult at once
the Felicity of your Family, and your
Daughters Honour. As many other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have successfully passed through
your hands, without the assistance of
<hi>Philodemus:</hi> so in the bringing this one
Affair (in which the happiness of all of
you is so much Interested) to an happy
Conclusion, and giving him upon his
Return the sight of a Worthy Son-in-law,
you will encrease the Admiration
he already hath of your Prudence, <hi>and
let him see how little the Daughter of
such a Mother stand, in need of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
The Money <hi>Teucrus</hi> shall pay upon
Demand; and whatever else the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
shall require, 'tis but letting him
know your Pleasure, and it shall be done
for you. As for <hi>Philodemus,</hi> you may
pray indeed to Heaven for his Return
before the Nuptial day; but defer not
your Daughters happiness upon that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.
And that he will return both
Safe and Within the time, as you have
many other Reasons to hope, <hi>so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

               <p>I Have according to your desire written
to <hi>Stesichorus</hi> about the Poem upon
your Wife, and given him the Particulars
of the Subject. He readily undertook the


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104652:100"/>
Work,<note place="margin">V. Not. Ox.</note> and promised to exert the utmost
of his Abilities upon it, as hoping * <hi>by the
Charms of his Muse</hi> to allay the Excesses
of your Grief. 'Tis true indeed, your
Unhappiness may seem too great to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of Comfort, or be lessened by
words, having lost in One and the same
Person two most endearing Relations:
The partner of your Blood, a Neece;
and of your Bed, a Wife, both in Beauty
and Virtue, far surpassing any <hi>Second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> of
her Sex. Thus pierced with a double
wound, wasting your breath in doleful
Lamentations, you languish in despair, and
little matter whither you Live or Dye.
Be not, <hi>Nicocles,</hi> so Cruel to your self,
nor load Nature with a burden she is
unable to bear. Such violent Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
both betray a weakness unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a man, and will render your Wound
uncurable. But come, <hi>Nicocles,</hi> let me
argue the matter with you a little. Remove
your thoughts some minute space from off
your own Misfortunes, and place them
upon the Common Fate of all Mankind,
and the sad Necessities of our Mortal
condition. We are all of us born to run
through a world of Miseries, of which
when every one hath received his allotted
Portion; then hath he finished his Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104652:100"/>
and is come to the end of his
Course. The only thing that makes us
in love with a Life so Miserable, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we think nothing more Miserable
than Death: and when we express such
grief at the Death of our Friends, we
consider not that 'tis ourselves we La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the Tears we shed at the Funerals
of them that go before us being but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon our <hi>Own,</hi> so soon after to
follow. This, <hi>Nicocles,</hi> is what we are
all Born to. When we receive the Gift
of Life we receive the Sentence of
Death: a Sentence so Impartially execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon all, that none have cause of
Complaint. For the Tyranny of Fate is
not more Irresistible than it is Impartial.
Neither can Force withstand, nor Art
elude, nor Intreaty Avert the Stroak.
All <hi>Tyrant</hi> as I am, yet <hi>Fate</hi> is still a
greater <hi>Tyrant</hi> than <hi>Phalaris.</hi> Lawless,
Cruel, Inexorable, or whatever else the
World may say of me, her Cruelty sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
Mine. I am called an <hi>Absolute</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
but how Improperly so called,
that fatal Hour will prove, when all my
Castles, Guards and Arms shall be in vain.
Or could I be that <hi>Absolute</hi> Soveraign,
which no man can; not for my own sake
would I wish it, to rescue myself out of


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104652:101"/>
the hands of Fate (I am one whom many
think, nor can I contradict it, unworthy
to take out even my Appointed time)
but that I might be able to save such
men from Dying, who, let them live ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so Long, yet dye too Soon. But
since we lye at her Disposal, not she at
ours, we must submit with Patience:
[Cease therefore, <hi>Nicocles,</hi> your unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable
Grief] not only as being a thing
vain in itself, but for fear of disquieting
the Ghost of your Wife, to whom (if the
Spirits of the Departed know what's
done by them they leave behind) your
Lamentations cannot but create Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.
She, who in her life made it
her only business to study your Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and whose only Pleasure it was to
see you Pleased, must even after death
be grieved to see you grieved: nay, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Grieved, not only at your Loss in
being deprived of such a Wife, but at
her Own also, in being taken away from
such an Husband. Since therefore you
are neither the First, nor the Only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that hath felt the like Misfortune,
bear a Common calamity with the Spirit
of a man. The various Incidents of my
Fortune have Familiarized me to the
thoughts of Death: the common Fate of


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:104652:101"/>
kind, and the daily Spectacles of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
ought to do the like with you.
Our Concernments cannot alter the Law

and <hi>Ariphantus</hi> have told me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
you, nor let their pretending
themselves to have been put upon that
Bloody design by you and your Poems,
give you the least disturbance. How
narrowly I escaped their hands at <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi>
you yourself know; but since I
<hi>have</hi> escaped them, their naming your
<hi>Verse</hi> as the Motive of so <hi>desperate</hi> an
Undertaking, ought to be rather a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Rejoycing to you, than the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

that be a thing worth your Regard)
proving me to be placed above the
Power of my Enemies. If <hi>Stesichorus</hi> his
<hi>Lyre</hi> can put men upon Destroying Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
the <hi>Lyre,</hi> in his hands, is a more
dreadful Instrument, than the <hi>Trumpet:</hi>
but still the <hi>Fortune</hi> of <hi>Phalaris</hi> is too


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104652:104"/>
strong for the <hi>Lyre</hi> of <hi>Stesichorus.</hi> And
now, the Horrid danger past, I know
both where to shew my self a <hi>Tyrant,</hi>
and where a <hi>Friend.</hi> Nor is <hi>Stesichorus</hi>
a person to be involved in the same Fate
with <hi>Ariphantus</hi> and <hi>Eubulus.</hi> To <hi>them</hi>
I have been what they have deserved,
to <hi>you</hi> I am and ever shall be what I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
were. So far from altering my
Sentiments concerning You yourself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some who pretended themselves
your Admirers, designed my Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that had they Effected as well as
Designed it, I should have been unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have had the Blame laid at your
door. Nor, had I fallen by their hands
could it have been said that you were
any whit concerned in it. You may
perhaps, in some or other of your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and Majestick Poems have Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the <hi>Destroying</hi> of Tyrants as a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Action. Nor do I myself contradict
it. But to <hi>Destroy.</hi> Tyrants is one thing,
to <hi>Kill Phalaris</hi> another. This is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as
you well know) the first proof I have
had<note n="*" place="margin">Ep. 138.</note>: Neither hath<note n="*" place="margin">Ep. 138.</note> 
                  <hi>Dropidas,</hi> nor any
other man in the world, (not deserving
it) found me a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> no, not one.
Nor would <hi>Jupiter</hi> himself (who well
merits of Me the Title of <hi>Deliverer,</hi> and


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104652:104"/>
who best knows how to distinguish the
Just from the Unjust) when only <hi>Eubulus,
Ariphantus</hi> and <hi>Phalaris</hi> were left in his
Temple, have so miraculously delivered
the <hi>two</hi> Conspirators into the hands of
the <hi>one</hi> Tyrant, had he Judged me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of that Fate which they designed me.
'Tis true, that Sink of Lust, <hi>Conon;</hi> that
projector of my Destruction, <hi>Theagoras;</hi>
that <hi>Antimedes</hi> and <hi>Pericles,</hi> and what
others like them I have been able to get
into my hands, I have put to death:
but not Unjustly; their Actions against
me having been such, which, had I been
placed in a far lower Station than I am,
I would rather have lost my life than not
have Revenged. Let such as they are
call me Murderer, Monster, Atheist, Tyrant,
Enemy to God and Man, or what worse
Names they can Invent, and Spare me
not. To have their Praises, would, in
the sight of all Wise and Good men, be
my Reproach, and Mercy to them a
Crime; and Such a Crime which I shall
ne're be guilty of. Some of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have I caused to be shut up and
roasted in the Belly of my Brazen Bull;
others to be nailed to the Cross, and
hoisted up into the Empty Air, a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Spectacle of Slow death, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104652:105"/>
warning to all Beholders not to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing against <hi>Phalaris;</hi> others
have had their eyes burnt out of their
heads, others their hands, legs, and the
other extreme parts of their Bodies lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
off; others all their Bones broken
upon the Wheel; and others the skin of
their heads drawn over their faces: and
others have I put to several other kinds
of death, the very same which they were
contriving against myself; which who
can call <hi>Vnjust?</hi> To all these I must
confess I have been a Tyrant: and for
their sakes alone was it that I were so
Ambitious (nor do I deny it) of getting
into my hands a power above Controul,
that I might be able to give such Miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
their due Rewards. But to all Just
and Good men, the same am I now a
Monarch, that I were when a Private
man: over them I am no <hi>Vsurper.</hi>
Think not therefore, <hi>Stesiehorus,</hi> when
in any of your Poems the Muses inspire
you with an Indignation against the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancies
of a Lawless Power, that I
am the person you aim at. Receive their
Inspirations with a willing mind, and
freely give them Vent; nor let any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to me check the Current of your
Noble Thought. No hand can <hi>slaughter

Phalaris.</hi> (how much soever a <hi>Tyrant)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Term his Fate hath allotted
him. His Destiny is long since decreed,
and when the fixed period is come,
though there were not a Poet in the
world to write Verses against <hi>Tyrants,
Phalaris</hi> must dye. And whether sooner
or later, I submit to my Doom. In the
mean time <hi>Eubulus</hi> and his fellow Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators,
who thought Fate too <hi>tardy</hi>
with the Tyrant, and were for taking
her work out of her hands, have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the reward their daring Folly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd:
not that reward the Laws of
<hi>Greece</hi> propose to those vain-glorious
Fools that shall venture their lives to
murder a Tyrant, but that which such
Fools may expect when they fall into the
Hands of a Tyrant, who is above the Laws
of <hi>Greece.</hi> For causing them to be let
down breast high into the Cage where
the <hi>Himeraeans</hi> keep their wild Beasts, in
that posture, with the addition of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other Tortures, they continued one
whole day and night together before
they dyed. As for your self, <hi>Stesichorus,</hi>
long may you live and Happy. Fare you
well. And may you never, I will not
say meet with a Fate like theirs, (your
own Worth will secure you from that)


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:104652:106"/>
but may you never meet with Enemies
that would force you to be as Cruel as
<hi>Phalaris.</hi> As the Muses are your Glory,
so forsake them not. And to give <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I Think, That you enjoy your Liberty
is owing to me; but the Enjoyment
of your Liberty I shall not charge to you
as a debt, nor call you Ungrateful upon
that Account. But pay me, I beseech
you, the Moneys which you borrow'd of
me. For I have at present extraordinary
occasion for Money, and am fain to send
all <hi>Sicily</hi> over a borrowing. And some


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104652:106"/>
have supplied me of <hi>Free Gift,</hi> as the
<note n="*" place="margin">Ep. 118</note> 
                  <hi>Geloans</hi> and <hi>Leontines;</hi> others promised
me a <hi>Loan,</hi> as the <hi>Hyalaeans</hi> and the <hi>Phin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi>
What therefore mean you, O ye
<hi>Ennaeans,</hi> not to repay me my own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
when others, no way oblig'd to
me as you have been, freely supply me
with Theirs? And if those who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to lend me Moneys should hear,
that instead of calling upon my Debtors,
I should press upon others, upon whom
I can pretend no claim, would they not,
think you, be tempted to fall back from
their word, as having too great reason
to suspect, that the man who can so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Forget the Debts owing to himself,
would not much better Remember the
Debts he owes to others. All these
things consider'd, I hope you will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
any longer to delay me the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my Money. But if Reason and
Argument be of no force with you, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
your selves I shall speedily find out
some more powerful means than bare
words, which will force you to be <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,</hi>
if they may be said to be so, who
are not so till they are forced to it.</p>

               <p>HAving once resolved to Translate the
Epistles of <hi>Phalaris</hi> into <hi>English,</hi> and
made some entrance into the Work; it came
into my Head to enquire whether it were not
done into <hi>French.</hi> I found, methoughts the
<hi>Phalaridan</hi> both <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Stile</hi> very
much to symbolize with that of the <hi>Louvre,</hi>
especially in the more Majestick, and truly
<hi>Tyrannick</hi> Stroaks. The same Absoluteness
of Power, the same Vncontrolledness of
Dominion, the same Dispensings of either
Good or Evil according to the Arbitrement
of Soveraign Will, the same Triumphs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Opposition, the same Insultings over E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
the same Menacings of the Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
so frequently Display'd in the Epistles
of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrant, most exactly resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104652:109"/>
those magnificent Addresses with which
the Lofty Genius's of <hi>France</hi> strive to out-do
each other, in Caressing their <hi>Grand Monarch:</hi>
and the same <hi>Colours</hi> of Humanity not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
used to Palliate the utmost Severities:
the same <hi>Elaborateness</hi> of <hi>Composition,</hi> the
same <hi>Stateliness</hi> of Thought, the same <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roseness</hi>
of Stile in the one as in the other.
So that could I have met with a <hi>French Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris,</hi>
I were in great hopes to have found
not only the <hi>Sense</hi> of my Author facilitated
to me, but also his <hi>Oratory</hi> Improved to the
most elevated Strain of <hi>Magniloquence.</hi> And
then my <hi>English</hi> Reader might have seen a
true <hi>Phalaris:</hi> which now for want of that
Help appears in a plain and homely Dress,
and disrob'd of his chiefest Excellency; <hi>a
Stiffness, and Stateliness, and Operoseness
of Stile;</hi> having nothing but the naked Thought
(nor perhaps always that) <hi>Simply</hi> express'd,
to recommend it. I searcht all the <hi>Foreign</hi>
Shops, but no <hi>French Phalaris</hi> could I find.
But tho I miss'd of my Principal Aim, yet I
did not wholly lose my Labour. Rummaging
among a parcel of old Books under a Counter,
I met with a Collection of <hi>French</hi> Epistles.
'Twas imperfect, two of the first sheets being
wanting: so that I am not able to give any
Conjecture either of the Author or the Date.
At the end of it I found some sheets in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript,


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:104652:109"/>
which indeed pleased me as well, or
rather better than those in Print. Blessing
my self with so opportune a Discovery, I
resolv'd to turn some of them into <hi>English,</hi>
and <hi>Attail</hi> them as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to my <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris.</hi>
The Author of them is manifestly of
a more <hi>Recent</hi> Date, than either the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phist</hi>
or the <hi>Tyrant.</hi> But methinks there is
something of the same <hi>Spirit</hi> in Both. And
that he is not very Modern, besides, that the
writing doth not appear fresh, I conclude
from hence: because there is, methinks, more
of <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Design,</hi> and less of <hi>Word</hi>
and <hi>Phrase</hi> in him, than in most of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<hi>French</hi> Compositions I have met with.
As for his Character and Quality, it may be
guest at by his Writings: And as for the
Choice of the Epistles, I followed my own
Gust. There being somewhat in even the most
Familiar of them, which to me was Affecting.
Most of those I have given, are such as may
with a little change be applied to very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
occasions: And many of them so adapted
to the present posture of Affairs, that one
would think the Author was somewhat Related
to the Family of <hi>Nostradamus.</hi> But there
is nothing new under the Sun.</p>

Permit me only to say thus much of you:
That I am not more Deeply obliged to
you than I am Willingly so; and that I
do not more Depend upon you than I
Love you. Since in you I find that Rare
man, scarce to be met with elsewhere,
that Dispences a Favour with as Unassu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

and to whom a man may be a Debtor,
without being a Slave. I desire you first

'Tis that makes you so forward and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reserv'd

I know your Neighbour is a Cross-grain'd

broken all my Measures, and at one Blow

my Creditors for their Charitable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearances.
But now I despair not, God
granting me some few years life, (and for
no other end do I desire life) of being
able to Answer all their Demands And
among the rest, yours: Which nothing
but the Assurance I have of your Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

a great Dealer in the like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
yourself. Indeed, my Lord, we
might reckon you as one of us, were it
not for your Wealthy Condition. 'Tis
not impossible but that your Lordship's
self may upon some occasion or other
have experimentally found at how low
an ebb Invention runs when Nature is
exhausted with the Cares of Life (for
Grandeur also hath its Cares) the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
drooping by too long an Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from those Spirituous Liquids which
should Support it, and the Courage of
Thought broken by want of that Cordial

The Trade of Wit (how Aiery
soever it may seem) can no more than
any other Merchandize whatsoever, be
carried on without something of a Stock,
either in Cash or Credit, of both which


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104652:122"/>
our Society is equally Unprovided. To
say nothing of Books, of Habits, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
of Domestick Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of Intervallating Refreshments, of
the Indulgence of some Vanities which
are proper to our Character, and to
which we are Prompted by the Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
of Inclination; all which laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
require a Competent Supply: But
abating all this; the Care for to Morrow,
my Lord, the Care for to Morrow; that's
a pressing occasion, and strangely Abates
that Heat, without which there's nothing
to be done in our way. Nature startles
at the thought: but I am horribly afraid
on't: yes, my Lord, I am afraid
'twill come to that at last; That I shall
be changed from a Poet into a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.
