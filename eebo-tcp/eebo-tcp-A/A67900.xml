            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:115000:5"/>Our Lord knew with what great desire of restoring the state of the fallen Creation, He was sent into the World; And being fully fatisfied in the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the divine appointment, rejoycing that it was so accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the <hi>Father,</hi> that He should become a <hi>Saviour,</hi> He omitted no fit meanes to bring that purpose to effect; For which He received publickly great approbations from above, declared not onely <hi>in words,</hi> but other most <hi>significant Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was my design to <hi>throw a mite into this Treasury</hi> by the preaching of this Sermon; which exhorts us unto the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of Goodnesse, that by it we may attain a noble confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb facs="tcp:115000:5"/>
to God, and do honour to Him by the lively expressions of it in our actions. As men can be made good only by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of that <hi>Archetype Image,</hi> so I know nothing, by which one may so plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the excellency of Goodnesse, as by making it appeare to be the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and that none do truly <hi>worship</hi> him, but such as are like Him in <hi>dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and practise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the world hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Imperfection of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature: And those which have had the happines to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand better than others, have perceived that its defects are onely to be made up by a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of a Divine Nature.</hi> Neither have they more clearly
<pb facs="tcp:115000:6"/>
discerned, that the perfections of God are the infallible pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of all worthy imitation, then they have confidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that the chief thing in Divinity is Goodnesse.</p>
            <p>In the early dayes of the Heathen world, this notion was so deeply implanted in their minds, that when <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> had raised the <hi>Italians</hi> out of the miseries of vice by his excellent precepts, and formed them into the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a well-governed life; whilest their neighbours won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at their felicity, which they themselves perceived to be true by their inward sense, and general experience; what said they? <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:115000:7"/>
should bestow great blessings upon the world,</hi> I know not; If they had, it was made good in <hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>God manifest in the flesh</hi>: But they plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, How much they believed Goodness convertible with God, as also, in that, rather than they would attribute any evill to Him, as indeed they ought not, being ignorant to answer the Question; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; they would needes set up another Principle for the Authour of <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vill: not discerning, it seems, that the Creature, upon which goodnesse is <hi>derived,</hi> but not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably fixed,</hi> might <hi>degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> into <hi>evill</hi> by its own will, and so bring in mischief without setting up an <hi>Anti-God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As these things do suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb facs="tcp:115000:8"/>
declare that inseparable connexion, that is between the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, and supreme Goodnesse: So concerning his <hi>worship,</hi> it hath been pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on all hands, that there is no instance so <hi>considerable and proper,</hi> as the <hi>imitation of his goodnesse.</hi> They said of old, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Then we worship God best, when we imitate him most.</hi> This is a most <hi>reasonable service;</hi> For, how highly must they needs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Divine Nature, that count themselves, and all things else utterly contemptible, so far as they are unlike unto it? And have no Standard, by which they estimate worth, besides the resemblance of that Holy Image,
<pb facs="tcp:115000:8"/>
and knowing that to be such, do carefully endeavour to make themselves and others parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it.</p>
            <p>By these things we see what need we have to acquaint our selves well with the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and to take care, that we understand God aright: (not only) because <hi>true appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions</hi> of Him are necessary to <hi>bottome</hi> a <hi>good confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and are the <hi>roots</hi> upon which <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> grow, but also, because if we form wrong imaginations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, we shall quote him for a <hi>defence of our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse,</hi> and make the <hi>blasphemy</hi> of our <hi>errour</hi> very <hi>hardly curable.</hi> It was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable Argument, by which
<pb facs="tcp:115000:9"/>
the <hi>ancient defenders</hi> of <hi>chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion</hi> reproved the folly of the Heathen world, for attempting to introduce vertue into men,<note place="margin">Iust.

            <q>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</q>
            <p>SAint <hi>Paul</hi> having received a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in a Letter from the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be present at an Idol Feast, or to eat any thing that was sold in the Shambles, if
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115000:14"/>
it had been offered to an Idol before</hi> (either by the Owner, who having offered a part, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted the whole; or the Priest peradventure having brought his portion to the market) gave an answer to it, Chap. 8. and in this Chapter explains himself a little further.</p>
            <p>As to the first branch of the <hi>Question,</hi> he answers <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely,</hi> That they might not be present at an <hi>Idol Feast,</hi> it being a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>worship,</hi> or at least such an <hi>Appurtenance,</hi> as none could partake of without sin, the Heathens of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering part to the <hi>Devils,</hi> and feasting upon the rest. Those which pretend <hi>fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> as all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians do in the Feast of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115000:14"/>
               <hi>Holy Eucharist,</hi> must take heed of this <hi>Idolatrous Communion,</hi> lest they put <hi>Devils</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with <hi>Christ, who came to destroy their works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the other part of the <hi>Question,</hi> concerning things offered to Idols, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sold in the Shambles; he sayes they might eat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out scruple, because they knew an Idol to be nothing, and that the Earth, with the meats and fruits thereof (as also the Sea, Psal. 95. 5.) belong to <hi>God,</hi> and are held of us in his right, not of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> or any other heathenish God, or Goddesse. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a good man need make no question; but if any guest at the Table say, <hi>This</hi> or <hi>that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115000:15"/>
portion was offered to an Idoll,</hi> then he must forbear to eat of it; Why? he accounts an Idoll nothing; what is it the worse? It's true, it is not; yet forbear for his sake, for he esteems an Idol something, and worships it as a God, with the oblation of meat: and will by thy eating, after he told thee what it was, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his sinne, and so through thy <hi>true knowledge uncharitably managed, thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perisheth, whom Christ in love died to save.</hi> Thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster preferred the salvation of a sinner before his own life, and thou wilt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the tasting of a little meat, it may be but once to prevent thy brothers damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               </gap>y can scarce by any thing be so advanced by us, as by a prudent charity: so much may serve for the explication of the Coherence of the Text.</p>
            <p>The verse contains <hi>one</hi> of those <hi>two comprehensive princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> which divide the substance of Religion between them, and are of such important use to a good man in all his wayes, that he can never neglect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, but he must needs miscarry.</p>
            <p>The first is <hi>Dependance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115000:16"/>
upon God,</hi> that is, a constant clasping about Almighty Goodnesse, which hath given us a Being, but not without an absolute necessity of clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving still to it; without which, we cannot support our selves, as we perceive by that Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and feeblenesse, which we often feel in our selves. Alas! we should sink down into nothing, and so would the whole Creation, were it not for that omnipotent life, which penetrates through all things, to comfort and sustein them. Whosoever ceaseth this duty to God: the first Cause of all things, tears himself off from his root; withers, and becomes unprofitable to God and himself, and growes as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115000:16"/>
stupidly as the Trunks of senselesse Trees, upon roots that afford them sap and juice, though they know it not.</p>
            <p>The second is <hi>a sincere or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of our selves, and our works, to the honour of God,</hi> which is a consequent of the former: for it is as absurd <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> not to live <hi>to God,</hi> as it is impossible <hi>naturally</hi> to live <hi>of our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Latter is the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text, and I have the rather chosen it for the subject of this discourse, because though it is by many much <hi>talked of,</hi> yet few things are more <hi>mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> and none more negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>

               </note> i. e. <hi>Now what manner of thing should I be whilst I speak of God? what beauty of speech, what light of apprehension re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing it self in clear expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what harmony of well cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen words, is needfull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to my self and others, so great a matter?</hi> This he might well say, considring that by reason of the excellency of Gods Nature, the darknesse of our minds, and the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of speech, it is difficult to think or speak any thing worthy of him. Some by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115000:18"/>
of the unworthinesse of their soules, are apt extremely to debase the glory of God, and it is possible so far to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, that, in stead of praising him, we may blaspheme. And it is an acknowledged truth, that our Religion depends not upon a slight extramissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ill grounded expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or shallow affections, but upon a deep intramission of Gods reall excellencies.</p>
            <p>That we might not mistake the Divine Glory, he, who only could, hath told us what it is. When a worthy man, and one very familiar with God made this prayer to him,<note place="margin">Exod 33. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>I beseech thee shew me thy glory</hi>: he received a grant of his prayer in these words, <hi>I will

make my goodnesse passe before thee; which is called the Glory of God,</hi> Verse 22. <hi>Thou shalt see my back parts, for my face can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be seen:</hi> thou shalt see as much as can be shown, or is fit for thee to see; my Name shall be told thee, by which I glory to be known.

            <p>

in his uninterrupted care of all things in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective ages of the world, but especially <hi>in the fulnesse of time,</hi> when to make up the sad ruines of the lapsed, Creation, he put the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of it under the hand of his beloved Sonne, who came upon the stage, as <hi>the expresse image of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the brightnesse of his glory,</hi> which hath been mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for in him it shined most clearly.

            </p>
            <p>Divines use a distinction of glorification, <hi>which is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to be mentioned in this place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One is, <hi>Perfectio objecti glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificati,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the perfection of the object glorified; and to glorify in this sense, is to produce some perfection in the object glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,

God I have discoursed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that small matter that we reach to, I shall explain in a few particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We do honour to God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> if we preserve alwayes in our minds a right notion of his glory, and thrust farre from us all low poor thoughts of God. We cannot do a greater dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the highest worth, then to think meanly of it; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as the <hi>Father</hi> said, God may be represented to his disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the unwise. Therefore whensoever we think or speak of God, we should be sure to use no <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, no poor groveling expressions, or cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping imaginations, which fall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115000:26"/>
utterly below the worthinesse of so glorious a person. Since he can receive no glory by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any thing to what he is, let us not foolishly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to take away from him, by obscuring that which he hath revealed himself to glory in, by attributing to him any Temper, Disposition, or Design, that is unworthy of him. Let us raise our thoughts of God as high as we can, for by that which hath been said already, it appeares how far all unworthinesse is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from God. He neither made the world at first, or preserves it now for any self-interest: what <hi>Iulian</hi> said of <hi>AEsculapius</hi> (in his fortieth Epist.) <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>He gaines nothing by the exercise of his native good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but whilst he relieves those that need him, he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to do likewise. What glory or lovelinesse is in the Creation, which he had not before in himself? what could he attain out of himself?</p>
            <p>It is true, the works of God do praise him; it is but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent that they should, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that they should not.

All excellent things honour their Authour. <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God.</hi> Wheresoever the voyce of the Creatures is heard, they sing his praise.

upon God, for not giving us garce, or suffering us to be tempted, or I know not what, do we not accuse his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that he is rigorous, or hath outwitted us?

            <p>First, <hi>If we carefully labour for such a knowledge of Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Nature and will, as may lay a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115000:47"/>
sufficient foundation for those many acts of Religion, by which we are to acknowledge him. True Religion</hi> hath many <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> things in it, which have no support in <hi>ignorant soules,</hi> as for example, <hi>The highest Love, the most perfect Trust, the greatest submission of our wills,</hi> &amp;c. How shall a man perform these, if he be ignorant of that <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> which makes <hi>God</hi> most <hi>lovely,</hi> that <hi>Truth,</hi> which makes him <hi>faith-worthy,</hi> that <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> which require our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>obedience</hi>? God hath made it one <hi>characteristical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> of <hi>irreligious</hi> persons, <hi>They know not the Lord. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> is a note of <hi>wicked care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse</hi> in men, because they
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115000:47"/>
seek not the knowledge of so <hi>Noble</hi> a <hi>Benefactor,</hi> and it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries along with it all <hi>Irreligion</hi> in other instances. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was well said by the <hi>Philosopher, the true worship of God is founded upon a right apprehension of him.</hi> The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> by which he disproved the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan worship,</hi> goes upon the same ground. <hi>You worship that which you do not know,</hi> Joh. 4. 22. It is no wayes likely that the <hi>sacrifice</hi> should be <hi>proper,</hi> when the <hi>Altar</hi> is inscribed, <hi>To an unknown God<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Religious expressions,</hi> which are not founded in true <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> are alwayes <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and sometimes sadly <hi>blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</hi> Those which have not a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115000:48"/>
right understanding of God, <hi>pray madly</hi> to him, and <hi>speak foolishly</hi> of him. <hi>Religious affections,</hi> that are not bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed upon a good <hi>understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> are framed <hi>childishly,</hi> and continue <hi>accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those which would be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>religious,</hi> should take a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Notice</hi> of those <hi>Attributes</hi> by which God hath discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his nature. We must not make excuses for our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by pretending, <hi>that God is incomprehensible,</hi> the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> he is, the sooner we may <hi>find</hi> and <hi>apprehend</hi> him, as you may sooner find the <hi>Sea</hi> then a <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> or, <hi>that we cannot behold the naked Essence or Being of God,</hi> no more can we of <hi>any thing</hi> else. What is there
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115000:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the world, which we know, but by its <hi>properties</hi> and <hi>effects</hi>? And by them God is sufficiently knowable to us. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural knowledge of God is implanted in mens soules, as an <hi>inbred light</hi> in the <hi>eye</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to <hi>see</hi> him, and he hath made the Creation a <hi>fair glasse</hi> to reflect his proper at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, for <hi>the invisible things of him,</hi> which we talk of, <hi>his eternal power and Godhead,</hi> his <hi>goodnesse</hi> and <hi>wisdom, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully</hi> declared, <hi>which express the Divity of God,</hi> are clearly seen by the world which he hath made, and in his <hi>actions</hi> whereby he doth continually show himself, he is so <hi>discerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> revealed, that those which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115000:49"/>
do not <hi>see,</hi> and <hi>serve him,</hi> are without all <hi>apology</hi> of their <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> and disobedience.</p>
            <p>The works of God, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of <hi>benignity</hi> and <hi>goodnesse.</hi> are called his <hi>witnesses,</hi> Acts 14. 17. <hi>Neverthelesse he left himself not without witnesse, in that he did good,</hi> &amp;c. And the <hi>son of God,</hi> who came out of the <hi>Fathers bosome,</hi> out of an intimate acquaintance with God, he <hi>hath revealed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having all these assistances, let us improve our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, lest we <hi>mistake</hi> extremely in our devotions, and present an <hi>impertinent</hi> service.</p>
            <p>If the unworthy <hi>Iewes</hi> had but well considered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, they would have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115000:49"/>
offered a <hi>reasonable</hi> and <hi>living service,</hi> and not have been contented with <hi>brutish dead worship.</hi> They would have known that it was an <hi>affront,</hi> rather then an <hi>oblation,</hi> so to mistake God, as to think that he could be pleased with <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>smoake,</hi> and to underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue him to others by their <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming</hi> services, giving by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers occasion to think, that the true God smiled upon such impertinencies, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received such absurd vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</p>
            <p>He which nourisheth igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and unbelief in his mind, will be ungodly in his heart &amp; life; I must confesse, I think this so far true, that I am of his mind who said, <hi>that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115000:50"/>
the root of all wickednesse is Atheisme.</hi> He which <hi>disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> his Maker, and <hi>despiseth</hi> the Law of his Benefactor in a wicked life, would not do so if he believed that God made him, and that all the blessings of his life were his meer boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that God was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more lovely then any of his creatures, and that the time will come, when God will judge the wicked for their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous life, (for they sin by loving the <hi>creature</hi> more then the <hi>Creator</hi>) and that he will abandon them to torments for their wilful disobedience. But wicked men either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade themselves that there is no God, or that he is not such, as he hath declared himself to

            <p>We do honour to God, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>after we have got a right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Nature, we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our seves unto it,</hi> when, as the <hi>Apostle saith,</hi>

               <hi>we beholding as in a glasse the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image from Glory to Glory, by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> When we become <hi>imitators of God, as dear children,</hi> putting on the

            </p>
            <p>The reason of this is plain, <hi>for by our careful conforming our selves to God, we do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly acknowledge him to be the absolute pattern of all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and the Primitive co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of all beauty and perfection.</hi> Then we <hi>honour</hi> God in an <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi> instance, when we do in <hi>disposition</hi> and <hi>life, show</hi> and <hi>hold forth the virtues,</hi> or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull goodnesses <hi>of God, who hath called us out of darknesse into his marvellous light.</hi> When the light of <hi>wisdom, goodnesse,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>God is not so pleased with <hi>Temples made with hands,</hi> and he hath forbidden to attempt the making of <hi>foolish Images,</hi> but he is well pleased with every <hi>good</hi> man and woman, that make themselves the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> that offer their soules to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>acceptable</hi> sacrifices through the <hi>participation</hi> of the <hi>divine Image and Nature.</hi> When such a worshiper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares before God, he may bring what other sacrifice he will, he shall be accepted,—<hi>vel farre litabit.</hi>

which God will converse with a <hi>wicked</hi> man, his <hi>oblations</hi> are the <hi>sacrifice</hi> of <hi>fooles.</hi> His <hi>gifts</hi> may maintain the <hi>flames</hi> upon a <hi>visible</hi> Altar, and his offerings present something that <hi>Church-robbers</hi> will be glad to steal, but his soul is so unlike to God, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to worship, that he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres him and his offerings. He counts his name rather <hi>blasphemed,</hi> than <hi>honoured</hi> by the mouthes of the <hi>ungodly,</hi> when they presume to make mention of it, though with a great deale of <hi>seeming</hi> devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But those which really <hi>put out</hi> his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>expresse</hi> his <hi>Image,</hi> do truly glorify their Lord, and so our Saviour sayes

he <hi>was glorified</hi> in his <hi>true</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, Joh. 17. 10. and he sayes, that in his next coming, he <hi>will be glorified in them</hi> again, 2 Thes. 1. 10. when he will reveal to all the world, that his admirable holinesse was the only pattern of all true worth and excellency.</p>
            <p>The true appearances of this divine Image, are of such wonderful effect some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that they dazle the eyes of those which behold them, and make them confesse, as <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> saith in his Epistle of the Christians of his time, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>We glorify God <hi>if we resign <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> our selves to the Government of his will</hi>; for by so doing, we honour it above our own self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and the examples of all others that contradict it.

            </p>
            <p>The first is, <hi>when those that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> professe the faith of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, contradict the principles of reason with absurd assertions. Many</hi> things of <hi>Revelation</hi> are <hi>above reason,</hi> but <hi>none</hi> are <hi>contrary</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>The light of the <hi>Sunne</hi> is

no <hi>contradiction</hi> to the light of the <hi>Moon.</hi> We cannot deal with God or man, but by <hi>reason,</hi> which because the beasts want, we judge them incapable of <hi>Religion.</hi> How will you come near to a man that is not a <hi>Christian,</hi> but by such things as you both agree in? That is <hi>Reason,</hi> by whose <hi>mediation</hi> you may get within him, and prove the Scriptures to be the word of God; He will find <hi>reason</hi> to believe <hi>that,</hi> by the <hi>same</hi> principles, by which he gives credit to all <hi>other</hi> things. When you are so farre, you have another principle to deale upon; but you shut that dore, if you talk absurdly. Will you teach him <hi>greater</hi>

things, who are out your self in <hi>lesse</hi>? It is a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to your cause, when he sees you can say truly, with the Father,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>I have often thought, that among the many <hi>hinderances</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> which the more <hi>ingenuous</hi> part of the <hi>unbelieving</hi> world stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at, we may reckon the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant opinions,</hi> that have crept into the books of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and will needs be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, as the <hi>Dictates</hi> of our
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115000:64"/>
               <hi>most wise Master,</hi> when as they are the <hi>mistakes</hi> of his <hi>weakest disciples,</hi> and it may be thrust in by <hi>pretenders,</hi> and which he owns no more then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the <hi>Titles,</hi> which the <hi>Iewes</hi> put upon him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first Ministers</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion were very wary lest they delivered their <hi>own errand</hi> in their <hi>Masters name,</hi> and therefore made <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> between <hi>his mind</hi> and their <hi>private opinion,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his disparagement. Those which pretend to follow them, should be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, because all the world knowes, that they have no <hi>new message</hi> to deliver. By this meanes when they relate things, which they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115000:64"/>
from <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>single blame</hi> of their odde conceits, would ly only upon the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their <hi>own brains,</hi> or the guilt of some other infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but when they blend them with Christs instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are forced to suffer for company. So that their <hi>mistaken Expositions,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable consequences,</hi> and <hi>hurtsull additions,</hi> by which they pretend to <hi>illustrate</hi> or <hi>perfect</hi> the Mysteries of God, are of no more courteous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to the Gospel, then the <hi>wild</hi> embraces of the <hi>Ivy</hi> are to the <hi>Oak,</hi> which is <hi>deformed</hi> and <hi>weakned,</hi> whilst they grow up by it.</p>
            <p>It is well known how hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly guilty the <hi>Papists</hi> are in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115000:65"/>
this point: and no doubt they will one day <hi>pay dear</hi> for the <hi>scandal,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> are to be <hi>blamed</hi> besides them.</p>
            <p>How shall we avoid this Rock? <hi>If we neither deliver or receive any thing for Christs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted mind, but what is plainly set down in the holy Scriptures.</hi>

               <hi>The second offence is, when those which pretend to Grace and Holinesse, fall below Moral virtues, by sordid practises.</hi> There is no <hi>answering</hi> of this <hi>Question</hi> to one that is without the Church: <hi>Are you a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and yet below a man?</hi> Do you <hi>love God whom you have not seen,</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> your <hi>brother, whom you see</hi> in need of your love?

               <hi>Irenaeus</hi> long agoe observed, that when the filthy <hi>Gnosticks, a Band of Ranters,</hi> had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced <hi>Christian Religion</hi> with their abominable lives, the <hi>Heathens</hi> avoyded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation of those which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed themselves to be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> thinking they were <hi>all such.</hi> If those who are really wicked do perceive such as pretend to Christianity, to be as <hi>proud, cruel,</hi> and <hi>revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>; as <hi>covetous</hi> and <hi>base spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> or as <hi>intemperate,</hi> or to fail in other <hi>immoral instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>; they may well say, <hi>that Christian Religion is abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if it make its disciples such; and it is a pitiful poor thing, if it do not change them

               <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> praising their <hi>Vnity,</hi> of which he had heard by <hi>Onesimus,</hi> gives <hi>this</hi> for the great reason of it, <gap reason="foreign">

neither did they hearken to any, but only Christ Iesus, the true Shepherd and Master</hi>; and yet there were such among them, as he saith a little after, that would have brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them things unworthy of God, and contrary to the doctrine of Christ.</p>
            <p>When that <hi>Holy Rule</hi> is neglected, which whilst it is kept to, brings <hi>peace</hi> upon <hi>all that walk according to it,</hi> men fall into <hi>by-paths,</hi> and when one takes one way, and another a different; they fall to disputing which is the right.

there had bin differences before amongst good men both about Easter day, &amp; also the manner of Fasts, &amp; yet they agreed in love both among themselves,<note place="margin">

            <p>When it so falls out by the Providence of God, that there are differences in opinion as to some things, when each party refuses, charitably to bear with those which cannot embrace their opinions, they cast the Dice for the peace of the Church, and appoint each to be content with their lot, till they can get the greatest power, or
