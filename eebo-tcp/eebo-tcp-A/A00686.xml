            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that hath no heart. That is, it is a mercie of God, which hee hath no right and true vſe of. So neceſſarie in verie outward things is both feeling and faith: the one to conceiue, the other to applie, and both of them to yeeld vs the true profit, comfort, and good intended into vs in the ſame by the Lord. Much more, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, in ſpirituall matters reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the life of bodie and ſoule for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And by name much more in the worde of God which we now ſo freely, and ſo plentifully, vnder the gratious gouernement of our moſt gracious Prince enioye.

I haue often ſecretly in my ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to ioyne vnto prayer ſome further indeuour, and according to that meaſure of mercie, which the Lorde ſhould voutſafe me, to make ſome plaine applications of ſuch portions of ſcripture, as I ſhoulde iudge in vſe &amp; practiſe fitteſt for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

For as his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promiſes are manie and ſwéete (as we haue heard) to the poore, ſo are his fearefull threatnings to the rich not a fewe: and as great is the good that is wrought in the childe of God by this croſſe of want, ſo feareful are the faults that are giuen vnto the ſoules of many by their ſtore of wealth. Let it ſuffice to marke what this ſame our Sauiour ſaith, by the mouth of <hi>Luke</hi> and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ouer againſt the promiſe ſpoken of nowe alreadie: <hi>Woe be to you that are rich, for you haue receiued your conſolation,</hi> ſaith he, and after him his apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> again: <hi>Go to now ye rich men, weepe and houle for your miſeries which ſhall come vpon you: your riches are corrupt, and your garments mothea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: your golde and ſiluer is cankred, &amp; the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, and ſhal eate your fleſh as if it were fire, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> againe, <hi>Gaine</hi>

gaine, if a man be content with that he hath: for we brought nothing into the world, and it is certaine that we can ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nothing out.

But thou O man of God flie theſe thinges and followe after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, godlineſſe, faith, loue, paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and meekeneſſe, fight the good fight of faith, laie holde of eternall life, &amp;c.</hi> By all which we doe as euidently ſée againe that Honour, Fame, Port, Pompe, wealth and abundance in this worlde are no ſure witneſſes of Gods fauour, and therefore the want of them no ſure argument of the contrarie, but the ende and verie trueth is this, if we feare God and bee poore, pouertie is great gaine. And if further the Lord goe

For what can you ſaie nowe, groning vnder this griefe of yours, traueling &amp; heauie loaden with your ſins, what can you ſay, I ſaie, if you ſaie your worſt, but euen crie out vpon the fulneſſe and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8800:22"/>
fouleneſſe of your iniquitie, vppon the ripeneſſe and rottenneſſe of your ſinne, ſaying your life is loſſe vnto you, and there is no ioy vnder the ſunne, that you can conceiue of anie thing by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your ſinne? For you haue béene an J<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater, a blaſphemous ſwearer, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth breaker, a diſobedient child to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes and ſubiect to Prince, a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer malicious and ſpitefull, an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer wanton and light, a thiefe deceitful and vniuſt, a falſe witneſſe, an euill thinker, and what not? And therefore though for manie ſinnes you could hope of mercie, yet for ſo many you cannot, but a heape togither beateth you down, when many ſingle ones could not do it. This is the worſt you can ſaie, and this is ill ynough if God giue not faith: Yet ſée howe all this is nothing, where this promiſe is marked. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ſorrowe, this mourning, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort and griefe that you haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by ruing of your life, is a ſure token, that you are the Lordes, and that he hath mercie for you, if you will
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8800:23"/>
not ſtand in defiance of him, but be of good hope he ſéeth you. And my proofe is no worſe than the Lords owne words, <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourne,</hi> (for their ſins and tranſgreſſions, for their wants and weakneſſe, and for their looſe courſe in the waies of ſo good a God) <hi>for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> Shall he ſay bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and you ſay curſed? ſhal he promiſe comfort, and you ſay you are caſt a way? God forbid. Remember what the ſpirit ſaith in the 1. <hi>Iohn 5. 10. Hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth not God, hath made him a lier.</hi> And therefore conclude with your ſelfe and be chéered with it, were there no more promiſes (which yet are many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides) of mercie vnto ſinners, yet were this ſufficient to ſtay the weakeneſſe of anie, if the Lorde be in them to giue them faith in it, that the God of trueth hath pronounced happineſſe to this wo, and intailed ſurely a certaine comforte in time to deſcende vnto this ſorrowe.

ſerueth not now to make a treatiſe of a conference: and when ynough is ſaide, why ſhoulde you not be ſatiſfied? God hath ſpoken it, the power of Hell ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not diſprooue it, you ſhould beléeue it, and I doe end with it, happy are you, or anie man or woman in the worlde, if you féele your ſinne and ſorrowe for it, ſo that you wil beléeue. For you are not caſt away, but you ſhall be comforted: you wéepe nowe, but you ſhall laugh, and you ſhall féele the performance of the wordes of <hi>Dauid</hi> Pſalme 126. 5. <hi>They that ſowe in teares, ſhall reape in ioy: and they that go weeping and carie pretious ſeed, ſhall returne with ioy, and bring their ſheaues with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Wheras y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame god ſaith with a thundring ſound, woe be to them that laugh nowe, for they ſhall wéepe.

Or yet more fullie ſuch (as an other ſaith) as are not of nature fearce, and deſirous euer of reuenge, but milde, tractable, courteous, ſoft, and gentle, eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing a wrong, if it be done vnto them, hating chidings, contentions and ſtrife, readie to giue place to euerie bodie, and chooſing rather with a quiet minde to committe all to God, than with intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate heate to purſue his owne right.

And though I ſée in the ſcripture manie other notable places ſounding foorth the ſame, and manie reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing by forcible concluſion the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of it, and many examples of the tried good that hath growen thereby, yet as to others God giueth a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of one thing than an other, ſo this to me I finde more pearcing than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I muſt néedes confeſſe.

the Lorde by name hath not inioyned this temperance of affections and ſwéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of nature, which now I ſpeake of.

That which beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euerie calling, and euerie perſon, ſhal it not bewtifie you thinke you? And that which is forbidden to euerie one in ſo expreſſe plaineneſſe, can you thinke the Lorde will euer allow in your ſelfe? Surelie he will not, and therefore know it and thinke of it, if you pleaſe the Lord
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8800:28"/>
you muſt be méeke.</p>
               <p>The reaſons I ſpake of be theſe and ſuch others. Firſt the Apoſtle in his epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Galathians</hi> reckoning vp the <note place="margin">Galat. 5.</note> fruites of the ſpirite which neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in anie truly, but in ſuch as ſhall be ſaued, reckoneth this as one amongſt them, to be méeke, and amongeſt the fruites of the fleſhe, that ſhall leade vs vnto death, he reckoneth the contrarie, choler and heate, whereupon wee our ſelues (as cleare as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſun) may ſée, that if the Lorde voutſafe vs this change of nature from ſowre to ſwéete, and from anger to méekeneſſe, there is no more comfortable crie can happen in this earth vnto our ſoules, that they are the Lordes. And if he doe not, then as migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie miniſtreth it an argument againe of woe, alas, and endleſſe woe vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Secondlie to be méeke is a true imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt, for <hi>Learne of me</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>I am meeke and lowly in hoart.</hi> But <note place="margin">Math. 11. 29.</note> he that treadeth the ſteps of this Lorde and God, ſhall neuer die: and therefore
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8800:29"/>
bleſſed are the méeke. Contrariwiſe to be haſtie, furious, and intemperate, is to followe <hi>Caine, Eſau,</hi> and all repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, which whoſo followeth, ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer liue, and therefore curſed is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, the Lorde careth for vs if wée be méeke, and watcheth ouer our wronges, ſéeing all the wordes &amp; déedes and verie thoughtes conceiued againſt vs, and the Lorde will pay our debtes if we leaue it to him and iuſtle him not out of his throne, ſitting downe our ſelues therein as iudges and reuengers of our owne cauſes. He knoweth our vpriſing, and downe lying, he is about our bed, and about our pathes, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out all our goinges, and ſéeth hée not when we are wronged? He hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a reckoning of the verie heyres of our heads, he putteth our teares into his bottle, and are not our wronges thinke we noted in his booke? O therefore how ſhould we our ſelues learne to be méeke, to forgiue, and to referre our ſelues euer to him, ſince we haue ſuch a iudge? The
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8800:29"/>
wife whileſt her huſbande liueth, quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her ſelfe from forren toyles, and leaueth all incumbrances to him, for he careth for them: but if he by death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from her, then ſhe her ſelfe, becauſe ſhe hath loſt her aide. Nowe we, if we be indéede as wee thinke wee are, the children of the Lorde, we are the ſpouſe of an huſbande that neuer dieth, but in life is permanent, in power ſufficient, in care ſtill vigilant, and therefore how ſhould this conſideration kill our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, mortifie our haſtie heartes and handes, and altar vs daily to an heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temperance, patience and méekenes? The Lorde is our aduocate to put vp our ſute, the Lorde is alſo iudge to giue ſentence of our wrong, and <hi>Frailtie</hi> then howe can any eſcape that hurteth vs, if we would be méeke, and leaue it vnto him? Me thinke, me thinke I could euen dwel continually in this conſideration, it is ſo comfortable. What madneſſe ſhould moue vs to harbour our hurt, to hatch vp our harme, and to kéepe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters boyling and feſtring within vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forgiuen
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8800:30"/>
and vnforgotten, when wee haue ſuch a Judge? God ſtrengthen vs and giue vs victorie of our ſelues. But why <hi>Frailtie,</hi> ſtandeſt thou yet ſo mute? Beléeueſt thou not all this? If thou doſt yet hang in the bryers of thy vnrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med paſſions, adde hereunto ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe of paſſed practiſe, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp; let that as mightie to perſwade, confirme and comfort thée to this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, if it be the Lordes will.</p>
               <p>The Iſraelites in <hi>AEgypt</hi> oppreſſed and harmed, could not with right coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaile might, but as patiently and méekely as God made them able, abid it, and cried vnto the Lord, and what fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed?

For the one thus as you ſée is prooued, and truly the other is as true. For what gouernment are they worthy, that wil not gouerne, as they poſſibly can themſelues well? What trueth can they know, that can not abide to heare indifferently both parties? No, euery man ſhal frame him ſelfe to their humours till his turne be ſerued, and truth ſhall neuer dare to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before them. What daunger can be preuented, or what guilefull gueſt ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be diſcouered, when heate doth thunder out threates, ere the time ſerue to take knowledge of the matter? The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie is armed, the friend is diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and iudge your ſelfe then howe

ſtrength is impaired. What ſeruant, if God rule not in him mightily, will tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerue, where comfortable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance either giueth not hope of conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient rewarde, or at leaſt preſently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth, what is done, in fauour? What one that hath anie gifts, friends, or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, will euer abide with a louing and true hart, where reproches and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, are his daily death? No, no, it will neuer be, nor it cannot be. Well may a worldlie minde in regard of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed time and charge make men rubbe out and carie coales, till they can do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or may get a cheate, but the heart being alienated, and the true faithfull kinde affection that is aboue golde, worne away with ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rebukes, which being not digeſted ſend vp at times as tokens of their remaining a bitter taſt, all is but hollowe, all is but in regarde of themſelues, and if time ſhoulde ſerue to néede them. God knowes howe their ſnubbed harts would call their ſnubbes to remembraunce, whereas méeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, gentleneſſe, comfort and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8800:32"/>
maketh a ſeruant true in his dealings, painefull, willing, conſtant in his place, and readie euen to die in the ſeruice of them whoſe louing vſage hath pierced his ſoule with a permane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t affection if he be of any good nature, and if he be not, the ſame vertue of méeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe watcheth, loketh, heareth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth all things wiſely, not bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe, till he haue found indéede a hollow ſeruant, and then wéedeth out iuſtly ſo ill a member.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſaie againe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be of diſorder in your affections, be they at home or abroade, truely <hi>Frailtie</hi> fight with your ſelfe, and neuer ſuffer your infirmitie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile.

Notwithſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider you for your confirmation what godly men in the ſcriptures haue euer done: and if God will haue mercie vpon you, reform your nature to their alow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſe.

the altar, that is, if a man ſpende him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, his bodie, his minde, his goods to inſtruct people in the way of ſaluation, &amp; require of them againe meate, drinke, and clothing for his paines, doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a thing vnreaſonable, or doeth he demaunde anie more than is his due right? Yet did <hi>Paul</hi> the déere ſeruaunt of the Lorde hunger and thirſt after this righteouſneſſe, and had it not. <hi>For vnto this houre</hi> ſaith he of himſelfe, <hi>we both</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8800:36"/>
right. What did <hi>Ioſeph</hi> hunger and thirſt for, but to be reputed honeſt, when hee was honeſt, and not ſtained with that crime which his ſoule abhorred? Yet did he want it. What did all the Prophetes and Martyres deſire, but Gods glorie to be increaſed, and their owne liues ſaued when they deſerued no death? Yet did they want it.

the Lorde ſée his time to ſatiſfie vs. And I pray you <hi>Frailtie</hi> conſider of it. You ſée it with your eyes, your excuſe is nought, be your right neuer ſo good, and your wrong neuer ſo great.

Whereby I am often (I confeſſe my corruption) driuen euen to the point of this worldly and wicked concluſion with my ſelfe, Let them ſinke or ſwimme for mee, I wil ſeeke to liue my ſelfe out of al mens daungers, and I wil neither borrow nor lend, giue nor take, make nor meddle. Let other mens wantes be other mens woes, and God helpe them, there are manie waies to make a man poore, though his hand be harde ynough. Now this I know is vngodly, and I was not borne to doe thus, yet Frailtie I am, and by reaſon of the monſtrous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude that the worlde aboundeth with, perforce I confeſſe it, I am often driuen towardes this rocke.

mercie, yet regarding your nature ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the néede of the thing, adde vnto al this but ſome litle view in your minde of the vertue it ſelfe in it ſelfe, and it may be you ſhall finde ſtrength increaſed by it. Is it not in his nature thinke you an aſſured vertue, that God maketh euer anie promiſe of rewarde vnto? Or can it make miſerable that <note place="margin">Mich. 6. 6. Coloſ. 3. 12.</note> the Lord ſaith, maketh bleſſed? Or is it not cauſe ynough to continue you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the practiſe of it, that the Lord ſo often, ſo earneſtly, and ſo generally to all eſtates commaundeth it? Surely it is, and therefore mercie in it nature is a moſt notable vertue. Is it not to be honored that maketh men in whome it is ſo renowmed, as that all ages ſpeake and write of their names and natures for it? But this vertue of mercie hath béene ſuch to many, and therefore in all truth, a notable vertue. For proofe of my aſſertion, I let paſſe the multitude of the faithful, whome either ſcriptures or ſtories, or preſent practiſe, as yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs honorably ſpeake and think
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8800:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of. And I remember you onelie of his name, whoſe nature in this action (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an heathen) hath often well liked me <hi>Alexander the great.</hi> Whom when <note place="margin">Note.</note> one <hi>Petillus</hi> humblie beſought to helpe him with ſome money towardes the beſtowing of his daughter in mariage, by and by he commaunded 50. talentes to be giuen vnto him: and when the man refuſed ſo great a gift, ſaying, that ten talentes would ſuffiſe, beeing tolde of it he alſo aunſwered, that it behooued a good nature, not onelie to conſider what an honeſt friende doeth aſke, but what his abilitie is well to ſpare and giue. Thinking belike (which in trueth is often ſo indéede) that either modeſtie, or feare, or ſome one regarde or other, may make an honeſt nature, not aſke ſo much as in déede he ſtandeth in néede of manie a time, &amp; therefore good reaſon a faithfull friend ſhould haue reſpect to ſuch an one aboue his aſking euer.</p>
                  <p>Was not this a ſwéete nature then, and a notable vertue in this man? Or can anie man reade this of him, and not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8800:43"/>
loue and like him for it. Great therefore is the praiſe of mercie and tender kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe euer. By mercie we reſemble God, and prooue our ſelues his children: For <hi>our heauenlie father is mercifull.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 6.</note> By mercie we become inſtruments and as it were amners to the Lorde to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his gratious benefites to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and euen verie equitie requireth it at our handes, that if we finde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie our ſelues in all our néedes with God, wee ſhoulde not denie it in their wantes vnto our brethren. For ſo ſaith <note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> the Lorde to that euill ſeruaunt in the Goſpell, that he ſhould haue forgiuen, becauſe he was forgiuen himſelfe, and ſhewed kindneſſe to his fellowe, ſince he had founde it with the Lorde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Laſt of all that fearefull threate of mercie euer to be denied to vs, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it our ſelues to others ſhould ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and ſtaie vs in this vertue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore. Therefore looke not I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vpon mens acceptance of our doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but looke vpon the vertue it ſelfe, howe it adorneth a man, howe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8800:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a man, and howe it maketh his fame to flie both farre and néere in euerie place. And looke vppon the ſure rewarde, that is promiſed to it by the Lorde. If you be mercifull you ſhall be bleſſed, if you bee mercifull you ſhall haue mercie, if you bee mercifull you ſhalbe renowned, you ſhall aſſure your ſoule that you are the Lordes, becauſe you reſemble his nature, and if you be not, both God and man ſhall curſe you: Therefore be mercifull. This may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage vs, and this will incourage vs certainely <hi>Frailtie,</hi> if the Lorde be not quite departed from vs. But as it is néedful that this vertue ſhould be in vs, ſo is it as néedefull that it be rightly in vs, for otherwiſe we deceiue our ſelues, and wee ſhall miſſe the rewarde in the ende. And therefore as I haue indeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſtirre you vp vnto it, ſo it ſhall not be vnprofitable per aduenture alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether if I alſo direct you a little in it. Some then haue thought this vertue to haue béene deliuered in the verſe before which we haue heard of vnder the name
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8800:44"/>
of méekeneſſe, but in déede they differ much. For méekeneſſe then is ſhewed, when we our ſelues are wronged, and yet reuenge not, but put it vp and leaue it to the Lorde. And mercie when wee our ſelues being no way hurt, yet are touched and mooued with other mens wantes, and euen ſuffring with them becauſe they ſuffer, indeuour ourſelues to our abilitie to relieue and helpe them. So that this vertue of mercy as you ſée, ſtandeth of two partes, to wit, of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der féeling, and compaſſion within vs, and of an outwarde louing helpe with our abilitie whatſoeuer it is without vs. The miſerie of man is of two ſorts, and therefore alſo this mercifull pitie and helpe of as many. For either a man wanteth what is néedefull for his ſoule, or what is conuenient for his bodie. And both of theſe doth a mercifull chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian tender and pitie, and helpe, as he can. Of the former we haue a proofe in the example of our ſauiour Chriſt, whoſe <note place="margin">Marke 6.</note> bowels euen yerned and heart aked to ſée the ſpirituall miſerie and want of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8800:44"/>
that great multitude that then he ſawe being deſtitute of knowledge and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as wandering ſhéepe without a ſheapheard. Of the ſeconde we haue a proofe alſo in the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull nature ſheweth it ſelfe towarde <note place="margin">Luke 10.</note> bodily wantes, and outward griefes of him that théeues had ſo ill handled And in both theſe you ſée the partes I ſpake of, namelie inwarde compaſſion and outwarde helpe. Without which neuer can this vertue ſtande, nor wee be liked either of God or man. For if we pitie and yet helpe not, that feareful ſpéech of <hi>Iohn</hi> lighteth on vs, <hi>Howe dwelleth the loue of God in vs,</hi> and we ſhall aſſuredly heare it in the day of iudgement, <hi>When I was naked yee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed me not, when I was hungrie yee fedde me not,</hi> and ſo foorth. And if we helpe a man in his néede, and yet doe it not vppon anie tender compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towarde him, but vppon a iolitie and pride in our ſelues, and vppon an imagination of merite for the worke ſake, or ſuch like, it is loothſome: againe,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8800:45"/>
all that euer we doe to the Lorde, and we looſe our rewarde. If you doubt of this, you may ſée it prooued in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies, <note place="margin">Matth. 6. Matth. 3.</note> whoſe almes abounded, &amp; made a glorious ſhewe. But becauſe they let the weightier matters paſſe, as iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Mercie and fidelitie, their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde déedes had neuer reward There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euen a thouſande times marke it, howe want of right diſpoſition in the heart, maketh outwarde dealing of giftes, be it neuer ſo magnificall, but phariſaicall and wicked: againſt that blockiſh aſſertion of ſome, that the déede doone muſt néedes be rewarded. This tender féeling doth the Apoſtle both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe in himſelfe, and require in others. In himſelfe, when hee aſketh who is <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 29.</note> weake and he is not weake, who is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and hee burneth not? In others, when be ſaith, wéepe with them that <note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> wéepe, and rebuketh the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for that they ſéeing ſo great a fall of their brother, were puffed vp and did not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorrowe. So well thus you ſée <note place="margin">Cor. 15.</note> what manner of mercie muſt be in you,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8800:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if it be allowed of the Lorde. Nowe howe this good vertue is begotten in <note place="margin">Howe merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe is wrought in men.</note> vs, let vs alſo conſider, and beſide di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others that might be named, you ſhall ſée the workers of it eſpecially and aboue other meanes to bee experience and ſight.

                     <note place="margin">4. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>be touched with the feeling of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, but wee haue one that was in all things tempted in like ſort, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin,</hi> concluding thereupon preſently, <hi>Let vs therfore go boldlie to the throne of grace, that wee may receiue mercie and grace to help in time of neede.</hi> Why ſo? Aſſuredlie becauſe wee can neuer féele that want which he knoweth not,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8800:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and knowing, experience worketh ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually a readie regarde and helpe. Whereuppon by the way, wee may grounde a great comfort againſt anie croſſe if we marke it. For thus may we thinke, if mercifulnes make vs bleſſed, and experience make vs mercifull, then whenſoeuer the Lorde giueth vs anie taſt of woe, he doeth but ſchoole vs vnto happineſſe. But I paſſe it ouer, and now let vs conſider, what a verie monſter and vglie beaſt in nature he is, who hauing himſelfe drunke of the beggers diſh, and taſted the ſmart of néedy want, yet neuer the more is mooued in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der kindneſſe to others, when God hath made him able to helpe them, but as braſſe or yron turneth both hande and heart away, when pitifull ſutes are made vnto him for ſome comfort.

But I ſtaie my ſelfe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you of this, that in al crations and ſpéeches, in all pleas, and actions, for and againſt any man amongſt them, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt plaineneſſe was euer an argument of fauour and ſuccour, and holowe ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

glauerie a note of reprooch and an argument to perſwade the contrarie. Nowe therefore let vs gather vppe all theſe againe together, and if heathens hate it, Chriſtians loath it, and the God of life and death abhor it, what ſtrength ſhould anie cauſe in the earth haue to tempt you vnto it? Nay <hi>Frailtie,</hi> howe dare you for anie fauour or gaine vnder the ſunne oppoſe your practiſe to his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, whoſe diſliking killeth and caſteth into hell for euermore? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you, be warned, and wipe off that miſt of earthlie couetouſneſſe, and ambition, that bleareth your eyes, looke with an other ſight vppon theſe thinges, and be aſſured if the trueth of God be aſſured, that ſince honeſt hearts, and plaine dealing hath a bleſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, the gaine of flatterie, gloſing and halting, is not the beſt wealth, nor the beſt wiſedome. But his little is more, whoſe heart is pure, than moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of goulde and all honored ſtate, that is crept vnto by déepe diſſembling, and ſo will the ende prooue in them or
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8800:53"/>
theirs, if God be God. For they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, if the pure in heart be bleſſed, as I haue often nowe repeated. And iudge if the curſe of God will want his effect at one time or other, at firſt or at laſt. But nowe if all this ſhould not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthen you (which God forbid) then procéede with the ſentence in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe,</hi> and ponder well the other part alſo of it. <hi>For they ſhall ſee God,</hi> (ſaith it.) What is this? But the Lorde ſhall reueile vnto them dayly more and more as a rewarde of their ſinceritie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt walking, his will, his mercie, his fauour, his comfortes, his ioyes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and all his goodneſſe in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> towarde them. Which in déede is to ſée God as man is able to ſée him in this life, and therefore is called bleſſedneſſe, becauſe the ende of ſuch knowledge and ſight is bleſſedneſſe, as woe and miſerie is of the contrarie. Where by the way we are notablie taught what is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in either man or woman that ſhall euer profite by reading or hearing the worde of God, namely a pure heart,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8800:54"/>
that is euen a ſyncere minde and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right purpoſe to learne of the Lorde and not to doe what they doe, either for one cauſe or other whatſoeuer beſide, that a ſubtill minde can laie downe. Which woordes of Chriſt include a ſtrong comfort to honeſt ſimplicitie, and as touching a terrour againſt ſmoothing hypocriſie. For the one ſhall ſée God, the other ſhall neuer beholde him to their comfort, but all their reading, all their hearing, all their knowledge, if the Lord beſtowe any, ſhalbe to death, and not to life: to woe, and not to wel: a ſauour ſending them bodie and ſoule to euerlaſting miſerie, as by neceſſarie conſequence followeth of the place. Yet doe I not meane in all this, that a man ſhould all be open to euerie one, and in euerie matter: for that were as great an extremitie the other way, and full of inconueniences. And I remember well what good counſell wiſe experienced <hi>Syrach</hi> giueth in this point: Namely, <note place="margin">Syrac. 8. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>that we ſhould not open our heartes to euerie one, leaſt they be vnthankefull to

Therefore I ſay againe vnder the praiſe of honeſt ſimplicitie and puritie of heart, I doe not ſhrowde or bolſter anie plaine fooliſhnes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcréet ſéelineſſe, but my ſpéech tendeth to the preſſing of that, euen to hell, if I can, which you <hi>Frailtie</hi> are tempted to: namely, to lie, flatter, cogge, halt, gloſe, ſooth, ſmooth, croutch, créepe, ſigh, ſorow, ſawne, and fall downe at ones féete, ſweare and proteſt liking, loue, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruice and friendſhippe, and what not, that may allure for credite and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, lucre, and gaine: when there is no more truth of good meaning in you, than is in the diuell, but onelie for your turne.

And what ſhould I ſay? to ride and run, to watch and wait, and performe all dueties, as if I were the trueſt ſeruant that draweth breath, and yet is my heart onlie bent vpon my maiſters preferments, and not one iote at all of faithfull dutie and affection in me to his perſon. This this abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and euen more than diueliſh nature if more may be, is that I meane, and that the worlde too much liketh of, that you are tempted to <hi>Frailtie,</hi> and that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> in this verſe nowe named ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his children and choſen againſte. Wherefore my companion <hi>Frailtie,</hi> weigh my drift, and marke my proofes, conſider what you deſire, and by what meanes you incline to get your deſire.

ſoule what againe is it? But if you take this courſe, you ſhall as certainely looſe both bodie and ſoule, as you now liue and heare me, for it is curſed of the Lorde, and they that vſe it ſhall neuer ſée God. His nature is all trueth, and ſimplicitie, and therefore what felowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip can euer he haue with a falſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer? But if you ſet the Lorde before your eies, hang vppon his mercie, and truſt to his prouidence, dealing with all the world ſincerely, honeſtly, plainely, and vprightly, beſtowing not face, and forme, but euen all the loue, and dutie of your heart where it is due, be it to God or man, you heare the Lorde, you heare the Lorde I ſay that neuer lied, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in hart, for they ſhal ſee God:</hi> you heare his ſeruant <hi>Dauid</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Bleſſed is that man in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile,</hi> no guile I ſay againe, and the Lord giue vs ſtrength.</p>

               <p>YOur next complaint is of ſlacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that créepeth vpon you dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more in laboring to pacifie diſagréeing neighbors, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which your conſcience crieth, and indéede with cauſe: for it is a great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, hatefull to God, and hurtfull to the common wealth in generall, and to manie a man in ſeuerall. But in the name of God, <hi>Frailtie,</hi> ſtrengthen your ſelfe by an earneſt conſideration of the great excellencie of that Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of peace and vnitie, and fix not your eie ſo much vppon the acceptaunce of men, that haue euer had their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and euer wil. The vertue you ſhall finde in verie high degrée commended vnto men by the holy ſcriptures of God <note place="margin">Scriptures teach vnitie.</note> in many places, and by manie argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but I will referre the noting
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8800:57"/>
and naming of them to your owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and content my ſelfe in a ſhort ſpéech with a verie fewe: Beginning firſt with that notable Pſalme of the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> wholie ſpent in this <note place="margin">Pſalm 133.</note> matter. Where the firſt argument is this: That which is good ought euer <note place="margin">1.</note> greatly to be regarded and maintained amongſt men, but much more if it both be good &amp; pleaſant too, for theſe both do not euer concurre together. But ſuch a thing is peace and loue amongeſt men. For beholde howe good and pleaſant a thing it is brethren to dwell together in vnitie, behold I ſay and euen marke it earneſtly. Therefore it ought to be regarded and maintened euer to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of our powers amongſt vs. His ſecond argument is this, that which <note place="margin">2.</note> caſteth a comfort from it like the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ointment that was appointed for the prieſts of the Lorde <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſucceſſors, and euen ſuch a comfort as that ointment hath when it is not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly dropped, but euen plentifully powred, and ſo plentifully as that it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8800:57"/>
runneth down euen from the top of the head to the ſkirts of his clothing, that is a notable thing amongſt men, and by all meanes to be retained and ſought: but this is peace and vnitie, loue and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréement amongſt them. Therefore to be regarded and maintained greatly. His third argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is this: That which <note place="margin">3.</note> being had is to men as the dew deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the mountains to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, and being wanting, is as the want of moiſture to the earth, that is thrice néedefull, gainefull, and good to men: but ſuch is vnitie, peace, and loue, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen like the dew of <hi>Hermon</hi> that fell vpon the hill of <hi>Sion.</hi> Therefore to be regarded and maintained greatly. His laſt, and not his leaſt argument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hée endeth both this matter and <note place="margin">4.</note> that Pſalme withall, is this: That which pulleth vppon men euen all the temporall bleſſings of God, and life for euermore, that is a thouſand times profitable both to them and theirs: but ſuch (ſaith the prophet) is peace and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, loue and agréement amongſt men,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8800:58"/>
therefore to be regarded and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned greatly. Thus you ſée one mans iudgement, and that ſuch a mans as had abundance of Gods moſt bleſſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to direct his heart to thinke, and penne to write, and as in trueth was euerie waie then renowmed, and now remaineth by the Lord himſelfe in high degrée aboue others commended to vs. Unto whome if you adde ſome other Scriptures, you ſhall more peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed with diuerſitie, though this indéede were ſufficient.

And marke a multitude of other places to the ſame concluſion, which aſſuredly the Lorde would neuer haue vttered, but that the price of peace, vnitie and loue is verie precious in his eyes, and to all eſtates a moſt ſoueraigne good in the worlde. Sée alſo howe ſenſiblie <note place="margin">Thinges in nature teach vnitie.</note> thinges in nature carie vs to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. For by experience we finde it, that if the heauens agrée to moyſten <note place="margin">Hoſe. 2. 22.</note> the earth, and the earth being moyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Therefore iudge by this the fruite of good agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Againe if the humors in mens bodies be at an agréement, not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue an other, but verie equally as is beſt proportioned and mixed, all the whole bodie is comfortable, proſpereth, and doth well: but if once any one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth or wanteth, and their ſwéete harmonie is broken, then by and by the whole bodie féeleth it, and if a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation be not made with conuenient ſpéede, it periſheth. Therefore iudge by this the fruit of good agréement. Againe if the members of the bodie well agrée to doe their ſeuerall duties, all is well: but if either eye denie to guide, foote to goe, hande to reach, ſtomacke to digeſt, or ſo foorth, ſtreight the whole bodie fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to hurt. And therefore ſée by this the fruite of good agréement. Laſt of all euen in muſicall inſtrumentes marke

how well we like the noyſe ſo long as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie ſtring doth kéepe his iuſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; how preſently we ſtop our eares from hearing, if any one be out of tune, twitched vp too high, or let downe too lowe, and all the muſicke is marred.

For then will followe aſſuredly ere the time bee long the proofe of Chriſt his ſpéeche, <hi>A kingdome diuided in it ſelfe can neuer ſtande.</hi> And that other alſo of the Poet.</p>

and loue be to the Lorde himſelfe ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and to all eſtates in the world ſo profitable, muſt it not néedes be in it ſelfe, howſoeuer the worlde accepteth it, a moſt ſingular thing, and a moſt deſerued praiſe to a man to be a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker amongeſt men? Certainelie it muſt. But we neede not to gather it by concluſion. For the Lorde Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath ſaide it in the ſame 5. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe,</hi> as preparing ſtrength before hande for this verie ſame temptation, that nowe you féele, That <hi>bleſſed are the peacemakers, for they ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the children of God.</hi> And neuer, as I haue nowe often ſaide, doeth he ſet a bleſſing vppon the heade of anie thing, but the ſame in it nature, and before his maieſtie is a worthie thing. Wherefore this place ſhoulde bee to you euen a thouſande argumentes to confirme your obedience in ſo Chriſtian a duetie, as peacemaking is, and a thouſande ſpurres to pricke you dailie to it when opportunitie is offered, and occaſion giuen to the ſame. For <hi>Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:8800:60"/>
what can you reſolue this ſpeach of Chriſt into, if you marke it wel, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſenſe? As if he ſhould haue ſaide to his diſciples in this order: I knowe the manifolde diſcomfortes that ſhall bee giuen to all men, and eſpeciallie to you miniſters in that duetie of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, which yet both belongeth to al men, and eſpecially to your calling, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding euer to indeuour ſo farre as power ſhall ſerue. And therefore leaſt hereafter, when it ſhall ſo fall out, either you or anie other ſhould be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through mens vnthankefulneſſe, to the giuing ouer of that ſo thriſe néedeful a thing, I forewarne you here before hande, and euen giue you in charge as I am your Lorde and maiſter, that you neuer regarde, cleaue, and ſticke in the acceptaunce or thankefulneſſe of men for your paines, and trauell, in this matter. For if you doe, you ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. But euer looke you vppe to heauen, what is there thought of it, and to the better ſort of the worlde alſo, whome the Lorde hath giuen eyes to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8800:61"/>
diſcerne good things with al. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you finde at mens handes for ſo godlie a labour, you ſhall well knowe it, finde it, and féele it, that with the Lorde in heauen bleſſed for euer ſhall bee the peacemakers, and both of him and his true children heere in earth, that knowe what is what, they ſhall be counted, taken, and acknowledged for the ſonnes of almightie God, that ſhall liue with their Father for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Which is inough <hi>Frailtie,</hi> if there be either touch or taſt, or anie féeling in the worlde in vs, to ſtaie vs for euer in this dutie, be the peruerſeneſſe of men neuer ſo much. For what can we deſire more than to haue our doinges accepted of the Lorde, and our ſelues aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of euerlaſting rewarde at his handes for men? Let men be mad and mad againe, let their crooked affections worke and writhe them whither they can, and euen all vnthankefull spéeches burſt from them againſt vs for our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, that may be imagined, my God is pleaſed, ſhoulde a Chriſtian heart
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8800:61"/>
thinke, with my indeuour, and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptaunce is my ſatiſfaction, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is my reſt, and a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall of all my paines. Otherwiſe <hi>Frailtie,</hi> I pray you euen earneſtlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it: What loue of God is that in vs, that the loue of man driueth out of vs, what care to pleaſe him is that, that mens diſpleaſure quencheth? Fie, fie, it is too groſſe, and ten thouſand wonders may it be, that euer anie of vs can ſléepe with this imagination, that wee loue God aboue all, and yet in ſuch thinges as by name are commaunded and by promiſes commended to vs, wholie guide our obedience according to mens acceptance or not acceptance, liking, or miſliking. Wherefore on ſtill <hi>Frailtie,</hi> with this dutie and indeuor to reconcile diſagréeing mindes in the name of God, and were the bitter gaule, the ſpitefull péeuiſhneſſe and all the vnthankfulneſſe of the Diuell and his whole hoaſt in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man and woman you deale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, yet haue you comfort inough if either the Lords acceptance can content
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8800:62"/>
you, or your owne promiſed rewarde and bleſſing pleaſe you, or good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt to bée one that God hath choſen for his childe, with the better ſort of the worlde comfort you. Nowe by the way of a little digreſſion, in hope I doe not wearie you, I would alſo wiſh you a little to conſider that if this peace and agréement amongeſt neighbours in towne or countrie be ſuch, and ſo ſwéet in the ſenſe of the Lorde, as that euen the preſeruers of it, and reſtorers, when it is broken are ſo heartily bleſſed, and accompted for it the ſonnes of God, muſt it not néedes followe that thoſe thinges likewiſe are in high accompt before his maieſtie, which being in men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe moſt mightilie maintaine this bleſſed vertue in all and euerie ſocietis vnder heauen? Surely it muſt néedes followe. And what are they? Manie and diuerſe are they if one ſhould make a curious recitall, but for my part when I marke the courſe of thinges, and the cauſes of good agréement in anie place, I thinke but euen eſpeciallie of theſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8800:62"/>
thrée. Firſt a patient and méeke nature in our ſelues able to beare and tolerate ſomething, without mounting into the houſe top immediatly, and flaſhing out all on fire by and by vppon the ſight or hearing of it. Secondly, a wel iudging heart of others, till wée be certaine of the contrarie. And laſtly, a good tongue. Muſt not I ſay (if peace be ſo pleaſing to the Lorde) theſe things alſo be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in his eies, which all the worlde knoweth to be nouriſhing nurſes of the ſame whereſoeuer they are? If peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making pull a bleſſing vppon vs, as the Lorde liueth theſe ſo great preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of peace ſhal haue a happy reward. And if this be true, then on the other ſide againe the contrarie vices for their contrarie effect muſt néeds be as loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, hatefull and accurſed: Namely, an impatient, haſtie, fierce, frowarde, furious nature, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is as ſhort as moſſe, that hath neuer fought withall, and foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led anie affection, but cleauing ſtill in pure naturalles, is vnregenerated and euer caſteth out the ſauour of old <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:8800:63"/>
vpon euerie occaſion be it but a trifle. Secondly, a ſuſpicious miſdéeming mind of euerie bodie, that they ſay thus of vs, worke this againſt vs, or at leaſt thinke thus of vs, when in trueth it is nothing ſo. O poiſon of peace in anie kingdome, countrie, towne, houſe, or perſon liuing in the worlde, this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déeming minde. And to a mans ſelfe there is no more twitching torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſon. For it is euen a worme that is euer gnawing and euer biting, and can neuer be contented. Laſtly, an euill tongue, a peaceles tongue, that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be quiet from prittle prattle, from ſcanning this neighbours wealth, that neighbours wit, this mans doings, and that mans ſayings, and from courſing euen the whole country ouer, til al men haue béene within the ſpéech of our tongues, drawen out of vs by the power peraduenture of a pot too much, or ſuch a like influence. Muſt not theſe things I ſay, and the owners of them be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, as ſure as they liue, if peace and loue and good agréement amongſt men
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8800:63"/>
be of the Lorde bleſſed? They muſt, they muſt <hi>Frailtie.</hi> For all the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the venome of theſe things in anie towne, and their mightie working a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vnitie, and therfore I praie you, and I praie you heartily conſider of it, and caſt euen a long looke vppon them, ſuch an one as we doe when we would marke a thing indéede, and beare it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And I doubt not but God ſhall giue you ſtrength againſt your tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is no one thing ſo great a nurſe of two of them, namely, of a miſdéeming mind, &amp; a pratling tongue, as idlenes is, when a man hath nothing to doe, and to applie himſelfe vnto, but to ſitte on a bulke in the ſtréete, or bench in a tauerne, or an ale houſe, and to wet his tongue with drinke, and drie it with talking, or when a woman hath no ſetled gouernment of her ſelfe in houſe, but is in the number of thoſe that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of, which <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>beeing idle learne to goe about from houſe to houſe. Yea, they are not onely idle, but alſo pratlers and buſie bodies,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8800:64"/>
ſpeaking things which are not comelie.</hi> Therfore whoſoeuer wil be a preſeruer of peace, he muſt be an enimie to theſe curſes aſſuredly, and heare more with two eares, than he ſpeaketh with one tongue. But I weary you with this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is longer than I meant, and therefore I cut it off, againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine requiring of you, that you neuer hang vpon the accompt of men in anie thing, that euer you goe about béeing commaunded by the expreſſe worde of God, but fullie ſuffice your ſelfe with the acceptance of God. and that which you haue here an aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of, if you be a peacemaker. Bleſſed ſhall you be, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer accompted both with God and his true children the ſon of God. And if this wil not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent you, quicken you, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and ſtay you in this vertue, but that worldlie ingratitude ſhall quench you, and drawe you to ſuch extremitie as you ſpake of, certainely <hi>Frailtie</hi> you deceiue your ſelfe, there is no true godlineſſe in you, but euen your name is too gentle for your nature, you are

become plaine infidelitie. But I hope the beſt, and performe you no leſſe, if you regarde your owne comfort. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient is this yet once againe, if you be the Lords, <hi>Bleſſed are the peacemakers, for they ſhall be called the children of God.</hi>

to ſpeake, but the fire to kindle and burne within vs, and ſo our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to haue ſpirite and power before the Lorde? The Croſſe. What killeth this intemperancie of our affections, and this bluſtring impaciencie of our natures, and maketh vs méeke, milde, humble, gentle, and like lambes, not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, appointed to the ſlaughter? The croſſe. What worketh the decaie euen of the whole olde <hi>Adam</hi> in vs with all his luſtes, concupiſcence, and venome, and daily raiſeth vp, as a meanes, the newe man with al his ſwéete motions, heauenly and reformed actions? The Croſſe. What maketh vs ſpitte in the face of this flattering worlde, whoſe loue cauſeth loſſe both of body and ſoule in the worlde to come, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part with her paps, and to bid al her pleaſures adue? The croſſe. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what maketh vs teare our bellies from the earth whereto they cleaue ſo faſt, and lift vp our heades to heauen, long for the life that laſteth, and deſire heartily to be clothed with our houſe

which is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue? The croſſe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then ſince it is decréed, and that in loue to our ſo great good, that all which will liue godlie in Jeſus Chriſt muſt ſuffer perſecution, what cauſe haue we, would the Lorde voutſafe vs eyes, with the croſſe to be diſcouraged and driuen from the Lorde? Thirdly it neuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to vs by fortune and chance, or by ignoraunce in our God, or inabilitie to let it, if it pleaſed him, but by his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by his will, and by his hande, and he is our father, bounde vnto vs in league and couenant of loue, that of his part ſhall neuer be broken while wee hang of him. The mother may forget y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childe that is her fleſh before he can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get vs, and aſwell can a man ſuffer the apple of his eye to be pricked, as he vs to be hurt, if we cleaue to him: then iudge if his croſſe ſhoulde euer diſmaie vs. Fourthly it is no ſtrange thing or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde of, or vnſéene before, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth to vs when we are perſecuted, but ſuch as all our brethren haue taſted, founde, and felt before vs, and why then
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8800:67"/>
ſhould we faint when we drinke but of the ſame cuppe that the déereſt ſaintes and ſoules nowe bleſſed with the Lorde, haue begunne to vs in? Caſt your eyes about, &amp; ſée the courſe of times although I knowe you knowe it well ynough. Beganne not <hi>Abell</hi> vnto vs in this cup and courſe, aſſoone as euer the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed his loue vnto him, before his brother? Followed not the Patriarkes, and Prophetes, men and women, elde and young, in their times, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures euen till Chriſt came? Then was it not the cuppe that his owne ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to his children in, and the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme wherewith he was baptized? Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not his diſciples ſent out into the world as ſhéepe amongſt wolues, whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and beaten, checked and ſnubbed, impriſoned and cheyned, &amp;c. Followed not againe after them thoſe thouſandes of his children vnder the primitiue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, ſome ſcalded, ſome burned, ſome broyled, ſome hanged, ſome headed ſome throwne down from the rocks vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtakes, ſome ſtabbed in with forkes,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8800:67"/>
ſome racked and torne in péeces, their tongues cut out, their eyes bored out, their fleſhe twitched off with pinſons, womens breſtes ſeared off with hoat yrons, pricked vnder the nayles with néedles, and a thouſande waies tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Yea was it not euer true with the godly, <hi>In hoc vocati eſtis: <hi>For this ende were yee called?</hi>
                     </hi> And good Lorde then why ſhould not a common caſe be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon comfort? Why ſhould any man or woman that loueth God ſéeke or wiſhe a priuiledge aboue all the children of God, that euer were and euen aboue the ſonne of God himſelfe Chriſt Jeſus? Is it not honor ynough, mercy ynough, and fauour ynough to be dealt withall, as they were? Therefore the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of it to vs with all our brethren and ſiſters, and euen with our eldeſt brother Chriſt Jeſus, ſhould ſtay our hearts whenſoeuer it pleaſeth the Lord to ſende it. Fiftly the cauſe being not ours, but the Lorde our Gods, and good, ſhould alſo confirme vs. The ſhort time that it can indure, were it (ſuppoſe) as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8800:68"/>
long as we liue ſhould comfort vs. For our life is but a flower, as graſſe, as ſmoke, as a bubble of the water, and as the vaineſt fickle fading thing that you can imagine. Againe that paſſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from the Lorde of life and trueth, ſealed with the bloud of his owne ſonne vnto vs, the ſwéeteneſſe whereof all the tongues of men and Angels can neuer expreſſe, <hi>That hee will neuer lay more vppon vs than hee will make vs able to beare,</hi> ſhould be like a thouſande ſtaies rounde about vs to houlde vs vp. The promiſes of peace, comfort, and quiet, for euermore aboue meaſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of man in heauen, if we continue faithfull to the end, ſhould hould vs vp. That ſentence paſſed in the Lords court of baſtardie and conſequently of depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of all inheritance, if we be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out correction, ſhould hould vs vp. And what ſhould I goe any further? The examples of our brethren of al rallings, of all ages, men and women, that haue conſtantly caried their croſſe, and neuer deliuered it vp, till they deliuered ſoule
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8800:68"/>

Wherefore <hi>Frailtie,</hi> euen as <hi>Iudas</hi> the <hi>Machabee</hi> could incourage his men not to feare the multitude of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, neither to be afraid of their aſſault but to remember howe their fathers were deliuered in the redde ſea when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> purſued after them, ſo ſay I to you and to my ſelfe, let vs neuer feare affliction nor the euill day, for our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie croſſe cauſeth an euerlaſting weight of glorie. But let vs remember the firme faith of our fathers, of our mothers, of our brethren, and friendes, let vs looke vpon their paciencie, vppon their conſtancie, their hope, &amp; beſéech the liuing God we may followe their good ſteppes, and ſtaie in ſtrength vppon his mercy, whatſoeuer he ſendeth vs, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as we know we liue, that though our braines cleaue to the wales, though our bones be ſtrowed in the ſtréetes, and our bloud runne downe euerie cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, yet ſhall we riſe againe, reſtored by the power of our God, be gathered into his barne as his pure wheate, our

Iſaak,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> loued he not his Prophets, loued he not his owne ſonne and all that followed his ſteppes to this day? Were none of them of a true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of an honeſt life, and wiſe ynough to take that courſe in the worlde that God allowed? Yet all of them plagued he as they call it. And neuer any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humbled in this world than Chriſt himſelfe, and therefore proſperitie or aduerſitie may not be taken for ſignes euer of fauour or diſpleaſure. But the worſt man moſt quiet often in this worlde, and moſt honored, loued, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, and renowned, his deſerued tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being deferred to an other day, and the trueſt chriſtian moſt troubled, toſſed, reiected, and humbled, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and rewarde remaining for him in an other worlde. But beſide all this plaine demonſtration of a tried trueth, vſe with your ſelfe <hi>Frailtie</hi> to oppoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that concept of the worlde, the ſentence of the Lorde our God next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, in the fifth of <hi>Matthewe,</hi> after thoſe that nowe haue béene conſidered
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8800:70"/>
of, <hi>Bleſſed are they that ſuffer perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for righteouſneſſe ſake, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen.</hi> And thinke with your ſelfe as I haue nowe often ſayde, that if our God ſet a bleſſing vpon it, what ſkilleth it what the whole worlde, and ten thouſande worldes moe if they were extant, doth iudge? Shall the voice of man be the guide of our courſe, and the line of our life? Shall mans iudgement or Gods iudgement ſtande in the later day? O <hi>Frailtie,</hi> we may not hang vppon ſo broken a réede as fleſh and fleſhlie wit is. Wee may not be lifted vp with mans liking, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it haue further warrant: nor caſt downe with his diſliking, vnleſſe wee knowe hee ſo déemeth iuſtly.</p>
                  <p>And therefore againe I ſay conſider of this comfort. Conſider of this worlde, and conſider of the world to come, the one is tranſitorie, the other permanent: the one full of woe and ſecret ſorowe in the verie middeſt of pompe, the other ful of ioy, comfort and ſolace, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ending. Then, whether is here
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8800:70"/>
good to be happie, and there vnhappie, here iudged miſerable, and there founde moſt bleſſed, iudge your ſelfe euen with verie reaſon. Certainly therefore it is a comfort ſufficient, ſo knowne to be by Chriſt that gaue it, and euer hath and ſhall comfort the children of god againſt worldly conceit, <hi>bleſſed are they that</hi> for a good cauſe <hi>ſuffer perſecution, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen.</hi> That is, all comfort poſſible to be thought of, and tenne thouſand times more. This was <hi>Paules</hi> comfort in the middeſt of all his miſerie, and therefore he boldly and chéerefully ſaith, he neuer counted the afflictions of the world worthie the ioy that ſhould be reuealed. This comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo, that he periſhed not in his affliction, as himſelf witneſſeth, and <note place="margin">Pſalme 119.</note> as that ſpéech by compariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſhew, <hi>I ſhould vtterly haue fainted, but that I</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſalme 27.</note> 
                     <hi>beleeue verily to ſee the Lorde in the lande of the liuing.</hi> And (what ſhould I name them) this euer hath comforted firſt, or laſt, leſſe, or more, yet euer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently anie that were the Lords. But
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8800:71"/>
ſée further how not onelie thus in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie againſt perſecution it pleaſed Chriſt to ſtrengthen our weakenes, but euen in ſpecialitie alſo againſt thoſe kinds which moſt bitterly taſt vnto vs, and ſhake vs ſore, if we be not ſtrong, to wit, reproch, and report. For, <hi>Bleſſed are you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when men reuile you, and ſhall falſely ſay all manner of euill ſaying by you, for my name ſake, reioice and be glad, for great is your rewarde in heauen,</hi> a ſaying neuer to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of vs whileſt the life is in vs. For, the gaule of theſe Croſſes is not little, and the power of this aſſault hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not as féeble in great Prophets and members of the Church. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie words alſo of Chriſt his comfort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate a ſecrete force aboue manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of this temptation. For hée biddeth them reioice, and promiſeth great reward in heauen, as forſéeing a great downefall both of heart and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in man, when he is once tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched either with reuiling ſpéeches, to his face, or falſe reportes behinde his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8800:71"/>
backe. Wherfore to conclude and leaue you nowe to your other readings of this matter, I praie you <hi>Frailtie</hi> open your eies, or rather deſire the Lorde to open them, that you may both nowe in the day of peace, and whenſoeuer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it ſhall pleaſe the Lorde further to trie you, ſée with your eie, heare with your eare, and beléeue with your heart your offered comfort in the worde, both againſt al other, and againſt this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by name of perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The word teacheth, and we know it is decréede by the Lord to be the lotte of his déere ones euer in this worlde, and therefore wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come be it. The worde teacheth it, and we knowe it, much good is wrought in vs by it, &amp; therefore welcome be it. The worde teacheth it, and we knowe it, no chance nor fortune, but the will of our heauenly father laieth it vpon vs, and therefore welcome be it. We knowe it is no new thing, or vnſéene before, but the old portion of the godly that haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer béen before vs, &amp; therefore welcome be it. The cauſe is not ours whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8800:72"/>
truth, but his, that made vs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore welcome be it. We haue a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe wée ſhall not be oppreſſed with more than we may beare, and therefore welcome be it. Wée knowe wée are children, if as children we be corrected, and therefore welcome be it. Wée are told we are baſtards, if we be without it and therefore welcome be it. And all our forefathers haue patiently carried it, and nowe are rewarded, therefore welcome be it. Welcom I ſay the croſſe in generall, and perſecution for truth all or part, as it pleaſeth God, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in particular this kinde of croſſe, if ſo our God will, reuilings, reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, reportings falſe and vniuſt. For we knowe our caſe, the plea is ended, and ſentence is giuen neuer to be reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, bleſſed are we, good cauſe wée haue to reioice and be glad, for great is our rewarde in heauen. O the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and father of mercy ſtrengthen vs, that theſe ſwéete promiſes may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with vs, and that our eies may ſée the comfortes of his worde. What

Is it not to ſtand in poſſeſſion of all theſe heauenlie promiſes &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer befalleth to vs in this worlde, to be happie and bleſſed in it, and by it? Be it pouertie, be it ſorrowe, be it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion or whatſoeuer? And contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, what it alſo is to be of a prophane heart, &amp; of an vncircumciſed life. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euen to ſtand as depriued of all theſe comfortes, and if we be poore to be alſo accurſed in our pouertie, in our ſorow, and whatſoeuer befalleth vnto vs grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous in this world. The Lorde I ſaie giue vs eies to ſée it, and harts to thinke of it. For, full well wée knowe that were euerie one of vs a Monarch of a whole worlde by himſelfe, they béeing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8800:73"/>
as this world is, the glorie both of them and vs muſt paſſe away like a ſhippe in the water, whoſe tract cannot be ſéene againe, like an arrow through the aire, or a weauers ſhuttle through his work, like a fading flower, ſoudenlie plucked vp and withered, like graſſe, like ſmoke, and like the bubble of the water. Wee ſhall be forgotten with all our pompe, as the trauailer is that tarrieth but a night, our honour ſhall come to an ende as the players part vpon the ſtage, our doinges, ſayinges, lookes, geſtures, ſtates, and maieſties ſhall be rowled vp as a ſcreule, and caſt into the office of forgetfulneſſe, where nothing can bee founde againe. And then what remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth? I ſay what remaineth? any thing but woe and wormes, if we haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned religion and liued diſobediently againſt the Lorde? anie thing but vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and torment both of the bodie and ſoule in hell fire? Will then ſwearing be liked, or drunkenneſſe, or whoring, or tipling, &amp; tauerning, ſporting in vanity, laſciuious talking, writing, or looking, carding, and diſing, roiſting and rouing,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:8800:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pride, and exceſſe, or anie kinde of ſinne deteſted of the Lorde? Will then a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling time-ſeruer not be vncaſed? Will then an vniuſt ſeruant not be found out? Will then an vnfaithfull wife not be diſcouered? or a beaſtlie fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, franticke huſbande, not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded? Will then anie thing abide the face that commeth in the cloudes with thouſandes of Angels, but onelie a religious heart, and ſoule, that hath labored to know, and indeuored to liue, truſting onelie to the mercie of God in Chriſt for all wantes to be pardoned? Alas we knowe it, euen as we knowe we liue, it wil not: but deſtruction and death ſhal then be to the man or woman for euer that lewdly hath liued in this world, and comfort endleſſe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.

Wherefore we all héere met together at this time before thy maieſtie, humblie confeſſing our wantes, moſt intirelie beſéech thée for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake to haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vppon vs: haue mercie vppon vs, moſt mercifull Father, and forgiue vs all that is paſt, ſtrengthen vs hereafter, that dailie both in bodie and ſoule, we may glorifie thée more than we haue doone, yéelding thankes daily for daylie

benefites, and ſtriuing in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of our life. But becauſe we cannot but offend and fall diuers wayes, good Lorde, for thy mercie ſake pearce our heartes with a féeling of the ſame, and neuer ſuffer vs to goe on with dull and dead ſoules, not ſéeing or ſighing for our offences. As a ſpeciall meanes to kéepe vs in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience before thée, O déere Father, worke in vs a continuall, &amp; an effectuall remembraunce, that wee ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes liue héere in the ſhewe of this wretched worlde, that doeth ſo pleaſe vs now, but that a day will come, when the trumpe ſhall ſounde, the dead ſhall ariſe, and all wee ſhall appeare before thy tribunall ſeate of iudgement, there to receiue according to our déedes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of perſons. O good Lorde giue vs a remembrance, and a féeling of the vnſpeakeable comfort, and eternall weight of glorie, which in that day ſhall be giuen vnto vs, if in this life we ſerue and pleaſe thée. And contrariwiſe euen terrifie our conſciences and let vs

Giue vs an hatred of ſinne, and a true loue of righteouſneſſe. Bleſſe thy worde euer more with fruite vnto our ſoules when we doe heare it, giue vs a deſire to heare it often. Remoue, O Lorde in thy good time, ſuch hinderances of the fruit thereof, as are amongſt vs, giue it full courſe, and ſende foorth labourers into thy harueſt, which not for filthie lucre and gaine, but of loue and zeale to thée and thy people may preach thy worde ſincerely. Bleſſe vs O Lorde from all hypocriſie, gloſing and halting before thée. And becauſe we little know how ſoone thou ſhalt ſende this pampered fleſh of ours to the wormes, ſtoppe our breath and call away for our ſoules to come vnto thée, whether this day or no before the euening, bleſſed Father, for
