            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as by maryage and affynyte of more noble per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sones
suche as were of lesse condycyon maye encrease
in hyer degre of noblenes. In euery of these I suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
this coutesse was noble. Fyrst she came of noble blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
lyneally descendynge of kynge Edwarde the .iij. w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
in the .iiij. degre of the same. Her fader was Johan du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
of Somerset her moder was called Margarete ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte
noble as well in maneres as in bloode. To who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
she was a veray doughter in all noble maners / for
she was bounteous &amp; lyberall to euery persone of her
knowlege or aquayntaunce. Auaryce and couetyse she

Of meruayllous gentylnesse she was vnto all folkes /

ryghte tenderly. Unkynde she wolde not be vnto
no creature / ne forgetefull of ony kyndnes or seruyce

to forgete and to forgyue iniuries done vnto her
at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leest desyre or mocyon made vnto her for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same.
Mercyfull also &amp; pyteous she was vnto suche as was

the chirche full obedyent &amp; tractable serchynge his ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noure

wolde not let for ony payne or laboure to take vppon

lefte vnto her by her auncetres she kepte &amp; encreased
them with a grete dylygens. The thyrde noblenes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

¶For the poore creatures / albeit she dyd not receyue

vysytynge them &amp; confortynge them / &amp; mynys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trynge

            <p>¶Thus it maye appere some comparison of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blessid
Martha &amp; of this noble prynces whiche was the fyrst
promysed.</p>
            <p>FOr the seconde that is to saye for the complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
&amp; lamentacyon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the soule of this noble
prynces myghte make for the dethe of her only body.
<pb facs="tcp:5905:7"/>
It is to be consydered that oftentymes in scrypture y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
vertuous and holy faders maketh lamentable excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macyons
agaynste almyghty god / for that he semeth
to be more indulgent and fauourable vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wycked
persone then vnto the good lyuer. The prophete Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyd
sayth in this maner. zelaui super iniquos: pa
cem pcto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <expan>
                  <am>

morti eorum nec firmamentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plaga eoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
That is to saye it perceth my stomacke to se the rest &amp;
case that synners often haue It is not loked for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deth
of them / nor none abydynge stroke or punysshemente
falleth vpon them. The prophete Iheremy sayth also
complaynynge vpon god. Quare via impiorum
prosperatur bene est oi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bus qui preuarica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur
et inique agunt. Why dothe the wycked persones
prospere in theyr way. wele it is with al them that bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
the lawes / and do wyckedly. The prophet Abacuc
sayth lyke wyse cryenge vpon god. Quare respitis
contemptores et taces conculante nupio iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiorem 
se. why lokest thou fauourably vpon them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
dyspyse the. And suffrest a synner to bere downe him
that is more ryghtwyse than he is. And the holy-man
Job. Quare ergo i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pii viuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t subleuati su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fortati
<abbr>qm</abbr> diuitiis. why then be the wycked perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
suffered for to lyue. They be set alofte / and they be
comforted with rychesse.</p>
            <p>¶The reason that moueth them thus to murmure &amp;
complayne may be this. There is in almyghty god .ij.
vertues specyally commended &amp; magnyfyed thorowe
out al scrypture. That is to say mercy &amp; ryghtwysnes
<pb facs="tcp:5905:7"/>
And bothe these sholde moue hym rather to be fauou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable
vnto the good than vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> badde. Fyrst his mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy
sholde moue him therto haue pyte and compassyon
where is the gretter cause of pyte but the greuaunce
trouble and vexacyon of the good persone hath gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cause of pyte and is moche more pyteous than of
the euyll persone. wherfore it may be thought that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghty
god whiche of his owne proprety is mercyful
and redy to gyue mercy. Deus cui proprium est
misereri. He sholde rather shewe his mercy vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
good than vpon the badde. And here vnto his ryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wysnes
also sholde enclyne hym / for of his ryghtwys<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
he sholde gyue vnto euery persone accordynge to
his deserte. But the good deserueth rather by theyr
goodnes to haue fauoure shewed vnto them then the
badde. Wherfore the holy faders seynge in this world
the wycked in prosperyte And the good in trouble &amp;
aduersite make these complayntes and exclamacions
aboue rehersed agaynst almyghty god and some crye
vpon hym as though he were a slepe. Exurge qua
re obdormis domine. Some other threpe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the
forgoten theym. Quare obliuisseris in opie

is noo god at all. Dixit incipiens in corde suo
non est deus. Some weneth at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leest he is absente
&amp; asketh where he is. Ubi est deustuus. In thys
condycion was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blessyd woman Martha. She knew
that our sauyour Ihesu was so good and mercyfull / 
And shewed his goodnes generally to al persones / she
byleued faythfully that yf he had be present at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dethe
<pb facs="tcp:5905:8"/>
of Lazarus her brother whom for his goodnes he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
so moche he wolde not haue suffred hym to deye.
And therfore she sayd vnto hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Domine si fuisses

to saye Syr yf thou had ben presente my brother had

soo greuously vexynge her and compellynge her

            <p>FYrst ye haue herde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodly condicyons of this

our mercyfull sauyoure agayne vnto her wherof we
all may be gretely comforted &amp; take cause &amp; matere of
grete reioysynge. It foloweth in the gospell. Dixit
ei iesus resurget frater tuus. That is to saye in
Englysshe. Ihesu sayd vnto her / thy broder shal ryse
agayne. I said before that consyderynge the loue and
amyte that is betwyxe the soule &amp; the body they maye
be thought to be as broder and syster. A trouthe it is
the soules that be hens departed out of theyr bodyes /

A grete comforte then it is vnto the soule y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath so

of her body as she had it before / and as she shall in
conclusyon receyue it agayne. But yet me thinke I se
what the soule of this noble pryncesse may answere agayne somwhat to lesse &amp; to mynysshe this dysconfort
after the same maner that Martha dyde answere vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to

And the hope of a thynge delayed tormenteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule
in the meane tyme. Therfore our sauyour more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
answereth to her agayne &amp; sayth in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Ego sum resurrectio &amp; vita. That is. I am
sayth he the veray cause of raysynge of the body. And
I am also the veraye cause of lyfe vnto the soule. As
who saye tho the rysynge of the body be delayed for a
season / the soule neuertheles shal for the meane tyme
haue a pleasaunt &amp; a swete lyfe. A lyfe full of comfort
a lyfe full of ioye &amp; pleasure / a lyfe voyde of all sorow
&amp; encombrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / a lyf not lyke vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyfe of this wret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched
world whiche is alway entermelled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moche bit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ternes / 
eyther with sorowes / eyther w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dredes or elles
with perylles. In hoc mundo non dolere no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere
non periclitari impossibile est. Sayeth
saynt Austyn. It is impossyble to lyue in this worlde
&amp; not to sorowe / not to drede / not to be in peryl. This
same noble prynces yf she had contynued in this worl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
she sholde dayly haue herde &amp; sene mater &amp; cause of
sorowe as well in herselfe as in her frendes parauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb facs="tcp:5905:11"/>
Her body dayly sholde haue waxen more unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy / 
her syght sholde haue be derked / and her herynge
sholde haue dulled more and more / her legges sholde
haue faylled her by &amp; by. And all the other partyes of
her body waxe more crased euery daye / whiche thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
sholde haue ben mater to her of grete dyscomforte
And albeit these thinges had not fallen vnto her forth
with / yet she sholde haue lyued alwaye in a drede and
a fere of them. Dare I say of her she neuer yet was in
that prosperyte but the gretter it was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more alwaye
she dredde the aduersyte. For whan the kynge her so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
was crowned in all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> grete tryumphe &amp; glorye / she
wepte meruayllously. And lyke wyse at the grete try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe
of the maryage of prynce Arthur. And at the
laste coronacyon wherin she had full grete Joye / she
let not to saye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> some aduersyte wolde folowe / so that
eyther she was in sorowe by reason of the present ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersytes / 
or elles whan she was in prosperite she was
in drede of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduersyte for to come. I passe ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rylles

And therfore saynt Gregory sayth. Uita hec terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
eterne vite comparata mors est potius di cenda
quam vita. And for that cause who y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ones
hathe tasted the pleasures of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lyfe / this is vnto them
a veray dethe for euer after. Example of Lazarꝰ whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was restored to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myseryes of this lyfe
agayne / he neuer lough but was in contynuall heuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

aboue to wante y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> presence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gloryous trynyte who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

ryght hertly glad &amp; ioyous therfor As for suerte veray
suerte can not be had but only by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reuelacyon of god
almighty. Neuertheles as farre as by scrypture / this
thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge can be assured in thende of this gospel folowing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
iz made by our sauyour a stronge argument almost
demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stratyue of this same thynge / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is this.
Euery persone y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> putteth theyr full truste in cryst Ihu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Albeit they be deed in theyr bodyes yet shall they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles
haue lyfe in theyr soules / &amp; that lyf y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neuer
shall haue ende. But this noble prynces she put her ful
truste in cryste<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ihesu verayly byleuynge that he was
the sone of god &amp; came in to this worlde for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> redemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon
of synners / wherfore it must necessaryly folowe
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> albeit her body be deed her soule is in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ioyous lyfe
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neuer shall cease. The fyrste parte of this argument
foloweth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospell. Qui credit in me etiam si<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mortuus
fuerit viuet. That is to say who y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fully
trusteth in cryst Ihu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / albeit they be deed in theyr bodi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es / 
they neuertheles shal lyue in theyr soules. But yet
we wante a lytell I sayd more than this. I saw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lyfe
shall neuer haue ende / &amp; for this also it foloweth. Et

That is to saye euery persone y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hathe this lyfe &amp; this
full trust in Ihesu shall neuer dye. So here appereth
well y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fyrst parte of our argument. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .ij. part now
