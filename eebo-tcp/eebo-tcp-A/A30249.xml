            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For the matter of it, it is chiefly improved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the dignitie and uſe of the Morall Law againſt late errours about it, and thereupon I have been forced to conſult more with thoſe books that are filled with ſuch poyſon, then to peruſe thoſe Authors that have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the truth; and I found the looking upon their Heterodoxies a ſpeciall help to propagate and confirme the truth, as that Romane Painter curiouſly drew the picture of an Horſe, by conſtant looking upon an Aſſe, avoiding whatſoever he ſaw ridiculous or deformed in him. I acknowledge this work above my ſtrength, it being a ſubject not much handled by former writers, and ſo I could not be guilty of that fault, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: but I ſay, as <hi>Austin, Ego parvas vires habeo; ſed Dei Verbum magnas habet; I have ſmall ſtrength, but the Word and
<pb facs="tcp:65695:4"/>
Truth of God hath great power.</hi> None is more unwilling then my ſelf to come in print; but, becauſe he that writeth good Books, doth <hi>retia ſalutis expandere,</hi> ſpread the nets of ſalvation to catch ſome men in; and the good works of ſuch will laſt as long as their Books live; I have hardened my ſelfe, and overcome mine owne temper, to publiſh to the world theſe conceptions of mine. I have not affected to appeare in this Book <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, about words and phraſes, becauſe it's controverſall matter, and ſo fitter to be repreſented to the underſtanding in naked unaffected explications, then curiouſly adorned to pleaſe fancy: Yea, I have grudged at words, as being too long and cumberſome, deſiring (if poſſible) to conveigh my ſenſe in as briefe a manner as may be, leſt any that comes to look for fruit, ſhould finde the leaves too broad, and ſo cover it from ſight. And this endeavouring of brevity will make the matter ſeeme too obſcure and abrupt, till there be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar acquaintance with my way.</p>
            <p>My method is after ſome generall diſcourſes about the uſefulneſſe of the Law, more particularly to handle it as given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and afterwards as promulgated by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people of Iſrael; and herein I have taken in all the materiall queſtions that Papiſts, Arminians, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians, and more eſpecially, Antinomians have ſtarted up. In all this I have endeavoured to give the Law its due, and the Goſpel its due, remembring that of <hi>Luther, Qui ſoit inter Legem &amp; Evangelium distinguere, gratias agat Deo, &amp; ſciat ſe eſſe Theologum;</hi> He that knoweth how to diſtinguiſh between Law and Goſpel, let him give thanks to God, and know he is a Divine. It is the allegoricall interpretation of one Writer, that the great feaſting and muſick which was uſed at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
<pb facs="tcp:65695:4"/>
of the Father to his Prodigall ſon, did ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſweet harmonie and agreement between Law and Goſpel. If this were ſo, then ſome doe repreſent the elder brother, that grudge and murmure at this excellent accord. If any adverſary ſhall aſſault this Book, I ſhall not be ſolicitous to anſwer it, becauſe I endeavoured ſo to ſtate the queſtion, that at the ſame time truth might be maintained, and falſhood demoliſhed; I am prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for thy view another Diſcourſe about Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which precious Doctrine hath alſo been much ſowred by the leaven of Antinomian opinions.</p>

                  <hi>Eraſmus</hi> tranſlates it, <hi>not to follow another doctrine,</hi> as if it did belong to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers: but the words afterwards <hi>[Teachers of the Law]</hi> doe plainly refute that. Now the word may be extended both to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65695:7"/>
                  <hi>matter</hi> (as ſome) to teach no other <hi>thing;</hi> or to the <hi>manner</hi> (as others) not to teach in another <hi>way:</hi> Not to teach <hi>nova,</hi> new things; no, nor yet <hi>novè,</hi> after a new manner. The rule is, <hi>Qui fingit nova verba, nova gignit dogmata:</hi> And it was <hi>Melancthons</hi> wiſh, that men did not onely teach the ſame things, but <hi>in iiſdem verbis, in iiſdem ſyllabis,</hi> in the ſame very words, and ſyllables.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of injunction is higher then the former: Though they doe not teach other things, yet they muſt not ſpend their gifts in an uſeleſſe way; as, <hi>to give heed to fables:</hi> This they apply to the Jewes, who had a world of fictions. So <hi>Tertullian</hi> of <hi>Valentinus, Multas introduxit fabulas;</hi> we ſee here the word <hi>fable</hi> in an ill ſenſe: Therefore <hi>Grotius</hi> cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, who calleth our Saviours Parables fables, as that of the Prodigall who ſpent his portion, <hi>Haec ſabula</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>nos de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, quod omnes ortu ſunt filii Dei,</hi> where both his words and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are very offenſive to the truth. It is true, we finde the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and others, uſe ſometimes a fable in their Orations, to denote ſome morall matter; but ſuch the Jewes did not uſe. As they muſt not <hi>give heed to fables,</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>endleſſe genealogies.</hi> We ſee a good uſe made of genealogies in the Scriptures, but here is reproved the ſinfull uſe of them; as thoſe Grammarians among the Heathens, that ſpent their time about <hi>Heeuba</hi>'s mother, or <hi>Achilles</hi> pedegree, and what it was that the Syren's ſung: and theſe he calls <hi>endleſſe,</hi> becauſe vaine curioſity is more unruly then the waves of the ſea; it hath no limiting, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou goe, and no further.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome referre genealogy not ſo much to perſons as things, for that the Jewes called genealogy, when one thing was fained to flow from, and, as it were, to be begotten of another; therefore (ſaith one) <hi>Paul,</hi> ver. 5. gives a ſhort, but profitable genealogy, when he makes a good conſcience to flow from a faith unfained. Now mark, the Apoſtle condemneth all theſe, becauſe they doe not edifie. The ſhell-fiſh among the Jewes was accounted uncleane, becauſe it had but a little meat, and a great deal of labour to get it: and this is true of all doctrines, which have no profit in them. The Apoſtle therefore tells us, what is the true uſe of the Law, the end of the precept. <hi>Scultetus,</hi> who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65695:7"/>
hath it out of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> makes <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, not to be <hi>the law,</hi> but <hi>the miniſtry,</hi> or <hi>preaching;</hi> and ſo the Apoſtle uſeth the word, <hi>v.</hi> 3. But grant it be ſo, yet they all agree, he ſpeaks of the Law ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken afterwards. The Apoſtle therefore, reproving theſe falſe teachers, that did turn bread into ſtones, and fiſh into ſerpents, the good law into unprofitableneſſe, leſt this ſhould be thought to traduce the law, he addeth, <hi>We know</hi> (as if that were without queſtion to all.) So that there is a poſition, <hi>The Law is good,</hi> and a ſuppoſition, <hi>If a man uſe it lawfully;</hi> with a correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>The Law is not made to the righteous.</hi> As <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was hard to ſpeak for free-will, and not to deny free-grace; or free-grace, and not to deny free-will:</hi> ſo it's hard to give the Law its due, and not to ſeeme to prejudice the Goſpel; or the Goſpel, and not to prejudice the Law: For, take but theſe two Verſes, <hi>Videtur Apostolus pugnantia dicere,</hi> The Apoſtle ſeemeth to ſpeake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, ſaith <hi>Martyr:</hi> For, ſeeing none can uſe the Law well, but a righteous man, how then is not the Law given to him? But this knot ſhall be untyed in its proper place. I ſhall at this time handle the firſt propoſition, that is conditionall; only I might inſiſt upon opening the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Law:</hi> For, I conceive, the neglect of the different uſe of this, doth breed many errours; for there is a law that we are to be Antinomians, or contrary to; and there is a law, that we muſt ſubmit to: But of this I will ſpeak in one particular caution.</p>
               <p>Obſerv. 1. <hi>The Law of God is good, if a man uſe it lawfully.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>The Law is good, 1. <hi>In respect of the matter of it therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. The Law is good in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the matter.</note> for, if you take the ſpirituall interpretation of it, you will finde all the matter exceeding good: to love God, to truſt in him, &amp;c. how good are they? Yea, there is no duty now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, but is contained there: Therefore <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> did well reſemble the Decalogue to the ten Predicaments, that, as there is nothing hath a being in nature, but what may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to one of thoſe ten; ſo neither is there any Chriſtian duty, but what is comprehended in one of theſe, that is, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially, or reductively. And, if <hi>Tully</hi> durſt ſay, that <hi>the law of the twelve Tables did exceed all the libraries of Philoſophers, both in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65695:8"/>
weight of authority, and fruitfulneſſe of matter,</hi> how much rather is this true of Gods Law? It's diſputed, <hi>Whether justifying faith be commanded in the Law:</hi> here are different opinions; but when I handle this Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and that which was ingraffed in</hi> Adams <hi>heart in innocency, be all one,</hi> it will be proper to ſpeak of that. <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> handling the diviſion of the ten Commandements, how the number ſhould be made up, makes that, which is commonly called the Preface <hi>[I am the Lord thy God,</hi> which are words of a Covenant] to be the firſt Commandment: and if ſo, then muſt juſtifying faith be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned there. And thus did ſome of the Fathers, though thoſe words are only enunciative, and not preceptive. But more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminatively of this in its place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect of the authority ſtamped upon it by God, whereby it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. In reſpect of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it.</note> 
                  <hi>a rule unto us.</hi> The former is agreed on by all: and I ſee few that dare openly deny the other; for, ſeeing the matter is intrinſecally and eternally good, it cannot but be commanded by God, though not to juſtifie, for that is ſeparable from it. There are ſome things that are <hi>justa,</hi> becauſe <hi>Deus vult;</hi> as in all poſitive things: and then there are other things juſt, and therefore God wills them, though even they are alſo juſt, becauſe they are conſonant to that eternall juſtice and goodneſſe in himſelf: ſo that, indeed, it is ſo farre from being true, that the Law, which hath Gods authority ſtampt on it for a rule, and ſo is <hi>mandatum,</hi> ſhould be abrogated, that it is impoſſible, <hi>nè per Deum quidem;</hi> for then God ſhould deny his own juſtice and goodneſſe: therefore we doe juſtly abhorre thoſe blaſphemous Queſtions among the School-men, <hi>An Deus poſſit mandare edium ſui, &amp;c.</hi> for it's impoſſible. Therefore we ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. that our Saviour is ſo farre from abrogating it, that he ſheweth the ſpirituall extent of the mandatory power of the Law, farre beyond Phariſees expectation; and thus <hi>James</hi> urgeth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Law-giver. The obligation by the Law is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and immutable, inſomuch that it doth abſolutely imply a contradiction, that there ſhould be in mans nature an holineſſe or righteouſneſſe without a law or ſubjection to the command of God. Hence it is a dangerous opinion of ſome, who ſay, the holineſſe of our natures is not commanded by the Law, but of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65695:8"/>
our actions, and ſo not originall ſinne but onely actuall ſinne ſhall be forbidden by the Decalogue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It's good instrumentally, as uſed by Gods Spirit for good.</hi> It's <note place="margin">3. It's inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally good.</note> diſputed by ſome, <hi>Whether the Law, and the preaching of it, is uſed as an inſtrument by the Spirit of God for converſion:</hi> But that will be an entire Queſtion in it ſelf; only thus much at this time. The Spirit of God doth uſe the Law, to quicken up the heart of a beleever unto his duty, <hi>Pſal. 119. Thou haſt quickened me by thy precepts.</hi> And ſo <hi>Pſal. 19. The Law of the Lord enlightneth the ſimple, and by them thy ſervant is fore-warn'd of ſinne.</hi> You will ſay, The word <hi>Law</hi> is taken largely there for all precepts and teſtimonies. It's true, but it's not excluſive of the precepts of the morall Law; for they were the chiefeſt; and indeed, the whole Word of God is an organ and inſtrument of Gods Spirit for inſtruction, reformation, and to make a man perfect to every good work. It's an unreaſonable thing, to ſeparate the Law from the Spirit of God, and then compare it with the Goſpel; for, if you doe take the Goſpel, even that Promiſe, <hi>Christ came to ſave ſinners,</hi> without the Spirit, it worketh no more, yea, it's a dead letter as well as the Law: Therefore <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> well called <hi>Lex, corpus,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit, anima:</hi> now, <hi>accedat anima ad corpus,</hi> Let the ſoul be put into the body, and it's a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reaſonable man: But now, as when we ſay, A man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, A man underſtands, this is <hi>ratione animae,</hi> in reſpect of his ſoul, not <hi>corporis,</hi> of the body; ſo when we ſay, A man is quickened by the Law of God to obedience, this is not by reaſon of the Law, but of the Spirit of God: But of this anon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It's good in reſpect of the ſanction of it:</hi> for it's accompanied <note place="margin">4. The Law is good, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its ſanction.</note> with Promiſes, and that not only temporall, as <hi>Command.</hi> 5. but alſo ſpirituall, <hi>Command.</hi> 2. where God is ſaid to pardon to many generations; and therefore the Law doth include Chriſt ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily and occaſionally, though not primarily, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed. It's true, the righteouſneſſe of the Law, and that of the Goſpel differ <hi>toto coelo;</hi> we muſt place one <hi>in ſuprema parte coeli,</hi> and the other <hi>in ima parte terrae,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeakes to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: and it's one of the hardeſt taskes in all divinity, to give them their bounds, and then to cleare how the Apoſtle doth oppoſe them, and how not. We know it was the curſed errour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65695:9"/>
of the Manichees and Marcionites, that the Law was only car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and had only carnall promiſes; whereas it's evident, that the Fathers had the ſame faith for ſubſtance as we have. It's true, if we take <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> in this ſtrict difference, as ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines doe, that all the Precepts, whereſoever they are, muſt be under the Law, and all the Promiſes be reduced to the Goſpel, whether in Old or New Teſtament; in which ſenſe Divines then ſay, <hi>Lex jubet, &amp; Gratia juvat;</hi> the Law commands, and Grace helps; and, <hi>Lex imperat,</hi> the Law commands, and <hi>Fides impetrat,</hi> Faith obtaineth; then the Law can have no ſanction by Promiſe: But where can this be ſhewed in Scripture? When we ſpeake of the ſanction of the Law by Promiſe, we take it as in the adminiſtration of it by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was Evangelicall; not as it was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> with a Promiſe of Eternall life upon perfect obedience: for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s propoſitions, To him that worketh, the reward is reckoned of debt; and, the doers of the Law are juſtified, were never verificable, but in the ſtate of innocency.</p>

Therefore ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this place, <hi>Habemus inſignem locum, quòd Lex omnibus ſuis parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus in Chriſtum respiciat; Imò quicquid Lex docet, quicquid praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, quicquid promittit, Chriſtum pro ſcopo habet:</hi> We have a noble place, proving, that the Law in all its parts did look to Chriſt; yea whatſoever the Law teacheth, commandeth, or promiſeth, it hath Chriſt for its ſcope. What had it been for a Jew to pray to God, if Chriſt had not been in that prayer? to love God, if Chriſt had not been in that love? yet here is as great a difference between the Law and Goſpel, as is between <hi>direction</hi> and <hi>exhibition,</hi> between a <hi>ſchool-master</hi> and a <hi>father:</hi> he is an unwiſe childe, that will make a ſchool-maſter his father.

Now I ſee it called <hi>ſpirituall</hi> in a two-fold ſenſe: 1. <hi>Effectivè,</hi> becauſe it did, by Gods Spirit, quicken to ſpirituall life; even as the Apoſtle in the oppoſition calls himſelf <hi>carnall,</hi> becauſe the power of corruption within, did work car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and ſinfull motions in him. But I ſhall expound it ſpirituall. 2. <hi>Formaliter,</hi> formally, becauſe the nature and extent of it is ſpirituall: for it forbids the ſins of the ſpirit, not only exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſins; it forbids thy ſpirit pride, thy ſpirit envie: Even as God is the father of ſpirits, ſo is the Law, the law of ſpirits.

Even as you ſee upon mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and thoſe that are poſſeſſed with devils, we put heavie chaines and fetters, that they may doe no hurt; ſo the Lord laid the Law upon the people of Iſrael, to keep them in from impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

The curſe of it is the ſore diſpleaſure of God, and that for every breach of it; and, if men, that have broken onely mens lawes, be yet ſo much afraid, that they hide themſelves, and keep cloſe, when yet no man or Judge can damne them, or throw them into hell; what cauſe is there to feare that Law-giver, who is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſoul and body? Therefore conſider, thou prophane man, are not thy oaths, are not thy luſts againſt Gods Law? You had better have all the men in the world your enemy, then the Law of God.

How ſhort is this of that which God commands? not, that a man is to look for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by this, or to make theſe in ſtead of a Chriſt to him; but for other ends.

How abſurd then are they, that ſay, The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law is to make men truſt in themſelves, and to adhere to their own righteouſneſſe? for, there is no ſuch way to ſee a mans beggery and guilt, as by ſhewing the ſtrictneſſe of the Law: For, what makes a Papiſt ſo ſelf-confident, that his hope is partly in grace, and partly in merits, but becauſe they hold they are able to keep the Law? God forbid, ſaith a Papiſt, that we ſhould enjoy heaven as of meere almes to us; no, we have it by conqueſt: Whence is all this, but becauſe they give not the Law its due?</p>

                  <hi>and the benefits by him:</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> in that great agony of his, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with his corruption (being like a living man tyed to a dead carkaſſe, his living faith to dead unbelief, his humility to loathſome pride) ſee what a concluſion he makes, <hi>I thank God, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It's true, many times the people of God, out of the ſenſe of their ſinne, are driven off from Chriſt; but this is not the Scriptures direction: That holds out riches in Chriſt for thy poverty, righteouſneſſe in Chriſt for thy guilt, peace in Chriſt for thy terrour. And in this conſideration it is, that many times <hi>Luther</hi> hath ſuch hyperbolicall ſpeeches about the Law, and about ſinne. All is ſpoken againſt a Chriſtians oppoſing the Law to the Goſpel, ſo, as if the diſcovering of the one, did quite drive from the other. And this is the reaſon, why Papiſts and formall Chriſtians never heartily and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently prize Chriſt, taking up every crumb that falls from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65695:11"/>
his table: they are Chriſts to themſelves, and ſelf-ſaviours. I deny not, but the preaching of Chriſt, and about grace, may alſo make us prize grace and Chriſt; but ſuch is our corruption, that all is little enough. Let me adde theſe cautions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It's of great conſequence in what ſenſe we uſe the Word</hi> [Law.] <note place="margin">1. The <hi>Law,</hi> according to the uſe of the word in the Scripture, is not onely a ſtrict <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>He that diſtinguiſheth well, teacheth well. Now I obſerve a great neglect of this in the books written about theſe points; and, indeed, the reaſon why ſome can ſo hardly endure the word <hi>[Law]</hi> is, becauſe they attend to the uſe of the word in Engliſh; or the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>Lex,</hi> as it is defined by <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which underſtand it a ſtrict rule only of things to be done, and that by way of meere command. But now the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth comprehend more; for that doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie ſtrictly what is to be done, but it denoteth largely any heavenly doctrine, whether it be promiſe, or precept: and hence it is, that the Apoſtle calleth it, <hi>The law of faith</hi> (which in ſome ſenſe would be a contradiction, and in ſome places, where the word <hi>Law</hi> is uſed abſolutely, it's much queſtioned, whether he mean the Law or the Goſpel) and the reaſon why he calls it a law of faith, is not (as <hi>Chryſostome</hi> would have it) becauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would ſweeten the Goſpel, and, for the words ſake, make it more pleaſing to them; but happily, in a meere Hebraiſme, as ſignifying that in generall, which doth declare and teach the will of God.</p>
               <p>The Hebrewes have a more ſtrict word for precept, and that is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet ſome ſay this alſo ſometimes ſignifieth <hi>a Promiſe,</hi> Pſal. 133. 3. <hi>There the Lord commanded a bleſſing, i. e.</hi> promiſed; ſo John 12. 50. <hi>his commandement, i. e.</hi> his promiſe, <hi>is life everlaſting:</hi> So then, if we would attend to the Hebrew words, it would not ſo trouble us, to heare that it is good. But yet the uſe of the word <hi>[Law]</hi> is very generall: ſometimes it ſignifieth <hi>any part of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the  word <hi>Law</hi> in Scripture, are divers.</note> 
                  <hi>the Old Teſtament,</hi> John 10. <hi>It is ſaid in the Law, Ye are gods.</hi> And that is in the Pſalmes: Sometimes the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> are made all the books of the Old Teſtament; ſometimes the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> are diſtinguiſhed; ſometimes it is uſed for the <hi>ceremoniall law only,</hi> Hebr. 10. 1. <hi>The Law having a ſhadow of things to come;</hi> ſometimes it is uſed <hi>ſynecdochically, for ſome acts of the Law only;</hi> as Galat. 5. <hi>Againſt ſuch there is no law:</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65695:12"/>
it is uſed for that <hi>whole oiconomy, and peculiar dispenſation of Gods worſhip unto the Jewes;</hi> in which ſenſe it is ſaid to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>John, but grace and truth by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> ſometimes it is uſed in the ſenſe of the Jewes, <hi>as without Chriſt:</hi> And thus the Apoſtle generally in the Epiſtle to the Romans and Galatians. Indeed, this is a diſpute between Papiſts and us, <hi>In what ſenſe the Law is taken:</hi> for, the Papiſts would have it underſtood onely of the <hi>ceremoniall law.</hi> But we anſwer, that the beginning of the diſpute, was about the obſervation of thoſe legall ceremonies, as neceſſary to ſalvation: But the Apoſtle goeth from the <hi>hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> to the <hi>theſis;</hi> and ſheweth, that not only thoſe ordinances, but no other works may be put in Chriſts roome: Therefore the Antinomian, before he ſpeaks any thing againſt, or about the Law, he muſt ſhew in what ſenſe the Apoſtle uſeth it: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken ſtrictly, for the <hi>five books of Moſes;</hi> yea, it is thought of many, that book of the Law, ſo often mentioned in Scripture, which was kept with ſo much diligence, was onely that book called <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi> and commonly it is taken moſt ſtrictly for the <hi>ten Commandements.</hi> Now, the different uſe of this word breeds all this obſcurity, and the Apoſtle argueth againſt it in one ſenſe, and pleadeth for it in another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Law must not be ſeparated from the Spirit of God.</hi> The <note place="margin">2. The Law and the Spirit of God muſt not be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</note> Law is only light to the underſtanding, the Spirit of God muſt circumciſe the heart to love it, and delight in it, otherwiſe that is true of Gods Law, which <hi>Aristotle, 2.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it's not able of it ſelf to make good and honeſt Citizens. This is a principle alwayes to be carried along with you: for, the whole Word of God is the inſtrument and organ of ſpirituall life, and the Law is part of this Word of God: This I proved before; nay, ſhould the Morall Law be quite aboliſhed, yet it would not be for this end, becauſe the Spirit of God did not uſe it as an inſtrument of life; for, we ſee all ſides grant, that circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the ſacraments are argued againſt by the Apoſtle, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt our Salvation, and damnable in their own uſe now; yet in the old Teſtament, thoſe ſacraments of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and the Paſchall Lamb, were ſpirituall meanes of faith, as truly as Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper are. It is true, there
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65695:12"/>
is a difference in the degree of Gods grace by them; but not in the truth: and therefore our Divines do well conſute the Papiſts, who hold thoſe ſacraments onely typicall of ours, and not to be really exhibitive of grace, as theſe are in the New Teſtament. Therefore, if the Apoſtles, arguing againſt the Morall Law, would prove it no inſtrument of Gods Spirit for our good, the ſame would hold alſo in Circumciſion, and all thoſe ſacraments; and therefore at leaſt for that time they muſt grant it a help to Chriſt and grace, as well as Circumciſion was. If you ſay, Why then doth the Apoſtle argue againſt the works of the Morall Law? I anſwer, Becauſe the Jewes reſted in them without Chriſt: and, it is the fault of our people, they turn the Goſpel into the Law; and we may ſay, Whoſoever ſeeks to be ſaved by his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, he falls off from Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>To doe a thing out of obedience to the Law, and yet by love and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Obedience and love op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not one another.</note> 
                  <hi>delight, doe not oppoſe one another.</hi> About this I ſee a perpetuall miſtake. To lead a man by the Law is ſlaviſh, it's ſervile, ſay they; a Beleever is carried by love, he needs no law: and I ſhall ſhew you, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath ſome ſuch hyperbolicall expreſſions upon the words following, <hi>[The Law is not put for the righteous.]</hi> But this is very weak, to oppoſe the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> and the <hi>rule</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for, the Spirit of God worketh the heart to love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in that which he commandeth: Take an inſtance in <hi>Adam;</hi> While he ſtood, he did obey out of love, and yet becauſe of the command alſo: ſo the Angels are miniſtring ſpirits, and do obey the commandments of God, (otherwiſe the Apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels could not have ſinned) and yet they are under a law, though doing all things in love. We may illuſtrate it by <hi>Moſes</hi> his mother; You know, ſhe was hired, and commanded by <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s daughter to nurſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was her own childe: now ſhe did this out of love to <hi>Moſes,</hi> her childe; yet did obey <hi>Pharaeh</hi>'s daughters commandement upon her alſo: ſo concerning Chriſt, there was a commandement laid upon Chriſt, to fulfill the Law for us, yet he did it out of love.</p>
               <p>It is diſputed, Whether Chriſt had a command laid upon him by the Father ſtrictly ſo called: and howſoever the Arrians, from the grant of this, did inferre Chriſts abſolute inferiority to the Father; yet our Orthodox Divines doe conclude it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65695:13"/>
of the many places of Scripture which prove it, Act. 7. 37. John 14. 31. <hi>As my Father hath commanded me, ſo I you.</hi> John 15. 10. <hi>(If you keep my commandements, and abide in love, &amp;c.)</hi> And, indeed, if it were not a <hi>commandement,</hi> it could not be called an <hi>obedience</hi> of Chriſt; for, that doth relate to a command: Now this I inferre hence, that, to doe a thing out of obedience to a command, becauſe a command, doth not inferre want of love; although I grant, that the commandement was not laid upon Chriſt, as on us, either to direct him, or quicken him. Beſides, all the people of God have divers relations, upon which their obedience lyeth; they are Gods ſervants, and that doth imply <hi>obedientiam ſervi,</hi> though not <hi>obedientiam ſervilem,</hi> the obedience of a ſervant, but not ſervile obedience.</p>
               <p>Again, a Beleever may look to the reward, and yet have a ſpirit of love; how much rather look to the command of God? A godly man may have <hi>amorem mercedis,</hi> though not <hi>amorem mercenarium.</hi> If God in his Covenant make a Promiſe of reward, the eie unto that is ſuteable and agreeable unto the Covenant, and therefore cannot be blame-worthy. And, laſtly, there is no godly man, but he hath in part ſome unwillingneſs to good things; and therefore needs the Law not only to direct, but to exhort and goad forward: Even, as I ſaid, the tamed horſe needeth a ſpur, as well as the unbroken colt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Though Chriſt hath obeyed the Law fully, yet that doth not exempt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Chriſts obedience exempts not us from ours.</note> 
                  <hi>us from our obedience to it, for other ends then he did it.</hi> And, I think, that if the Antinomian did fully inform himſelf in this thing, there were an agreement: for, we all ought to be zealous againſt thoſe Phariſaicall and Popiſh practices of ſetting up any thing in us, though wrought by the grace of God, as the matter of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. But herein they do not diſtinguiſh, or well argue: The works of the Law do not juſtifie, therefore they are needleſſe, or not requiſite: for (ſay they) if Chriſt hath fully obeyed the righteouſneſſe of the Law, and that is made ours; therefore it is not what ours is, but what Chriſts is. This would be a good conſequence, if we were to obey the Law for the ſame end Chriſt did, but that is farre for us. I have heard indeed ſome doubt, whether the maintaining of Chriſts active obedience imputed to us, doth not neceſſarily imply Antinomianiſme: but of that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65695:13"/>
more hereafter; onely let them lay a parallel with Chriſts paſſive obedience. He ſatisfied the curſe and threatning of the Law, and thereby hath freed us from all puniſhment; yet the Beleevers have afflictions for other ends: ſo do we the works of Gods Law, for other ends then Chriſt did them.</p>

What? becauſe it is not good for juſtification, is it in no ſenſe elſe good? Is not gold good, becauſe you cannot eat it, and feed on it, as you do on meat? Take the precept of the Goſpel; yea, take the Goſpel acts, as, To beleeve: this, as it is a work, doth not juſtifie: (Therefore that opinion which makes <gap reason="foreign">

But, if you uſe it ſo, as Chriſt is the dearer, and grace the more welcome to thee, then thou doſt well.

                  <hi>disputes:</hi> and this the Apoſtle doth here mainly intend. <hi>Cui bono?</hi> muſt be the queſtion made of any diſpute about the Law: and therefore, if I ſhould, in this exerciſe I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, handle any frivolous or unprofitable diſputes, this were
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65695:15"/>
to uſe the Law unlawfully; and therefore let Miniſters take heed that be not true of them, which one dreamed about the School-men, that he thought them all like a man eating an hard ſtone, when pure manchet was by. Beſides, he preacheth the Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably, not only that darkeneth it with obſcure queſtions, but that doth not teach Chriſt by it: and I ſee not but that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may be humbled, that they have preſſed religious duties, but not ſo as to ſet up Chriſt; and hereby people have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with duties and ſacraments, though no Chriſt in them. But, as all the veſſels were to be of pure gold in the Temple, ſo ought all our duties to be of pure and meere Chriſt for acceptation. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of <hi>Cerinthus, Legem proponit, ad excludendum Evangelium,</hi> he preacheth the Law, to exclude the Goſpel; Therefore there may be ſuch a legall preacher, as is juſtly to be reproved, the Apoſtle of the teachers in this Chapter, ſaith they will be <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65695:15"/>
places of Scripture that ſeeme to deny the Law; and, I doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, it is hard to get the true ſenſe of thoſe places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diligence: and therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid well (as to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if I miſtake not) <hi>They are not ſo much the ſimple, as the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, that are deceived herein:</hi> and, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>A friend that is acquainted with his friend, will get out the meaning of a letter or phraſe, which another could not that is a ſtranger:</hi> ſo it is here in the Scripture. Now, two things let ſuch conſider: 1. That as there are places that ſeem to overthrow it, ſo there are alſo many places that doe confirme it; yea, the Apoſtle makes objections againſt himſelf, as if he did diſanull it, and then anſwers with an <hi>abſit,</hi> as if it were an horrid thing to doe ſo. 2. That they muſt take the Apoſtle in the particular ſenſe he intends it. It is a good rule, <hi>Quaelibet res eâ capienda eſt parte, quâ capi debet:</hi> You doe not take a ſword by the edge, but the handle; nor a veſſell by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but the eare: and ſo this doctrine of the Law, not in every part, but where the Apoſtle would have you take it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>When they doe ill interpret it.</hi> And herein all Popiſh Authors <note place="margin">4. When they miſinterpret it.</note> are in an high degree to be reproved; for, they limit exceedingly the ſpirituall meaning thereof, even as the Phariſees underſtood it only of externall acts: and therefore our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. did not make new commands or counſells there (as Popiſh Expoſitors dreame) but did throw away all that earth, which the Philiſtims had tumbled into that ſpring. And this was ſo generall a miſtake, that it was a great while ere <hi>Paul</hi> did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſtrictneſſe of it. This diſcovers a world of ſin in a man, which he was ignorant of before. The Papiſts, they alſo uſe it unlawfully in that corrupt gloſſe, as if it might be kept ſo farre forth as it's obligatory. In a great part of it, they make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitory, and not obligatory; and the power of man they make to be the rule of his duty, whereas it is plaine by Scripture, that that meaſure of grace, which God giveth any man upon earth, is not anſwerable to the duty commanded there. It is true, <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was blaſphemy to ſay, God commanded any thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible:</hi> but in this ſenſe impoſſible abſolutely, ſo that man could never have fulfilled it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>When they doe oppoſe it to Chriſt.</hi> And this was the Jewes <note place="margin">5. When they oppoſe it to Chriſt.</note> fundamentall errour, and under this notion doth the Apoſtle
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65695:16"/>
argue againſt it in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians.</hi> And, howſoever they would have compounded Chriſt and the Law together, yet this compoſition was to make oppoſition. There can be no more two Suns in the firmament, then two things to juſtifie: Therefore the reconciliation of the Law and Chriſt cannot be, in matter of juſtification, by way of mixture; but yet one is antecedaneous and ſubordinate to the other, and is no more to be oppoſed, then the end to the meanes. Nor is it any wonder that the Law, through errour, may be oppoſed to Chriſt, ſeeing that Chriſt may be oppoſed to Chriſt; as, in Popery, Chriſt ſanctifying is oppoſed to Chriſt juſtifying: for, when we charge them with derogating from Chriſt, in holding our graces doe juſtifie; Nay (ſay they) we ſet him up more then you, for, we hold, He doth make us holy, That this holineſſe doth juſtifie. Thus, you ſee, Chriſt in his workes is oppoſed to Chriſt in his juſtifying. And here, by the way, you may ſee, that that only is the beſt way of advancing Chriſt or grace, which is in a Scripture way, and not what is poſſible for us to think, as the Papiſts doe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>When they look for justification by it:</hi> and this is a dangerous <note place="margin">6. When they expect juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by it.</note> and deſperate errour; this is that which reigneth in Popery, this is that inbred canker-worm, that eateth in the hearts of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally. They know not a Goſpel-righteouſneſſe, and for this end they reade the Law, they heare it preached onely, that they may be ſelf-ſaviours: And, certainly, for this two-fold end, I may think, God ſuffers this Antinomian errour to grow; firſt, That Miniſters may humble themſelves, they have not ſet forth Chriſt and grace in all the glory of it. If <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid, he did not love to reade <hi>Tully,</hi> becauſe he could not reade the Name of Chriſt there; how much rather may we ſay, that in many Sermons, in many a mans miniſtery, the drift and end of all his preaching is not, that Chriſt may be advanced. And in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in Proteſtants, it is a farre greater ſin then in Papiſts: for, it is well obſerved by <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> that the Apoſtle doth deale more mildly in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> then in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians;</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Galatians</hi> were at firſt well inſtructed in the matter of juſtification, but afterwards did mixe other things with Chriſt, therefore he thunders againſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65695:16"/>
them. <hi>I deſire to know nothing,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Corinth. 2. <hi>but Jeſus Christ, and him crucified.</hi> And ſecondly, another end may be, to have theſe truths beaten out more: As, The deity of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Arrians; and, Grace in predeſtination and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by the Pelagians: ſo, The grace of juſtification, becauſe not only of Papiſts, but Antinomians. And, certainly, theſe things were much preſſed by <hi>Luther</hi> at firſt, as appeares in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians:</hi> but, perceiving how this good doctrine was abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he ſpeaks in his Commentary on <hi>Geneſis</hi> (which was one of his laſt workes) much againſt Antinomiſts: But yet, becauſe generally people are fallen into a formality of truths, it's good to ſet up Chriſt. And the poiſon of this opinion will be ſeen in theſe things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It overthroweth the nature of grace.</hi> And this holdeth againſt <note place="margin">1. Juſtification by the Law overthrowes the nature of grace.</note> the works of the Goſpel, as well as thoſe of the Law. Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this, that juſtification by works doth not only exclude the works of the Law, but all works of the Goſpel, yea, and the works of grace alſo. Hence you ſee, the oppoſition is of works, and of grace. Here the Apoſtle makes an immediate oppoſition, whereas the Papiſt would ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> hath a <hi>non ſequitur;</hi> for, <hi>datur tertium,</hi> workes of and by grace. But works doe therefore oppoſe grace, becauſe the frequent acception of it in the Scripture is for the favour of God without us, not any thing in us. I will not deny but that the word <hi>[grace]</hi> is uſed for the effects of it, inherent holineſſe wrought in us, as in that place, <hi>Grow in grace and knowledge;</hi> but yet commonly <hi>grace</hi> is uſed for the favour of God. And the ignorance of the uſe of the word in Scripture, makes them ſo extoll inherent holineſſe, as if that were the grace which ſhould ſave us. As (ſaith the Papiſt) a bird cannot fly without wings, the fiſh ſwimme without ſcales, the Sculler without his oare cannot get to the haven: ſo, without this grace, we cannot fly into heaven, and that as the meritorious cauſe. But this is ignorance of the word <hi>[grace]</hi> and ſo the troubles and unbelief of the godly heart, becauſe it is not ſo holy as it would be, cometh from the miſtake of the word <hi>[grace.]</hi> I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate my ſelf in another ſubject, if I ſhould tell you how comprehenſive this word is, implying no merit or cauſality on our part for acceptance, but the clean contrary; and therefore,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65695:17"/>
for God to deal with us in grace, is more then in love: for <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had continued righteous, he had been partaker of life; this had been the gift of God, but not by the grace of God, as it is ſtrictly taken; for <hi>Adam</hi> was not in a contrary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to life. I will not trouble you with <hi>Pareus</hi> his apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thinketh <hi>Adams</hi> righteouſneſſe could not be called grace, therefore reproveth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for his title, <hi>De gratia pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi hominis:</hi> neither will he acknowledge thoſe habits of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Chriſt to be called <hi>grace,</hi> becauſe there was not a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſpoſition in his nature to it, as it is in ours. And this alſo <hi>Cameron</hi> preſſeth, that, beſides the <hi>indebitum</hi> which grace imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in every ſubject, there is alſo a <hi>demeritum</hi> of the contrary. Thus then juſtification is of grace, becauſe thy holineſſe doth not only not deſerve this, but the clean contrary. Now what a cordiall may this be to the broken heart, exerciſed with its ſinnes? How may the ſick ſay, There I finde health? the poore ſay, There I finde riches? And as for the Papiſts, who ſay they ſet up grace, and they acknowledge grace; yet firſt it muſt be ſet down in what ſenſe we take <hi>grace.</hi> It is not every man that talketh of grace, doth therefore ſet up Scripture-grace. Who knoweth not that the Pelagians ſet up grace? They determined, that <hi>whoſoever did not a knowledge grace neceſſary to every good act all the day long let him be an anathema:</hi> and this faire colour did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Eaſtern Churches, that they did acquit him: But <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> and others obſerved, that he did uſe the word grace, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline envie, <hi>gratiae vocabulo uti ad frangendam invidiam;</hi> even as the Papiſts do at this time: therefore if they ſay, Thy patience is grace, Thy hope is grace, and therefore by grace thou art ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; ſay, This is not the Goſpel-grace, the Scripture-grace, by which ſins are pardoned, and we ſaved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It oppoſeth Christ in his fulneſſe: It makes an halfe-Christ.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Oppoſeth the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</note> Thus the falſe Apoſtles made Chriſt void, and fell off from him. Neither will this ſerve, to ſay that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall law: for (as we told you) though the differences about the Jewiſh ceremonies, were the occaſion of thoſe diviſions in the primitive times, yet the Apoſtle goeth from the <hi>hypotheſis</hi> to the <hi>theſis,</hi> even to all works whatſoever, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>Abrahams</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> works from juſtification. Now
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65695:17"/>
Chriſt would be no Chriſt if workes were our righteouſneſſe; becauſe the righteouſneſſe by the faith of Chriſt is oppoſed to <hi>Pauls</hi> own righteouſneſſe, and this is called <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God:</hi> Yea, this is ſaid to be <hi>made righteouſneſſe unto us,</hi> and he is called the <hi>Lord our righteouſneſſe;</hi> and howſoever <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would underſtand theſe phraſes cauſally, as when God is called <hi>the Lord our ſalvation;</hi> yet we ſhall ſhew you it cannot be ſo, therefore if thy works juſtifie thee, what needs a Chriſt?

               <p>But before I come to handle ſome of their dangerous errours in this point, let me premiſe ſomething, As,</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65695:21"/>
this were all the controverſie, we ſhould quickly agree. It is no wonder then if it be ſo hard to preach free-grace, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Papiſt; or, on the other ſide, to preach good works of the Law, and not offend the Antinomian.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There have been dangerous aſſertions about good works, even by thoſe that were no Antinomians, out of a great zeale for the grace of God againſt Papiſts.</hi> Theſe indeed, for ought I can learn, did no wayes joyn with the Antinomians: but in this point there is too much affinity. There were rigid Lutherans called <hi>Flacians,</hi> who as they did goe too far, at leaſt in their expreſſions, about originall corruption (for there are thoſe that doe excuſe them;) ſo alſo they went too high againſt good works: Therefore in ſtead of that poſition, maintained by the Orthodox, Good works are neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>Bona opera ſunt neceſſaria ad ſalutem;</hi> they held, Good works are pernicious to ſalvation, <hi>Bona opera ſunt pernicioſa ad ſalutem.</hi> The occaſion of this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was the book called, <hi>The Interim,</hi> which <hi>Charles</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour would have brought into the Germane Churches. In that book was this paſſage, <hi>Good works are neceſſary to ſalvation:</hi> to which <hi>Melancthon</hi> and others aſſented (not underſtanding a <hi>neceſſity of merit,</hi> or <hi>efficiency,</hi> but of <hi>preſence;)</hi> but <hi>Flacius Illyricus</hi> and his followers would not, taking many high expreſſions out of <hi>Luther</hi> (even as the Antinomians doe) for their ground. Hence alſo <hi>Zanchy,</hi> becauſe in his writings he had ſuch paſſages as theſe, <hi>No man grown up can be ſaved, unleſſe he give himſelf to good works, and walk in them:</hi> One <hi>Hinckellman,</hi> a Lutheran, doth endeavour, by a troop of nine Arguments, to tread downe this aſſertion of <hi>Zanchy,</hi> which he calls <hi>Calviniana</hi>

                  </gap>, as a moſt manifeſt errour. Now, if all this were ſpoken to take men off from that generall ſecret ſin of putting confidence in the good works we doe, it were more tolerable: in which ſenſe we applaud that of <hi>Luther,</hi> Take heed not only of evil works, but of good, <hi>Cave non tantùm ab operibus malis, ſed etiam à bonis;</hi> and that of another man, who ſaid, he <hi>got more good by his ſins, then his graces:</hi> But theſe ſpeeches muſt be ſoundly underſtood.

3. <hi>That iſ the incommodious, yea and erroneous paſſages in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian Authors, were uſed for ſome reaſons hereafter to be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it were the more tolerable:</hi> but that ſeems not to be. There is more poiſon then can be concocted in them. But if this were their ground of many unſavory aſſertions among them, meerly their want of clear judgement to expreſſe themſelves, ſo that they think more orthodoxly then they write; then they might be excuſed, as being in a logomachy: but with this <hi>proviſo,</hi> as <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaid of them that uſed the word <hi>fatum</hi> in a good ſenſe, Let them hold their opinion, but correct their expreſſions, <hi>Mentem teneant, ſed linguam corrigant.</hi> Now, that there may be injudiciouſneſſe in them, as a cauſe in part of ſome of their erroneous paſſages, will appeare in that they frequently ſpeake contradictions. This is a paſſage often, but very dangerous, that, <hi>Let a man be a wicked man, even as high as enmity it ſelf can make a man, yet while he is thus wicked, and while he is no better, his ſins are pardoned, and he justified.</hi> Yet now in other paſſages, <hi>Though a man be never ſo wicked, yet if he come to Christ, if he will take Chriſt, his ſinnes are pardoned:</hi> now what a contradiction is here, <hi>To be wicked</hi> and, <hi>while he is wicked,</hi> and, <hi>while he is no better,</hi> and yet <hi>to take Chriſt,</hi> unleſſe they hold that, <hi>to take Chriſt,</hi> or, <hi>to come to him,</hi> be no good thing at all?

Their injudiciouſneſſe and weakneſſe doth alſo appear, that when they have laid down ſuch a truth as every godly Author hath, they have ſo many words about it, and doe ſo commend it, as if they had found a Philoſophers Stone, or a <hi>Phenix;</hi> as if the Reader ſhould preſently cry out and ſay, <hi>Behold a greater then Solomon is here:</hi> and yet it is but that which every Writer almoſt hath. Again, their injudiciouſneſſe doth appeare, in that <hi>they minde only the promiſſory part of the Scripture, and doe ſtand very little upon the mandatory part.</hi> There are five or ſix places, ſuch as, <hi>Christ came to ſave that which was lost,</hi> and, <hi>He hath laid on him the iniquities of us all, &amp;c.</hi> theſe are over and over again: But you ſhall ſeldome or never have theſe places urged, <hi>Make your calling and election ſure. Work out your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with feare and trembling;</hi> whereas all Scripture is given for our uſe. Therefore, 1. <hi>If weakneſſe were all the ground of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,</hi> the danger were not ſo great. Or, 2ly, <hi>If the end and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65695:22"/>
aime they had, were only to put men off from glorying in themſelves, to deny the concurrence of works to the act of justification.</hi> If their deſire were that men ſhould not (as <hi>Michal)</hi> put an image in <hi>Davids</hi> roome, ſo neither that Chriſtians ſhould put their works in Chriſts ſtead, thus farre it might be excuſable: but then their books, and their aimes cannot be reconciled. Or, <hi>If, 3ly, their maine drift was only to ſhew that good works follow a juſtified perſon, and that they doe not antecede;</hi> here would be no oppoſition: but they deny the preſence of them in time. Or, 4ly, <hi>If the queſtion were about preparatory works to juſtification and converſion;</hi> though (for my part) I think there are ſuch, with thoſe limitations that hereafter may be given to them: this alſo were not ſo hainous. Or fifthly, <hi>If the diſpute were onely upon the ſpace of time between a profane mans profaneneſſe, and his juſtification, or the quantity of his ſorrow;</hi> theſe things were of another debate. I do acknowledge, that the Chriſtian Religion was matter of offence to the Heathens, in that they taught, Though a man had never been ſo wicked, yet, if he did receive Chriſt, he ſhould be pardoned; and how ſoon this may be done, it is as God pleaſeth: but there is an alteration of the mans nature at that time alſo; and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> indeed, hath ſuch a paſſage upon that Scripture, <hi>The righteous ſhall live by faith, Rom.</hi> 1. by faith onely a man hath remiſſion of ſins; Now (ſaith he) this is a Paradox to humane reaſon, that he who was an adulterer, a murderer, ſhould preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be accounted righteous, if he doe beleeve in Chriſt: but this differs from the Antinomian aſſertion, as much as heaven from hell. So it's related in Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, that when he had killed many of his kindred, yea and was counſelled alſo to murder his own ſon, repenting of theſe hainous crimes, askt <hi>Sopater</hi> the Philoſopher, who ſucceeded <hi>Plotinus</hi> in teaching him, Whether there could be any expiation for thoſe ſins? The Philoſopher ſaid, No: afterwards he asked the Chriſtian Biſhops, and they ſaid, I, if he would beleeve in Chriſt. This was feigned, to make our Religion odious. Or ſixthly, <hi>If it were to ſhew, that there cannot be aſſurance before juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> or that <hi>to relye upon Chriſt for pardon, it is not neceſſary I ſhould know whether I have truly repented, or no;</hi> This were alſo of another nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65695:22"/>
Therefore let us ſee what prejudiciall inferences they gather from this doctrine of Juſtification. I know, the proper place of handling this will come, when we ſpeak of that point; but yet, to give ſome antidote againſt their errours, I will name ſome few: as, 1. <hi>Denying them to be a way to heaven.</hi> Thus one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly <note place="margin">1. Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans deny works to be a way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> (Sect. 4. <hi>on Christ being a way,</hi> pag. 68.) It is a received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit among many perſons, that our obedience is <hi>a way</hi> to heaven; though it be not <hi>cauſa,</hi> yet it's <hi>via ad regnum:</hi> Now this he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to confute. As for the ſpeech it ſelf, Divines have it out of <hi>Bernard,</hi> where, among other <hi>encomium</hi>'s of good works, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them Seeds of hope, incentives of love, ſignes of hidden Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, and preſages of future happineſſe, <hi>Spei quaedam ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria, charitatis incentiva, occultae Praedestinationis indicia, futurae felicitatis praeſagia,</hi> he addeth this, The way to the Kingdome, not the cauſe of reigning, <hi>Via regni, non cauſa regnandi.</hi> Now it's true, that they are not <hi>a way</hi> in that ſenſe that Chriſt is called <hi>a Way,</hi> no more then the ſpirituall life of a Chriſtian is life in that ſenſe Chriſt ſtileth himſelf Life; for, here he underſtands it of himſelf, as the cauſall and meritorious way: Therefore there are Articles added to every one, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and that which followeth makes it cleare, <hi>No man can come to the Father, but by me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Oh, but ſay they, our works are our buſineſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, not our way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, when we call them <hi>a way,</hi> it's a metaphor, and ſuch a metaphor, that the Scripture doth often delight in: Thus the <hi>wayes of God</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>perfect, Deut.</hi> 32. that is, the works of the Lord; and thus, when it's applyed to men, if ſignifieth any religion, doctrine, manners, actions, or courſe of life, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2, 15, 21. So that good works are both our way, and imployment; for an imployment and way in this ſenſe are all one. Thus <hi>Matth. 7. 17. Strait is the way that leadeth to life:</hi> What is this, but the work of grace and godlineſſe? for, as for that expoſition of the ſame author, to underſtand it of Chriſt, as if he were ſtrait, becauſe men do account him ſo, and therefore would adde works to him, this is to compell Scripture to go two miles with us, that would not go one; and then, by the oppoſition, not wickedneſs, but the devil himſelf would be the broad way.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:65695:23"/>
2. <hi>Denying the preſence of them in the perſon justified.</hi> And truly, <note place="margin">2. They deny their preſence in the perſon juſtified.</note> this is ſo dangerous, that I know not how charity can excuſe it: It is ſuch a <hi>naevus,</hi> that <hi>ubera charitatis</hi> cannot <hi>tegere,</hi> cover it. For, thus ſaith the Authour expreſly, ſpeaking of that of <hi>Paul, Therefore we conclude, a man is juſtified without the deeds of the Law: Here</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Apoſtle doth not only exclude works from having any power operative to concurre in the laying iniquities upon Chriſt, but excludes all manner of works men can doe, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and existent in perſons, when God doth juſtifie them.</hi> And he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth of a generall pardon for theeves and traitors: <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>one may take the pardon as well as another.</hi> And ſo ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that place <hi>[He hath received gifts for men, even for the rebellious.]</hi> he concludes, that therefore though a man doe rebell actually from time to time, and doe practiſe this rebellion; yet, though this perſon do thus, the hatefulneſſe thereof is laid upon Chriſt: Is not this ſuch a doctrine that muſt needs pleaſe an ungodly heart?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In the denying of gaining any thing by them, even any peace of heart, or loſing it by them.</hi> Now this goeth contrary to Scripture. <note place="margin">3. They deny any gain or loſſe to come by them.</note> Thus page 139. (the Antinomian ſaith) <hi>The buſineſſe we are to do is this, that though there be ſinnes committed, yet there is no peace bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, becauſe the breach of peace is ſatisfied in Chriſt; there is a reparation of the damage before the damage it ſelf be committed.</hi> And again, page 241. <hi>If God come to reckon with beleevers for ſinne, either he muſt aske ſomething of them, or not; If not, why are they troubled? If ſo, then God cannot bring a new reckoning.</hi> And in other places, <hi>If a man look to get any thing by his graces, he will have nothing but knocks.</hi> To anſwer theſe, it is true, if a man ſhould look by any repentance or grace to have Heaven and pardon, as a cauſe or merit, this were to be ignorant of the imperfection of all our graces, and the glorious greatneſſe of thoſe mercies: What proportion hath our faith, or godly ſorrow with the everlaſting favour and good pleaſure of God? But firſt, the Scripture uſeth ſevere and ſharp threatnings even unto the godly, where they neglect to repent, or goe on in ſin, Rom. 8. 13. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh, you ſhall die:</hi> eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that place, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. two laſt verſes; the Apoſtle alludeth to that place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. and he ſaith, <hi>Our God</hi> (as well as the God
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65695:23"/>
of the Jewes, who appeared in terrour) <hi>is a conſuming fire:</hi> Now then, if the Scripture threatens thus to men living in ſin, if they doe not, they may finde comfort. Secondly, Our holy duties, they have a promiſe of pardon, and eternall life, though not becauſe of their worth, yet to their preſence: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may the godly rejoyce when they finde them in themſelves. Laſtly, their ground is ſtill upon that falſe bottome, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our ſinnes are laid upon Christ.</hi> What then? they may be laid upon us in other reſpects, to heale us, to know how bitter a thing it is to ſinne againſt God. God doth here, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> with his brethren; he cauſed them to be bound, and to be put in gaoles, as if now they were to ſmart for their former impiety.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>In denying them to be ſignes and teſtimonies of grace, or Chriſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. They deny them to be ſignes of grace.</note> 
                  <hi>dwelling in us.</hi> And here, indeed, one would wonder to ſee how laborious an Author is to prove, that no inherent graces can be ſignes: and he ſelects three inſtances, Of univerſality of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Of ſincerity, and love to the brethren; concluding, that there are two evidences only; one revealing, which is the Spirit of God immediately; the other receiving, and that is faith. Now, in anſwering of this, we may ſhew briefly how many weak props this diſcourſe leaneth upon:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In confounding the inſtrumentall evidencing with the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; <hi>Not holy works</hi> (ſay they) <hi>but the Spirit:</hi> Here he doth oppoſe ſubordinates; <hi>Subordinata non ſunt opponenda, ſed componenda.</hi> As if a man ſhould ſay, We ſee not by the beames, or reflection of the Sun, but the Sun. Certainly, every man is in darkneſſe, and, like <hi>Hagar,</hi> ſeeth not a fountaine, though neare her, till her eyes be opened. Thus it is in grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſay, that a Chriſtian, in time of darkneſſe and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not to go by ſignes and marks, but obedientially to truſt in God, as <hi>David</hi> calls upon his ſoul often; and the word is emphaticall, ſignifying ſuch a relying or holding, as a man doth that is falling down into a pit irrecoverably.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His Arguments, againſt ſincerity, and univerſality of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, goe upon two falſe grounds: 1. That a man cannot diſtinguiſh himſelf from hypocrites; which is contrary to the Scriptures exhortation. 2. That there can be no aſſurance, but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65695:24"/>
upon a full and compleat work of godlineſſe. All which are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh arguments.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All thoſe arguments will hold as ſtrongly againſt faith; for, Are there not many beleevers for a ſeaſon? Is there not a faith that indureth but for a while? May not then a man as ſoon know the ſincerity of his heart, as the truth of his faith?</p>
               <p>Now let us conſider their grounds for this ſtrange aſſertion, 1. Becauſe, <hi>Roman.</hi> 4. it is ſaid, that <hi>God justifieth the ungodly.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How God may be ſaid to juſtifie the ungodly.</note> Now this hath a two-fold anſwer; 1. That which our Divines doe commonly give, that theſe words are not to be underſtood <hi>in ſenſu compoſito</hi> but <hi>diviſo,</hi> and <hi>antecedenter:</hi> he that was ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is, being juſtified, made godly alſo, though that godlineſſe doe not juſtifie him. Therefore they compare theſe paſſages with thoſe of making the blinde to ſee, and deafe to heare; not that they did ſee while they were blind, but thoſe that were blind doe now ſee: and this is true and good. But I ſhall, ſecondly, anſwer it, with ſome learned men, that <hi>ungodly</hi> there is meant of ſuch, who are ſo in their nature conſidered, having not an abſolute righteouſneſſe, yet at the ſame time beleevers, even as <hi>Abraham</hi> was; and faith of the ungodly man is accounted to him for righteouſneſſe: So then, the ſubject of juſtification is a ſinner, yet a beleever. Now it's impoſſible that a man ſhould be a beleever, and his heart not purified, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. for whole Chriſt is the object of his faith, who is received not onely to juſtifie, but to ſanctifie. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. where the Apoſtle ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to make an exact order, he begins with Preſcience, (that is approbative and complacentiall, n<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in a Popiſh or Arminian ſenſe) then Predeſtination, then Calling, then Juſtification, then Glorification. I will not trouble you with the diſpute, in which place Sanctification is meant. Now the Antinomian, he goeth upon that as true, which the Papiſt would calumniate us with, That <hi>a profane ungodly man, if beleeving, ſhall be justified:</hi> We ſay, this propoſition ſuppoſeth an impoſſibility, that faith in Chriſt, or cloſing with him, can ſtand with thoſe ſins, becauſe faith pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth the heart; <hi>By faith Chriſt dwells in our hearts,</hi> Epheſ. 3. Therefore thoſe expreſſions of the Antinomians are very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and unſound, and doe indeed confirme the Papiſts calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:65695:24"/>
Another place they much ſtand upon is <hi>Rom. 5. Christ dyed for us while we were enemies, while we were ſinners:</hi> But, 1. if Chriſt dyed for us while we were enemies, why doe they ſay, That <hi>if a man be as great an enemy as enmity it ſelfe can make a man, if he be willing to take Chriſt, and to cloſe with Chriſt, he ſhall be pardoned?</hi> (which, we ſay, is a contradiction.) For, how can an enemy to Chriſt, cloſe with Chriſt? So that this would prove more then in ſome places they would ſeem to allow.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Chriſt dyed not only to juſtifie, but ſave us: now will they hence therefore inferre, that profane men, living ſo, and dying ſo, ſhall be ſaved? And indeed the grand principle, <hi>That Chriſt hath purchaſed and obtained all graces antecedently to us,</hi> in their ſenſe, will as neceſſarily inferre, that a drunkard, abiding a drunkard, ſhall be ſaved, as well as juſtified.</p>
               <p>But, thirdly, to anſwer that place, When it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt dyed, and roſe again for ſinners,</hi> you muſt know, that this is the meritorious cauſe of our pardon and ſalvation; but, beſides this cauſe, there are other cauſes inſtrumentall, that go to the whole work of Juſtification: Therefore ſome Divines, as they ſpeak of a converſion paſſive and active, ſo alſo of a juſtification active and paſſive; and paſſive they call, when not onely the meritorious cauſe, but the inſtrument applying is alſo preſent, then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is juſtified. Now theſe ſpeak of Chriſts death as an univerſall meritorious cauſe, without any application of Chriſts death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this or that ſoule: Therefore ſtill you muſt carry this along with you, that, to that grand mercy of juſtification, ſomething is requiſite as the efficient, <hi>viz.</hi> the grace of God; ſomething as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts ſuffering; ſomething as inſtrumentall, <hi>viz.</hi> faith; and one is as neceſſary as the other.</p>
               <p>I will but mention one place more, and that is <hi>Pſal. 68. 18. Thou haſt received gifts even for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord God may dwell among them.</hi> Here they inſiſt much upon this, <hi>yea for the rebellious;</hi> and ſaith the Author, <hi>pag. 411. Seeing God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dwell where iniquity is, Chriſt received gifts for men, that the Lord God might dwell among the rebellious; and by this meanes, God can dwell with thoſe perſons that doe act the rebellion, becauſe all the hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of it is tranſacted from thoſe perſons upon the back of Christ.</hi> And, ſaith the ſame Author, <hi>pag. 412. The holy Ghoſt doth not ſay,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65695:25"/>
that the Lord takes rebellious perſons and gifts, and prepares them, and then will come and dwell with them; but even then, while they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, without any ſtop, the Lord Christ hath received gifts for them, that the Lord God may dwell among them.</hi> Is not all this ſtrange? Though the ſame Authour preſſe ſanctification never ſo much in other places, yet certainly ſuch principles as theſe overthrow it.</p>
               <p>But as for this place, it will be the greateſt adverſary they have againſt them, if you conſider the ſcope of it; for, there the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of the fruit and power of Chriſts Aſcenſion, as appeareth <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. whereby gifts were given to men, that ſo even the moſt rebellious might be converted, and changed by this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery; ſo that this is clean contrary: And beſides, thoſe words, <hi>with them,</hi> or <hi>among them,</hi> are not in the Hebrew; therefore ſome referre them to the rebellious, and make <hi>Jah</hi> in the Hebrew, and <hi>Elohim,</hi> in the Vocative caſe, even for the rebellious (O Lord God) to inhabit; as that of <hi>Eſay, The Wolfe and the Lamb ſhall dwell together:</hi> Some referre it to Gods dwelling, yet doe not underſtand it of his dwelling with them, but of his dwelling, <hi>i. e.</hi> fixing the Arke after the enemies are ſubdued. But take our Edition to be the beſt (as it ſeemeth to be) yet it muſt be meant of rebels changed by his Spirit; for the Scripture uſeth <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>HAving confuted ſome dangerous inferences, that the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian makes from that precious doctrine of Juſtification, I ſhall at this time anſwer only one queſtion, <hi>Upon what grounds are the people of God to be zealous of good workes?</hi> for it's very hard to repent, to love, to be patient, or fruitfull, and not to doe them for this end, to juſtifie us: And, howſoever theologically,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65695:25"/>
and in the notion, we may make a great difference between <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as a way</hi> or <hi>meanes,</hi> and as <hi>a cauſe</hi> or <hi>merit</hi> of ſalvation; yet practically the heart doth not uſe to diſtinguiſh ſo ſubtilely. Therefore, although I intend not to handle the whole doctrine of Sanctification or new obedience at this time; yet I ſhould leave my diſcourſe imperfect, if I did not informe you, how good works of the Law done by grace, and juſtification of the Goſpel, may ſtand together.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore take notice what we meane by <hi>good works.</hi> We take not <hi>good works</hi> ſtrictly, for the works of charity or libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; nor for any externall actions of religion, which may be done where the heart is not cleanſed; much leſſe for the Popiſh good workes of ſupererogation: but for the graces of Gods Spirit in us, and the actions flowing from them: For, uſually, with the Papiſts and Popiſh perſons, good works are commonly called thoſe ſuperſtitious and ſupererogant workes, which God never commanded: or, if God hath commanded them, they mean them as externall and ſenſible; ſuch as, Coming to Church, and, Receiving of Sacraments; not internall and ſpirituall faith, and a contrite ſpirit, which are the ſoule of all duties: and if theſe be not there, the outward duties are like clothes upon a dead man, that cannot warme him, becauſe there is no life within. Therefore much is required even to the eſſence of a godly work, though it be not perfect in degrees: As, 1. <hi>It muſt be commanded</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Foure things required to the eſſence of good works.</note> 
                  <hi>by God. 2. It muſt be wrought in us by the Spirit of God.</hi> All the unregenerate mans actions, his prayers, and ſervices are ſinnes. 3. <hi>It muſt flow from an inward principle of grace, or a ſupernaturall being in the ſoule, whereby a man is a new creature. 4. The end muſt be Gods glory.</hi> That which the moſt refined man can doe, is but a glow-worm, not a ſtarre: So that then onely is the work <hi>good,</hi> when, being anſwerable to the rule, it's from God, and through God, and to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Antinomian erreth two contrary wayes about good works: Sometimes they ſpeak very erroneouſly and groſly about them. Thus <hi>Iſlebius Agricola,</hi> the firſt Antinomian that was (who afterwards joyned with others in making that wicked Book, called, <hi>The Interim)</hi> and his followers, deliver theſe Poſitions, That ſaying of <hi>Peter, Make your calling and election
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65695:26"/>
ſure,</hi> is <hi>dictum inutile,</hi> an unprofitable ſaying, and <hi>Peter</hi> did not underſtand Chriſtian liberty. So again, <hi>As ſoon as thou once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnest to thinke, how men ſhould live godlily and modestly, preſently thou hast wandered from the Gospel.</hi> And again, <hi>The Law and works only belong to the Court of Rome.</hi> Then, on the other ſide, they lift them up ſo high, that, by reaſon of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe imputed to us, they hold all our workes perfect, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. Chriſts clenſing his Church, ſo, as to be without ſpot or wrinkle, even pure in this life. They tell us not onely of a righteouſneſſe or juſtification by imputation, but alſo Saintſhip and holineſſe by this obedience of Chriſt: And hence it is, that God ſeeth no ſin in beleevers. This is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous poſition: and, although they have Similies to illuſtrate, and diſtinctions to qualifie it; yet, when I ſpeak of <hi>imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> there will be the proper place to ſhew the dangerous falſhood of them.</p>

You muſt, in the diſcourſe you ſhall heare concerning the neceſſity of good works, carefully diſtinguiſh between theſe two Propoſitions: <hi>Good workes are neceſſary to beleevers, to justified perſons, or to thoſe that ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and this, <hi>Good works are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to juſtification and ſalvation.</hi> Howſoever this later is true in ſome ſenſe, yet, becauſe the words carry as if holineſſe had ſome effect immediately upon our juſtification and ſalvation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do wholly aſſent to thoſe learned men, that think, in theſe two caſes, we ſhould not uſe ſuch a Propoſition: 1. When we deale with adverſaries, eſpecially Papiſts, in diſputation; for then we ought to ſpeak exactly: Therefore the Fathers would not uſe the word <gap reason="foreign">

The ſecond caſe is in our ſermons and exhortations to people; for, what common hearer is there, that, upon ſuch a ſpeech, doth not conceive that they are ſo neceſſary, as that they immediately work our juſtification? The former propoſition holds them offices and duties in the perſons juſtified; the other, as conditions effecting juſtification.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65695:28"/>
1. To apprehend and lay hold upon Chriſt, and thus it juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 2.

It's a ſaying of <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> Where good workes are not without, faith cannot be within, <hi>Ubi bona opera non apparent ad extra, ibi fides non eſt ad intra:</hi> Therefore, as Chriſt, while he remained the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was inviſible, but when he was incarnated, then he became viſible; ſo muſt thy faith be incarnated into works, and it muſt become fleſh as it were.</p>

Now it's true, to take them ſo as to put confidence in them, to take comfort from them, as a cauſe, that cannot be; for, who can look upon any thing he doth with that boldneſſe? It was a deſperate ſpeech of <hi>Panigarola</hi> a Papiſt (as <hi>Rivet</hi> relates) who called it folly to put confidence onely in Chriſts bloud. We know no godly man ſatisfieth his own heart in any thing he doth, much leſſe can hee the will of God. Wee cannot at the ſame time ſay, Lord, forgive me, and, Pay me what thou oweſt; yet theſe good works, though imperfect, may be a great comfort unto us, as the teſtimony of Gods eternall love to us. Thus did <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Kings 20. 3. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is not there a proud Phariſee, but a thankfull acknowledger of what is in him: and ſome conſider, that this temptation might fall upon <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that when he had laboured to demoliſh all thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, and now became dangerouſly ſick that hee had not done well; therefore he comforts himſelfe in his heart, that hee did thoſe things with, not that he meant an abſolute perfect heart, but a ſincere, and comparatively perfect. Hence it's obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the word <hi>I have walked,</hi> is in <hi>Hiphil, I have made my ſelfe to walke;</hi> implying the dulneſſe, and ſluggiſhneſſe, and averſneſſe he found in his heart to that duty: ſo that prayer being, as one calls it well, <hi>Speculum animi,</hi> the ſoules glaſſe, you may gather what was a comfort to him. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. <hi>I have fought a good fight, &amp;c.</hi> It is true, thoſe words, <hi>A crown of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, The juſt Judge,</hi> and <hi>Render,</hi> doe not prove any merits in <hi>Paul,</hi> as the Papiſts plead; but yet <hi>Paul</hi> declareth this, to keep up his heart againſt all diſcouragements. We are not therefore to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65695:29"/>
take comfort from them, ſo as to reſt in them; but ſo as to praiſe God thereby. It's a good way, <hi>neſciendo ſcire,</hi> that ſo wee may praiſe God for them; and, <hi>ſciendo neſcire,</hi> that ſo we may be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in our ſelves.</p>

                  <hi>light ſhine before men.</hi> Hee doth not there encourage vain-glory, but he propounds the true end of our viſible holineſſe; for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, being light, it ought not to be under a buſhell.

Wee ought ſo to walk, that men ſhould glorifie God, who hath made us ſo heavenly, ſo humble, ſo mortified. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaid of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that he did <hi>diligere Chriſtum habitantem in Auguſtino;</hi> ſo ought we to walk, that others may love Chriſt dwelling in us. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. it's an exhortation to wives, ſo to <hi>walke, that their husbands may be won to the Lord.</hi> Thou prayeſt for thy husband in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condition, thou wouldſt have him go heare ſuch a Miniſter, and ſuch Sermons; ſee that thy life alſo may convert him.

                  </gap>, doth imply, 1. the great price that every mans ſoule is worth; 2. the delight that they ought to take in converting of others, even the ſame that merchants doe in their trade.</p>

Becauſe godlineſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent is the end of our faith and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</note> and that is the meaning of our Divines, who ſay, Charity, or Love of God is the end of faith, becauſe God hath appointed this way of juſtification by faith, till he hath brought us into eternall glory, and there we have perfect inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though even then the glory and honour of all that ſhall be given to Chriſt. Now, indeed, it hath pleaſed God to take another way for our acceptation, then ſhall be hereafter; not but that God might, if he had pleaſed, have given us ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace inherent, whereby we might have obtained eternall life, being without ſin, and conformable to his will: but this way hath pleaſed his wiſdome, that ſo Chriſt and Grace may be exalted, and wee for our ſins debaſed in our ſelves. Therefore good is that of <hi>Anſelme, Terret me tota vita mea; namapparet mihi aut peccatum, aut tota ſterilitas:</hi> My whole life terrifieth me, for I ſee nothing but ſin, or barrenneſſe. Only this may make for the excellency of Sanctification, that therefore is Chriſt, and Grace, and Juſtification, and all, that at laſt we may be made perfectly holy.</p>
               <p>Now ſome Divines have gone further, but I cannot goe along with them: As, 1. Thoſe that doe give them cauſality and effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of our juſtification and ſalvation: And, if they ſhould uſe the word <hi>Efficiency</hi> in a large ſenſe, it might be true, but dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: but otherwiſe, to take <hi>Efficient</hi> ſtrictly, they cannot; for ſo was the covenant of works at firſt. <hi>Adams</hi> obedience would not have meritoriouſly, but efficiently procured his happineſſe. Hence, by the Apoſtle, faith is not included as works are rejected, for they are rejected as efficients of our ſalvation; but faith is included as the inſtrumentall and paſſive receiving of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some learned men have ſaid, Though good works doe not merit eternall life, for that is wholly purchaſed by Chriſts death; yet, ſay they, accidentall degrees of glory our godlineſſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65695:30"/>
may obtaine: but that is not ſafe; for, firſt, it's queſtioned by ſome, whether there be ſuch degrees at all, or no; but grant it, yet even that muſt be of grace as well as others.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſome hold our temporall mercies to come to us by a covenant of workes, but not our ſpirituall: this alſo is hard; for, we may have theſe good things either by Chriſt, or elſe by the forbearance of God, who doth not take the advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us for our ſins.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay no more of this, then by anſwering a main doubt.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> If good workes be ſtill neceſſarily requiſite, why then is not the covenant of grace ſtill a covenant of works: not as at firſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> when they were to be perfect and entire; but by grace, pardoning the imperfection of them, in which ſenſe the Arminians affirme it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although good workes be requiſite in the man juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or ſaved, yet it's not a Covenant of workes, but faith: and the reaſon is, becauſe faith only is the inſtrument that receiveth juſtification and eternall life; and good workes are to qualifie the ſubject beleeving, but not the inſtrument to receive the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: ſo that faith onely is the condition that doth receive the covenant, but yet that a man beleeve, is required the change of the whole man; and that faith onely hath ſuch a receiving nature, ſhall be proved hereafter (God willing).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> Of exhortation, to take heed, you turne not the grace of God into licentiouſneſſe: ſuſpect all doctrines that teach com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but not duty; labour indeed to be a ſpirituall Anatomiſt, dividing between having godlineſſe, and truſting in it: but take heed of Separating Sanctification from Juſtification. Be not a Phariſee, nor yet a Publican: ſo that I ſhall exhort thee at this time, not againſt the Antinomianiſme in thy judgement onely, but in thine heart alſo. As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, Every man hath a Pope in his belly; ſo every man an Antinomian. <hi>Paul</hi> found his fleſh rebelling againſt the Law of God, reconcile the Law and the Goſpel, Juſtification and Holineſſe. Follow holineſſe as earneſtly, as if thou hadſt nothing to help thee but that; and yet rely upon Chriſts merits as fully, as if thou hadſt no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe at all. And what though thy intent be onely to ſet up

Chriſt and Grace, yet a corrupted opinion may ſoon corrupt a mans life; as rheume, falling from the head, doth putrefie the lungs, and other vitall parts.</p>

                  <q>Knowing this, that the Law is not made for a righteous man.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>WE are at this time to demoliſh one of the ſtrongeſt holds that the Adverſary hath: For, it may be ſuppoſed, that the eighth <hi>verſe</hi> cannot be ſo much againſt them, as the ninth is for them: therefore <hi>Austin</hi> obſerveth well, <hi>The Apostle</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>joyning two things, as it were contrary, together, doth</hi> monere &amp; movere, <hi>both admoniſh and provoke the Reader to finde out the true anſwer to this question, how both of them can be true.</hi> We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay to theſe places, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did to the two Iſraelites fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Why fall you out, ſeeing you are brethren? Austin</hi> improveth the objection thus, <hi>If the Law be good, when uſed lawfully, and none but the righteous man can uſe it lawfully, how then ſhould it not be but to him, who onely can make the true uſe of it?</hi> Therefore, for the better underſtanding of theſe words, let us conſider, who they are that are ſaid <hi>to know:</hi> and ſecondly, what is ſaid <hi>to be knowne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſubject knowing is here in this Verſe in the ſingular number, in the Verſe before in the plurall: it's therefore doubted, whether this be affirmed of the ſame perſons or no. Some Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors thinke thoſe in the eighth, and theſe in the ninth, are the ſame, and that the Apoſtle doth change the number from the plurall to the ſingular; which is very frequent in Scripture: as, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6. 1. Others (as <hi>Salmeron)</hi> make a myſticall reaſon in the changing, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there are but few that know the Law is not made for the righteous, therefore he ſpeaketh in the ſingular number.</hi> There is a ſecond kind of Interpreters, and they do not make this ſpoken of the ſame, but underſtand this word, as a qualification of him that doth rightly uſe the Law: Thus,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65695:31"/>
                  <hi>The Law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully;</hi> and he uſeth it lawfully, that knoweth it's not made for the righteous. Which of theſe interpretations you take is not much materiall: onely this is good to obſerve, that the Apoſtle, uſing theſe words, <hi>We know,</hi> and <hi>Knowing,</hi> doth imply, what underſtanding all Chriſtians ought to have in the nature of the Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let us conſider, what Law he here ſpeaks of. Some have underſtood it of the ceremoniall Law, becauſe of Chriſts death that was to be aboliſhed, and becauſe all the ceremonies of the Law were convictions of ſinnes, and hand-writings againſt thoſe that uſed them: But this cannot be; for circumciſion was commanded to <hi>Abraham</hi> a righteous man, and ſo to all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Old Teſtament: and the perſons, who are oppoſed to the righteous man, are ſuch, who tranſgreſſe the Morall Law. Others, that do underſtand it of the Morall Law, apply it to the repetition and renovation of it by <hi>Moſes:</hi> for, the Law being at firſt made to <hi>Adam</hi> upon his fall, wickedneſſe by degrees did ariſe to ſuch an height, that <hi>the Law was added becauſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh: But we may underſtand it of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law generally; onely take notice of this, that the Apoſtle doth not here undertake a theologicall handling of the uſe of the Law, (for that he doth in other places) but he brings it in as a generall ſentence to be accommodated to his particular mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning the <hi>righteous man</hi> here. We muſt not interpret it of one abſolutely righteous, but one that is ſo <hi>quoad conatum</hi> and <hi>deſiderium;</hi> for the people of God are called <hi>righteous,</hi> becauſe of the righteouſneſſe that is in them, although they be not juſtified by it. The Antinomian and Papiſt doe both concurre in this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, though upon different grounds, that our righteouſneſs and works are perfect, and therefore do apply thoſe places; <hi>A people without ſpot or wrinkle,</hi> &amp;c. to the people of God in this life, and that not onely in juſtification, but in ſanctification alſo. <hi>As</hi> (ſaith the Antinomian) <hi>in a dark dungeon, when the doore is opened, and the ſun-light come in, though that be dark in it ſelf, yet it is made all light by the ſun:</hi> Or, <hi>As water in a red glaſſe, though that be not red, yet, by reaſon of the glaſſe, it lookes all red: ſo though we be filthy in our ſelves, yet all that God ſeeth in us looks as Chriſts, not onely in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but Sanctification.</hi> This is to be confuted hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:65695:31"/>
Thirdly, let us take notice how the Antinomian explaineth this place, and what he meanes by this Text. The old Antinomian, <hi>Iſlebius Agricola,</hi> ſtates the queſtion thus: <hi>Whether the Law be to a righteous man as a teacher, ruler, commander, and requirer of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence actively:</hi> Or, <hi>Whether the righteous man doth indeed the works of the Law, but that is</hi> paſſivè; <hi>the Law is wrought by him, but the Law doth not work on him.</hi> So then, the queſtion is not, <hi>Whether the things of the Law be done,</hi> (for they ſay the righteous man is active to the Law, and not that to him) but, <hi>Whether, when theſe things are done, they are done by a godly man, admoniſhed, instructed, and commanded by the Law of God:</hi> And this they deny. As for the later Antinomian, he ſpeaketh very uncertainly, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently: Sometimes he grants the Law is a Rule, but very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſeldome; then preſently kicketh all down again: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it cannot be conceived that it ſhould rule, but alſo it ſhould reigne;</hi> and therefore think it impoſſible, that one act of the Law ſhould be without the other. <hi>The damnatory power of the Law is inſeparable from it: Can you put your conſcience under the mandatory power, and yet keep it from the damnatory?</hi> (Aſſertion of Grace <hi>page</hi> 33. Again, the ſame Author, <hi>page 31.) If it be true that the Law cannot condemne, it is no more a Law,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther.</hi> I ſay not that you have dealt as uncourteouſly with the Law, as did that King with <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants, who cut off their garments by the midſt: but you have done worſe, for even, <hi>Joab-</hi>like, under friendly words, you have deſtroyed the life and ſoule of the Law. You can as well take your <hi>Appendices</hi> from the Law, as you terme them, and yet let it remain a true Law; as you can take the brains and heart of a man, and yet leave him a man ſtill. By this it appeareth, that if the Law doth not curſe a man, neither can it command a man, according to their opinion. The ſame Author again, <hi>pag. 5. He dare not truſt a beleever to walk without his keeper [the Law,] as if he judged no otherwiſe of him then of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor in Newgate, who would kill and rob if his Jaylor were not with him: Thus they are onely kept within the compaſſe of the Law, but are not keepers of it.</hi> Yet, at another time, the ſame Author calls it a <hi>ſlander,</hi> to ſay, <hi>that they deny the Law.</hi> Now, who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile theſe contradictions? Nor is this ſhufling and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty any new thing; for the old and firſt Antinomian did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65695:32"/>
times promiſe amendment, and yet afterwards fell to his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour again; after that he condemned his errour, and recanted his errour in a publike Auditory, and printed his revocation, yet, when <hi>Luther</hi> was dead, hee relapſed into that errour: ſo hard a thing it is to get poiſon out, when it's once ſwallowed downe.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place we come to lay downe thoſe things that may cleare the meaning of the Apoſtle: and firſt know, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authors, who yet have acknowledged the help of precepts, doe ſpeak thus much of a righteous man, onely to ſhew this, that <hi>he doth that which is righteous, for love of righteouſneſſe, not for feare of puniſhment:</hi> As <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaid of his love to God, <hi>Amo, quia amo; &amp; amo, ut amem.</hi> Thus <hi>Seneca, Ad Legem eſſe bonum exiguum est:</hi> It's a poore ſmall thing to be good onely according to the law. And ſo <hi>Aristotle, lib. 3. Polit. cap.</hi> 9. ſheweth how a righteous man would be good, though there were no law; as they ſay of a Magiſtrate, he ought to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a living law.</hi> Thus <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid of the Civill Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> And <hi>Plato, Polit.</hi> 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>It is not fit to command or make lawes for thoſe that are good.</hi> Theſe Sayings are not altogether true, yet they have ſome kinde of truth in them. Hence it was that <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> ſaid, <hi>A wiſe man was not bound by any lawes:</hi> And <hi>Demonax</hi> told a Lawyer, that <hi>all their lawes would come to nothing; for good men did not need them, and wicked men would not be the better for them.</hi> And as the Heathens have ſaid thus, ſo the Fathers: <hi>Hierome, What needs the Law ſay to a righteous man,</hi> Thou ſhalt not kill, <hi>to whom it's not permitted to be angry?</hi> Yet we ſee <hi>David,</hi> though a righteous man, needed this precept. But eſpecially <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> even from theſe words, doth wonderfully hyperbolize, <hi>A righteous man needs not the Law, no not teaching or admoniſhing; yea, he diſdaines to be warned by it, he doth not wait or ſtay to learn of it.</hi> As therefore a Muſician or Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian, that hath theſe arts within him, ſcorns the Grammar, or to go to look to the rules; ſo doth a righteous man. Now theſe are but hyperbole's; for what godly man is there, that needs not the Word as a light, that needs it not as a goad? Indeed, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the godly ſhall not need the Law; no more ſhall they the Goſpel, or the whole Word of God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:65695:32"/>
2. There are three interpretations which come very neere one another, and all doe well help to the clearing of the Apoſtle. 1. Some learned men lay an emphaſis in the word <hi>[Made]</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>It is not</hi> made <hi>to a godly man as a burden,</hi> he hath a love and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light <note place="margin">The Law to a godly man is a delight, not a burden.</note> in it; <hi>Lex eſt poſita, ſed non impoſita:</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>Juſti non habent legem, aut ſunt ſine lege; ſed non imminet eis tanquam flagellum,</hi> it's not like a whip to them. The wicked wiſh there were no Law, and cry out as he, <hi>Utinam hoc eſſet non peccare!</hi> The righteous man is rather in the Law, then under it. It's true, the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] in the generall doth ſignifie no more then to <hi>lye,</hi> or <hi>be,</hi> or <hi>is;</hi> therefore, in <hi>Athenaeus, Ulpianus</hi> was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe of his frequent queſtions, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; where ſuch or ſuch a word might be found: but yet ſometimes it ſignifieth <hi>to be laid to a thing, as to deſtroy it;</hi> ſo Matth. 3. 10. <hi>The axe is laid to the root of the tree,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the originall, and ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is for as much as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>poſita</hi> for <hi>oppoſita,</hi> as we ſay <hi>poſitus obex.</hi> Now this is to be underſtood ſo farre forth as he is righteous, otherwiſe the things of God are many times a burden to a godly man. Let us not oppoſe then the works of the Law, and the works of the Spirit, Grace and Goſpel; for the ſame actions are the works of the Law <hi>ratione objecti,</hi> in reſpect of the object; and the works of the Spirit <hi>ratione efficientis,</hi> in reſpect of the efficient. Indeed the Scripture oppoſeth Grace and Works, and Faith and Works, but in a clean other ſenſe then the Antinomian, in time is to be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond interpretation is of the <hi>damnatory</hi> and <hi>curſing</hi> part <note place="margin">The godly are under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of the curſe, but not the actuall condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law.</note> of the Law: <hi>The Law is not made to the beleever ſo, as he ſhould abide under the curſing, and condemning power of it:</hi> and in this ſenſe we are frequently denied to be under the Law. It's true, the godly are under the <hi>deſert of the curſe</hi> of the Law, but not the <hi>actuall curſe,</hi> and condemnation: Nor doth it therefore follow, that there is no Law, becauſe it doth not curſe; for it's a good rule in Divinity, <hi>à remotione actûs ſecundi in ſubjecto impediti, non valet argumentum ad remotionem actûs primi;</hi> from the removall of an act or operation, the argument doth not hold to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the thing it ſelf: as it did not follow, The fire did not burn the three Worthies, therefore there was no fire; God
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65695:33"/>
did hinder the act: And if that could be in naturall agents, which work naturally, how much rather in morall cauſes, ſuch as the Law is of condemnation, which works according to the appointment of God? So then the Law is not to curſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the righteous man.</p>
               <p>The laſt interpretation is, that <hi>the Law was not made becauſe of righteous men, but unrighteous.</hi> Had <hi>Adam</hi> continued in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, <note place="margin">The Law, in the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power thereof, was not made for the righteous, but unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> there had not been ſuch a ſolemne declaration of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law; for it had been graven in their hearts: Therefore, though God gave a poſitive law to <hi>Adam,</hi> for the tryall of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to ſhew his homage; yet he did not give the Morall Law to him by outward preſcript, though it was given to him in another ſenſe: and ſo the phraſe ſhall be like that Proverb, <hi>E malis moribus bonae leges naſcuntur,</hi> Good lawes ariſe from evil manners: And certainly lawes, in the reſtraining and changing power of them upon the lives of men, are not for ſuch who are already holy, but thoſe that need to be made holy; and ſo it may be like that of our Saviour in a ſenſe which ſome explaine it in, <hi>I come not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> By <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> they meane <hi>converſion,</hi> and by the <hi>righteous,</hi> not Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, but <hi>ſuch as are already converted.</hi> Thus <hi>Tacitus Annal. 15. Uſu probatum eſt leges egregias ex aliorum delictis gigni, &amp;c. Nam culpa quam poena, tempore prior; emendari quam peccare poſterius eſt;</hi> excellent Lawes are made, becauſe of other mens delinquencies; The fault goeth before the puniſhment, and ſinne before the amendment.</p>
               <p>Now that theſe interpretations, much agreeing in one, may the better be aſſented to, conſider ſome parallel places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 23. ſpeaking of the fruits of the ſpirit, <hi>Againſt ſuch there is no law;</hi> The Law was not made to theſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, or accuſe them: ſo that what is ſaid of the actions and graces of the godly, may be applyed to the godly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. You may take another parallel, <hi>Rom. 13. 3. Rulers are not a terrour to good works, but to evil:</hi> Wouldſt thou not be afraid of them? doe no evil. And thus the Apoſtle, to ſhew how the grace of love was wrought in the Theſſalonians hearts, <hi>I need not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>write to you to love, for you have been taught of God to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65695:33"/>
doe this:</hi> His very ſaying, <hi>I need not write,</hi> was a writing; ſo that theſe expreſſions doe hold forth no more, then that the godly, ſo farre as they are regenerate, doe delight in the Law of God, and it is not a terrour to them. And if becauſe the godly have an ingenuous free ſpirit to doe what is good, he need not the Law directing or regulating; it would follow as well, he needed not the whole Scripture, he needed not the Goſpel that calls upon him to beleeve, becauſe faith is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in his heart. This rock cannot be avoided: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon this ground, becauſe the godly are made holy in themſelves, the <hi>Swencfeldians</hi> did deny the whole Scripture to be needfull to a man that hath the Spirit: And that which the Antinomian doth limit to the Law, <hi>It is a killing letter,</hi> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the whole Scripture; and I cannot ſee how they can eſcape this argument. Hence <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> that ſpake ſo hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically about the Law, ſpeaks as high about the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>We ought to have the Word of God engraven in our hearts ſo, that there ſhould be no need of Scripture:</hi> And <hi>Austin</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>ſome,</hi> that <hi>had attained to ſuch holineſſe that they lived without a Bible.</hi> Now who doth not ſee what a damnable and dangerous poſition this would be?</p>
               <p>That the Law muſt needs have a directive, regulating, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming power over a godly man, will appeare in theſe two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We cannot diſcerne the true worſhip of God from ſuperstition</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. The true worſhip of God cannot be diſeerned from falſe, but by the Law.</note> 
                  <hi>and idolatry, but by the firſt and ſecond Commandement.</hi> It is true, many places in Scripture ſpeak againſt falſe worſhip, but to know when it is a falſe worſhip, the ſecond Commandement is a ſpeciall director. How do the orthodox Writers prove Images unlawfull? how do they prove that the ſetting up any part or meanes of worſhip which the Lord hath not commanded is unlawfull, but by the ſecond Commandement? And, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the want of exact knowledge in the latitude of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement brought in all idolatry and ſuperſtition. And we ſhall ſhew you (God willing, in time) that the Decalogue is not onely <hi>Moſes</hi> his ten Commandements, but it's Chriſts ten Commandements, and the Apoſtles ten Commandements as well as his.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:65695:34"/>
2. Another inſtance at this time is, in <hi>comparing the depth of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The depth of ſin cannot be diſcovered without it.</note> 
                  <hi>the Law, and the depth of our ſinne together.</hi> There is a great deale more ſpirituall excellency and holineſſe commanded in the Law of God, the Decalogue, then we can reach unto: Therefore we are to ſtudy into it more and more: <hi>Open mine eyes, that I may understand the wonderfull things of thy Law;</hi> thus <hi>David</hi> prayeth, though godly, and his eyes were in a great meaſure opened by the Spirit of God. And as there is a depth in the Law, ſo a depth in our originall and native ſin: There is a great deale more filth in us, then we can or doe diſcover, <hi>Pſal. 19. Who can underſtand his errours? Cleanſe me from ſecret ſins.</hi> Therefore, there being ſuch a world of filth in thy carnall heart, what need is there of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and holy Law, to make thee ſee thy ſelf thus polluted and abominable? Certainly, a godly man groweth partly by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering that pride, that deadneſſe, that filth in his ſoule he never thought of, or was acquainted with.</p>
               <p>The practicall uſe that is to be made of this Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, is, to pray and labour for ſuch a free heavenly heart, that the Law of God, and all the precepts of it may not be a terrour to you, but ſweetneſſe and delight. <hi>Oh how I love thy Law!</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>David;</hi> he could not expreſſe it. And again, <hi>My ſoul break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the longing after thy judgements.</hi> In another place, he and <hi>Job</hi> do account of them above their neceſſary food; you do not hale and drag an hungry or thirſty man to his bread and water: I doe not ſpeak this, but that it's lawfull to eye the reward, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt did; yea, and to fear God: for who can think that the Scripture, uſing theſe motives, would ſtirre up in us ſinfull and unlawfull affections? but yet ſuch ought to be the filiall and ſon-like affections to God and his will, that we ought to love and delight in his Commandements, becauſe they are his; as the poore ſon loveth his father, though he hath no lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or rich inheritance to give him.</p>
               <p>There is this difference between a free and violent motion: a free motion is that which is done for its own ſelfe ſake; a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent is that which cometh from an outward principle, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent helping it not forward at all: Let not, to pray, to beleeve, to love God, be violent motions in you. Where faith worketh by love, this maketh all duties reliſh, thsi overcometh all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65695:34"/>
The Lacedemonians, when they went to war, did ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Love, becauſe love only could make hardſhip, and wounds, and death it ſelfe eaſie. Doe thou therefore pray, that the <hi>love of God may be ſhed abroad in thine heart;</hi> and conſider theſe two things: 1. How the Law laid upon Chriſt to dye, and ſuffer for thee, was not a burthen or terrour to him. How doth he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this by crying out, <hi>With deſire I have deſired to drink of this cup?</hi> Think with thy ſelf, If Chriſt had been as unwilling to die for me, as I to pray to him, to be patient, to be holy, what had become of my ſoule? If Chriſt therefore ſaid of that Law, to be a Mediatour for thee, <hi>Lo, I come to doe thy will, O God, thy Law is within mine heart;</hi> how much rather ought this to be true of thee in any thing thou ſhalt doe for him? Thou haſt not ſo much to part with for him, as he for thee. What is thy life and wealth to the glory of his God-head, which was laid aſide for a while? And then ſecondly, conſider how that men love luſts for luſts ſake, they love the world becauſe of the world. Now evill is not ſo much evill, as good is good; ſin is not ſo much ſin, as God is God, and Chriſt is Chriſt. If therefore a profane man, becauſe of his carnall heart, can love his ſin, though it coſt him hell, becauſe of the ſweetneſſe in it; ſhall not the godly heart love the things of God, becauſe of the excellency in them? But theſe things may be more enlarged in another place.</p>

               <p>BEfore I handle the other places of Scripture that are brought by the Antinomians againſt the Law, it is my intent, for better methods ſake, and your more ſound inſtruction, to handle
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65695:35"/>
the whole Theology of the Law of God in the ſeverall diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, and that poſitively, controverſally, and practically; and I ſhall begin firſt with the <hi>law of Nature,</hi> that God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in us, and conſider of this two waies: 1. <hi>As it is a meere law;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>As it was a covenant of works made with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> And then in time I ſhall ſpeak of the <hi>Morall Law</hi> given <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is the proper ſubject of theſe controverſies.</p>
               <p>The Text I have read is a golden Mine, and deſerveth dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent digging and ſearching into: Therefore, for the better underſtanding of theſe words, let us anſwer theſe Queſtions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Who are meant by the Gentiles here?</hi> It is ordinarily known, <note place="margin">Who meant by <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </note> that the Jewes did call all thoſe Gentiles that were not Jewes, by way of contempt; as the Greeks and Romans called all other nations Barbarians. Hence ſometimes in the Scripture the word is applyed to wicked men, though Jewes: as, <hi>Pſal. 2. Why doe the heathen rage?</hi> It may be interpreted of the Phariſees reſiſting Chriſt. Indeed, the Jewes will not confeſſe, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Gentes,</hi> is any where applyed to them: but this is very falſe, for <hi>Geneſ. 17. Abraham</hi> is there ſaid to be <hi>the father of many nations,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Gentes:)</hi> therefore they muſt either deny themſelves to be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, or elſe acknowledge this word belonging to them. But generally it ſignifieth thoſe that had not the Lawes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor did live by them. Therefore <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 14. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to live like a Gentile,</hi> is, not to obſerve the Lawes of <hi>Moſes:</hi> and in this ſenſe it is to be taken here; for the Apoſtles ſcope is to make good that great charge upon all mankinde, both Jew and Gentile, that naturally they are wholly in ſin; and God, being no accepter of perſons, will deſtroy the one as well as the other. And whereas it might be thought very hard to deale thus with the Gentile, becauſe no law was delivered unto him, as unto the Jew, the Apoſtle anſwereth that Objection in this place. But grant it be underſtood of ſuch Gentiles, then there is a greater Queſtion whether it be meant of the Gentiles abiding ſo, or the Gentiles converted and turned beleevers; for, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch, moſt of the Latine Interpreters, both ancient and modern, doe affirme: and ſo the Greek Father, <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> and <hi>Eſtius,</hi> a learned Papiſt, doe think there are ſo many arguments for it, that it's certaine. I confeſſe, they bring many probable
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65695:35"/>
reaſons; but I will not trouble you with them: this ſeemeth a ſtrong argument againſt them, becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch who are <hi>without a law, and a law to themſelves,</hi> which could not be true of Gentiles converted: we take the Apoſtle therefore to ſpeak of Gentiles abiding ſo; but in this ſenſe there is alſo a dangerous expoſition and a ſound one. The poyſonous interpretation is of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who underſtand the law written in their hearts, in the ſame ſenſe as it is uſed, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 33. even ſuch a fulfilling of the law which will attaine to ſalvation; and this they hold the Heathens by the law and help of nature did ſufficiently: But this is to overthrow the doctrine of Grace and Chriſt. Therefore the ſound interpretation is of the Gentiles indeed, but yet to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the law written in their hearts, onely of thoſe relicts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon and conſcience, which was in the Heathens, as is to be proved anon.</p>
               <p>The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Queſtion is eaſily anſwered, <hi>How they are ſaid to be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How the Gentiles are ſaid to be without a Law.</note> 
                  <hi>without a law;</hi> to wit, without a written law, as the Jewes had; ſo that we may ſay, they had a law without a law; a law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but not declared.</p>
               <p>The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Queſtion, <hi>In what ſenſe they are ſaid to doe the things of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How ſaid to do the things of the Law by nature.</note> 
                  <hi>the law, and that by nature.</hi> To doe the things of the law is not meant univerſally of all the Heathens, for the Apoſtle ſhewed how moſt of them lived in the Chapter before: nor ſecondly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally in regard of the matter contained in the law, but ſome externall acts, as <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> with others. And here it's diſputed, <hi>Whether a meere Heathen can doe any work morally good?</hi> But wee anſwer, No: for every action ought to have a ſupernaturall end, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of God, which they did not aime at; therefore we do refuſe that diſtinction of a <hi>morall good,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Morall</hi> and <hi>Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call good</hi> reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> and <hi>theologicall,</hi> becauſe every morall good ought to be theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall: they may do that good matter of the law, though not well. And as for the manner how, <hi>by nature;</hi> thoſe Interpreters that underſtand this Text of Gentiles beleevers, ſay, <hi>Nature</hi> is not here oppoſed to Grace, but to the law written by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and therefore make it nature enabled by grace: but this is ſhewed to be improbable. By <hi>nature</hi> therefore we may underſtand that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <note place="margin">What is here meant by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  </note> light of conſcience, whereby they judged and performed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65695:36"/>
ſome externall acts, though theſe were done by the help of God.</p>
               <p>The next Queſtion is, <hi>How this Law is ſaid to be written in their hearts?</hi> You muſt not, with <hi>Auſtine,</hi> compare this place with that gracious promiſe in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> of God writing his law in the hearts of his people. There is therefore a two-fold <hi>writing in the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A two-fold writing of the Law in mens hearts, and which here meant.</note> 
                  <hi>hearts of men;</hi> the firſt, of knowledge and judgement, whereby they apprehend what is good and bad: the ſecond is in the will and affections, by giving a propenfity and delight, with ſome meaſure of ſtrength, to do this upon good grounds. This later is ſpoken of by the Prophet in the covenant of Grace, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is to be underſtood here, as will appeare, if you compare this with <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
               <p>The laſt Queſtion is, <hi>How they declare this Law written in their</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in mens hearts two waies.</note> 
                  <hi>hearts?</hi> And that is firſt <hi>externally,</hi> two waies: 1. By making good and wholeſome lawes to govern men by; and 2. By their practice, at leaſt of ſome of them, according to thoſe lawes: And ſecondly <hi>internally,</hi> by their conſciences, in the comfort or feare they had there.</p>
               <p>Obſervat. <hi>There is a law of Nature written in mens hearts.</hi> And if this be not aboliſhed, but that a beleever is bound to follow the direction and obligation of it, how can the Antinomian think that the Morall Law, in reſpect of the mandatory power of it, ceaſeth? Now, becauſe I intend a methodicall Tractate of the ſeverall kindes of Gods Law, you might expect I ſhould ſay much about Lawes in generall; but becauſe many have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten large Volumes, eſpecially the School-men, and it cannot be denyed but that good rationall matter is delivered by them; yet, becauſe it would not be ſo pertinent to my ſcope, I forbeare. I will not therefore examine the Etymology of the words that ſignifie a <hi>Law;</hi> whether <hi>Lex</hi> in the Latine come of <hi>legendo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was written to be read (though that be not alwaies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;) or of <hi>ligando,</hi> becauſe a law binds to obedience; or of <hi>deligendo,</hi> becauſe it ſelects ſome precepts: nor concerning <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Greek, whether it come of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is improbable; or of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe it diſtributes to every one that which is right: neither the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſome make to

come of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>to instruct and teach;</hi> others of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that ſignifieth <hi>a diſpoſition, or compiling of things together</hi> as lawes uſe to be. In the next place, I will not trouble you with the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a law, whether it be an act, or habit, or the ſoul it ſelfe: onely this is good to take notice of, againſt a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall errour of the Antinomian, about a law in generall; for they conceive it impoſſible but that the damning act of a law muſt be where the commanding act of a law is, and this is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently urged (as I ſhewed the laſt time:) Therefore obſerve, that there are only two things goe to <hi>the eſſence of a law,</hi> (I ſpeak not of externall cauſes) and that is, firſt, <hi>Direction,</hi> ſecondly, <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation: 1. Direction,</hi> therefore a law is a rule; hence the law of God is compared to a light. And, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 27. there is a notable expreſſion of the law of Nature, <hi>It's a candle of the Lord, ſearching the inwards of the belly.</hi> So it is obſerved, that the Chaldee word for a law, is as much as <hi>light.</hi> The ſecond eſſentiall conſtitute of a law is, <hi>Obligation,</hi> for therein lyeth the eſſence of a ſinne, that it breaketh this law, which ſuppoſeth the obligatory force of it. In the next place there are two Conſequents of the Law which are <hi>ad bene eſſe,</hi> that the Law may be the better obeyed; and this indeed turneth the law into a covenant, which is another notion upon it, as afterwards is to be ſhewn. Now as for the ſanction of the law by way of a promiſe, that is a meere free thing; God, by reaſon of that dominion which he had over man, might have commanded his obedience, and yet never have made a promiſe of eternall life unto him. And as for the other conſequent act of the law, to curſe, and puniſh, this is but an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall act, and not neceſſary to a law; for it cometh in upon ſuppoſition of trangreſſion: and therefore, as we may ſay of a Magiſtrate, He was a juſt and compleat Magiſtrate for his time, though he put forth no punitive juſtice, if there be no malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors offending; ſo it is about a law, a law is a compleat law ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieging, though it do not actually curſe: as in the confirmed Angels, it never had any more then obligatory, and mandatory acts upon them; for that they were under a law is plaine, becauſe otherwiſe they could not have ſinned, <hi>for where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> If therefore the Antinomian were recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 15.</note> in this principle, which is very true and plain, he would
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65695:37"/>
quickly be ſatisfied: but of this more in another place. But wee come to the particulars of the doctrine, the preſſing of which will ſerve much againſt the Antinomian. Therefore, for the better underſtanding of this <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> conſider theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The nature of it in which it doth conſiſt,</hi> and that is in thoſe common notions and maximes, which are ingraffed in all mens <note place="margin">The Law of Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in thoſe common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are ingraffed in all mens hearts.</note> hearts: and theſe are ſome of them ſpeculative, that there is a God; and ſome practicall, that good is to be imbraced, and evill to be avoided: and therefore <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith well, that <hi>what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Sciences are in things of demonſtration, the ſame are theſe rules of nature in practicals:</hi> therefore we cannot give any reaſons of them; but, as the Sun manifeſts it ſelfe by its owne light, ſo doe theſe. Hence <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerveth well, that God, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding murder, and other ſins, giveth no reaſon of it, becauſe it's naturall: but, ſpeaking of the ſeventh day, why that in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar was to be obſerved, he giveth a reaſon, becauſe on the ſeventh day the Lord reſted, not but that the ſeventh day is morall, (as ſome have denyed.) but becauſe it's not morall naturall, onely morall poſitive, as the Learned ſhew.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The difference of its being in Adam and in us.</hi> This is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <note place="margin">Some frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments onely of this Law left in us.</note> to obſerve; for it was perfectly implanted in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, but we have onely ſome fragments, and a meere ſhadow of it left in us. The whole Law of Nature, as it was perfectly inſtructing us the will of God, was then communicated to him: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God, for good reaſons hereafter to be mentioned, did give, beſides that law of Nature, a poſitive law to try his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet the other cannot be denyed to be in him, ſeeing he was made after Gods image, in righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, and otherwiſe <hi>Adam</hi> had been deſtitute of the light of reaſon, and without a conſcience. Therefore it's a moſt impudent thing in <hi>Socinus,</hi> to deny that <hi>Adam</hi> had any ſuch law or precept, and that hee could not lye, or commit any other ſin though hee would; for, it may not be doubted, but that if <hi>Adam</hi> had told a lye, or the like, it had been a ſin, as well as to eate of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden <note place="margin">Thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions, in which this law conſiſts, are in us by nature.</note> fruit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The naturall impreſſion of it in us.</hi> We have it by nature; it's not a ſuperadded work of God to put this into us. This aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65695:37"/>
is much oppoſed by <hi>Flaccus Illyricus,</hi> who, out of his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſire to aggravate originall ſin in us, and to ſhew how deſtitute we are of the image of God, doth labour to ſhew, that thoſe common notions and dictates of conſcience are infuſed <hi>de novo</hi> into us, and that wee have none of theſe by nature in us. And a godly man, in his Book of <hi>Temptations,</hi> holdeth the ſame opinion. <hi>Illyricus</hi> indeed hath many probable arguments for his opinion, but he goeth upon a falſe ſuppoſition, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle his ſcope is, to compare a Gentile ſuppoſed onely to doe the Law, and not aſſerted to doe it, before a Jew who was an hearer of the Law, but not a doer of it: therefore, to debaſe the Jew, he ſaith, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh conditionally, to this purpoſe, <hi>If an Heathen ſhould keep the Law, though he be not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, yet he would be preferred before you; not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Apostle meaneth aſſertively and poſitively that any ſuch doe:</hi> and therefore preſſeth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is a particle of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive Mood, and is equivalent to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>If the Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi> But his ſuppoſition is falſe; for the Apoſtle's ſcope is, to ſhew that the Gentile hath no excuſe if God condemne him, becauſe hee hath a law in himſelfe: as appeareth, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. As for the other conſideration of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, though <hi>Eraſmus</hi> render it <hi>[cum fecerint;]</hi> yet that particle is applied to the Indicative Mood, as well as the Subjunctive. It cannot therefore be true, which hee ſaith, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh ſuch great things of men by nature, that if they were true, it would neceſſarily juſtifie all Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme. I ſhall not ſpeak of his many arguments againſt naturall principles and knowledge of a God; for he doth in effect at laſt yeeld to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The extent of it.</hi> And here it's very hard to meaſure out the bounds of the law of Nature; for, ſome have judged that to be condemned by the law of Nature, which others have thought the law of Nature approveth: ſo true is that of <hi>Tertullian, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem Naturae opiniones ſuas vocant, They call their opinions the law of Nature.</hi> There are foure waies of bounding this law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Some make it thoſe generall things, wherein man and beaſt agree;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Foure bounds of the law of Nature.</note> as, defence of it ſelf, and deſire of life: but by this meanes, that of naturall honeſty and righteouſneſſe would be excluded; for, a beaſt is not capable of any ſin, or obligation by a law. And
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65695:38"/>
howſoever that be much diſputed upon, <hi>Why God would have the beaſt killed that killed a man;</hi> yet, to omit the thoughts of many about it, that was not becauſe a beaſt could be tyed by a law: but God, to ſhew the horridneſſe of the fact, would have the very inſtrument puniſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Some bound it by the custome of Nations,</hi> that is, <hi>jus Gentium;</hi> but that is ſo diverſified, that a ſin with ſome was a vertue with others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Some doe bind it by reaſon in every man:</hi> but this is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and one mans reaſon is contrary to anothers, and one mans conſcience is larger then anothers; even as it is with mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in divers countries, though they have the ſame name, as a buſhell, &amp;c. yet they are different in quantity, one is larger then another.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Others bound it by the will of God, declared and manifeſted firſt to</hi> Noah <hi>in ſeven precepts, and afterwards to</hi> Moſes <hi>in the ten Commandements:</hi> but theſe extend the law of Nature not onely to firſt principles, but concluſions alſo deduced from thence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The obligation of it, when the law of Nature doth bind:</hi> And <note place="margin">The obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the law of Nature is from God.</note> that is from God the authour of it, God onely is under no law. Every beleever, though juſtified by Chriſt, is under the Morall Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as alſo the law of Nature: but now this law of Nature doth not ſo properly bind, as it's mans reaſon or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as that it is the Vicegerent of God, or a command from him: and thus <hi>Cain</hi> by the law of Nature found a tye upon him not to ſin, and guilt becauſe he did ſin in murdering his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although there was no Morall Law as yet given. It is true, indeed, our Divines doe well reprove the Papiſts, for calling all that time from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> a ſtate, or law of Nature: and this the Papiſts doe, that therefore to offer ſacrifice unto God may be proved from the law of Nature; whereas thoſe ſacrifices, being done in faith, had the word of God, otherwiſe we were bound ſtill to offer Lambs or Kids to God, which they deny.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The perpetuity of this obligation.</hi> This Law can never be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated. <note place="margin">The obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the law of nature is perpetual and immutable.</note> And herein we may demand of the Antinomian, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the law of Nature doe bind a beleever, or no? Whether he be bound to obey the dictates of his naturall conſcience? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a beleever hath his naturall conſcience dictating to him,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65695:38"/>
This ſin he may not doe; is he not obliged hereunto not onely from the matter (for that he grants,) but as it is a law and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God implanted in his ſoule? I know there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the law of Nature, and the ten Commandements, as may be ſhewed hereafter; but yet they agree in this, that they are a rule immutable, and of perpetuall obligation. Therefore think not, that becauſe he dyed to free you from the curſe of the Law, that therefore you are freed from the obedience unto the law naturall, or delivered by <hi>Moſes.</hi> To deny this, is to deny that a beleever is bound to obey the ſure dictates of a naturall conſcience. I know we are not alwayes bound to follow what conſcience ſuggeſts, for that is obſcured and darkened; but I ſpeak of thoſe dictates which are naturally known.</p>
               <p>Other particulars, as, <hi>The inſufficiency of it to direct in worſhip,</hi> as alſo, <hi>to ſave men,</hi> I do put off, and make application of what hath been delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Of <hi>Instruction,</hi> againſt the Antinomian, who muſt needs overthrow the directive and obligative force of the law of Nature, as well as that of <hi>Moſes; Doth not even Nature teach you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle?) Now if a man may not care for <hi>Moſes</hi> teaching, need he care for Nature teaching? It is true (I told you) ſometimes they grant the Law to be a rule, but then afterwards they ſpeak ſuch things as are abſolutely inconſiſtent with it.</p>
               <p>There were ſome (as <hi>Wendelinus</hi> reports) <hi>Swencfeldians,</hi> that held a man was never truly mortified, till he had put out all ſenſe of conſcience for ſinne; if his conſcience troubled him, that was his imperfection, he was not mortified enough. I ſhould doe the Antinomians wrong, if I ſhould ſay, they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch things in their books; but let them conſider, whether ſome of their Poſitions will not carry them neere ſuch a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rock: For, if the Law have nothing to doe with me in reſpect of the mandatory part of it, then if I be troubled for the breach of it, it is my weakneſſe, becauſe I am not enough in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Of <hi>Reproofe,</hi> to thoſe who live againſt this Law. Sins that are againſt the Law of Nature do moſt terrifie. How many
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65695:39"/>
live in ſuch ſins that the law of Nature condemneth? Doth not Nature condemne lying, couzening in your trades, luſts, and uncleanneſſe? How many Tradeſ-men are there that need not a <hi>Paul?</hi> Even <hi>Tully</hi> in his Book of <hi>Offices</hi> will condemne their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſophiſticate wares, and unlawfull gain. It's much how farre they ſaw this way. Sinnes againſt naturall conſcience are called <hi>Crying ſinnes;</hi> and, though men have repented of them, yet how long is it ere faith can ſtill their cry? Have not many Heathens been faithfull and juſt in their dealings? It's true, that man hath not godlineſſe, who hath only naturall honeſty; therefore there are many ſpirituall ſinnes that he never humbleth himſelf for: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he <hi>knew not the motions of his heart to be ſinne.</hi> Hence men are to be exhorted to get further light, and more tenderneſſe then a naturall conſcience can ever attain unto. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, if men ſo live, as if they had not this Law in their hearts, they are the more inexcuſable: Are there not men who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, that yet the very Heathens will condemne at that great day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Why it is ſo hard to beleeve in the Lord Chriſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here is nothing of nature in it, it's all ſupernaturall. The Papiſts ſay, we make an eaſie way to heaven; for, let a man be never ſo great a ſinner, yet if he doe but beleeve, all is well. Now the people of God, ſenſible of their ſin, find nothing harder for, it's in the law of Nature they ſhould not lye, or ſteale, but that they ſhould beleeve in Chriſt for pardon, when labouring under their offences, here nature doth not help at all. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it's a diſpute among Divines, <hi>Whether in that law implanted in</hi> Adams <hi>heart, there was not alſo a power to beleeve in Christ, when revealed?</hi> But of that hereafter; but the orthodox deny, that he had explicite juſtifying faith, for that was repugnant to the condition he was in. But the thing I intend is, to ſhew how ſupernaturall and hidden the way of beleeving is. No marvell therefore if it be made ſuch a peculiar work of the Spirit, to convince of this ſinne.</p>

               <p>THe Doctrine already gathered from theſe words is, that, <hi>The Gentiles have a law of Nature written in their hearts:</hi> Which law doth conſiſt partly in light and knowledge of ſpeculative principles; and partly in practice and obedience to practicall principles. So then from hence we may conſider, firſt, <hi>Of the light of Nature,</hi> and then ſecondly, <hi>Of the power of Nature;</hi> and from both theſe we may have profitable matter, and alſo may confute ſome dangerous errours, which have poiſoned too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I ſhall begin therefore with <hi>the light of Nature,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and ſhall endeavour to ſhew the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of it, and yet the <hi>Inſufficiency</hi> of it: It is not ſuch a ſtarre that can lead us to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place take notice, that this <hi>light of Nature</hi> may be conſidered in a three-fold reſpect:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>As it's a relict or remnant of the image of God:</hi> for, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <note place="margin">The light of Nature is a remnant of Gods image.</note> the image of God did primarily conſiſt in righteouſneſs and true holineſſe; yet ſecondarily it did alſo comprehend the powers and faculties of the reaſonable ſoule in the acts thereof: And this later part abideth. It is true, this <hi>light of Nature,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively to that <hi>of faith,</hi> is but as a glow-worme to the Sun; yet ſome light and irradiation it hath. God, when he made man, had ſo excellently wrought his owne image in him, that man could not fall, unleſſe that were alſo deſtroyed; as they write of <hi>Phidias,</hi> who made <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſtatue, yet had wrought his own picture ſo artificially in it, that none could break <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but he muſt alſo ſpoile <hi>Phidias</hi> his image, who was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of it: And thus it is in <hi>Adams</hi> fall, yet there remaineth ſome
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65695:40"/>
light ſtill, which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>(Rom. 1.) Truth;</hi> he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth that name to it, <hi>They detain the</hi> truth <hi>in unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> Now this moon-light or glimmering of Nature is of a three-fold uſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For ſocieties and publike Common-wealths, whereby they have</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. The light of Nature uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the making of wholſome lawes in Common-wealths.</note> 
                  <hi>made wholſome lawes.</hi> It's wonderfull to conſider, how excellent the Heathens have been therein. Thus <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> ſpeaking how the moſt excellent men need the counſell of others, inſtanceth in <hi>Jethro</hi>'s advice to <hi>Moſes,</hi> about chooſing aſſiſtant officers: <hi>That great man</hi> Moſes (ſaith he) <hi>who was ſo potent in words and workes, who was the friend of God, which commanded the creatures, was helped incounſell by</hi> Jethro <hi>his father-in-law, an obſcure man, and a Barbarian:</hi> Although, to ſpeak the truth, <hi>Jethro,</hi> when he gave this counſell, was not ſo, but had the knowledge of the true God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This light of nature ſerveth for the inſtigation and provocation</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. It inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to good duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man.</note> 
                  <hi>of men to many good actions and duties towards God and man.</hi> Hence ſtill obſerve that phraſe, <hi>They detain:</hi> reaſon and naturall light is bound, as a priſoner, by the chaines of luſts and ſinfull af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; which thing <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth fully ſet forth in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent perſon, whom he deſcribeth to have a right opinion in the generall about that which is good; yet, being too much affected to ſome particular pleaſure or profit, by that meanes the better part is over-born: and therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, the better part of the minde did provoke to better things. This agreeth with that of <hi>Paul.</hi> And as they bound captivated practicall truths towards man, ſo they alſo impriſoned them about God. <hi>Plato</hi> had the knowledge of one God, yet he dared not to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to the vulgar: Therefore (ſaith he) <hi>Opificem univerſorum ne<expan>

Here for feare of the people, he detained this truth. And <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath a moſt excellent chapter, <hi>cap. 10. lib. 6. de Civit.</hi> to ſhew how <hi>Seneca kept the truth in unrighteouſneſſe:</hi> he ſpeaks of a Book <hi>Seneca</hi> wrote (which now is loſt) againſt Superſtitions, where he doth moſt freely and boldly write againſt the practices of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but, ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> He had liberty in his writing, but not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65695:40"/>
in his life, <hi>Libertas affuit ſcribenti, non viventi.</hi> I will name ſome paſſages, becauſe they are applicable to Popiſh Idolatry, as well as Paganiſh. They dedicate their gods in moſt baſe materialls, and call them gods, which if taking life, they ſhould meet us on a ſudden, we ſhould judge them monſters. They doe things ſo unſeemly grave men, ſo unworthy free-men, ſo unlike wiſe ſound men, that no man would doubt but that they were mad, if there were but few of them, whereas now the multitude of thoſe that are thus mad is a patronage to them; <hi>Immortales deos in materia viliſſima &amp; immobili dedicant—Numina vocant, quae ſi ſpiritu ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepto ſubitò occurrerent, monſtra haberentur—Faciunt tam indecor a honeſtis, tam indigna liberis, tam diſſimillima ſanis, ut nemo fuerit dubitaturus furere eos, ſi cum paucioribus furerent; nunc ſanitatis patrocinium est inſanientium turba.</hi> But <hi>Seneca,</hi> when he had ſpoken thus, and much more, in the ſcorn of thoſe gods, what doth he reſolve upon that his wiſe man ſhall doe in thoſe times? Let him not religiouſly account of them in his minde, but feigne them in his outward acts, <hi>In animi religione non habeat, ſed in actibus fingat.</hi> And again, All which things a wiſe man will obſerve, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Law, not as acceptable to God, <hi>Quae omnia ſapiens ſer vabit tanquam legibus juſſa, non diis grata.</hi> And further, <hi>Iſtam ignobilem deorum turbam, quam longo aevo longa ſuperstitio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſit, ſic adorabimus, ut meminerimus cultum ejus ad morem magis pertinere quam rem.</hi> Some ſay, <hi>Seneca</hi> was coetaneous with <hi>Paul,</hi> and that he had <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles; might he not (if ſo) ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſcribed in this phraſe, <hi>detaining the truth in unrighteouſneſſe?</hi> But how well doth <hi>Auſtin</hi> in the ſame place ſtigmatize him? He worſhipped, what he reproved; did, what he argued againſt; adored, what he blamed; <hi>Colebat, quod reprehendebat; agebat, quod arguebat; quod culpabat, adorabat.</hi> And are there not many ſuch Popiſh ſpirits, that know their ſuperſtitions and falſhoods, yet, becauſe of long cuſtome, will not leave them? What elſe was the meaning of <hi>Domitianus Calderinus,</hi> when, ſpeaking of going to Maſſe, he ſaid, <hi>Eamus ad communem errorem?</hi> And ſo it was a ſpeech of a diſputing Sophiſter, <hi>Sic dico quando ſum in ſcholis, ſed, penes nos ſit, aliter ſentio.</hi> You ſee then by this, that naturall truth would encline to better actions, but it is ſuppreſſed. When I ſay, <hi>naturall light</hi> enclineth the heart to good, it is to be underſtood
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65695:41"/>
by way of object meerly, ſhewing what is to be deſired, not that we have any ſtrength naturally to what is good. If you aske why truth, apprehended by naturall light, ſhould be leſſe efficacious to alter and new-mould the heart and life, then truth received by faith (for in the Scripture we reade of wonderfull converſions; and the Heathens have but one ſtory that they much boaſt of, of one <hi>Palemon</hi> (if I miſtake not) who was a great drunkard, and came to deride <hi>Socrates,</hi> while he was reading his diſcourſe to his ſcholars, but was ſo changed by that lecture, that he left off his drunkenneſſe: This alteration was only in the skin, and not in the vitalls. What then ſhould be the difference?) I anſwer, not that one truth in it ſelfe is ſtronger then another, but the difference is <hi>in medio,</hi> or <hi>instrumento,</hi> the inſtrument to receive this truth. When Nature receives a truth, it's but with a dimme eye, and a palſie-hand; but when we receive it by faith, that is accompanyed with the power and might of the holy Ghoſt. The influence of truth by naturall light, is like that of the Moon, wateriſh and weak, never able to ripen any thing; but that of faith is like the influence of the Sun, that doth heat, and ſoon bring to maturity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt uſe of this <hi>naturall light</hi> is, <hi>to make men inexcuſable;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. It makes men inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> for, ſeeing they did not glorifie God according to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for that they are juſtly condemned. This indeed is not the onely uſe of the <hi>light of Nature,</hi> as ſome ſay; but it is a main one, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. not that this is the end of God, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe principles into us, but it falleth out by our ſinfulneſs. But how are they <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> if they could not glorifie God by nature, as they ought? Some anſwer, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe in regard of knowledge:</hi> but if you underſtand it <hi>of power,</hi> it is true; for by our fault we are unable, and none went ſo farre as naturally they were able. And thus Nature is conſidered in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>You may conſider it as corrupted and obſcured by ſin:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The light of Nature, as corrupted by ſin, is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God and goodnes.</note> And in this ſenſe it's no help, but a deſperate enemy to what is good: and the more reaſon this way, the more oppoſition to God: and thus it fell out with all the great naturall Luminiſts; they became vain in their reaſonings, the more they enquired and ſearched, the further off they were from what is true, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65695:41"/>
                  <hi>The naturall man perceiveth not the things of God:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is not a man carnall and groſſe in ſinne, but a ſouly man, one that doth <hi>excolere animam,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Now the wiſer theſe men were, the vainer they were. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s compariſon doth well agree with them: <hi>As if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a king ſhould give much money to a ſervant that by it he ſhould make his family more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and he goeth preſently and ſpends all his money upon whores and bawds.</hi> Thus did the Heathens: As <hi>Auſtin</hi> wrote to a man of great parts, <hi>Ornari abs te Diabolus quaerit,</hi> The Divell ſeeks to be adorned by thee.</p>
               <p>Hence Egypt, that is accounted the mother of Sciences, and <hi>Moſes</hi> in regard of knowledge is preferred before the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; yet that was the ſeat alſo of Idolaters: and ſo the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers, who lifted up themſelves above others in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of heavenly things, brought in thoſe monſters into heaven, and attributed worſhip to them, and in their worſhip of their gods they added many feaſts and ſports. Thus they invented an happineſſe, which <hi>Auſtin</hi> calleth <hi>Scyllaeum bonum,</hi> conſiſting of humane and brutiſh parts. If you aske how this <hi>naturall light</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The light of Nature ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured three wayes.</note> cometh to be thus <hi>obſcured;</hi> I anſwer, three waies: 1. <hi>By ill education.</hi> This is like the firſt concoction, or the firſt ſettling of the limbs of a man. Secondly, <hi>By long cuſtome and degeneration.</hi> Hence ſome Nations have by their publike lawes allowed groſſe ſins lawfull; as ſome Nations have allowed robberies, ſome inceſt, ſome that all old men ſhould be thrown down headlong a ſteep hill. Thirdly, <hi>By the juſt judgement of God;</hi> therefore three times in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. God is ſaid to <hi>give them up to ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>You may ſpeak of Nature as informed, and enlightened</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The light of Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by Gods Word an excellent help.</note> 
                  <hi>by Gods Word:</hi> and while it's thus, you need not caſt this <hi>Hagar</hi> out of doores. Let Scripture and the Word of God lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ſtone, and then Reaſon may build upon it. It is <hi>Stella</hi> his compariſon: <hi>It is with Faith and Reaſon, as with the mould that is at the root of the barren and fruitleſſe tree; take the mould out, and throw in muck or other compoſt, and then put the mould in, it will much help the tree, which hindered it before.</hi> Thus, lay aſide Reaſon at firſt, and then receive truths by Faith; and afterwards im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them by Reaſon, and it will excellently help. Divine truths are not founded upon Reaſon, but Scripture; yet Reaſon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65695:42"/>
may bear them up: as you ſee the elme or wall bear up the vine, but the elme or wall doth not bring forth the fruit; onely the vine doth that. As long therefore as the light of Nature is not the rule, but ruled and ſquared by Gods Word, ſo long it cannot deceive us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond grand conſideration is, <hi>That the light of Nature is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The light of Nature, as it is a relict of Gods image is neceſſary in religious and morall things, and that two wayes.</note> 
                  <hi>neceſſary in religious and morall things, though it be not ſufficient.</hi> We ſpeak of the light of Nature in the firſt conſideration, as it is the reſidue of the glorious image of God put into us (for of the later, as it is informed by Scripture, it is no queſtion.) Now this is abſolutely neceſſary two wayes: 1. As a paſſive qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubject for faith; for, there cannot be faith in a ſtone, or in a beaſt, no more then there can be ſin in them: Therefore Reaſon, or the light of Nature, makes man in a paſſive capacity fit for grace; although he hath no active ability for it: And, when he is compared to a ſtone, it is not in the former ſenſe, but the later. And ſecondly, it's neceſſary by way of an inſtrument; for we cannot beleeve, unleſſe we underſtand whether know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be an act ingredient into the eſſence of faith, or whether it be prerequiſite: all hold there muſt be an act of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one way or other, going to beleeve. Hence knowledge is put for faith, and <hi>Hebr. 11. By faith we underſtand.</hi> Thus it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as an inſtrument.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is nothing true in Divinity that doth croſſe the truth of Nature, as it's the remnant of Gods image.</hi> This indeed is hard to <note place="margin">Though ſome divine truths may tranſcend the reach of Nature, none do croſſe the truth thereof, as it is the remnant of Gods image.</note> cleere in many points of Divinity; as in the doctrine of the Trinity, and the doctrine of Chriſts Incarnation, which ſeemeth paradoxall to Reaſon; of whom <hi>Tertullian, lib. 5. de carne Chriſti, cap.</hi> 5. thus, <hi>Natus est Dei Filius, non pudet, quia pudendum eſt; Mortuus eſt Dei Filius, prorſus credibile eſt, quia ineptum; Sepultus reſurrexit, certum eſt, quia impoſſibile.</hi> Yet, ſeeing the Apoſtle calls the naturall knowledge of a man Truth, and all truth is from God, which wayes ſoever it come, there can therefore be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction between it. And hereupon our Divines doe, when they have confuted the Popiſh doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation by Scripture, ſhew alſo, that for a body to be in two places, is againſt the principles of Nature. They indeed call for faith in this point: and <hi>Lapide,</hi> upon theſe words, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:65695:42"/>
ſaith, <hi>If Chriſt ſhould aske me at the day of judgement, Why did you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the bread to be the body of Christ? I will anſwer, This text, if I be deceived, Theſe words have deceived me.</hi> But we muſt compare place with place, and Scripture with Scripture. As for the doctrine of the Trinity, though it be above Reaſon, and we cannot look into that myſterie, no more then an Owle can into the Sun beames, yet it is not againſt it.</p>

                  <hi>the light of Faith.</hi> This may eaſily be underſtood: I may know there is a God by the light of Nature; and I may beleeve it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture ſaith ſo: ſo <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. I may by faith under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Word was made, and by arguments know it was made; and this is called faith, by <hi>James. The divels beleeve,</hi> that is, they have an evident intuitive knowledge of God, and feel it by experience; not that they have faith, for that is a ſupernaturall gift wrought by God, and hath accompanying it <hi>pia affectio,</hi> to him that ſpeaketh, as the firſt truth. Faith therefore, and the light of Nature go to the knowledge of the ſame thing different waies: faith doth, becauſe of the teſtimony and divine revelation of God; the light of Nature doth, becauſe of arguments in the thing it ſelf by diſcourſe. And faith is not a dianoeticall or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive act of the underſtanding, but it's ſimple and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Though Reaſon and the light of Nature be neceſſary, yet it is not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The light of Nature a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but no Judge in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>a Judge in matters of faith.</hi> The Lutheran ſeemeth to depreſſe Reaſon too much, and the Socinian exalteth it too high: They make it not onely an inſtrument, but a Judge; and thereupon they reject the greateſt myſteries of Religion. I know ſome have endeavoured to ſhew, that <hi>Religio eſt ſumma ratio;</hi> and there are excellent men that have proved the truth of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by Reaſon: and certainly, if we can by Reaſon prove there is any Religion at all, we may by the ſame Reaſon prove that the Chriſtian Religion is the true one. But who doth not ſee how uncertaine Reaſon is in compariſon of Faith? I doe not therefore like that aſſertion of one, who affects to be a great Rationaliſt (it is <hi>Chillingworth)</hi> that ſaith, <hi>We therefore receive the Scriptures to be the Word of God, becauſe we have the greateſt Reaſon that this is the Word of God.</hi> But we muſt not confound the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65695:43"/>
and the Judge: holy truths, they are Scripture truths, though hammered out by Reaſon. As the Smith that takes golden plate, and beates it into what ſhape he pleaſeth, his hammer doth not make it gold, but only gold of ſuch a ſhape: And thus alſo Reaſon doth not make a truth divine, onely holds it forth, and declareth it in ſuch a way.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>It's altogether inſufficient to preſcribe or ſet down any worſhip of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nature inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe divine Worſhip.</note> 
                  <hi>God.</hi> Hence God doth ſo often forbid us to walk after our own imaginations, and to doe that which we ſhall chooſe. The Apoſtle calleth it Will-worſhip, when a mans Will is the meere cauſe of it. Now, it's true, men are more apt to admire this, as we ſee in the Phariſees and Papiſts; they dote upon their Traditions more then Gods Inſtitutions. Hence <hi>Raymundus,</hi> a Papiſt, ſpeaking of the Maſſe, <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as full of mysteries, as the ſea is full of drops of water, as the heaven hath Angels, as the firmament hath ſtarres, and the earth little crummes of ſand.</hi> But what ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. that which is highly eſteemed before men, is abomination before God? That word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is applyed to idols and falſe-worſhip. It's true indeed, even in worſhip, light of Nature and prudence is inſtrumentally required to order the Inſtitutions of God; but as Reaſon may not make a new Article of Faith, ſo neither a new part of worſhip. Now Natures inſufficiency is deſcribed in theſe three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To have all the worſhip of God ſenſible and pleaſing to the eye.</hi> It <note place="margin">1. Becauſe it would have all the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God ſenſible and pleaſing to the eyes</note> was well called by <hi>Pariſienſis, a madneſſe</hi> in ſome, who doubted not to ſay, The Church was better ruled by the inventions of men then by the Scriptures. The people of Iſrael would have ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible gods, that they might ſee them: and certainly men doe as much delight in ſenſible pompous worſhip, as children do in gay babies; therefore the Prophet ſpeaketh of their goodly images. But all this ariſeth, becauſe they are ignorant of ſpirituall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and cannot tell how to make ſpirituall advantage from God. It was well ſaid by one, that <hi>A ſuperſtitious man is Gods flutterer, and not his friend; he is more officious then needs:</hi> and where a man is buſie <hi>ubi non oportet,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Tertullian)</hi> he is negligent <hi>ubi oportet.</hi> Such carnall ſenſible worſhippers are well compared to thoſe that, becauſe they have no children, delight in birds and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65695:43"/>
dogs; ſo becauſe they have no true graces of the Spirit of God, they delight in theſe imitations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To appoint mediatours between us and God.</hi> This was the <note place="margin">2. Becauſe it's prone to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours between God and us.</note> great Argument of the Heathens; they thought themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and therefore appointed others to mediate between them and God; which Argument of the Heathens, ſome of the Fathers wrote againſt. But, doe not the Papiſts the ſame thing? Doe not they tell us, Petitioners at the Court doe not addreſſe themſelves immediately to the Prince, but get Favourites to ſpeak for them; ſo muſt we to God? And therefore <hi>Salmeron</hi> doth give ſome reaſons why it's more piety and religion to pray to God and Saints together, then to God alone. But is not this to forget Chriſt our head, who is made neerer to us then Angels are? And, indeed, Angels are reconciled to us by Chriſt. If therefore we follow the light of Nature thus, we ſhall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ditch at laſt; and ſuperſtition is never more dangerous, then when it's coloured over with the ſpecious colours of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>To doe all by way of compenſation, and ſatisfaction to God.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Becauſe it performes all duties by way of compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; merit.</note> Upon this ground were all the ſacrifices of the Heathens. And is not all this with Popery? Doe they not make all penall things compenſative? If they pray, that is meritorious; if they faſt, that is ſatisfactory. Hence ariſeth that ſeeming not to ſpare the fleſh, <hi>Col. 3. ult.</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>it hath a ſhew of wiſdome.</hi> But the more like any actions are to worſhip and wiſdome, and are not ſo, the more loathſome they are: as in an Ape, that which makes an Ape ſo much deformed and loathſome, is becauſe it is ſo like a man, and is not a man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> Of Inſtruction. What hath made the idolatry of the Church of Rome ſo like Paganiſh and Ethnicall idolatry? Even becauſe they followed their light, the light of Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Look over all their Paganiſh gods, and they have anſwerable ſaints. As the Heathens had their <hi>Ceres,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and <hi>Aeſculapius;</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Varro</hi> ſaid, <hi>Diſcendum fuiſſet quâ de causâ quiſ<expan>

And this was done at firſt, they ſay, to gain the Heathens;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65695:44"/>
but the contrary fell out. Let us then follow the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no further then we ought; let her be an hand-maid, not a miſtreſſe. And then we muſt take heed of going againſt her where ſhe doth truly direct. Are there not many, not only unchriſtian, but alſo unnaturall actions? let us remember that.</p>

               <p>YOu have heard of two things conſiderable in the law of Nature; the <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>light of it,</hi> and the <hi>power</hi> or <hi>ability of it.</hi> We ſhall (God willing) at this time proſecute the doctrine of the former part, and the taske we have at this time is to anſwer ſome Queſtions about the light of Nature: for, as there are ſome who depreſſe it too much; ſo there are others advance it too high. The Philoſophers called the Chriſtians <hi>Credentes,</hi> by way of reproach, becauſe they did not argue by reaſon, but receive upon truſt: and there are ſome, who doe not indeed, with <hi>Abilardus,</hi> make faith <hi>[aestimatio]</hi> a fancy, yet they make it <hi>ratio.</hi> Let us ſee therefore what this light can doe, by way of anſwer to ſome Queſtions onely; not to anſwer all.</p>
               <p>The firſt Queſtion, <hi>Whether a man can by the light of Nature,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">That there is a God, may be known by the light of Nature.</note> 
                  <hi>and by the conſideration of the creatures, come to know there is a God?</hi> This is denyed by Socinians and others. Indeed <hi>Bellarmine</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth tenets to this effect upon <hi>Calvin,</hi> but that which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Authours hold, is, that he may indeed have a knowledge that there is a God, but what this God is, whether he be one, and what his attributes are, they cannot ſo reach to. <hi>Nihil Deo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, nihil ignotius:</hi> otherwiſe, they ſay, there is no naturall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt in opinion, though many in affections, deſiring there were no God. As <hi>Tully</hi> argueth, let us take heed, how we bring this opinion into the world, that there is a God, leſt hereby we bring a great ſlavery and feare upon our ſelves. Are there not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65695:44"/>
many Polititians have too much of this poiſon in their hearts? But of this more anon. Onely that there is ſuch a knowledge naturall, appeareth by ſome places: as firſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That which may be knowne of God:</hi> for there are ſome things, that by Nature could never be known, as the Trinity and Incarnation of Chriſt. Now this knowledge is by the book of the creatures. This whole univerſe may be called the lay-mens book; <hi>Rebus pro ſpeculo utamur,</hi> we may ſee the power and wiſdome of God in them. <hi>Tully</hi> hath a good compariſon: As a man that ſeeth and readeth a book, and obſerveth how every letter is put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make an harmonious ſenſe, muſt needs gather, that all thoſe letters did not fall together by chance, but that there was a wiſe authour in the compoſing of them: ſo it's in the world, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, none can think ſuch a ſweet compagination of all the parts of it ſhould come together meerly accidentally. It's ſaid to be the ſpeech of one <hi>Antony,</hi> much ſpoken of in Eccleſiaſticall ſtory, that he called the world a great volume, and the heaven, and water, and earth were the pages and leaves; the ſtarres and living creatures were the letters in thoſe pages: and how glorious a letter is the Sun, when <hi>Eudoxus</hi> ſaid, he was made onely to behold it? The wayes and arguments by which Naturaliſts have proved this, have not been by demonſtrations <hi>à priori,</hi> for that is impoſſible; but by the effects. As a man that cannot ſee the Sun in it ſelf, it is ſo dazeling, doth look upon it in a baſon of water: thus we who cannot know God in himſelf, know him in the creatures.</p>
               <p>The ſecond proof is from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. where the Pſalmiſt makes the creatures ſo many tongues ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a God, yea the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>eructat</hi> doth ſignifie the plenty and ſerenity, as alſo the fluid eloquence of the heavens; and this is quoted by the Apoſtle. And here two doubts are by the way to be removed: firſt, Whether that of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others be true, that the text is here corrupt: and, Whether the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts meaning be not perverted. For the firſt; in the Hebrew it's there <hi>line,</hi> but the Apoſtle, following the Septuagint, renders it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as if they had read <hi>Colam</hi> for <hi>Cavam:</hi> But the Anſwer is, that the Septuagint regarded the ſenſe, and, the Pſalmiſt having ſpoken before of the words or ſpeech of heaven, they therefore
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65695:45"/>
interpret according to that ſenſe: And by <hi>line,</hi> is meant the <hi>Structure</hi> and <hi>exact compoſing</hi> of all theſe things, which declareth the admirable wiſdome of the Maker.</p>
               <p>As for the later, it is indeed generally taken, as if the Apoſtle did ſpeak this of the Apoſtles preaching the Goſpel, which the Pſalmiſt did of the heavens: inſomuch that the Lutherans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret all the former part of the Pſalme allegorically. Others think the Apoſtle alledgeth that place alluſively, not by way of argument, as in that place of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where the Apoſtle applyeth the ſpeech about Manna to matter of liberality. But <hi>Janſenius</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez</hi> among the Papiſts, and <hi>Beza</hi> with others among the orthodox, think the Apoſtle keepeth to the literall meaning of the Pſalmiſt; as if this ſhould be the Apoſtles meaning, Iſrael hath heard, for God made known himſelf even to the very Heathens by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, how much more to the Jewes by the Prophets? Which way ſoever you take it, it proveth that God hath a ſchoole of Nature by his creatures, as well as a ſchoole of Grace by his Miniſters.</p>
               <p>The laſt proofe is from <hi>John 1. He is the true light, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth every man coming into the world:</hi> for ſo we think [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] doth referre to man, not light; though <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> plead much for it. Some indeed underſtand this of the light of Grace; but it will be more univerſally and neceſſarily true of the light of Reaſon, which is in infants radically, though not actually. I ſhall not here relate what unſound Poſitions an Antinomian Authour hath in a manuſcript Sermon upon this place, becauſe it is not pertinent. So then there is an implanted ſenſe and feeling of a deity; which made <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſay, <hi>O anima naturaliter Christiana!</hi> and <hi>Cyprian, Summaeſt delicti nolle agnoſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, quem ignorare non potes.</hi> If you object, that the Scripture ſpeaks of the Gentiles as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is to be underſtood of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and obedient knowledge of him. And as for ſome Atheiſts ſpoken of, that have expreſſedly profeſſed it; what they did was partly in deriſion of the many gods, as <hi>Socrates,</hi> and another, who needing a fire, threw a ſtatue of <hi>Hercules</hi> into the fire, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Age</hi> Hercules, XIII. <hi>laborem ſubiturus adesto, obſonium nobis cocturus.</hi> Beſides, they did this with their tongue more then their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65695:45"/>
heart, as appeareth by <hi>Diagoras,</hi> who when he had made a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous oration againſt a deity, the people came applauding him, and ſaid, he had almoſt perſwaded them, but only they thought, that if any were God, he was, for his eloquence ſake: and then this wretch, like <hi>Herod,</hi> was content to be thought a god. We read <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 23. of an altar to the unknown god; But that is in this ſenſe, Among the Heathens, it was uncertaine, which of their gods were appropriated to ſuch or ſuch offices: Hence when a plague was once at Athens, <hi>Epimenides</hi> brought ſheepe, ſome whereof were black, others white, to <hi>Areopagus,</hi> and letting them goe from thence, whither they would, directed them to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice (where they ſhould lye down) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to the proper God, and hence came their altars to an unknown God, becauſe they knew not, which God to ſacrifice to, for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their calamities.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Queſtion is, <hi>Whether the myſtery of the Trinity, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The myſterie of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the Incarnation of Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found out by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Incarnation of Chriſt, can be found out as a truth by the light of Nature?</hi> And here, certainly, we muſt anſwer negatively; for the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. ſpeaking of the myſteries of the Goſpel, ſaith, <hi>It hath not entered into the heart of a man to conceive of them:</hi> which is to be underſtood, not onely of the bleſſed joy and peace of thoſe truths, but alſo as they are truths; ſo that all theſe things are of meere ſupernaturall revelation. Hence we reade, that when, by reaſon of the Arrians, there was an hot diſpute about theſe myſteries, there was a voice heard from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The fall of the wiſe men.</hi> I doe acknowledge, that <hi>Austin</hi> and others have ſought the foot-ſteps or repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Trinity in the creatures; yea, <hi>Nierembergius</hi> a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, <hi>De origine ſacrae Scripturae, lib. 1. cap.</hi> 3. doth hold, that God did intend by the works of Creation, to declare the myſteries of graces; as by thoſe artificiall things of the Ark, Tabernacle, and Temple, he intended ſpirituall myſteries: but this is falſe. But then they did firſt know and beleeve this doctrine by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and then afterwards goe to repreſent it. Yet it muſt be confeſſed, that all theſe Similies have ſcarce one foot, much leſſe foure, to run on. The School-men ſpeak of the three things in every creature, <hi>Eſſe, poſſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>Operari.</hi> But eſpecially that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about the ſoule, when it underſtandeth or knoweth, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65695:46"/>
when it loveth: and the Son of God is repreſented by that <hi>Verbum mentis,</hi> and the holy Ghoſt by <hi>Amor.</hi> Now here is a miſtake, for Chriſt is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. by <hi>John,</hi> imitating, the Chaldee, not in reſpect of any ſuch ſcholaſticall ſenſe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth reveale and make knowne the will of God to us: ſo the union of the humane nature and the divine in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though learned men give many Examples, yet none come up to the full reſemblance: And indeed, if you could give the like inſtance, it were not wonderfull or ſingular. We conclude then, that the Scriptures are the onely ladder, whereby we climb up to theſe things, and our underſtandings are of ſuch a little ſtature, that we muſt climb up into the tree of life (the Scriptures) to ſee Jeſus.</p>
               <p>The third Queſtion concerning this naturall light is, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſufficient for ſalvation?</hi> For, there are ſome that hold, If <note place="margin">The light of Nature inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for ſalvation.</note> any man, of whatſoever Nation he be, worſhip God according to the light of Nature, and ſo ſerve him, he may be ſaved. Hence they have coined a diſtinction of a three-fold piety: <hi>Judaica, Christiana,</hi> and <hi>Ethnica.</hi> Therefore ſay they, What <hi>Moſes</hi> was to the Jewes, and Chriſt to the Chriſtians; the ſame is Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or the knowledge of God by nature, to Heathens. But this opinion is derogatory to the Lord Chriſt; for onely by faith in his Name can we be ſaved, as the Scripture ſpeaketh. And, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if the Apoſtle argued that Chriſt died in vain, if workes were joyned to him; how much more if he be totally excluded? It is true, it ſeemeth a very hard thing to mans reaſon, that the greater part of the world, being Pagans and Heathens, with all their infants, ſhould be excluded from heaven. Hence, becauſe <hi>Vedelius,</hi> a learned man, did make it an aggravation of Gods grace to him, to chuſe and call him, when ſo many thouſand thouſands of pagan-infants are damned: this ſpeech, as being full of horridneſſe, a ſcoffing Remonſtrant takes, and ſets it forth odiouſly in the Frontiſpice of his Book. But, though our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is offended, yet we muſt judge according to the way of the Scripture; which makes Chriſt the onely way for ſalvation. If ſo be it could be proved, as <hi>Zwinglius</hi> held, that Chriſt did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelf to ſome Heathens, then it were another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I will not bring all the places they ſtand upon, that which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65695:46"/>
is mainely urged is <hi>Act.</hi> 10. of <hi>Cornelius;</hi> his prayers were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and, ſaith <hi>Peter, Now I perceive,</hi> &amp;c. But this proceedeth from a meere miſtake; for <hi>Cornelius</hi> had the implicite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith of Chriſt, and had received the doctrine of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> though he was ignorant of Chriſt, that individuall Perſon. And as for that worſhipping of him in every Nation, that is not to be underſtood of men abiding ſo, but whereas before it was limited to the Jewes, now God would receive all that ſhould come to him, of what Nation ſoever.</p>
               <p>There is a two-fold Unbelief: one <hi>Negative,</hi> and for this no Heathen is damned: He is not condemned becauſe he doth not beleeve in Chriſt, but for his originall and actuall ſinnes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is <hi>Poſitive</hi> Unbelief, which they only are guilty of, who live under the meanes of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The fourth Queſtion is, <hi>Whether that be true of the Papists,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs did not offer ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but God revealed his will to <hi>Adam</hi> to be ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</note> 
                  <hi>which hold, that the ſacrifices the Patriarchs offered to God, were by the meere light of Nature:</hi> For ſo ſaith <hi>Leſſius, Lex Naturae &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringit &amp; ſuadet, &amp;c.</hi> the Law of Nature both bindeth and dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all to offer ſacrifices to God; therefore they make it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that there ſhould be a ſacrifice now under the New Teſtament offered unto God: And upon this ground <hi>Leſſius</hi> ſaith it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Indians to offer up ſacrifices unto God, according to their way and cuſtome. And, making this doubt to himſelf, <hi>How ſhall they doe for a Priest?</hi> He anſwereth, that as a common-wealth may appoint a Governour to rule over them, and to whom they will ſubmit in all things; ſo may it appoint a Prieſt to officiate in all things for them. This is ſtrange for a Papiſt to ſay, who doteth ſo much upon ſucceſſion, as if where that is not, there could be no miniſtery. Now in this caſe he gives the people a power to make a Prieſt. But, howſoever it may be, by the light of Nature, that God is religiouſly to be worſhipped; yet it muſt be onely inſtituted worſhip that can pleaſe him: And thus much <hi>Socrates</hi> an Heathen ſaid, That God muſt onely be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in that way wherein he hath declared his will to be ſo. Seeing therefore <hi>Abel,</hi> and ſo others, offered in faith, and faith doth alwayes relate to ſome teſtimony and word, it is neceſſary to hold, that God did reveale to <hi>Adam</hi> his will, to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by thoſe externall ſacrifices, and the oblations of them. It is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65695:47"/>
true, almoſt all the Heathens offered ſacrifices unto their gods, but this they did, as having it at firſt by hear-ſay from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; and alſo Satan is alwayes imitating of God in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions: And howſoever the deſtructive mutation or change of the thing (which is alwayes neceſſary to a ſacrifice) doth argue, and is a ſigne of ſubjection and deepeſt humiliation; yet how ſhould Nature preſcribe, that the demonſtration of our ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt be in ſuch a kind or way?</p>
               <p>The fifth Queſtion is, <hi>Whether originall ſin can be found out by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Originall ſin can onely be truly knowne by Scripture-light.</note> 
                  <hi>the meere light of Nature?</hi> Or, <hi>Whether it is onely a meere matter of faith that we are thus polluted?</hi> It is true, the learned <hi>Mornay</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to prove by naturall reaſon our pollution, and ſheweth how many of the ancient Platoniſts doe agree in this, That the ſoule is now vaſſalled to ſenſe and affections, and that her wings are cut whereby ſhe ſhould ſoare up into heaven. And ſo <hi>Tully</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Cum primùm naſcimur, in omni continuò pravitate verſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur;</hi> much like that of the Scripture, <hi>The Imagination of the thoughts of a mans heart is onely evil, and that continually:</hi> But <hi>Aristotle</hi> (of whom one ſaid wickedly and falſly, that he was the ſame in Naturals, which Chriſt was in Supernaturals) he makes a man to be <hi>obraſa tabula,</hi> without ſin or vertue; though indeed it doth incline <hi>ad meliora. Tully</hi> affirmeth alſo, that there are <hi>ſemina innata virtutum</hi> in us, onely we overcome them preſently: Thus alſo <hi>Seneca, Erras, ſi tecum naſci vitia putas, ſupervenerunt, ingeſta ſunt,</hi> as I ſaid before. Here we ſee the wiſeſt of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſpeaking againſt it. Hence <hi>Julian,</hi> the Pelagian, heaped many ſentences out of the chiefeſt Philoſophers againſt any ſuch corruption of nature. But <hi>Auſtine</hi> anſwered, It was not much matter what they ſaid, ſeeing they were ignorant of theſe things. The truth is, by nature we may diſcover a great languiſhment and infirmity come upon us; but the true nature of this, and how it came about, can only be known by Scripture-light: Therefore the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. ſaith, <hi>he had not known lust to be ſin, had not the Law ſaid, Thou ſhalt not last.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixth Queſtion is, <hi>What is the meaning of that grand rule of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 17. 12. expounded.</note> 
                  <hi>Nature, which our Saviour alſo repeateth, That which you would not have other men doe to you, doe not you to them? Matth.</hi> 7. 12. It is reported of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> that he did much delight in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65695:47"/>
this ſaying, which he had from the Jewes or Chriſtians: and our Saviour addeth this, that, <hi>This is the Law, and the Prophets;</hi> ſo that it is a great thing even for Chriſtians to keep to this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. Men may pray, and exerciſe religious duties, and yet not doe this; therefore the Apoſtle addeth this to prayer, ſo that we may live as we pray, according to that good rule of the Platoniſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. How would this ſubdue all thoſe proud, envious, cenſorious, and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micitious carriages to one another? But now when we ſpeake of doing that to another, which we would have done to our ſelves, it is to be underſtood of a right and well-regulated will, not corrupted or depraved.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Queſtion is, <hi>Whether the practice of the Apoſtles,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Communion of all things no precept of Nature, and the Apoſtles practiſe of it was only oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionall, not binding to poſterity.</note> 
                  <hi>making all their goods common, was according to the precept of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo binding all to ſuch a practice?</hi> For there have been, and ſtill are thoſe that hold this. But now, that communion of all things is not <hi>jure Naturae,</hi> appeareth, in that theft is a ſin againſt the Morall Law; which could not be, if diviſion of goods were not according to the law of Nature. Indeed, by Nature all things were common, but then it was Natures dictate to divide them; as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſheweth in many reaſons againſt <hi>Plato.</hi> What would have been in innocency, if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, whether a common right to all things, or a divided propriety, (I ſpeak of goods) is hard to ſay. But as for the practice of the Church of Jeruſalem, that was occaſionall, and neceſſary, therefore not to be a ground for perpetuall command; for other Churches did it not, as appeareth by the almes that were gathered, nor was it laid neceſſarily upon all to ſell what they had, as appeareth by <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſpeech to <hi>Ananias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. If God be ſo angry with thoſe that abuſe naturall light, <note place="margin">God is more off ended with thoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe Goſpel light, then thoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the light of Nature.</note> how much rather then with ſuch, who alſo abuſe Goſpel light? Theſe doe not put light under a buſhell, but under a dung-hill. There are many that are <hi>Solifugae,</hi> as Bats and Owles are. In one Chapter God is ſaid three times to deliver them up, becauſe they did not glorifie God according to Natures light; how much more then according to the Goſpels light? <hi>Gravis eſt lux conſcientiae,</hi> ſaid <hi>Seneca,</hi> but <hi>gravior eſt lux Evangelii:</hi> The light of the Miniſtery and Word muſt needs be more troubleſome to thy ſinfull wayes.</p>

               <p>WE have handled thoſe things that concern the light and conduct of Nature: now we ſhall ſpeak of that which belongs to the ability and power of Nature; for herein are two extreme errours: one of the Pelagian, Papiſt, and Arminian, with others, who lift up this power too high, The enemies of grace lurk under the praiſes of nature, <hi>Sub laudibus Naturae latent inimici gratiae;</hi> and the other of the Antinomians, who ſeem to deny all the preparatory works upon the heart of a man; holding, that Chriſt immediately communicateth himſelfe to groſſe ſinners abiding ſo: and though they hold us paſſive at the firſt receiving of Chriſt, which all orthodox do; yet they expreſſe it in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound ſenſe, comparing God unto a Phyſician, that doth violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open the ſick mans throat, and poure down his phyſick whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will or no; whereas God, though he doth convert <hi>fortiter,</hi> yet he doth it alſo <hi>ſuaviter.</hi> Now for the full clearing of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to any good thing, we will lay down theſe Propoſitions:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:65695:48"/>
1. <hi>There is a naturall power of free-will left in us.</hi> Free-will is <note place="margin">There is in man a natural power, by the help of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to chuſe or refuſe this or that thing.</note> not indeed a Scripture name, but meerly eccleſiaſticall, and hath been ſo abuſed, that <hi>Calvin</hi> wiſhed the very name of it were quite exploded: but if we ſpeak of the <hi>quid ſit,</hi> and not the <hi>quid poſſit,</hi> the <hi>being</hi> of it, and not the <hi>working</hi> of it, we muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily acknowledge it. The neereſt expreſſion to the word <hi>Free-will,</hi> is that 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 37. having</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>power over his own will:</hi> but generally the Scripture uſeth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is as much as we intend. There is in all men naturally that power, whereby, through the help of Reaſon, he chooſeth this, and refuſeth another-thing; only this muſt not be extended to the things of grace. Now to ſay what this Free-will is, is very hard: <hi>Perkins,</hi> following ſome Schoole-men, maketh it a mixed power of the Underſtanding and the Will; others a third reall diſtinct power from them: but it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be thought, that it is nothing but the will in electing or refuſing ſuch things; ſo that we call it the <hi>Will</hi> in thoſe things it's neceſſarily carried out to, as to will what is good, and not ſin as ſin: and then <hi>Free-will,</hi> when it's carried out to thoſe things that are not neceſſarily connexed with it: Even as in the Underſtanding, while the Underſtanding doth conſider firſt Principles, it's called <hi>Intellectus;</hi> while Concluſions that are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from them, it's called <hi>Ratio.</hi> Therefore our Adverſaries do but calumniate us, when they ſay, we turn men into beaſts; for we hold the Underſtanding going before, and the Will after: and this is more then a meere ſpontaneous inclination in things naturall. Therefore it is, that we do not bid the fire burn, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade an horſe to goe, becauſe there is not Underſtanding or Will in theſe things, as there is in a man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This which is left in us is not able to performe naturall actions,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">This naturall power in man not able to performe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall actions without Gods generall aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> 
                  <hi>without the generall help of God.</hi> That which we have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be in a man naturally, muſt ſtill be limited to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſphere, to naturall, and civill actions, or ſome externally religious duties: but even then we muſt acknowledge a generall help, or aſſiſtance of God, without which we could not doe any naturall thing; ſo that place in the <hi>Acts, In him we live, and move, and have our being:</hi> by which we prove, that God doth not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65695:49"/>
onely give us the principles of being and moving, but we move in him, <hi>i. e.</hi> by him. Therefore <hi>Hierome</hi> did well reprove the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians, that thought, without the generall aide of God, a man might move his finger, or write, and ſpeak. There have beem ſome who have thought, that all which God doth for us in our naturall actions, is onely to give the principles and power o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> actions; and then afterwards we need no further aide, then mee<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> preſervation of our being, no concourſe or aide of God helping us in the action: Thus <hi>Durand</hi> of old, and one <hi>Dodo</hi> of late, who hath written a Book onely to that purpoſe: but the place aboveſaid doth evidently convince it; and we ſee, that God did hinder the fire from burning the three Worthies, though he did preſerve the fire at the ſame time in the power of burning, which could not be otherwiſe, then by denying his actuall aide to the working of the fire: For, to ſay that the reaſon was becauſe of Gods doing ſomething upon their bodies, were to make the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle there, where the Scripture doth not lay it. If you aske then, why this may not be called a ſpeciall help of God, as well as that whereby we are inabled to beleeve, or repent; I anſwer, there is a great deal of difference:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe this generall aide is neceſſary to wicked actions, in regard of their poſitive nature, as well as to good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God doth this in the way of his Providence, as a Creatour, the other he doth in the way of Predeſtination, as a Father in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The other aide may be ſaid to be due, as our Divines ſpeak of originall righteouſneſſe, upon a ſuppoſition that a man is made a creature to do ſuch actions; yet not properly a debt, but that for our ſin we are deprived of it: but this ſpeciall help of grace cannot be called ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is wholly unable to work any good thing.</hi> All this while we have conſidered the power of man but as in the lower region; <note place="margin">Man by the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wholly unable to performe good actions.</note> and if you doe conſider him, in reference to good things, ſo he hath no power, or will, or free-will at all; but, as <hi>Austin</hi> ſaid before <hi>Luther,</hi> it's <hi>ſervum arbitrium,</hi> a ſervant, and inſlaved will to ſin onely. Indeed we have not loſt our underſtandings or our wills, but to know or will that which is good, is wholly loſt:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65695:49"/>
Though we have not loſt the will, yet we have the rectitude in that will, whereby we ſhould encline to good. And this may be proved from many Arguments:</p>
               <p n="1">1. From all thoſe places of Scripture which declare our eſtate <note place="margin">1. Becauſe our natures are full of ſin and corruption.</note> to be full of ſin and corruption, and altogether wicked. Now, <hi>Doe men gather grapes of thornes, or figs of thistles?</hi> Hence the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compareth us well to the ſhip in a tempeſt, that is deſtitute of a Pilot: we are daſhed continually upon rocks, though this ſpeak of the negative onely, not the poſitive corruption.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All thoſe places, which ſpeak of grace, and converſion, and <note place="margin">2. Becauſe grace and converſion are the work of God.</note> regeneration, as the work of God. As for thoſe places, where we are ſaid to repent, and to turn unto God, in time we ſhall cleare; only theſe Texts prove, that all the good things we do, they are the works of the Lord: not that God beleeveth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth in us, but he worketh thoſe actions in us efficiently, which we doe formally and vitally.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All thoſe places whereby glory and praiſe is to be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">3. Becauſe glory is to be given to God onely, not to our ſelves.</note> God onely, and not unto our ſelves. <hi>What hast thou thou haſt not received?</hi> We are to glory in nothing, becauſe no good thing is ours. Therefore, we bring forth good things, as <hi>Sarahs</hi> dead womb brought forth a child; it was not a child of nature, but a child of the meere Promiſe: thus are all our graces. And, indeed, if we could either in whole or part work our own converſion, we might thank God, and our wils: But how abſurd would this be, Lord, I thank thee for the turning of my heart, when I was willing to turn it?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It cannot prepare or dispoſe it ſelf for the grace of justification</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nature of it ſelf cannot diſpoſe for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, or ſanctification: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why.</note> 
                  <hi>or ſanctification.</hi> As it cannot immediately work any good thing, ſo neither can a naturall man diſpoſe, or prepare himſelf for the great works of grace. There is no truth in ſuch an aſſertion. Let man do what he can naturally, God will meet him graciouſly: and the reaſons are plain:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe no naturall thing is in it ſelf an order or a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to a ſupernaturall thing; for they differ in their whole kind and nature. Hence it is, that we never read of any Heathens, that, by the improvement of a naturall light, had ſupernaturall vouchſafed unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:65695:50"/>
2. Thoſe places that ſpeak of our totall corruption, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively <hi>onely evil,</hi> and extenſively, <hi>all the thoughts of a man are evil,</hi> and protenſively, <hi>continually,</hi> do ſufficiently declare, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prepare our ſelves to meet God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we could prepare, or diſpoſe our ſelves to grace, then the greateſt cauſe of glory would ſtill be in a mans own ſelf For, Why doth <hi>Peter</hi> repent, and not <hi>Judas?</hi> Becauſe, may ſome ſay, he diſpoſed and ſet himſelf to repent, and not <hi>Judas.</hi> But ſtill here is the Queſtion, Why did <hi>Peter</hi> ſet himſelf to repent and not <hi>Judas?</hi> Here it muſt be ultimately reſolved either into the grace of God, or the will of man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All thoſe ſimilitudes that the Scripture uſeth, do illuſtrate this thing. We are not ſaid to be blind, or lame, but dead in ſin: now did <hi>Lazarus</hi> prepare himſelf to riſe? So it's called Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Can a man diſpoſe himſelf to have life? I know theſe compariſons muſt not be extended too far; yet, the Scripture uſing ſuch expreſſions to declare our utter inability, we may well preſſe thoſe breaſts of the Scripture ſo farre, and bring out no blood. The parched earth doth not diſpoſe it ſelf for the rain, nor doth the cold ice of it ſelf thaw, which is the Fathers Similie.</p>
               <p>Yet fifthly, <hi>We may hold truly ſome antecedaneous works upon the heart, before thoſe graces be beſtowed on us.</hi> This take to antidote <note place="margin">There are, and may be ſome prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedaneous works upon the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> againſt the Antinomian, who ſpeaks conſtantly of the ſoul ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Chriſt, even while it's a grievous polluted ſoul; as if there were no poliſhing of this crooked timber and rough ſtone, but even taken out of the quarry, and ſo immediately put into the building. Thoſe in the <hi>Acts</hi> that were pricked in heart, were yet bid to repent; and ſo they cried out, <hi>What ſhall we doe to be ſaved?</hi> The ſick feeleth his burden before he cometh for eaſe, ſo that a groſſe ſinner is not immediately put out of his vile wayes into Chriſt; onely theſe limitations you muſt take:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all theſe things, ſight of ſin, trembling for fear, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed deſires, they are the works of Gods grace moving us, they do not come from our own naturall ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe are not abſolutely neceſſary in every one. We know how <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Lydia</hi> did follow Chriſt; and God ſaith, he <hi>was found of ſome that did not ſeek him. Paul</hi> was in a moſt curſed
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65695:50"/>
indiſpoſition when the Lord called him: but generally God takes this way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe are not neceſſary antecedents, ſo as the grace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion doth neceſſarily follow. Wee reade of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> troubled for ſin. These are a wilderneſſe that a man may dye in, and never goe into Canaan: There may be throes and pangs, when yet no childe, but wind is to be delivered. Hence a people that have been civill, have not been called: but Publicans and Harlots. The object of election is for the moſt part few for number, infirme for power, and ſinfull for converſation: though in the godly theſe are needles that will draw in the threed, yet this ſtate muſt not be called a third middle eſtate between rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and unregenerate, as ſome feigne.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, none of theſe workings can be called ſo properly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, or diſpoſitions in themſelves, but onely intentionally in God. Our Saviour looked on a young man, and loved him, and ſaid, hee <hi>was not farre from the Kingdome of heaven:</hi> that is, the life hee lived was not farre from the Kingdome of heaven; yet this was no preparation in it ſelfe to it: nay, he may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, as two high hills may be neer in the tops to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the bottomes ſome miles aſunder. And this is ſo great a matter, that great ſins are made by God a preparation to ſome mans converſion, which yet of themſelves they could never be: As a childe, whoſe coat is a little dirty, hath it not preſently waſhed; but when he falls wholly all over in the dirt, this may be the cauſe of the waſhing of it: ſo that they are preparations only ſo far as God intendeth them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>All determination to one doth not take away that naturall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to one kind of acts takes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way liberty.</note> This will further cleere the truth: for it may be thought ſtrange, that there ſhould be this freedome of will in a man, and yet thus determined to one ſin onely; whereas it's plaine, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to one kind of acts, good or evill, doth not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way liberty. God can onely will that which is good, and ſo the Angels and Saints confirmed in happineſſe; yet they doe this freely: and ſo the Divels will that which is wicked onely. It's true, ſome exclaime at ſuch paſſages, but that is onely becauſe they are prepoſſeſſed with a falſe opinion about liberty; for a determination to one may ariſe from perfection, as well as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65695:51"/>
imperfection. It is from Gods abſolute perfection that hee is determined to will onely good; and when <hi>Adam</hi> did will to ſin againſt God, it did not ariſe from the liberty of his will, but his mutability. There is a naturall neceſſity, ſuch which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth a thing to one; and that is imperfection: but a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of immutability in that which is good, is a glorious perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The Learned ſpeak of a three-fold liberty: 1. From miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſuch as the Saints ſhall have in heaven. 2. From ſin, to which <note place="margin">A threefold liberty.</note> is oppoſed that freedome to righteouſneſſe, of which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeaketh, <hi>Then are yee free indeed,</hi> when the Son hath made you free; and of which <hi>Auſtine, Tunc eſt liberum, quando libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> 3. From naturall neceſſity, and thus alſo man, though hee be neceſſarily carried on to ſin, yet it is not by a naturall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as beaſts are, but there is Reaſon and Will in him when he doth thus tranſgreſſe: onely you muſt take notice, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of our Will onely to ſin, is the loſſe of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection we had in <hi>Adam,</hi> and doth not ariſe from the primaeve conſtitution of the will, but by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and ſo is meerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall to it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Nor doth it take away that willingneſſe or delight in ſin, which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſinne, takes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſinne which man is inevitably carried out unto.</note> 
                  <hi>we are inevitably carried out unto:</hi> For now, if man were carried out to ſin againſt his will and his delight, then there might be ſome ſhew of pleading for him; but it is not ſo, he ſinneth as willingly, and as electively in reſpect of his corrupt heart, as if there were no neceſſity brought upon him. Therefore that is good of <hi>Bernards, The neceſſity takes not away the willingneſſe of it, nor the willingneſſe of it the neceſſity.</hi> It's both an hand-maid, and ſo free, and, which is to be wondered, <hi>eo<expan>

Beſides (I ſay, this juſt and full anſwer) this alſo is to be ſaid, that no man ſins conſtrainedly, but every one is carried on with that delight to ſin, as if he were independent upon any providence, or predefinitive permiſſive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God, or any ſuch corrupt neceſſity within him. Hereby
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65695:51"/>
he pitieth not himſelfe, hee ſeeth not his undone eſtate, <hi>&amp; nihil miſerius miſero non miſerante ſcipſum.</hi> Hence it is, that a mans whole damnation is to be aſcribed to himſelfe. Wee ourſelves have deſtroyed our owne ſoules, wee cannot caſt it upon Gods decrees. And this is neceſſarily to be urged, becauſe of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corruption in us with <hi>Adam,</hi> to caſt our ſinne upon God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>A man may acknowledge grace and give much to it, and yet</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Much may be aſcribed to grace, and yet the totall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto it.</note>

Thus grace and free-will produce a good action; grace as the generall cauſe, and free-will as the particular: but how dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory is this to grace? how can our actions be ſaid to be the fruit of grace? For, If I ſhould aske, Who is the father of ſuch a man? it would be very hard to ſay, The Sun in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo it would be as abſurd to ſay, Grace regenerated and converted this man. Again, they make grace a partiall cauſe only; ſo that it ſtirreth up our naturall ſtrength to work this or that good thing: and therefore we are ſynergiſts or co-workers with <note place="margin">The outward act of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the power of Nature.</note> God in the work of converſion; but this ſuppoſeth us not dead in ſinne.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Men may naturally performe the outward act of a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</hi> Now though we be thus corrupt, yet for all that, men
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65695:52"/>
by nature may doe that outward act which is commanded by God, or abſtaine from the matter prohibited. Thus <hi>Alexander</hi> abſtained from the Virgins hee took captives, which is ſo much related in ſtories, and many other famous inſtances of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, though ſome indeed think they had a ſpeciall helpe and aide from God to doe that: but here the Apoſtle in the Text is cleare, <hi>They doe by nature the things of the law.</hi> Some doe not like that dictinction, They may doe <hi>the ſubſtance of the work,</hi> but not <hi>the manner of a good worke,</hi> becauſe they think the ſubſtance doth comprehend that indeed which makes a good work; howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they agree that the externall act may be done. Thus <hi>Ahab</hi> hee externally humbled himſelfe, and ſome think that <hi>Uriah,</hi> which <hi>Eſay</hi> calls, <hi>The faithfull witneſſe</hi> he took to him, to be the ſame with him that brought in the Altar of Damaſcus: ſo that, though he was an idolater, and an ungodly man, yet hee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a <hi>faithfull</hi> man in his word. And certainly this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to make many men inexcuſable. They may forbeare thoſe acts of groſſe impiety which they doe, ſuppoſing they have not cuſtomarily, or by the juſt judgement of God throwne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the power of ſuch ſins; not that this will helpe to ſave them, onely their puniſhment will be leſſe. Thus <hi>Fabricius</hi> and <hi>Camillus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Austin)</hi> will be leſſe puniſhed then <hi>Verres</hi> or <hi>Cataline,</hi> not becauſe theſe were holy, but becauſe they were leſſe wicked, <hi>&amp; minora vitia virtutes vocamus.</hi> I know it's a queſtion, Whether a godly man can doe more good then he doth, or leſſe evill then he doth: but this may be handled in the controverſall part; we ſpeak now of a wicked man, who can doe no good at all, unleſſe in the externall act.</p>
               <p>Yet 10. <hi>All that they doe is a ſin before God.</hi> This is an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote <note place="margin">Whatſoever meere natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men doe, is ſin before God; becauſe 1. The act wants faith, the perſon reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God. 2.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>They could not come from faith, or one reconciled with God:</hi> and the perſon muſt be firſt accepted before the action, <hi>Heb. 11. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it's impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It could not come from a regenerate nature:</hi> and therefore the tree not being good, the fruit was alſo bad.

               <p>WE have already poſitively and plainly (ſo farre as wee conceived neceſſary) declared and proved the truth about the power and ability of a man by Nature to doe that which is good: now it remaineth we ſhould antidote againſt thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that doe militate againſt this truth, and that indeed with much ſhew of reaſon; for never have men been more witty, then when they have undertaken to be the patrons of Nature. But <hi>Auſtin</hi> well called it <hi>vitreum acumen:</hi> the more it glitters, the eaſier it's broken. The Heathens are very obſtinate in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning mans power.

And, as <hi>Joab</hi> did about Rabbah, when he had taken it, ſent to <hi>David</hi> to come and take all the glory; ſo doe they ſay, <hi>Not I, but the grace of God, 1 Corinth.</hi> 15. <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Finſt therefore they ſay, <hi>If ſo be we are not able to doe any thing towards our ſalvation, this is to turn men into ſtockes, and ſtones, or beasts, and ſo no difference between them and us.</hi> But we ſay, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65695:53"/>
thoſe ſimilitudes the Scripture holds forth doe prove our inability for that which is good, yet they muſt not be made alike in all things. It's true, to convert men, is to make children unto <hi>Abraham</hi> out of ſtones; yet we muſt not think that is therefore an univerſall likeneſſe between men and ſtones: For firſt, conſider this vaſt diſſimilitude; In ſtones and beaſts there is no paſſive capacity of grace, but in man there is. We ſay, there is a power for grace in a mans nature; and the Papiſts ſay, there is a power: only they ſay it's an active power, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; we ſay, only a paſſive. There is a power to be converted to God, which is not in ſtones or beaſts: they ſay, there is a power to convert or turn to God; here is a great difference.</p>
               <p>Beſides, wee may conſider theſe degrees in the creatures: 1. There is an inclination to ſuch an act, as in the fire to burne. 2. A ſpontaneous inclination to ſome acts accompanied with ſenſe, and ſenſible apprehenſions, as in beaſts. 3. A willing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination accompanied with reaſon or judgement, and this is in man: Now, becauſe man is thus affected, therefore God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, though he doth it by a potent work, yet by arguments, which we never uſe to horſes, or brute beaſts: and although man hath loſt that rectitude in his will and mind, yet hee hath not loſt the faculties themſelves; therefore though he be theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally dead, yet hee is ethically alive, being to be wrought upon by arguments. Hence is that ſaying, <hi>To will is of nature, To will well of grace, To will ill of corrupt nature.</hi> Hence wee may grant thoſe objections, that if a man had not this free-will (if you doe not extend it to good things) there could be no converſion or obedience; for grace doth not deſtroy, but perfect nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This putteth men upon ſpeaking and preaching contradictions:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">To preſſe a duty, and yet to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gods grace or gift to do it, is no contradiction.</note> For ſo ſome have ſaid, that the Calviniſts; though they be Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts in their Doctrines, yet they are Arminians in their Uſes. And they ſay, How incongruous is it, to tell us we can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our ſelves, and then to make this uſe, Therefore let us ſeek out for the grace of Chriſt? But to anſwer, 1. This contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction may be caſt as well upon Chriſt and <hi>Paul:</hi> Take Chriſt for an inſtance, <hi>John</hi> 6. in that Sermon, he bade the Jewes <hi>labour for that meat that periſheth not,</hi> and yet at the ſame time ſaid, <hi>None can come unto mee, except my Father draw him.</hi> Might not the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65695:54"/>
ſay, How can theſe two things ſtand together? So <hi>John</hi> 15. our Saviour telleth them, <hi>Without him they can doe nothing,</hi> and yet at the ſame time he exhorteth them, <hi>to abide in him, and keep his commandements:</hi> So <hi>Paul;</hi> take two inſtances from him, <hi>Rom. cap.</hi> 9. &amp; <hi>cap.</hi> 11. The Apoſtle there ſheweth, <hi>God will have mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> and <hi>that it is not of him that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth or willeth, but of God that calleth;</hi> yet he bids <hi>them that ſtand take heed lest they fall:</hi> and, <hi>Be not high-minded, but feare.</hi> So <hi>Phil. 2. 12, 13. Work out your ſalvation with feare and trembling;</hi> for it's <hi>God that worketh in you both to will and to doe.</hi> This reaſon, in their ſenſe, would quite overthrow the former. Nay (ſay they) it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attributed thus to God, and to man, it ſeemeth both doe it How this may be anſwered, wee ſhall ſee anon.

                  </gap> ſpeak contradictions, becauſe we preſſe a duty, and yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gods grace or gift to doe it, is to make a perpetuall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord between precepts and promiſes: For the ſame things which God commands us to doe, doth hee not alſo promiſe to doe for us, as, <hi>to circumciſe our hearts,</hi> and, <hi>to walk in his commandements</hi> How much better is that of <hi>Auſtius, O man, in Gods precepts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what thou oughteſt to doe, in his promiſes acknowledge that thou canſt not doe it?</hi> But 2. we may returne upon them, that their Sermons and Prayers are contradictions; they ſay, they can doe it, and then they pray God they may doe it: They ſay, the Will may receive the grace of God, and may obey God calling; and then they pray, God would make them obey his calling; as much as to ſay, O Lord, make me to obey if I will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This evacuateth the whole nature of Gods precepts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Simply and univerſally, even to the power of God:</hi> and ſo all thoſe things are, that imply a contradiction; and this impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ariſeth from the nature of the thing, not from any defect in God: Yea, wee may ſay with one, <hi>Potentiſſimè hoc Deus non poteſt.</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:65695:54"/>
2. <hi>There may be a thing impoſſible in its kind;</hi> as for <hi>Adam</hi> to reach the heavens, for a man to work above naturall cauſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That which is poſſible in it ſelf to ſuch a ſubject, but becomes impoſſible accidentally through a mans fault.</hi> Now for a man to be commanded that, which through his own fault he becometh unable to do, is no illuſion or cruelty. If a creditor require his debt of a bankrupt, who hath prodigally ſpent all, and made himſelf unable to pay, what unrighteouſneſſe is this?

Again conſider, that the commands of God doe imply if any power, then more then they will acknowledge; for they ſuppoſe a man can doe all of himſelf without the grace of God, and therefore indeed the old Pelagian, and the new Socinian ſpeak more conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly then theſe, that divide it between grace, and the power of man.</p>

The anſwer then to this may be taken out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 11. That howſoever <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of the Law, yet <hi>Paul</hi> interprets it of the Goſpel. What then? Doth <hi>Paul</hi> pervert the ſcope of <hi>Moſes?</hi> Some do almoſt ſay ſo; but the truth is, the Law (as is to be ſhewed againſt the generall miſtake) if it was not in it ſelf a covenant of grace, yet it was given Evangelically, and to Evangelicall purpoſes, which made the Apoſtle alledge that place: and therefore the Antinomian doth wholly miſtake, in ſetting up the Law as ſome horrid <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> or <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s head, as is to be ſhewed.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Neceſsity of ſinning hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not the delight and willingneſſe man hath in ſin, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently God may reprove him for his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                  <hi>if they could doe no other wayes?</hi> This alſo ſeemeth very ſtrange, if men can do no otherwiſe. Is not this as ridiculous to threaten them, as that of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who menaced the ſea? I anſwer, No, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſtill whatſoever man offends in, it's properly his fault, and truly his ſin; for whatſoever he ſinneth in, he doth it voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with much delight; and is therefore the freer in ſin, by how much the more he delights in it. And this <hi>Auſtin</hi> would diligently inculcate, that ſo no man might think to caſt his faults upon God. There is no man forced to ſinne, but he doth it with all his inclination and delight. How farre voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is requiſite to the nature of a ſinne, at leaſt actuall, though not to originall, is not now to be determined; for we all acknowledge, that this neceſſity of ſinning in every man, doth not hinder the delight and willingneſſe he hath in it at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhould this be thought ſo abſurd, for even <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 5. l. 3. Ethic. ad Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com.</note> that <hi>though men at firſt may chooſe, whether they will be wicked or no, yet if once habituated, they cannot but be evil:</hi> and yet for all that, this doth not excuſe, but aggravate. <hi>If an Ethiopian can change his skin,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>then may you doe good, who have accuſtomed your ſelves to doe evil.</hi> The Oake, while it was a little plant, might be pulled up; but when it's grown into its full breadth and height, none can move it. Now if it be thus of an habit, how much more of originall ſin, which is the deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature? And howſoever <hi>Auſtin</hi> was ſhye of calling it <hi>naturale malum,</hi> for fear of the Manichees; yet ſometimes he would doe it. Well therefore doth the Scripture uſe thoſe ſharp reproofes and upbraidings, becauſe there is no man a ſinner or a damner of himſelf, but it is by his own fault: and withall, theſe ſerve to be a goad and a ſharp thorn in the ſinners ſide, whereby he is made reſtleſſe in his ſin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>To what purpoſe are exhortations and admonitions?</hi> Though <note place="margin">Though God works all our good in us, yet exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the inſtrument wherby he works it.</note> the other anſwers might ſerve for this, yet ſomething may be ſpecially anſwered here, which is, that though God work all our good in us, and for us, yet it is not upon us as ſtocks or ſtones; but he dealeth ſutably to our natures, with arguments
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65695:55"/>
and reaſons: And if you ſay, To what purpoſe? Is it any more then if the Sun ſhould ſhine, or a candle be held out to a blind man? Yes, becauſe theſe exhortations and the word of God read or preached, are that inſtrument, by which God will work theſe things. Therefore you are not to look upon preaching, as a meere exhortation, but as a ſanctified <hi>medium,</hi> or inſtrument, by which God worketh that he exhorteth unto. Sometimes indeed we read, that God hath ſent his Prophets to exhort thoſe, whom yet he knew would not hearken: Thus he ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to bid <hi>Pharaoh</hi> let the people of Iſrael go, and thus the Prophets did preach, when they could not beleeve, becauſe of the deafneſſe and blindneſſe upon them. But unto the godly theſe are operative meanes, and practicall, even as when God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light;</hi> or, when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Lazarus, come forth of the grave.</hi> And this by the way ſhould keep you from deſpiſing the moſt plain miniſtery or preaching that is; for, a Sermon doth not work upon your hearts, as it is thus elegant, thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, but as it is an inſtrument of God, appointed to ſuch an end: Even as <hi>Austin</hi> ſaid, <hi>The conduits of water, though one might be in the ſhape of an Angel, another of a beaſt, yet the water doth refreſh as it is water, not as it comes from ſuch a conduit; or the ſeed that is thrown into the ground fructifieth, even that which comes from a plain hand, as well as that which may have golden rings or jewels upon it:</hi> not but that the Miniſter is to improve his gifts, <hi>Qui dedit</hi> Petrum <hi>piſcatorem, dedit</hi> Cyprianum <hi>rhetorem,</hi> but onely to ſhew whence the power of God is. <hi>Bonorum ingeniorum inſignis est indoles, in verbis verum amare, non verba.

                  <note place="margin">How conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance may be ſaid to be our acts.</note> 
                  <hi>as well as the effects of Gods grace.</hi> And this cannot be denyed but that we are the ſubject, who being <hi>acti<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> agimus,</hi> enabled by grace, do work; for, grace cannot be but in an intelligent ſubject: As before the Manna fell upon the ground, there fell a dew, which (ſay Interpreters) was preparatory to conſtringe and bind the earth, that it might receive the Manna; ſo doth reaſon and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty qualifie the ſubject, that it is paſſively capable of grace: but when enabled by grace, it is made active alſo. Theſe be places indeed have ſtuck much upon ſome, which hath made them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65695:56"/>
Why, if thoſe Promiſes of God converting us do prove converſion to be his act, ſhould not other places alſo, which bid us turn unto the Lord, prove that it is our Act? The anſwer is eaſie: none deny, but that to beleeve, and to turn unto God, are our acts; we cannot beleeve without the minde and will. That of <hi>Auſtin</hi> is ſtrong and good, <hi>If, becauſe it's ſaid,</hi> Not of him that willeth and runneth, but of him that ſheweth mercy, <hi>man is made a partiall cauſe with God, then we may as well ſay, Not in him that ſheweth mercy, but in him that runneth and willeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether we can doe this of our ſelves, with grace?</hi> Or, <hi>Whether grace onely enable us to doe it?</hi> That diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Bernards</hi> is very cleere: The heart of a man is the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum in quo,</hi> but not <hi>à quo;</hi> the ſubject <hi>in which,</hi> not <hi>from which</hi> this grace proceedeth: Therefore you are not to conceive, when grace doth enable the mind and will to turn unto God, as if thoſe motions of grace had ſuch an impreſſion upon the heart, as when the ſeal imprints a ſtamp upon the wax, or when wine is poured into the veſſell, where the ſubject recipient doth not move, or ſtirre at all: Nor is it as when <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſſe ſpake, or as when a ſtone is thrown into a place, nor as an enthuſiaſticall or arreptitious motion, as thoſe that ſpake oracles, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not; Nor as thoſe that are poſſeſſed of Satan, which did many things, wherein the minde and will had no action at all: but the Spirit of God inclineth the Will and Affections to their proper object.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Antinomians ſimilitude ſound, that (as you heard) makes God converting of a man, to be as when a Phyſician poureth down his potion into the ſick-mans throat, whether he will or no: For it is moſt true, that the Will, in the illicite and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate acts of it, cannot be forced by any power whatſoever: It's impoſſible that a man ſhould beleeve unwillingly; for to beleeve, requireth an act of the Will. The School-men diſpute, Whether fear, or ignorance, or luſt do not compell the will; and they do rightly conclude, that it cannot: Therefore, though a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion be reſiſted by the corrupt heart &amp; will of a man, yet when it is overcome by the grace of God, it turneth willingly unto him. Therefore this argument, though it ſeem ſtrange, yet we may ſay of it as he in another caſe, <hi>Hoc argumentum non venit à Dea Suada.</hi>

                  <hi>grace ſhall come; for, if we have no power, why are men exhorted to come to Christ, and reade the Word?</hi> And indeed, this hath ſo wrought upon ſome, that they have not uſed any meanes at all, but expect Gods providence to be a ſupplyer of all, as <hi>Brentius</hi> (if I miſtake not) relateth of an Anabaptiſt woman, who invited many to ſupper, and never provided any thing, expecting God would do it. Now this Queſtion is built upon a falſhood, as if a mans working were wholly excluded; whereas you are to know, that there are two kinds of holy things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There are holy things that are internally and eſſentially ſo,</hi> and theſe we cannot doe without God, <hi>John 15. Without me ye can do nothing.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>There are holy actions externally ſo,</hi> as to come to heare the Word preached, to reade and meditate upon the Word: experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth, that men have a naturall power to this; witneſſe thoſe many Comments and learned Expoſitions, that men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any grace have made upon the Scripture. Now it's true, to doe any of theſe holily is Gods act, <hi>The naturall man perceiveth not the things of God:</hi> and, <hi>God opened Lydia's heart.</hi> But yet God converteth in the uſe of theſe meanes. He will not ordinarily change the heart of any, that doth not wait at the gates of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Therefore God doth not work upon the heart, as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer uſeth his inſtrument, but he commands to reade and hear; and this is the organ, or the meanes by which the Spirit of God will change his heart. Now indeed, when a man readeth or heareth any naturall or philoſophicall truth, he is able by theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſtrength left in nature, to comprehend them, but he cannot in the ſame manner bring forth any thoughts or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of heart ſutable unto thoſe ſpirituall myſteries laid open before him. But now the patrons of Nature ſpeak otherwiſe; they ſay it is, as if a man, almoſt ſpent by a diſeaſe, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive phyſick, and ſo that phyſick doth repaire and increaſe ſtrength, not infuſe ſtrength: Or, as a bird tyed by a ſtring, that hath a power to flye, onely is outwardly hindered, ſo that they

ſuppoſe a latent power in Nature to be excited and ſtirred up by grace: we ſay, the power muſt be firſt infuſed.</p>

                  </gap>, that it's taken from the cuſtome of men, and goeth to make up the parable.

of God giveth theſe diverſity of gifts, as he pleaſeth, this wholly overthroweth that expoſition. Therefore the Papiſts, <hi>Barradius</hi> and <hi>Maldonat,</hi> do confeſſe it makes onely <hi>ad ornatum, non ad rem per parabolam ſignificatam;</hi> and that it's taken from the cuſtome of men, who uſe indeed to look to the gifts of men, their prudence and fidelity: but we know by experience, God did not ſo. But if we make an argument of it, then this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or capacity muſt be either ſupernaturall, and then it's the gift of God; or if of naturall capacity, as ſometimes to him that hath excellent parts, a prompt wit, an happy memory, God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the habit of Divinity (for there is ſuch a thing that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the habit of faith) and a gift of interpreting Scripture, although that naturall dexterity be a gift of God alſo, but in another kind; and then God doth not tye or bind himſelf to this way: and therefore, if we ſhould ſay, as ſome do, God gave the ſpirit of government to <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe by nature he was moſt prudent and meek; yet it's not univerſally ſo, becauſe God gave to <hi>Saul</hi> a ſpirit of government from his own meere good will, without any reſpect to <hi>Saul.</hi> And how many men of parts have been ſo farre from being bleſt, becauſe of theſe naturall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, that they have turned their wedge of gold into an idoll, to worſhip it?</p>

               <p>WE come now in order to the law God gave <hi>Adam;</hi> and this may be conſidered two wayes: Firſt, as <hi>a Law,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as <hi>a Covenant.</hi> We will handle it firſt in the former no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now, becauſe the law God gave <hi>Adam</hi> was partly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and partly poſitive, both which did goe to the making up of that covenant, I ſhall handle both thoſe diſtinctly: and firſt, let us conſider Gods <hi>poſitive law</hi> in the text, which is alſo called by Divines, a <hi>ſymbolicall precept,</hi> becauſe the obedience unto it was a <hi>ſymbolum</hi> or outward teſtimony of our homage and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God. And the object of this command is not a thing good or bad in its own nature, but indifferent, and only evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe prohibited: So that in the words you have the object of this negative precept deſcribed two wayes; firſt, by that which is proper to it, the tree of knowledge of good and evil: ſecondly, by that which is accidentall to it, <hi>viz.</hi> death infallibly upon the eating of it. And that this commandement might be the better received, in the Verſe before, God giveth a large commiſſion to eate of any other tree beſides this. When God made this world as a great houſe, he puts man into it as his tenant; and by this tryall of obedience, he muſt acknowledge his Land-lord. That <hi>Adam</hi> did eate in the ſtate of innocency, and was hungry, doth appeare by this text; onely hunger was not in him, as it is in us, with paine and trouble. The difficulties muſt be handled in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65695:58"/>
the opening of the doctrine, which is, <hi>That God beſides the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall law engraven in</hi> Adams <hi>heart, did give a poſitive law, to try his obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The doubts in explicating of this point are, 1. <hi>What is meant by the tree of knowledge of good and evill?</hi> And here, certainly, wee muſt take heed of being too curious, leſt, as it was <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, to eate of it; ſo it may be our curioſity to dive too farre into the knowledge of it. Now when I aske what is meant by it, I doe not underſtand what kind of fruit or tree it was, whether apple or fig, (that cannot be determined) but why it had that name. The Rabbins, who have as many fooliſh dreames about the Old Teſtament, as the Friars about the New, conceive <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to be created without the uſe of reaſon, and that this tree was to accelerate it. And, indeed, the Socinians border upon this opinion, for they ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were created very <note n="*" place="margin">Tanta fuit <hi>Adami</hi> recens conditi stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditas, ut major in infantos cadere non poſtit.</note> ſimple, and weak in underſtanding; and, ſay they, it's impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to conceive, that if <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule were created ſo adorned with all knowledge and graces (as the firmament is beſpangled with ſtars) how he ſhould come to eate of the forbidden fruit, or to ſin againſt God.</p>
               <p>But both theſe are falſe. That he had perfect knowledge, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in his giving names to the creatures, and to <hi>Eve,</hi> ſo fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">The tree of knowledge why ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> and apt; and, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. the image of God is ſaid to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed mind: and that though thus knowing, he did yet ſin; and though thus holy, hee did yet fall; it was becauſe hee was not perfectly confirmed, but mutable. Indeed Divines doe much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to expreſſe how his ſin did begin, whether in the Will firſt, or in the Underſtanding; but that is impertinent to this matter. That which is the moſt received, both by <hi>Austin</hi> and others, is, that it was ſo called, not from any effect, but from the event, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it did indeed experimentally make to know good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: and ſo it's uſuall in Scripture to call that by a name, which it had afterward. Now though this be generally received, and cannot well be rejected, yet certainly it may be further ſaid, that it was not called ſo by the meere event, but by the divine decree and appointment of God, as being given to be a boundary and limit to <hi>Adam,</hi> that hee ſhould not deſire to know more, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then God had appointed.</p>

                     </gap>, did give a poſitive law: 1. That the power which God had over him might be the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently held forth.</note> 
                  <hi>law in his heart.</hi> There are theſe reaſons commonly given:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That hereby Gods dominion and power over man might be the more acknowledged:</hi> for to obey the naturall law, might be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary condition, and not an act of the Will: Even as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens doe abſtaine from many ſins, not becauſe forbidden by God, but as diſſonant to their naturall reaſon. And even among Chriſtians there is a great deale of difference between good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are done becauſe God commands, and becauſe of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conſcience. Theſe two principles make the ſame actions to differ in their whole nature. Therefore God would try <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> by ſome poſitive law, that ſo the dominion and power which God had over him might be the more eminently held forth: and therefore <hi>Adam</hi> in this was not to conſider the greatneſſe or goodneſſe of the matter, but the will of the commander.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another reaſon, which floweth from the former, is, <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. To try and manifeſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo</hi> Adams <hi>obedience might be the more tryed, and be manifeſted to be obedience.</hi> For, as <hi>Auſtine,</hi> ſpeaking of himſelfe in confeſſing his wickedneſſe, that <hi>though he had no need or temptation to ſin, yet to be a ſinner he delighted in that; Nulla alia cauſa malitiae, niſi mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia:</hi> ſo on the contrary, it's an excellent aggravation of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when there is <hi>nulla alia cauſa obedientiae, niſi obedientia;</hi> ſo that the forbearing to eate, was not from any ſin in the action, but from the will of the law-giver. And <hi>Austine</hi> doth well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine this: <hi>If a man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>forbid another to touch ſuch an herb, becauſe it's poyſon, this herb is contrary to a mans health, whether it be forbidden or no: Or if a man forbid a thing, becauſe it will be an hinderance to him that forbiddeth; as to take away a mans mony, or goods, here it's forbidden, becauſe it would be loſſe to him that forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: but if a man forbids that which is neither of theſe waies hurtfull, therefore it's forbidden, becauſe</hi> bonum obedientiae per ſe, &amp; malum inobedientiae per ſe monſtraretur.</p>
               <p>And this is alſo further to be obſerved, that though the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto this poſitive law be far inferiour unto that of the morall law, becauſe the object of one is inwardly good and the object of the other rather a profeſſion of obedience, then obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet the diſobedience unto the poſitive law is no leſſe hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65695:59"/>
then that to the morall law, becauſe hereby man doth profeſſedly acknowledge he will not ſubmit to God: Even as a vaſſall, that is to pay ſuch homage a yeare, if he wilfully refuſe it, doth yearly acknowledge his refractorineſſe. Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth expreſly call <hi>Adams</hi> ſin <hi>diſobedience, Rom.</hi> 5. not in a generall ſenſe, as every ſin is diſobedience; but ſpecifically it was (ſtrictly taken) the ſin of diſobedience: he did by that act caſt off the dominion and power that God had over him, as much as in him lay; and though pride and unbelief were in this ſin, yet this was properly his ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Why God would make this law, ſeeing he fore-knew his fall, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The proper eſſentiall end of the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive law was to exerciſe <hi>Adams</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> 
                  <hi>abuſe of it.</hi> For ſuch is the profane boldneſſe of many men, that would have a reaſon of all Gods actions, whereas this is as <note n="*" place="margin">Altitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem conſilii ejus penetrare non poſſum, &amp; longè ſupra vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res meas eſſe confiteor, <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> if the Owle would look into the Sun, or the Pigmee meaſure the Pyramides. Although this may be anſwered without that of <hi>Pauls, Who artthou, O man, &amp;c.</hi> for God did not give him this law to make him fall; <hi>Adam</hi> had power to ſtand. Therefore the proper eſſentiall end of this commandement was to exerciſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dams</hi> obedience. Hence there was no iniquity or unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in God. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth confeſſe, that God may doe that, which if man ſhould doe, hee ſinned: as, for inſtance, Man is bound to hinder him from ſin that he knoweth would doe it, if it lay in his power; but God is not ſo tyed, both becauſe hee hath the chiefe providence, it's fit he ſhould let cauſes work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their nature; and therefore <hi>Adam,</hi> being created free, hee might ſin, as well as not ſin; as alſo becauſe God can work evill things out of good; and laſtly, becauſe God, if hee ſhould hinder all evill things, there would many good things be wanting to the world, for there is nothing which ſome doe not abuſe. The Engliſh Divines in the Synod of Dort held, that <hi>God had a ſerious will of ſaving all men, but not an efficacious will of ſaving all:</hi> Thus differing from the Arminians on one ſide, and from ſome Proteſtant Authours on the other ſide; and their great inſtance of the poſſibility of a <hi>ſerious will</hi> and <hi>not efficacious,</hi> is this of Gods to <hi>Adam,</hi> ſeriouſly willing him to ſtand, and with all giving him ability to ſtand: yet it was not ſuch an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious will, as <hi>de facto</hi> did make him ſtand; for, no queſtion, God could have confirmed the will of <hi>Adam</hi> in good, as well as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65695:60"/>
that of the Angels and the glorified Saints in heaven. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth of this their Aſſertion, we are to enquire in its time. But for the matter in hand, if by a <hi>ſerious will</hi> be meant a will of approbation and complacency, yea and efficiency in ſome ſenſe, no queſtion but God did ſeriouſly will his ſtanding, when he gave that commandement. And howſoever <hi>Adam</hi> did fall, becauſe he had not ſuch help that would in the event make him ſtand, yet God did not withdraw or deny any help unto him, whereby he was enabled to obey God. To deny <hi>Adam</hi> that help, which ſhould indeed make him ſtand, was no neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite at all on Gods part.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, that of <hi>Auſtins</hi> is good, <hi>God would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſin to be, if he could not have wrought greater good then ſin was evill:</hi> not that God needed ſin to ſhew his glory; for he needed no glory from the creature: but it pleaſed him to permit ſin, that ſo thereby the riches of his grace and goodneſſe might be manifeſted unto the children of his love. And if Arminians will not be ſatisfied with theſe Scripture conſiderations, wee will ſay as <hi>Austine</hi> to the Hereticks, <hi>Illigarriant, nos credamus,</hi> Let them prate while we beleeve.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Whether this law would have obliged all posterity.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <note place="margin">The poſitive law did lay an obligation upon <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity.</note> wee muſt conclude, that this poſitive command was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, and that <hi>Adam</hi> is here taken collectively; for, although that <hi>Adam</hi> was the perſon to whom this command was given, yet it was not perſonall, but to <hi>Adam</hi> as an head, or common perſon: Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. all are ſaid to ſin in him, for whether it be <hi>in him,</hi> or, <hi>in as much as all have ſinned,</hi> it cometh to the ſame purpoſe; for how could all be ſaid to have ſinned, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were in him? And this is alſo further to be proved by the commination, <hi>In the day thou eatest thereof, thou ſhalt dye:</hi> now all the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> dyeth hereby. Beſides, the ſame reaſons which prove a conveniency for a poſitive law, beſides the naturall for <hi>Adam,</hi> doe alſo inferre for <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity. It is true, ſome Divines that doe hold a poſitive law would have been, yet ſeem to be afraid to affirme fully, that the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> would have been tryed with the very ſame comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of eating the forbidden fruit: but I ſee no cauſe of queſtioning it. Now all this will be further cleared, when wee
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65695:60"/>
come to ſhew, that this is not meerly <hi>a law,</hi> but <hi>a covenant,</hi> and ſo by that meanes there is a communicating of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne unto his poſterity. And, indeed, if God had not dealt in a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant way in this thing, there could be no more reaſon, why <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne ſhould be made ours, then the ſinnes of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate parents are made ours. I know <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> (and he quoteth <hi>Bucer)</hi> is of a minde, that the ſinnes of the immediate parents are made the ſins of the poſterity; and <hi>Austin</hi> inclineth much to that way: but this may ſerve to confute it, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. doth ſtill lay death upon one mans diſobedience. Now, if our parents and anceſtors were as full a cauſe as <hi>Adam</hi> was, why ſhould the accuſation be ſtill laid upon him? But of this more hereafter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>How the threatning was fulfilled upon him, when he did eat of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adam,</hi> by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, became mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and in the ſtate of death, not naturall onely, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and eternall alſo.</note> 
                  <hi>the forbidden fruit.</hi> We need not run to the anſwer of ſome, that this was ſpoken onely by way of threatning, and not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, as that ſentence upon the Ninivites; for theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, therefore <hi>Adam</hi> died not, becauſe of his repentance: but <hi>Adam</hi> did not immediately repent, and when he did, yet for all that he died. Others reade it thus, <hi>In the day thou eatest thereof,</hi> and then make the words abſolute that follow, <hi>Thou ſhalt die:</hi> as if God had ſaid, There is no day excepted from thy death, when thou ſhalt eate. But the common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is beſt, which takes <hi>to die,</hi> for <hi>to be in the ſtate of death:</hi> and therefore <hi>Symmachus</hi> his tranſlation is commended, which hath, <hi>Thou ſhalt be mortall;</hi> ſo that hereby is implyed a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a change of <hi>Adams</hi> ſtate as ſoon as he ſhould eate this forbidden fruit: And by <hi>death,</hi> we are not onely to meane that of the actuall diſſolution of ſoule and body, but all diſeaſes and paines, that are the harbingers of it. So that hereby Chriſtians are to be raiſed higher, to be more Eagle-eyed then Philoſophers: They ſpake of death and diſeaſes, as tributes to be paid, they complained of Nature as a ſtep-mother; but they were not able to ſee ſin the cauſe of this. Yea, in this threatning we are to underſtand ſpirituall death, and eternall alſo. Indeed, it's made a queſtion, <hi>Whether, if</hi> Adam <hi>had continued, be ſhould have been tranſlated into heaven, or confirmed onely in Paradiſe?</hi> but that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65695:61"/>
his death would have been more then temporall, appeareth fully by <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Indeed, the things that concern heaven and hell, or the reſurrection, are not ſo frequently and plainly mentioned in the Old Teſtament as in the New; yet there are ſufficient places to convince, that the Promiſes and threatnings in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament were not onely temporall, as ſome doe moſt erroneouſly maintain.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Whether</hi> Adam <hi>was mortall, before his eating of the forbidden</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>fruit.</hi> And this indeed is a very famous queſtion; but I ſhall not be large in it. The orthodox they hold, that immortality was a priviledge of innocency, and that <hi>Adams</hi> body then onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came mortall, when his ſoule was made ſinfull. This is vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently oppoſed by Papiſts, and by Socinians: now they both agree, that man ſhould not actually have dyed, but for ſin; only they ſay, he was mortall, as the Socinians, or immortall, by a meere ſupernaturall gift of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But a thing may be ſaid to be <hi>immortall</hi> ſeverall wayes, as the Learned obſerve: 1. From an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <note place="margin">A thing may be ſaid to be <hi>immortall</hi> foure wayes.</note> neceſſity, either inward or outward; in this ſenſe God only is ſaid to be immortall. 2. When there is no inward materiall cauſe of diſſolution, though outwardly it may be deſtroyed; and thus are Angels, and the ſoules of men. 3. A thing may be ſaid to be immortall by ſome ſpeciall gift and appointment of God, as the bodies glorified: and, as ſome ſay, the heavens and maine parts of the world ſhall have only a qualitative alteration, not a ſubſtantiall abolition. 4. That is immortall, which hath no propenſity to death, yet ſuch a condition being put, it will die; and thus <hi>Adam</hi> was: therefore in ſome ſenſe he may be ſaid mortall, in another immortall: But becauſe he is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mortall that is obnoxious to death, therefore we ſay, <hi>Adam,</hi> before his ſin, was immortall; and this is abundantly confirmed by this ſentence of commination. And therefore though <hi>Adam</hi> would have eaten and drunk, though his body was elementary, and the originall of it duſt, though he would have begotten children; yet none of theſe can prove him mortall, becauſe the righteouſneſſe in his ſoule would have preſerved the fit tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of his body, eſpecially having Gods Promiſe made to his obedience.</p>

                  <hi>that curſed opinion of the mortality of the whole man, in ſoul as well as body.</hi> Of all the errours that have riſen up, there is none more horrid in nature, and more monſtrous in falſhood then this: ſo that if it could be true of any mans ſoul, that it was not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall ſubſtance, but onely a quality of the temperament; it would be true of the Authour of that Book, which ſeemeth to have little ſenſe and apprehenſion of the divine authority in the Scriptures concerning this matter. What an horrid falſhood is it to call the doctrine of the immortall ſoul an hell-hatched doctrine? And what a contradiction alſo to call it hell-hatched, when yet he holdeth there is no hell? But certainly you would think, for a man to dare to broach ſuch an opinion, he muſt have places of Scripture as viſible as the Sun. But this Text is his <hi>Achilles,</hi> and all the reſt ſhrowd under this, from which he frames his firſt and chiefeſt argument, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What of</hi> Adam <hi>was immortall through innocency, was to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliz'd by tranſgreſſion:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But whole</hi> Adam <hi>was in innocency immortall:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>all and every part, even whole man was lyable to death by ſin.</hi> But what Logician doth not ſee a great deale more foiſted into the Concluſion, then was in the Premiſes? <hi>Whole</hi> Adam <hi>was to be mortaliz'd,</hi> therefore <hi>all and every part.</hi> What a <hi>non ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> is here? That is true of the whole; as it is the whole, which is not true of every part. If I ſhould ſay, Whole Chriſt dyed, (for death is of the concrete, the perſon) therefore all and every part of Chriſt died, therefore his divine nature died; this would be a ſtrange inference: yet upon this fallacy is the frame of all his arguments built. Man is ſaid to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, whole man dieth, therefore every part of man dieth. There is difference between <hi>totum</hi> and <hi>totalii as,</hi> the <hi>whole,</hi> and <hi>every part of that whole.</hi> It's true, death doth bring the <hi>compoſitum,</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to a <hi>non-</hi>entity, but not every part of that <hi>compoſitum</hi> to a <hi>non-</hi>entity.</p>
               <p>Beſides, that which was immortall, is mortalized, according to their natures, the ſoule dieth a ſpirituall and an eternall death. But ſee how the devill carries this man further, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65695:62"/>
ſets him upon the pinacle of errour, and bids him throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf head-long; becauſe he doth evidently ſay, that if the ſouls were deſtroyed as well as the bodies, then there would be no heaven nor hell as yet; he is bold, and confeſſeth there is none till the reſurrection. Now if this be ſo, then how ſhall that be true, that the heaven muſt contain Chriſt till he come? This doth exceedingly puzzle him, but he takes <hi>the heaven</hi> for the place where the Sun is, and concludes peremptorily (as if he had been in the ſame alſo) that Chriſts glorified body is in the Sun: <hi>Without doubt</hi> (ſaith he, pag. 33.) <hi>he must be in the Sun;</hi> and (ſaith he, pag. 34.) <hi>The Sun may be called well the right hand of God, by which through Chriſt in him we live, and move, and have our being:</hi> and there ſpeaketh nothing but darkneſſe about light, as that the Sun is the vaile, to keep off the light of Chriſts body from us, which otherwiſe would be ſo glorious, we could not ſee it and live. But how dare any man make this interpretation, <hi>The heavens must contain him,</hi> that is, he muſt be in the Sun, <hi>till he come to restitution of all things?</hi> The naming of theſe things is confutation enough, onely this I brought as in a paſſage meerly, to ſee what cauſe we have to pray to God to keep us from our ſelves, and our own preſumptuous thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Of Inſtruction, that a law may be made, even to a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, and that threatnings may be menaced to a man, who yet is not under the actuall curſe and damning power of the Law.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. How the devill doth ſtill prevaile over us with this temptation of knowledge. There were Hereticks called <hi>Gnostici,</hi> and <hi>Ophitae.</hi> This deſire to eate of the tree of knowledge, hath brought much ignorance and errour. I know there are many people ſo ſottiſh and ſtupid, that the divell could never intice them with this temptation: They account it a trouble, even the knowledge of meere neceſſary things to ſalvation; but when
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65695:62"/>
men deſire to know above that which is written, this is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous precepice.</p>

               <p>YOu have heard of a two-fold law given to <hi>Adam:</hi> one by outward preſcript, for tryall and exhortation of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the other by implantation, which was the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> and of that at this time.</p>
               <p>When God had made all other things, then man, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and proxime end, was created; it being Gods goodneſſe to make no living creature before he provided the food and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of it. And thus man, the laſt, but the choiceſt exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and viſible piece of his workmanſhip, is created, but in a great difference from the former; for his creation is brought in by way of deliberation and advice, <hi>Let us make man:</hi> which words denote, 1. The excellency of the man to be made, 2. The Myſterie of the Trinitie is here implyed; for, howſoever the Jewes would have it, that he ſpoke to the Angels, or the inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate creatures: or others, that the word is uſed in the Plurall Number for dignitie ſake, as they ſhew examples in the Hebrew: yet we rather joyn with thoſe that doe think it implyed, not indeed that this text of it ſelf can prove a Trinity, for the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Number proveth no more three, then foure or two, but with other places that doe hold forth this doctrine more expreſly: ſo that in the words you have the noble and great effect, <hi>Man;</hi>

Now the Orthodox, eſpecially the Calviniſts, though they deny not but that the ſoule of a man, with the faculties thereof, may be called the <hi>image of God,</hi> ſecondarily and remotely, (herein differing from the Lutherans, who will not acknowledge thus much) ſo that principally and chiefly it be placed in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and holineſſe; yet they ſay, this cannot be gathered from the words, for theſe reaſons: 1. Becauſe <hi>verſe</hi> 27. where there is the execution of this decree in the text, there onely <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> is named, and <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. there is onely <hi>image</hi> named, and <hi>Gen. 5.

Nor is that any matter, becauſe they are put down as two Subſtantives: for that is uſuall with the Hebrewes, when the later is intended onely as an Adjective: ſo <hi>Jerem. 29. 11. To give you an end and expectation,</hi> that is, <hi>an expected end;</hi> ſo here, <hi>image</hi> and <hi>likeneſſe,</hi> that is, <hi>an image most like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It's conſiderable in what an</hi> image <hi>doth conſist.</hi> Now the <note place="margin">An Image conſiſts in likeneſſe to another pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern after which it is made. A Four-fold image.</note> Learned, they ſpeak of a four-fold <hi>image,</hi> or <hi>likeneſſe: 1. Where there is a likeneſſe in an abſolute agreement in the ſame nature:</hi> and thus the Son of God is the <hi>expreſſe image of the Father. 2. By par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of ſome univerſall nature:</hi> ſo a man and a beaſt are alike in their common nature of animality. 3. <hi>By proportion onely:</hi> as the Pilot of a ſhip, and the Governour in the Common-wealth are alike. 4. <hi>By agreement of order, when one thing is a pattern for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65695:63"/>
another to be made after it:</hi> and this is properly to be an <hi>image;</hi> for two things goe to the nature of an <hi>image: 1. Likeneſſe,</hi> and then 2. that this <hi>likeneſſe be made after another as a pattern.</hi> Thus one egge is like another, but not a pattern of another: ſo man was made like Angels, yet not after their <hi>image,</hi> as the Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would have it. So that, to be made after the image of God, implieth a likeneſſe in us to God; and then, that this likeneſſe in us, is made after that pattern which is in God. And howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever man is a body, and God a ſpirit; yet this image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may well be in other conſiderations. It was the opinion of <hi>Osiander,</hi> that therefore we are ſaid to be made after the image of God, becauſe we are made after the likeneſſe of that humane nature, which the ſecond Perſon in Trinity was to aſſume: and this hath been preached alate as probable; but that may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be confuted, when we come to handle that Queſtion, <hi>Whether Christ, as a Mediatour, was knowne and conſidered of in the ſtate of innocency?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us conſider in what that</hi> image <hi>or</hi> likeneſſe <hi>doth conſiſt.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The image of God in <hi>Adam</hi> conſiſted in the ſeverall perfections and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his ſoul. 1. In his <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> was exact knowledge of divine and naturall things.</note> Where, not ſtanding upon the rationall ſoule of a man, which we call <hi>the remote image of God,</hi> in which ſenſe, we are forbid to kill a man, or to curſe a man, becauſe he is made after the image of God; we may take notice of the ſeverall perfections and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in <hi>Adams</hi> ſoul: As, 1. <hi>In his</hi> Underſtanding <hi>there was an exact knowledge of</hi> divine <hi>and</hi> naturall <hi>things:</hi> Of <hi>divine,</hi> becauſe otherwiſe he could not have loved God, if he had not known him, nor could he be ſaid to be made <hi>very good.</hi> Hence ſome make a three-fold <hi>light:</hi> 1. That <hi>of immediate knowledge,</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> had. 2. The light <hi>of faith,</hi> which the regenerate have. 3. The light <hi>of glory,</hi> which the Saints in heaven have. Now how great is this perfection? Even <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, that <hi>a little knowledge, though conjecturall, about heavenly things, is to be preferred above much knowledge, though certain, about inferiour things.</hi> How glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious muſt <hi>Adams</hi> eſtate be, when his Underſtanding was made thus perfect? And then for <hi>inferiour things; the creatures,</hi> his knowledge appeareth in the giving of Names to all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and eſpecially unto <hi>Eve. Adam</hi> indeed did not know all things, yea he might grow in experimentall knowledge; but all
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65695:64"/>
things that were neceſſary for him, created to ſuch an happy end, to know, thoſe he did: but to know that he ſhould fall, and that Chriſt would be a Mediatour, theſe things he could not, unleſſe it were by revelation, which is not ſuppoſed to be made unto him. So, to know thoſe things which were of ornament and beauty to his ſoul, cannot be denyed him. Thus was <hi>Adam</hi> created excellent in intellectuall abilities; for ſapience, knowing God; for ſcience, knowing the creatures; and for prudence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in all things to be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His</hi> Will, <hi>which is the univerſall appetite of the whole man,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. His <hi>Will</hi> was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully good, and furniſhed with many habits of goodneſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>which is like the ſupreme orbe, that carrieth the inferiour with the power of it, this was wonderfully good, furniſhed with ſeverall habits of goodneſſe, as the firmament with ſtars:</hi> for in it was a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to all good, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24. It's called <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe:</hi> and <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 29. God made man <hi>upright:</hi> His <hi>Will</hi> was not bad, or not good, that is, indifferent; but <hi>very good.</hi> The ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of the thoughts of his heart were only good, and that continually. And certainly if <hi>David, Job.</hi> and others, who have this image reſtored in them but in part, doe yet delight in Gods will, how much more muſt <hi>Adam,</hi> who when he would doe good, found no evil preſent with him? He could not ſay as we muſt, <hi>Lord, I beleeve, help my unbelief:</hi> Lord, I love, help my want of love. He could not complain, as that man, <hi>Libenter bonus eſſe vellem, ſed cogitationes meae non patiuntur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, though his Will was thus good, he needed help from God to be able to doe any good thing. I know there are ſome learned Divines, as <hi>Pareus,</hi> that doe deny the holineſſe <hi>Adam</hi> had, or the help God gave <hi>Adam,</hi> to be truly and properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>grace; righteouſneſſe</hi> they will call it, and <hi>the gift of God,</hi> but not <hi>grace.</hi> Therefore <hi>Pareus</hi> reproveth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for ſtiling his Book <hi>de gratia primi hominis:</hi> and his reaſon is, becauſe the Scripture makes that onely grace which comes by Chriſt, and when the ſubject is in a contrary condition, as we are; but it was not ſo with <hi>Adam:</hi> but I cannot tell whether this be worth the while to diſpute. This is certain, firſt, that <hi>Adam</hi> could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere or continue in obedience to God, without help from God. Nor ſecondly, was he confirmed in a ſtate of goodneſſe, as the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65695:64"/>
Angels are; yea, as every godly man now is through Chriſt: and therefore being mutable, we may well conceive a poſſibility of his falling, though made thus holy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In his</hi> Affections. 1. <hi>Theſe tempeſts and waves were under the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. In his <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and ſubjection.</note> 
                  <hi>command of that holineſſe:</hi> They were to <hi>Adam</hi> as wings to the bird, as wheels to the chariot; and he was not, as <hi>Actaeon;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of thoſe that followed him, as it is with us: for, if you conſider <hi>Affections</hi> in the riſe of them, they did not move, or ſtirre, but when holineſſe commanded them. This is proved, in that he was made right: Therefore there could not any <hi>Affection</hi> ſtirre or move irregularly; as it's ſaid of Chriſt; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>he troubled himſelf.</hi> There were indeed <hi>Affections</hi> moving in Chriſt, and ſo in <hi>Adam;</hi> but they were as clean water moved in a clear glaſſe: but in us they are as water ſtirred in a muddy place, which caſteth great defilement. <hi>Adam</hi> therefore, being made right, he could ſet his <hi>Affections,</hi> as the Artificer doth his clock, to make it ſtrike when and what he will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe</hi> Affections <hi>are ſubjected in regard of the continuance of them.</hi> When our Affection and Paſſions are raiſed, how hardly are they compoſed again? how are we angry, and ſin? how doe we grieve, and ſin? whereas in the ſtate of innocency, they were ſo under the nurture of it, that, as we command our dogs to fetch and carry, and to lay down; ſo could <hi>Adam</hi> then do, bid come fetch ſuch an object, and then bid it to lay down again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In regard of the degrèes of them.</hi> We are ſo corrupted, that we cannot love, but we over-love; we cannot grieve, but we over-grieve: All our heat is preſently feaveriſh; but it was then far otherwiſe. Now then by this <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> you may perceive the glorious image that God put upon us, and apply it to us, who are baniſhed not onely out of a place of Paradiſe, but out of all theſe inward abilities: and who can deplore our eſtate enough?</p>
               <p>Thus was the <hi>Morall Law</hi> written in his heart: and what the command is for direction, that he was for converſation. And howſoever the Socinians deny this law written in his heart, yet acknowledging he had a conſcience, which had dictates of that which was good and righteous, it amounts almoſt to as much.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65695:65"/>
Non is it any matter, though we reade not of any ſuch outward law given to him: nor is it neceſſary to make ſuch a Queſtion, <hi>Whether the breach of the Morall Law would have undone</hi> Adam <hi>and his posterity, as well as the tranſgreſſion of the poſitive law.</hi> For all muſt neceſſarily think, that the <hi>Morall Law</hi> implanted in his heart, and obedience thereunto, was the greateſt part of <hi>Adams</hi> happineſſe and holineſſe. Although we told you, diſobedience unto that poſitive precept, which was onely for tryall, might in ſome ſenſe be judged more hainous, then diſobedience to the <hi>Morall Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>the image of God did conſist in a freedome from</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The image of God conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from all miſery and danger.</note> 
                  <hi>all feare of miſery and danger, even proportionably as God is without feare:</hi> And this happineſſe is the conſequent of his holineſſe. And if it be true of the image of God repaired in us, that it is to make us <hi>ſerve him without fear all, the dayes of our life,</hi> how much more muſt it be verified of <hi>Adam</hi> in that eſtate? And if you demand how <hi>Adam</hi> could be without feare, ſeeing he knew he might fall, and ſo become miſerable: the Anſwer is to be taken from that ſtate wherein he was created; having no guilt within him, he could have no feare: Even as ſome learned men ſay, the godly ſhall remember their ſins in heaven, yet without ſhame and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, becauſe that glorified nature is not capable of it. And this is a reaſon why <hi>Eve</hi> was not a friend of the Serpent, thought it was uſed by the devill to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>this image of God conſisted in the dominion and ſoveraignty</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. It conſiſted in that domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty <hi>Adam</hi> had over the creatures.</note> 
                  <hi>he had over the other creatures.</hi> And this was rather a conſequent of this image, then part of it; for when God had declared his will to make man after his image, then he alſo ſaid he ſhould rule over the reſt. The Socinians indeed make this the onely ground or particular wherein this image doth conſiſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hold that the woman was not made after the image of God, becauſe ſhe was made in ſubordination to the man. But that is eaſily anſwered; for, although ſhe was made in ſubjection to him, yet with dominion over the reſt of the creatures. Now we might adde alſo, that in his body there was ſomething of Gods image; as the impaſſibility of it, and the immortality: but theſe things do not come within my ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:65695:65"/>
We therefore come to ſhew the properties of this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe that was thus fixed in <hi>Adams</hi> heart.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It's called</hi> originall, <hi>to difference it from actuall holineſſe;</hi> as <note place="margin">That righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and holineſs fixed in <hi>Adam</hi> was, 1. Originall.</note> we call it <hi>originall ſin,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>actuall:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Learned call it <hi>originall,</hi> partly <hi>in regard of it ſelf,</hi> becauſe it was the firſt righteouſneſſe; partly <hi>becauſe of</hi> Adam, who had it as ſoon as he was created. As the Schools ſay of originall ſin, <hi>Quàm primum originatur homo, originatur itidem peccatum;</hi> ſo we may of <hi>Adam</hi> in his righteouſneſſe, <hi>In ortu virtus,</hi> as the Father ſaid, <hi>In ortu vitium est:</hi> and partly <hi>in regard of his poſterity,</hi> for it ſhould have been propagated to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another property of this righteouſneſſe is, <hi>That it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Univerſall.</note> 
                  <hi>comprehending the rectitude of all the parts and faculties of the ſoul:</hi> ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> was, for his ſoul, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> is ſaid to be comely for his body, from the head to the foot no blemiſh at all: ſo that this was not a perfection in one part onely, but all over; as our corruption makes us, as he ſaid of the Martyr wounded in many places, <hi>totum vulnus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It was harmonious:</hi> there was not onely rectitude in every <note place="margin">3. Harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> part, but a ſweet correſpondency one with the other; there was no rebellion or fight between the inferiour appetite and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Therefore ſome learned men ſay, This righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not to be conceived as an aggregation of ſeverall habits, but as an inward rectitude of all faculties: Even as the exact tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the body is not from any ſuperadded habit, but from the naturall conſtitution of the parts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This righteouſneſſe and holineſſe <hi>it was a perfection due to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. A perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due unto him, upon ſuppoſition of the end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto God made him.</note> Adam, <hi>ſuppoſing the end to which God made him.</hi> If God required obedience of <hi>Adam</hi> to keep the law, and happineſſe thereupon, it was due not by way of merit, but condecency to Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to furniſh him with abilities to performe it; as the ſoul of <hi>Adam</hi> was a due to him, ſuppoſing the end for which God made him. Indeed, now it's of grace to us, and in a far different conſideration made ours, becauſe we loſt it. Laſtly, this was to be a propagated righteouſneſſe; for, as it is to be proved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, God did all this in a way of covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> as a publike perſon: And howſoever every thing that <hi>Adam</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65695:66"/>
was not made ours, (we did not eate in his eating, nor drink in his drinking, we did not dreſſe the garden in his dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it) yet that which he did federally, as one in convenant with God, that is made ours; ſo his ſin and miſery is made ours, then his righteouſneſſe and happineſſe: As it is now, <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin;</hi> ſo then it would have been by one man righteouſneſſe, and life by righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Queſtions to be made:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether this righteouſneſſe was naturall to</hi> Adam, <hi>or no?</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <note place="margin">Righteouſneſs was a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſutable and connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> ſome have thought this a meere contention of words, and therefore if they were well explained, there would be no great difference; yet the Papiſts make this a foundation for other great errours: for, grant this righteouſneſſe to be ſupernaturall to <hi>Adam,</hi> as it is to us, then 1. it will follow, That all the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons riſing in the Appetite againſt Reaſon, are from the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nature; and ſo no more ſin, then hunger and thirſt is. 2. That free-will is ſtill in us, and that we have loſt nothing but that which is meerly ſuperadded to us. Or they compare this righteouſneſſe <hi>Adam</hi> had, ſometimes to an Antidote, which preſerves againſt the deadly effect of poyſon: ſometimes to a bridle, that rules the horſe; ſo that they ſuppoſe mans nature would of it ſelf rebell, but onely this was given to <hi>Adam</hi> to check it: ſometimes to <hi>Sampſons</hi> haire, whereby he had ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſtrength, but when that was cut off, he had onely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: So that by this doctrine, man, now fallen, ſhould be weaker then he was, but not corrupted. Therefore we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that this righteouſneſſe was naturall to him; not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed flowing from the principles of nature, for ſo it was of God, but it was a perfection ſutable or connaturall to him; it was not above him, as it is now in us. As a blind man that was made to ſee, though the manner was ſupernaturall, yet to ſee was a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perfection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether justifying faith was then in</hi> Adam? Or, <hi>Whether faith</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adam</hi> had power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, ſo farre as it did not imply an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in the ſubject.</note> 
                  <hi>and repentance are now parts of that image?</hi> This is a diſpute among Arminians, who plead <hi>Adam</hi> had not a power to beleeve in Chriſt, and therefore it's unjuſt in God to require faith of us, who never had power in <hi>Adam</hi> to doe it. The Anſwer is eaſie,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65695:66"/>
that <hi>Adam</hi> had power to beleeve, ſo farre as it did not imply an imperfection in the ſubject. It was a greater power then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt, and therefore it was from the defect of an object that he could not doe it: as <hi>Adam</hi> had love in him, yet there could be no miſerable objects in that ſtate to ſhew his love.</p>
               <p>As for that other Queſtion, <hi>Whether repentance be part of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Repentance, as it flowes from a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate nature, reductively the image of God.</note> 
                  <hi>image of God? Anſw.</hi> So farre forth as it denoteth an imperfection in the ſubject, it cannot be the image of God; for we doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble God in theſe things: yet as it floweth from a regenerated nature, ſo farre it is reductively the image of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether this ſhall be restored to us in this life again?</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <note place="margin">Gods image not fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in us in this life.</note> we are ſaid to be <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> and to be <hi>renewed in the image of God;</hi> yet we ſhall not in this life have it fully repaired. God hath declared his will in this, and therefore are thoſe ſtubs of ſin and imperfection left in us, that we might be low in our ſelves, bewaile our loſſe, and long for that heaven, where the ſoule ſhall be made holy, and the body immortall: yet, for all this, we are to pray for the full abolition of ſin in this life, becauſe Gods will and our duty, to <hi>be holy as he is holy,</hi> is the ground of our prayer, and not his decree for to have ſuch or ſuch things done. Yea, this corruption is ſo farre rooted in us now, that it is not cleanſed out of us by meere death, but by cinerifaction, conſuming the body to aſhes: for we know, <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and others that died, being reſtored again to life, yet could not be thought to have the image of God perfectly, as they were obnoxious to ſin and death.</p>
               <p>Uſe 1. <hi>To humble our ſelves under this great loſſe.</hi> Conſider what we were, and what we are, how holy once, how unholy now: and here who can but take up bitter mourning? Shall we lament, becauſe we are baniſhed from houſes and habitations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have loſt our eſtates, and comforts? and ſhall we not be affected here? This argueth us to be carnall more then ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: we have loſt a father, a friend, and we wring our hands; we cry, We are undone: and though we have loſt God and his image, all happineſſe thereby, yet we lay it not to heart. Oh think what a glorious thing it was to enjoy God without any interruption; no proud heart, no earthly heart, no lazie heart to grapple with: ſee it in <hi>Paul, O wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65695:67"/>
                  <hi>Baſil</hi> compareth <hi>Paul</hi> to a man thrown off his horſe, and dragg'd after him, and he cryeth out for help; ſo is <hi>Paul</hi> thrown down by his corruptions, and dragg'd after them.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2. <hi>To magnifie the grace of God in Chriſt, which is more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſave us, then</hi> Adams <hi>ſin can be to deſtroy us.</hi> This is of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the godly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. the Apoſtle, on purpoſe, makes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between them, and ſheweth the preheminency of one to ſave, above the other to deſtroy. There is more in Chriſt to ſave, then in <hi>Adam</hi> to damne: Chriſts obedience is a greater good, then <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is an evil: It's more honour to God, then this is or can be a diſhonour. Let not then ſin be great in thy thoughts, in thy conſcience, in thy feares; and grace ſmall and weak. As the time hath been, when thy heart hath felt the gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood of ſin; ſo let it be to feel the power of Chriſt. As thy ſoul hath ſaid, <hi>By one man ſin;</hi> ſo let it ſay, <hi>By one man life.</hi>

               <p>I Have already handled this Text, as it containeth a law given to <hi>Adam</hi> by God, as a foveraigne Lord over him; now I ſhall re-aſſume this Text, and conſider it as part of a Covenant, which God did enter into with <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity; for theſe two things, <hi>a Law,</hi> and <hi>a Covenant,</hi> ariſe from different grounds: The <hi>Law</hi> is from God as ſupreme, and having abſolute power, and ſo requiring ſubjection; the other ariſeth from the love and goodneſſe of God, whereby he doth ſweeten and mollifie that power of his, and ingageth himſelf to reward that obedience, which were otherwiſe due, though God ſhould never recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it. The words therefore being heretofore explained, and the Text eas'd of all difficulties, I obſerve this Doctrine, That <hi>God did</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> 
                  <hi>not only, as a Law-giver, injoys obedience unto</hi> Adam; <hi>but as a loving God, did alſo enter into covenant with him.</hi> And for the opening of this, you muſt take theſe Conſiderations:</p>

1. <hi>That this covenant with</hi> Adam <hi>in the ſtate of innocency, is more</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall more obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid down, then the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant off grace after the fall.</note> 
                  <hi>obſcurely laid down, then the covenant of grace after the fall:</hi> for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards you have the expreſſe name of the Covenant, and the ſolemne entring into it by both parties; but this Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> muſt only be gathered by deduction and conſequence. This Text cometh the neereſt to a Covenant, becauſe here is the threatning expreſſed, and ſo by conſequent ſome good thing promiſed to obedience. We are not therefore to be ſo rigid, as to call for expreſſe places, which doe name this Covenant; for that which is neceſſarily and immediately drawn from Scripture, is as truly Scripture, as that which is expreſly contained in it. Now there are theſe grounds to prove God dealt in theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements by way of Covenant:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From the evil threatned, and the good promiſed.</hi> For, while <note place="margin">That God dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> by way of Covenant, appeares, 1. From evil threatned, and good promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> there is a meere command, ſo long it is a law onely; but when it is further confirmed by promiſes and threatnings, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Covenant. And if that poſition be true of ſome, which maketh the tree of life a ſacrament, then here was not onely <hi>nudum pactum,</hi> a meer covenant; but a ſeale alſo to confirme it. And certainly, being God was not bound to give <hi>Adam</hi> eternall life if he did obey, ſeeing he owed obedience to God under the title of a creature, it was of his meere goodneſſe to become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a promiſe for this. I know it's a Queſtion by ſome, <hi>Whether</hi> Adam, <hi>upon his obedience, ſhould have been tranſlated into heaven, or confirmed onely in that naturall life, which was marvellous happy?</hi> But either way would have been by meer promiſe of God, not by any naturall neceſſity. Life muſt be extended as farre as death; now the death threatned was not onely a bodily death, but death in hell: why therefore ſhould not the life promiſed be a life in heaven?</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, another argument to confirme that God <note place="margin">2. Becauſe his poſterity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes guilty of his ſin, and obnoxious to his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> dealt in a Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> is, <hi>in that his poſterity becomes guilty of his ſin, and ſo obnoxious unto the ſame puniſhment which was inflicted upon</hi> Adam <hi>in his own perſon.</hi> Now we muſt come to be thus in <hi>Adam,</hi> either by a naturall propagation, and then <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be no more to us then our parents, and our parents ſins ſhould be made ours as well as <hi>Adams;</hi> which is contrary to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65695:68"/>
the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. who chargeth it ſtill upon one man. And beſides, who can ſay, that the righteouſneſſe, holineſſe and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, which we ſhould have been partakers of in <hi>Adams</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, could come by a naturall neceſſity, but onely by the meere covenant and agreement of God? <hi>Adams</hi> repentance might then have been imputed to us, as well as his ſin.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. makes all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> as the godly are in Chriſt: now beleevers come to receive of Chriſt, not from a naturall neceſſity, becauſe they have that humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which Chriſt took upon him, (for ſo all ſhould be ſaved) but by a federall agreement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us conſider in the next place, what a Covenant doth imply;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A Covenant implies Gods decree, will, or promiſe to, &amp; concerning his creatures, whether ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationall.</note> 
                  <hi>first in the word, then in the thing ſignified.</hi> For I ſhould deal very imperfectly, if I did not ſpeak ſomething of the generall nature of it, though hereafter more may be ſpoken of. You may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take notice, that there are things among men, that doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a publike obligation, that yet doe differ: A <hi>Law,</hi> a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and a <hi>Testament.</hi> Now a <hi>Law</hi> and a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and doe not imply any conſent of the party under them: As a <hi>Law</hi> requireth ſubjection, not attending unto, or expecting the conſent of inferiours; and ſo a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> or a Will of man, is to bequeath ſuch goods and legacies unto a man, not expecting a conſent. Indeed ſometimes ſuch goods are bequeathed with a condition, and ſo a man may refuſe whether he will be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or no; but this is accidentall to the nature of a <hi>Teſtament.</hi> But a <hi>Covenant,</hi> that differs from the two former, in that it doth require conſent and agreement between two parties: and in Divinity, if it be between man entire and upright, it is called by ſome, <hi>A Covenant of friendſhip;</hi> if it be between God and man fallen, it is called, <hi>A Covenant of reconciliation.</hi> Hence in Covenants, that are not <hi>nuda pacta</hi> (meer Covenants) but are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſome ſolemnities, there were ſtipulations added, which were done by Queſtion and Anſwer: <hi>Doe you promiſe? I promiſe.</hi> Hence it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and we call it <hi>Stipulation,</hi> from the Latine word, which comes from the Greek word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is as much as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe theſe words did make the Covenant valid. As for <hi>Iſidorus</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:65695:68"/>
his etymology of ſtipulation, <hi>à frangendis ſtipulis,</hi> becauſe, when they promiſed or entred into an agreement, they brake a ſtick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and then joyning it together, ſo made a promiſe, and every party kept a piece, as a tally, to maintain their agreement; this is rejected by the learned <hi>Salmaſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe a <hi>Covenant</hi> doth thus differ from a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> hence hath it troubled the Learned, why the Hebrew word, which ſignifieth <hi>a Covenant,</hi> ſhould be tranſlated by the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Teſtament;</hi> and ſo the New Teſtament uſeth it in this ſenſe: for, if it be a <hi>Covenant,</hi> how can it be a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> which implyeth no conſent? Let us anſwer firſt to the word, and then to the matter. Therefore is a <hi>Covenant</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> and not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as <hi>Aquila</hi> tranſlates it) becauſe this word is of a large ſenſe, coming from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to <hi>order</hi> and <hi>diſpoſe:</hi> and when we ſay, the New or Old <hi>Testament,</hi> it is not to be taken ſo ſtrictly, as we call a mans <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Teſtament,</hi> though ſometimes the Apoſtle doth, in reference to Chriſts death; but more largely, for Gods gracious ordering of ſuch mercies and ſpirituall benefits to us, by the death of Chriſt: for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace implyeth Chriſts death, it being a Covenant of reconciliation. Now, becauſe there is in the Covenant of grace ſomething of a Covenant, and ſomething of a Teſtament alſo, hence ſome do call it a <hi>Testament-Covenant,</hi> becauſe it is of a mixt nature. The riſe of the Hebrew word <hi>Berith</hi> is variouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured: ſome make it to come from a word that ſignifieth <hi>to eat,</hi> becauſe of the ſacrifices and feaſts that were at a Covenant: ſome from a word that ſignifieth <hi>to cut,</hi> becauſe then in the ſtriking of the Covenant, there was a diviſion of the beaſt that was killed: ſome from the word that ſignifieth <hi>to create,</hi> as alſo <hi>to order</hi> and <hi>diſpoſe</hi> things by way of likeneſſe: ſome from a word that ſignifieth <hi>to be pure,</hi> and <hi>to chooſe,</hi> either becauſe it's by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or becauſe in Covenants they ought to deal without all fraud: but I ſtand not upon theſe things.</p>
               <p>By this which hath been ſaid it may appeare, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> though it be truly called a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; yet no wayes a Teſtament, becauſe there did not intervene the death of any to procure this good for <hi>Adam.</hi> Now to all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65695:69"/>
this that hath been ſaid, there muſt this caution be added, <hi>That a Covenant is not ſo properly ſaid to be with God and man, as between man and man:</hi> for among them conſent is requiſite, and doth mutually concurre to make the Covenant valid: but neither in the Covenant of Nature or Grace is this conſent anteceding the validity of the Covenant required in man. Therefore if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the uſe of the word, and the application of it, it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note Gods decree, and will, or promiſe about things, whether about the irrationall creatures, or the reaſonable: Such was Gods Covenant not to drown the world, and Gods Covenant with day and night; yea, Gods Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> did induce an obligation and tye upon <hi>Abraham</hi> to circumciſe his childe. And thus it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> Gods Covenant did not depend properly upon his conſent and acceptation, for he was bound to doe as God commanded, whether he would agree, or no.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Adams</hi> conſent was not neceſſary to make the Covenant valid, doth appeare, in that he was bound to accept what God did require. And it's indeed diſputed, Whether <hi>Adam</hi> did ſo much as know (and if he did not know, he could not conſent) that God did indent with him as a publike perſon, and ſo all his poſterity in him; although it may truly be thought, that <hi>Adam</hi> did know this precept to be to him and his poſterity: for hereby his ſinne is made the more hainous, in undoing himſelf and all his; as alſo, by the knowledge of this, he would be the more thankfull unto God, that ſhould propagate ſuch great mercies to him and his, and alſo be made more vigilant againſt falling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In the next place let us conſider, how God can be ſaid to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God enters into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with man by way of condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp; makes promiſes unto him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme him in his hope and confidence in him.</note> 
                  <hi>or enter into a promiſe with man:</hi> for it may be thought an imperfection, and hereby God may ſeeme to loſe his right, that he cannot doe what he will. But this may be eaſily anſwered; for, if God can give good things to man, he may alſo promiſe to give them: and therefore both to give, and to promiſe to give, are acts of liberality and dominion, and ſo not repugning to the majeſty of God: Nor doth God by promiſing to give, loſe his dominion, no more then he doth by giving. It is true, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65695:69"/>
doth induce an obligation, and ſo in man it is with ſome imperfection; but in God it is not, becauſe he doth not hereby become obliged to us, but to his own ſelf: ſo that we have not a right of juſtice to the thing, becauſe God hath promiſed it to us; but only God cannot deny himſelf nor his word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are confident.</p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>Aquinas</hi> well, <hi>Deus non eſt debitor, quia ad alia non ordinatur, ſed omnia ad ipſum,</hi> God by covenanting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing doth not become a debtor, becauſe he is not to be ordered for other things, but all things for him. Hence is that ſaying of God, <hi>Reddit debita nulli debens, donat debita nihil pendens:</hi> And ſo again, <hi>Justus eſt, non quia reddit debitum, ſed quia facit quod decet ſummè bonum:</hi> So that when God entreth into a covenant or promiſe, you muſt conceive of this ſutably to his great majeſty; you muſt not apprehend of it, as when two men agree that are equall, and therefore a debt of juſtice ariſeth between them, and one may implead the other; but as a mercifull condeſcenſion on Gods part, to promiſe ſuch things to us, that ſo we might be the more confirmed in our hope in him. Hence <hi>Durand</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minenſis</hi> labour to prove, that Gods promiſes doe not induce an obligation, but denote the diſpoſition of God to give, although their arguments exclude onely a debt of juſtice from God. Therefore although in the Covenant God makes with man, there is a compact of mutuall fidelity, yet there is not a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and equall right of covenanting, becauſe of the inequality of the Covenanters; ſo that the whole diſpoſition and ordering of the Covenant with ſuch conditions is on Gods part, and not mans: Hence it's called Gods Covenant, and not mans.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſider why God will deale with man in a covenant way ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then in a meere abſolute ſupreme way.</hi> There may be theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God might hereby ſweeten and indeare himſelf to us.</hi> For, <note place="margin">God deales with man by way of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, not of power, 1. To indeare himſelf unto him.</note> whereas he might require all obedience from us, and annihilate us at laſt, or at leaſt not vouchſafe heaven and ever laſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe; to ſhew how good and loving he is, he will reward that moſt bountifully, which is otherwiſe due to him: for God did not make man, becauſe he needed him, but that there might be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65695:70"/>
objects to whom he would communicate his love. <hi>Thou needest not my goodneſſe,</hi> or, <hi>that extendeth not to thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> It's <hi>Austins</hi> expreſſion, The earth doth farre otherwiſe dry up, or ſwallow the water, thirſting for it, then the Sun beames, which alſo conſume the water: the one doth it <hi>indigentiâ</hi> out of want; the other <hi>potentiâ,</hi> out of power and ſtrength: ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> could not but have thankfull and loving thoughts of God, that would thus condeſcend.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Another Reaſon might be, to incite and incourage</hi> Adam <hi>the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. To incite man to more obedience.</note> 
                  <hi>more to obedience.</hi> For, howſoever there was no ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> or remiſneſſe: yet this might ſerve as a meanes to preſerve him in his obedience to God. And here you may ſee, that to do a duty, becauſe of a reward promiſed, is not a ſlaviſh and unlawfull thing; for did not God deale thus with <hi>Adam?</hi> If he would obey, he ſhould live; but if not, then he muſt dye. Will you ſay, with the Antinomian, That this was an unlawfull thing, and this was to make <hi>Adam</hi> legall, and one that was not affected with the goodneſſe of God to him? It is true, if a man obey God out of love to any thing more then God, or equally with God, this is unlawfull, according to that, <hi>Minus te amat, qui tecum (Domine) aliquid amat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That hereby</hi> Adams <hi>obedience might be the more willing and free.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. To make this obedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence more willing and free.</note> An abſolute law might ſeeme to extort obedience, but a covenant and agreement makes it to appeare more free and willing, as if <hi>Adam</hi> would have obeyed, though there could have been no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon him to doe it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Conſider that the nature of this Covenant was of works, and not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Covenant God made with <hi>Adam</hi> was of works, not of faith.</note> 
                  <hi>of faith.</hi> It was not ſaid to <hi>Adam, Beleeve, and have life eternall;</hi> but, <hi>Obey,</hi> even perfect and entire obedience. It is true indeed, there was faith of adherence and dependance upon God in his promiſe and word, and this faith doth not imply any imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtate of the ſubject as ſinfull, (which juſtifying faith doth) for it was in Chriſt, who in his temptations and tryalls did truſt in God. And what the Old Teſtament calls <hi>trusting,</hi> the New calls <hi>beleeving;</hi> yea, ſome ſay, that this kind of faith ſhall be in heaven, <hi>viz</hi> a dependance upon God for the continuance of that happineſſe which they doe enjoy. This faith therefore
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65695:70"/>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> had, but in that Covenant it was conſidered as a gracious act and work of the ſoul, not as it is now, an organ or inſtrument to receive and apply Chriſt.</p>
               <p>With us indeed there is juſtifying faith and repentance, which keeps up a Chriſtians life; as the Naturaliſts ſay, the <hi>calor inna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and <hi>humidum radicale</hi> doe the naturall life: Faith is like the <hi>calor innatus</hi> and Repentance is like the <hi>humidum radicals;</hi> and, as the Philoſopher ſaith, if the innate heat devoure too much the radicall moiſture, or the radicall moiſture too much the heat, there breed preſently diſeaſes: ſo it is with us, if beleeving make a man repent leſſe, or repenting make a man beleeve the leſſe, this turneth to a diſtemper.</p>
               <p>Yet, though it were a Covenant of works, it cannot be ſaid to be of merit. <hi>Adam</hi> though in innocency, could not merit that happineſſe which God would beſtow upon him: firſt, <hi>becauſe the enjoying of God, in which</hi> Adams <hi>happineſſe did conſiſt, was ſuch a good, as did farre exceed the power and ability of man.</hi> It's an infinite good, and all that is done by us is finite. And then in the next place, <hi>Becauſe even then</hi> Adam <hi>was not able to obey any command of God, without the help of God.</hi> Though ſome will not call it grace, becauſe they ſuppoſe that onely cometh by Chriſt; yet all they that are orthodox do acknowledge a neceſſity of Gods enabling <hi>Adam</hi> to that which was good, elſe he would have failed. Now then, if by the help of God <hi>Adam</hi> was ſtrengthned to do the good he did, he was ſo farre from meriting thereby, that indeed he was the more obliged to God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>God, who entred into this Covenant with him, is to be conſidered</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God, entring into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>Adam,</hi> muſt be looked upon as one already plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him, not as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>as already pleaſed, and a friend with him, not as a reconciled Father through Chriſt.</hi> Therefore here needed no Mediatour, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, becauſe the ſoul could not be terrified with any ſin. Here needed not one to be either <hi>medius,</hi> to take both natures; or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,</hi> to performe the offices of ſuch an one. In this eſtate that ſpeech of <hi>Luthers</hi> was true, which he denieth in ours, <hi>Dens eſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute conſiderandus. Adam</hi> dealt with him as abſolutely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not relatively: with us, God without Chriſt is a conſuming fire, and we are combuſtible matter, chaffe and ſtraw: we are loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to God, and God terrible to us; but <hi>Adam</hi> he was <hi>Deo
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65695:71"/>
proximo amicus, &amp; Paradiſi colonus,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and therefore was in familiarity and communion with him.</p>
               <p>But, although there was not that ordered adminiſtration and working of the three Perſons in this Covenant of works, yet all theſe did work in it. Hence the ſecond Perſon, though not as incarnated, or to be incarnated; yet he with the Father did cauſe all righteouſneſſe in <hi>Adam:</hi> and ſo the holy Ghoſt, he was the worker of holineſſe in <hi>Adam,</hi> though not as the holy Spirit of Chriſt purchaſed by his death for his Church, yet as the third Perſon; ſo that it is an unlikely aſſertion which one maintains, That the Trinity was not revealed in this Covenant to <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo that this ſheweth a vaſt difference between that Covenant in innocency, and this of grace. What ado is here for the troubled ſoul to have any good thoughts of God, to have any faith in him as reconciled? but then <hi>Adam</hi> had no fear, nor doubt about it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>This Covenant did ſuppoſe in</hi> Adam <hi>a power, being aſſiſted by</hi>

               <p>Nor could this neceſſity be of God, who made him good and righteous: nor would God ſubtract his gifts from him before he ſinned, ſeeing his fall was the cauſe of his defection, not Gods deſerting of him the cauſe of his fall.

                  </gap> it. And upon this ground it is, that we anſwer all thoſe cavills, why God doth command of us that which is impoſſible for us to doe: for the things commanded are not impoſſible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65695:71"/>
but, when required of <hi>Adam,</hi> he had power to keep them; but he ſinned away that power from himſelf and us. Neither is God bound, as the Arminians fancy, to give every one power to beleeve and repent, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency had not ability to doe theſe; for he had them eminently and virtually, though not formally: But more of theſe things in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. To admire with thankfulneſſe Gods way of dealing with us his creatures, that he condeſcends to a promiſe-way, to a covenant-way. There is no naturall or Morall neceſſity that God ſhould doe thus. We are his, and he might require an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, without any covenanting: but yet, to ſhew his love and goodneſſe, he condeſcends to this way. Beloved, not onely we corrupted, and our duties, might be rejected; not onely we in our perſons might be abaſhed, but had we all that innocency and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which did once adorn our nature, yet even then were we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to God, and it was Gods goodneſſe to receive it, and to reward it. Was then eternall life and happineſſe a meere gift of God to <hi>Adam</hi> for his obedience and love? what a free and meere gift then is ſalvation and eternall life to thee? If <hi>Adam</hi> were not to put any truſt in his duties, if he could not challenge God for a reward; how then ſhall we relye upon our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, that are ſo full of ſin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Further to admire Gods exceeding grace to us, that doth not hold us to this Covenant ſtill. That was a Covenant which did admit of no repentance: though <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had torn and rent their hearts out, yet there was no hope or way for them, till the Covenant of grace was revealed. Beloved, our condition might have been ſo, that no teares, no repentance could have helped us: the way to ſalvation might have been as impoſſible, as to the damned angels. To be under the Covenant of works, is as wofull, as the poore malefactour condemned to death by the Judge, according to the law, he falls then upon his knees, Good my lord ſpare me, it ſhall be a warning to me, I have a wife and ſmall children, O ſpare me: But, ſaith the Judge, I cannot ſpare you, the Law condemnes you: So it is here, though man cry and roare, yet you cannot be ſpared, here is no promiſe or grace for you.</p>

               <p>HAving handled the Law of God both <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>poſitive,</hi> which was given to <hi>Adam</hi> abſolutely; as alſo relatively in the notion of a Covenant God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> I ſhall put a period to this diſcourſe about the ſtate of innocency, by hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſeverall Queſtions, which will conduce much to the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our judgement againſt the errours ſpread abroad at this time, as alſo to the inlivening and inflaming of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons practically.</p>
               <p>Theſe Queſtions therefore I ſhall endeavour to cleare:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether there can be any ſuch diſtinction made of</hi> Adam, <hi>while innocent, ſo as to be conſidered either in his naturalls, or ſupernaturalls?</hi> For this is affirmed by ſome, that <hi>Adam</hi> may be conſidered in his meere naturalls, without the help of grace, and ſo he loveth God as his naturall utmoſt end, in that he is the preſerver and authour of nature: or elſe in his ſupernaturalls, as God did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow righteouſneſſe upon him, whereby he was inabled to enjoy God as his ſupernaturall end. And for this end is this errour maintained, that ſo man now born, may be made no worſe then <hi>Adam</hi> in that condition at firſt: which errour, if admitted, would much eclipſe all that glory which is attributed in Scripture to grace converting and healing of us. Therefore to this Queſtion theſe things may be anſwered:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it cannot be denied, but that in <hi>Adam</hi> ſuch qualities <note place="margin">1. In <hi>Adam</hi> ſuch qualities and actions may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as did flow from him as aliving creature, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a rational ſoul.</note> and actions may be conſidered, which did flow from him as a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature, endued with a reaſonable ſoul; ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. there the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to be made a <hi>living ſoul,</hi> that is, a living creature in his kinde, whereby he did provide and prepare thoſe things for his nouriſhment and life that he needed: and this is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65695:72"/>
to have a <hi>naturall body,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it. But we may not ſtay in the conſideration of him as a man in an abſtracted noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as ſo created by God for that end, to be made happy. Therefore howſoever ſome learned ſpeak of the animall ſtate and ſpirituall eſtate of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet both muſt be acknowledged to be naturall to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next place, we doe not hold in ſuch a manner his <note place="margin">2 The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and habit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> but help from God to perſevere, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall.</note> righteouſneſſe and holineſſe to be naturall to him, as that we deny every thing to <hi>Adam</hi> that was ſupernaturall; for, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but the favour of God, which he did enjoy, may well be called ſupernaturall; ſo alſo that actuall help of God (ſay ſome,) which was to be continued to him: For howſoever the principle, and habit as it were of righteouſneſſe, was naturall to him; yet to have help from God to continue and perſevere, was ſupernaturall. Even as you ſee the eye, though it hath a naturall power to ſee, yet there is a further requiſite to the act of ſeeing, which is light, without which it could not be.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion is, <hi>Whether Christ did intervene in his help</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency needed not Chriſt by way of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, but of conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>to</hi> Adam, <hi>ſo that he needed Christ in that ſtate?</hi> For here we ſee many learned and ſound men differ: ſome ſay, that Chriſt, being onely a Mediatour of reconciliation, could no wayes be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in any reſpect to <hi>Adam;</hi> for God and he were friends: Others again make the grace of Chriſt univerſally neceſſary, even to Angels, and <hi>Adam;</hi> ſaying that propoſition, <hi>[Without me ye can doe nothing,]</hi> is of everlaſting truth, and did extend to <hi>Adam,</hi> not indeed by way of pardon or reconciliation, but by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and conſervation in the ſtate of righteouſneſſe: Thus thoſe excellent pillars in the Church of God, <hi>Calvin, Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Zanchy,</hi> with others. Now for the clearing of this truth, we muſt conſider theſe particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it cannot be denyed, but that Christ, as the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, did create and make all things.</hi> This is to be diligently maintained againſt thoſe curſed opinions that begin, even pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, to deny the Deity of Chriſt. Now there are three generall waies of proving Chriſt to be God: 1. In that the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> is applyed to him, without any ſuch reſpect as to other creatures. 2. In that he hath the attributes of God, which are <hi>Omnipotency</hi> and <hi>Omniſciency,</hi> &amp;c. 3. In that he doth the works
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65695:73"/>
which God only can doe; ſuch are, raiſing up from the dead by his own power, and creation: Now that Chriſt doth create and ſuſtain all things, appeareth, <hi>John 1. Col.</hi> 1. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 3. ſo that it's impudent blaſphemy which oppoſeth clear Scripture, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract this from Chriſt. Indeed, his creating of the world, doth not exclude the other Perſons, onely he is included hereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What help the Angels had by Chriſt.</hi> Here I finde different thoughts, even of the judicious. That place <hi>Coloſ. 1. 20. To recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile all things to himſelf by him, whether things in heaven or earth,</hi> is thought by ſome a firme place, to prove that the Angels needed Chriſt, even as a Mediatour: and <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place brings two Reaſons why the Angels need Chriſts mediation:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they were not without danger of falling, and therefore their confirmation was by Chriſt. But how can this be proved, that their confirmation came from Chriſt, and not from God, as a plentifull rewarder of their continued obedience? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if that opinion of <hi>Salmerons</hi> were true, which holds it very probable, that the fallen Angels were not immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but had a ſet ſpace and time of repentance given them, this would with more colour have pleaded for Chriſts mediation; but that opinion cannot be made good out of the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Reaſon of <hi>Calvin</hi> is, that the obedience of the <note place="margin">The obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels may be ſaid to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, not privatively.</note> Angels was imperfect, or not ſo perfect, but that it needed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; which he groundeth upon <hi>Job 4. 18. His Angels he charged with folly.</hi> This may be anſwered thus, That the obedience of the Angels may be ſaid imperfect negatively, or <hi>comparative,</hi> in reſpect of God; it is not anſwerable to his greatneſſe: but yet it is not imperfect privatively, as if it did want any perfection due to it, and ſo was to be pardoned. Therefore <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion tends onely to this, to ſhew the Greatneſſe and Majeſtie of God, and that even Angels themſelves are but darkneſſe to his glory. If you aske then, What ſhall be thought of the place <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ.</hi> 1. 20? I anſwer, This place compared with <hi>Epheſ. 1. 10. [That he might gather together in one all things in Christ,]</hi> may well be laid together; for they ſpeak the ſame thing. In the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> it's <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to reconcile;</hi> and that to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which word ſome expound to be as much as <hi>to bring to its firſt beginning;</hi> and ſo it's explained by them, that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65695:73"/>
all things have ſuffered a defect from the beginning, and by Chriſt are to be reſtored to their former ſtate: Others expound it of <hi>reducing all to one head,</hi> which is Chriſt: Others make it a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, from thoſe things which are largely ſet down, and then briefly capitulated, and ſummed up again; thus, ſay they, all that was prefigured by the ſacrifices, is fulfilled in Chriſt: but we take the word in this ſenſe, as it doth imply, <hi>to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether thoſe things which were ſcattered and divided;</hi> and ſo it doth excellently deſcribe the ruine and confuſion that is brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all by ſin. But then here is the difficulty again, how the Angels can be ſaid to be gathered, ſeeing they were never divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. To this ſome anſwer, that the <hi>All things</hi> here ſpoken in the text, are to be limited to men onely: ſo that the <hi>things in heaven,</hi> ſhall be the ſpirits of godly men already tranſlated thither; and the <hi>things in earth,</hi> thoſe men that are living. But ſuppoſe it be extended to Angels, yet will not this inferre their need of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation by Chriſt, but onely ſome benefit to redound unto them by Chriſt; and that is certain: for, firſt, by Chriſt they have a knowledge of the myſteries of our ſalvation, as appeareth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 10. and ſecondly, hereby they have joy in the converſion of a ſinner; and, laſtly, Angels become hereby reconciled with man: and this ſeemeth to be the moſt proper and immediate ſenſe of the place. So that I cannot ſee any ground for that aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſaith, <hi>Becauſe there is no proportion between a creature and the Creatour, therefore there must be a Mediatour.</hi> And if this hold true of the Angels, then it will alſo hold about <hi>Adam;</hi> for, there being no offence or breach made, there needed no Mediatour to interpoſe.</p>
               <p>It's hard to ſay, <hi>Christ would have been incarnated, if</hi> Adam <hi>had</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chriſts incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation cannot be ſuppoſed, but upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</note> 
                  <hi>not ſinned.</hi> All thoſe, who hold the neceſſity of Chriſt to <hi>Adam</hi> and Angels, muſt alſo neceſſarily maintain, that, though <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, Chriſt would have been incarnated. Now when the Scripture nameth this to be the principall end of Chriſts coming into the world, to ſave that which is loſt; unleſſe this had been, we cannot ſuppoſe Chriſts coming into the fleſh. Whether indeed Chriſt was not the firſt object in Gods decree and predeſtination, and then afterwards men, and then other things, is a far different queſtion from this. As for <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65695:74"/>
ſeemeth to ſpeak of Chriſt as head of the Church, that he might have preheminency in all things, this doth not prove his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, though no fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> but rather ſuppoſeth it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether the tree of life was a ſacrament of Christ to</hi> Adam, <hi>or</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The tree of life was not a ſacrament of Chriſt to <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>no?</hi> For this alſo is affirmed by ſome, that the tree of life was a ſacrament given to <hi>Adam,</hi> which did repreſent Chriſt, from whom <hi>Adam</hi> was to receive his life. But upon the former grounds I doe deny, the tree of life to have any ſuch ſacramentall ſignification. It is true, I grant it to be a ſacrament; for there is no good reaſon to the contrary, but that ſacraments may be in the ſtate of innocency; onely they did not ſignifie Chriſt. Why it was called <hi>a tree of life,</hi> is not the ſame way determined by all: ſome think, becauſe it had a ſpeciall quality and efficacy with it, to preſerve <hi>Adam</hi> immortall; for, although he was ſo made, yet there were meanes appointed by God to preſerve this ſtate. But we will not conclude on this; only we ſay, It was a ſacrament, not only to admoniſh <hi>Adam</hi> of his life received from God, but alſo of that happy life, which upon his obedience he was alwayes to enjoy. Hence <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 7. happineſſe is called <hi>eating of the tree of life, which is in the midst of Paradiſe.</hi> We do not in this exclude <hi>Adam</hi> from depending upon God for all things, or acknowledging him the ſole authour of all his bliſſe: but onely there was not then that way of adminiſtration of good to us, as is now by Chriſt to man plunged into ſin. And this muſt be ſaid, that we muſt not curiouſly ſtart queſtions about that ſtate in innocency; for the Scripture, having related that there was ſuch a ſtate once, doth not tell us what would have been, upon ſuppoſition of his obedience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And ſo we may anſwer that demand, Whether there was <note place="margin">The Scripture doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of a Chriſt unto <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> any revelation unto <hi>Adam</hi> of a Chriſt? Now what might be done, we cannot ſay; but there is no ſolid ground to aſſert it: for, howſoever the Apoſtle indeed makes a myſterious applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſpeech of <hi>Adam</hi> unto Chriſt and his Church, to ſet forth their immediate union; yet it doth not follow, that <hi>Adam</hi> did then know any ſuch myſterie. Indeed <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt did in an humane ſhape appear, and put <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> together in that conjugall band; but we cannot affirme this from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And by this alſo it doth appeare, that the Sabbath, as it
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65695:74"/>
was figurative of Chriſt, had this conſideration added unto it, as it was given to the Jewes afterward, and in that reſpect it was to be aboliſhed. That opinion is very much forced, which makes thoſe words of Gods bleſſing and ſanctifying the Sabbath day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. to be by way of anticipation; and therefore would deny the command of the Sabbath to be given to <hi>Adam,</hi> ſaying, there was onely one poſitive law, which was that of not eating the forbidden fruit, that was delivered unto <hi>Adam.</hi> Now, though this be falſe, yet that conſideration of the Sabbath, as it was figurative of Chriſt, was not then in the ſtate of the innocency.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another main queſtion is, <hi>Whether this ſtate of reparation</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The ſtate of innocency excelled the ſtate of repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and outward feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</note> 
                  <hi>be more excellent then that in innocency.</hi> Now here we cannot ſay one is abſolutely better then the other, only in ſome reſpects one is excelled by the other: As, the firſt eſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> did far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed this in the rectitude it had, being altogether without any ſin; for he was not created (as ſome would have it) in a neutrall eſtate doth plainly repugne that image of God, after which he is ſaid to be created. Now what a bleſſed eſtate it is to have an heart not ſtained with fin, to have no blemiſh, nor ſpot in the ſoul, will appeare by <hi>Paul</hi>'s bitter complaint, <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> That eſtate alſo doth excell ours in the immortality and outward felicity he enjoyed; for our ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt, howſoever he hath deſtroyed the works of ſin and Satan, yet he hath not fully removed the ſcars which thoſe ſins have left upon us: Chriſt doing here, as thoſe Emperours, who had taken their enemies priſoners and captives, but yet killed them not immediately, till the day of triumph came.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, our condition is in one reſpect made <note place="margin">The ſtate of reparation more happy then that of innocency, in reſpect of the certainty of perſeverance in the ſtate of grace.</note> happier then <hi>Adams;</hi> which is the certainty of perſeverance in the ſtate of grace, if once tranſlated into it. And this conſideration <hi>Auſtin</hi> did much preſſe. We have indeed much ſin with our grace, yet God will not let that ſpark of fire goe out: but <hi>Adam</hi> had much holineſſe, and no ſin; yet how quickly did he loſe it? Not but that grace of it ſelf is amiſſible as well as that of <hi>Adams,</hi> but becauſe of the ſpeciall promiſe and grace of God in Chriſt; therefore whom he loves, he will alwaies love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:65695:75"/>
The next Queſtion is, <hi>Whether we may be now by Chriſt ſaid to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts righteouſneſs doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that therefore we are more righteous then <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>be more righteous then</hi> Adam? For ſo an Antinomian in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Justification,</hi> pag. 320. 321. quoteth places out of ſome Authours, as affirming this, that now by Chriſt we have a more perfect righteouſneſſe, then that of Angels, or was loſt in <hi>Adam;</hi> and by this meanes labours to prove, that we are ſo holy, that God can ſee no ſin in us. Now, to anſwer this, I deny not, but the orthodox ſometimes have uſed ſuch expreſſions, and upon this ground, becauſe the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt as it was his, was of infinite value and conſequence; and ſo as we are in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, we are in a better and ſurer condition, then the Angels or <hi>Adam</hi> was: but they never uſed ſuch expreſſions to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian ſenſe, as if hereby we were made not onely perfectly righteous, but alſo holy, and without ſin. This opinion is at large to be refuted in the Treatiſe about <hi>Juſtification;</hi> only thus much take for an anſwer, That the doctrine, which holdeth the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, doth not neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that therefore we have righteouſneſſe more excellent then Angels or <hi>Adam;</hi> for it is onely imputed to us for that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which we ought to have: it is not made ours in that largeneſſe or latitude as it was Chriſts, but as we needed it. Now God never required of us ſuch an holineſſe as the Angels have, or a greater righteouſneſſe then <hi>Adam</hi> had; and therefore it's a ſenſleſſe thing to imagine, that that ſhould be made ours which we never needed, or ever were bound to have: ſo that thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the orthodox muſt be underſtood in a ſound ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Whether that which God requireth of us be greater, then that he</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What God requireth of us, is not greater then what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency.</note> 
                  <hi>demanded of</hi> Adam <hi>in the ſtate of innocency?</hi> For thus the Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hold, that greater abilities are now required of a man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Goſpel, then were of <hi>Adam</hi> to fulfill the Law; partly, becauſe the myſterie of the Goſpel doth conſiſt in meere revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Law doth not; as alſo, becauſe all the actions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Goſpel do ſuppoſe a reſurrection from that firſt fall. Now (ſay they) more is required to riſe from a fall, then to prevent a fall. And all this they urge, to prove the neceſſity of univerſall grace given to all.</p>
               <p>Now to anſwer this: Firſt, I conclude (as before hath been proved) that the nature of juſtifying faith was in <hi>Adam,</hi> though
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65695:75"/>
there was not ſuch a particular object about which it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed; for a thing may be for the nature of it, and yet not have ſuch a name which it hath from a certain reſpect to ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that now is not, or from ſome effects which it cannot now produce: So Mercy and Grace was in God for the nature of it alwaies, but as it hath reſpect to a miſerable and wretched creature, that was not till the creature was made ſo. And ſo in <hi>Adam,</hi> there was the nature of love and pity, but yet in regard of ſome effects, which could not be exerciſed in that eſtate, his love could have no ſuch name, as mercy or pity. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> for his faith, that faith which he did put forth in Gods Promiſe about eternall life, upon his obedience, was a juſtifying faith for the nature of it, but had not the denomination or reſpect of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, becauſe ſuch an object was impoſſible in that condition. Hence that faith of dependency which <hi>Adam</hi> had, was the ſame in nature which juſtifying faith is. Therefore to the arguments propoſed, we deny, that greater ſtrength is required to riſe, then to keep from falling; for the ſame things which would have preſerved <hi>Adam</hi> from falling, as faith in the firſt place, the ſame alſo are required for a man to riſe. And as <hi>Adam</hi> would have ſtood, as long as his faith in God ſtood, the devill labouring to ſhake that by his temptation; ſo Chriſt praying for <hi>Peter,</hi> a man fallen by <hi>Adam,</hi> doth eſpecially pray, that his faith may not fail, becauſe by that he was ſupported and ſtrengthned.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Whether</hi> Adams <hi>immortality in that estate, be not different</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adams</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality in the ſtate of innocency different from, and ſhort of that which ſhall be in heaven.</note> 
                  <hi>from that which ſhall be in heaven.</hi> Yes, it is very plain it is ſo; for he was ſo immortall, as that there was a poſſibility of morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but it is not ſo with thoſe that are glorified. Again, he was ſo immortall, as that he had a naturall body, which did need nouriſhment; but it is not ſo with thoſe that are made happy. It is true, we have heretofore concluded, that <hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt eſtate was naturally immortall, for if death had been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, God had been the authour of death, and man would not have abhorred it. Neither did Chriſt dye ſimply becauſe he was a man, but becauſe he was a man made for us, who ought to dye becauſe of our ſin. Indeed, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> did eat and drink, and his body was a naturall body, therefore there was mortality in him in a remote power, but actuall mortality was hindered, by
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65695:76"/>
reaſon of that glorious condition he was placed in; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not actually to dye, but to be in a mortall ſtate was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a puniſhment to him of all apoſtaſie from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Of Inſtruction. What comfort may be to the godly from Chriſt, though by nature all is loſt. Who can heare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trembling of this great loſſe? Righteouſneſſe and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality loſt, God and his image loſt. If thou lookeſt upon thy proud earthly ſinfull heart, thou mayeſt ſay, It was not thus from the beginning: if upon thy ſick, weak, and mortall body, It was not thus from the beginning. Now here is no way to keep up the heart, but by looking to Chriſt. Though thou haſt loſt the image of God, yet he is the expreſſe image of his Father. Though thou haſt not perfect righteouſneſſe, he hath. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thy loſſe and evil be by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> thy gain and good may be by the laſt <hi>Adam.</hi> Admire herein the myſteries of Gods grace and love. What may we not expect for temporalls, if needfull, when he is thus gracious in ſpiritualls? Are riches, ſubſiſtence, equall to Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Of Exhortation, not to reſt in any eſtate, but that of reſtauration again. The word (as you heard) <hi>Epheſ. 1. 10. to gather,</hi> doth imply that all mankind is like an houſe fallen down, lying in its rubbiſh and ruines. Let us not therefore ſtay in this condition: It's a condition of ſinne, of wrath: Oh, much better never to have been born, then to be thus. How happy are all the irrationall creatures in their eſtate above us, if not repaired by Chriſt? And know, that to be reſtored again to this image of God, is a great and rare bleſſing, few partake of it. Holineſſe muſt be as inwardly rooted and ſettled in thee, as ever ſinne and corruption hath ſoaked into thee. Thou didſt drink iniquity like water; doeſt thou now, as the Hart, pant after the water-brooks? The reſurrection of the ſoul muſt be in this life. It was ſinfull, proud; but it's raiſed an holy, humble ſoule.</p>

               <p>HAving handled the Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, both abſolutely as it is a Law, and relatively as a Covenant; we now proceed to ſpeak of that Law given by God, through the miniſtery of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the people of Iſrael; which is the great ſubject in controverſie between the Antinomians and us. There were indeed Precepts and Laws given before <hi>Moſes.</hi> Hence the Learned ſpeak much of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Precepts. The Talmudiſts ſay (as <hi>Cuneus</hi> relates) that theſe ſeven Precepts of <hi>Noah</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch an exact rule of righteouſneſs, that whoſoever did not know them, the Iſraelites were commanded to kill. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are impertinent to my ſcope, I paſs them by. And in the handling of this Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> I will uſe my former me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, conſidering the Law abſolutely in it ſelf, and then rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively as a Covenant: for, as God (you have heard) hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red other errours about the Deity of Chriſt, and the Trinity, and the grace of God, therefore to break forth, that the truth about them may be more cleared and manifeſted; ſo happily the Law will be more extolled in its dignity and excellency then ever, by thoſe opinions which would overthrow it. The Text, upon which moſt of the matter I have to ſay, ſhall be grounded, are the words now read unto you, that are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to the Law, containing briefly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The nature of the matter delivered, which is called <hi>Words;</hi>

But this may be anſwered eaſily, that the Scripture doth frequently uſe a liberty in changing of words, when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth the ſame thing, onely it doth not alter the ſenſe. And happily this may be to confute that ſuperſtitious opinion of the Jews, who are ready to dream of miraculous myſteries in every letter.</p>

God. But this is confuted by the learned. I ſhall not preface any further, but raiſe this Doctrine, <hi>That God delivered a Law</hi>

                  <hi>to the people of Iſrael by the hand or miniſtry of</hi> Moſes.</p>
               <p>I ſhall (God willing) handle this point doctrinally in all the Theological conſiderations about the Law: and,</p>
               <p>Firſt, you muſt ſtill remember, that <hi>the word</hi> Law <hi>may be uſed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The word Law is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diverſe ſenſes and ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                  <hi>in divers ſenſes; and, before this or that be aſſerted of it, you muſt clear in what ſenſe you ſpeak of the Law.</hi> Not to trouble you again with the ſeveral acceptions of the word, which you muſt have alwaies in your eye, take notice at the preſent, of what a large or reſtrained ſignification the word <hi>Law</hi> is capable of: for we may either take the word <hi>Law</hi> for the whole diſpenſation and promulgation of the Commandments, <hi>Morall, Judiciall,</hi> and <hi>Ceremoniall:</hi> Or elſe more ſtrictly, for that part which we call the <hi>Morall Law;</hi> yet with the preface and promiſes added to it: and in both theſe reſpects the Law was given as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace (which is to be proved in due time:) Or elſe moſt ſtrictly, for that which is meer mandative and preceptive, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any promiſe at all: And in this ſenſe, moſt of thoſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the Learned have concerning the difference between the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> are to be underſtood; for, if you take (as for the moſt part they do) all the precepts and threatnings ſcattered up &amp; down in the Scripture, to be properly the <hi>Law;</hi> and then all the gracious promiſes, whereſoever they are, to be the <hi>Gospel,</hi> then its no marvell if the Law have many hard ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions caſt upon it. Now this ſhall be handled on purpoſe in a diſtinct queſtion by it ſelf, becauſe I ſee many excellent men peremptory for this difference: but I much queſtion, whether it will hold, or no.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What Law this delivered in Mount Sinai is, and what kindes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Laws in general, and why the <hi>Morall</hi> ſo called.</note> 
                  <hi>of laws there are, and why its called the Morall Law.</hi> It is plain by <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. &amp; <hi>cap.</hi> 21. All the laws that the Jews had were then given to <hi>Moſes</hi> to deliver unto the people, only that which we call the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> had the great preheminency, being twice written by God himſelf in tables of ſtone. Now the whole body of theſe laws is, according to the matter and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, divided into <hi>Morall, Ceremoniall,</hi> and <hi>Judiciall.</hi> We will not meddle with the Queries that may be made about this diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65695:78"/>
We may, without any danger, receive it, and that Law which we are to treat upon is the <hi>Moral Law.</hi> And here it muſt be acknowledged, that the different uſe of the word Morall, hath bred many perplexities; yea, in whatſoever controverſie it hath been uſed, it hath cauſed miſtakes. The word Morall, or Morally, is uſed in the controverſie of the Sabbath, in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion about converting grace; in the doctrine of the Sacraments, about their efficacy and cauſality; and ſo in this queſtion, about a Law, what makes it morall. Now in this preſent doubt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the word <hi>Moral</hi> beareth no ſuch force in the notation of it, (it being as much as that which directeth and obligeth about manners, and ſo applicable even to the <hi>Judiciall</hi> and <hi>Ceremoniall:</hi> and theſe are in a ſenſe commanded in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law,</hi> though they be not perpetuall) as to denote that which is perpetual and alwaies obliging; yet thus it is meant here, when we ſpeak of a thing moral, as oppoſite to that, which is binding but for a time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether this law repeated by</hi> Moſes <hi>be the ſame with the Law</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the law of Nature:</note> 
                  <hi>of nature implanted in us.</hi> And this is taken for granted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: but certainly there may be given many great differences between them: for,</p>
               <p>Firſt, if he ſpeak of the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> implanted in <hi>Adam</hi> at <note place="margin">1. In reſpect of power of binding.</note> firſt, or as now degenerated, and almoſt defaced in us, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is by that law injoyned, doth reach unto all, and binde all, though there be no promulgation of ſuch things unto them: But now the <hi>Moral Law</hi> in ſome things that are poſitive, and determined by the will of God meerly, did not binde all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world: for, howſoever the command for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day was perpetuall, yet it did not binde the Gentiles, who never heard of that determined time by God: ſo that there are more things expreſſed in that, then in the <hi>law of Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, in the ſecond place, The <hi>Moral Law</hi> given by God <note place="margin">2. The breach of the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is a greater ſin then the breach of the law of Nature.</note> doth induce a new obligation from the command of it; ſo that though the matter of it, and of the <hi>law of nature</hi> agree in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, yet he that breaketh theſe Commandments now, doth ſin more hainouſly then he that is an Heathen or Pagan; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by Gods command there cometh a further obligation and tye upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:65695:78"/>
In the third place, in the <hi>Morall Law</hi> is required juſtifying <note place="margin">3. The <hi>Morall</hi> Law requires juſtifying faith and repentance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more particulars in it, then the law of Nature.</note> faith and repentance as is to be proved, when I come to ſpeak of it as a Covenant; which could not be in the Law given to <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo the ſecond Commandment requireth the particular worſhip of God, inſomuch that all the Ceremoniall Law, yea our Sacraments are commanded in the ſecond Commandment; it being of a very ſpirituall and comprehenſive nature: ſo that although the <hi>Morall Law</hi> hath many things which are alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>law of Nature,</hi> yet the Morall Law hath more particulars then can be in that. Hence you ſee the Apoſtle ſaith, he <hi>had not known luſt to be ſin, had not the Law ſaid ſo,</hi> although he had the <hi>law of Nature</hi> to convince him of ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Why it was now added.</hi> The time when it was added ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <note place="margin">The Law was given when the Iſraelites were in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not ſooner.</note> by the 18. Chapter, to wit, when the people of Iſrael were in the Wilderneſs, and had now come to their twelfth ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Mount Sinai. That reaſon which <hi>Philo</hi> giveth, becauſe the Lawes of God are to be learnt in a Wilderneſs ſeeing there we cannot be hindred by the multitude, is no waies ſolid Two reaſons there may be, why now, and not ſooner or later, God gave this Law:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the people of Iſrael coming out of Aegypt, had <note place="margin">1. Becauſe, being come out of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, they were to be reſtrained of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and idolatry.</note> defiled themſelves with their waies: and we ſee, while they were in their journie in the Wilderneſs, what horrible groſs impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they plunged themſelves into: therefore God to reſtraine their impietie and idolatry, giveth them this Law, to repreſs all that inſolency, ſo <hi>Rom</hi> 5. and <hi>Gal. 3. The Law came becauſe of tranſgreſſions:</hi> Hence <hi>Theophilact</hi> obſerveth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, It was added, ſignifieth that the Law was not primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and for it's own ſake given, as the promiſes were, but to reſtrain tranſgreſſions then over flowing: But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, I conceive the great and proper reaſon why God at this time, rather then another, gave the Law, was, becauſe now <note place="margin">2. Becauſe they were now to grow into a Common-wealth.</note> they began to be a great people: they were to enter into Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and to ſet up a Common wealth, and therefore God makes them lawes, for he was their King in a ſpeciall manner; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that all their Lawes, even politicall, were divine: and therefore the Magiſtrates could not diſpence in their lawes, as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65695:79"/>
now Governours may in their lawes of the Common-wealth, which are meerly ſo, becauſe then they ſhould <hi>diſpenſare de jure alieno,</hi> which is not lawfull. This therefore was the proper rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why God at this time ſet up the whole body of their Lawes, becauſe they were now to grow into a Common-wealth. Hence <hi>Joſephus</hi> calls the Common-wealth of the Jews <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a place where God was the Governour.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Whether this Law was not before in the Church of God.</hi> And <note place="margin">The Law not only was, but was publikely preached in the Church before <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </note> certainly, he that ſhould think this Law was not in the Church of God before <hi>Moſes</hi> his adminiſtration of it, ſhould gratly erre. Murder was a ſin before, as appeareth by Gods words to <hi>Cain;</hi> yea the very anger it ſelfe that goeth before murder: So all the outward worſhip of God, as when its ſaid, <hi>Then began man to call upon the name of the Lord;</hi> ſo that the Church of God never was, nor ever ſhall be without this Law. And when we ſay, the Law was, before <hi>Moſes,</hi> I do not meane only, that it was written in the hearts of men, but it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely preached in the miniſtry that the Church did then enjoy, as appeareth by <hi>Noah</hi>'s preaching to the old world, and Gods ſtriving with men then by his word</p>
               <p>So that we may ſay, the Decalogue is <hi>Adams,</hi> and <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and <hi>Noahs,</hi> and Chriſts, and the Apoſtles, as well as of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Indeed there was ſpeciall reaſon, as you heard, why at that time, there ſhould be a ſpeciall promulgation of it, and a ſolemn repetition; but yet the Law did perpetually ſound in the Church, ever ſince it was a Church. And this conſideration will make much to ſet forth the excellency of it, it being a perpetuall meanes and inſtrument which God hath uſed in his Church for information of duty, conviction of ſin, and exhortation to all holineſs: So that men who ſpeak againſt the uſe of the Law, and the preaching of it, do oppoſe the univerſall way of the Church of God in the Old and New Teſtament.</p>

                  <hi>amplitudines legis meae,</hi> where the Prophet makes the Law a precious gift depoſited in the Jews hands.

That which God ſpeaks of as a great mercy to a people, they do reject.</p>
               <p>Nor, becauſe that God hath vouchſafed greater expreſſions of his love to us in theſe latter dayes, therefore may thoſe former mercies be forgotten by us, ſeeing the Law doth belong unto us for thoſe ends it was given to the Jews now under the Goſpel,

(as is to be proved) as much as unto them. And therefore you cannot reade one commandment in the ſpirituall explication of it, (for <hi>the law is ſpirituall)</hi> but you have cauſe to bleſs God, ſaying, Lord, what are we, that thy will ſhould be ſo clearly, and purely manifeſted to us, above what it is to Heathens, yea, and Papiſts, with many others? Therefore, beloved, it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for you to be no Antinomian, but you are to bleſs God, and praiſe him for it, that its read, and opened in our congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>

                  <hi>belonging to God or man.</hi> And here againe I ſhall not ſpeak of it as a covenant, but meerly as its a rule of obedience. And thus, though it be ſhort, yet its ſo perfect, that it containeth all that is to be done, or omitted by us. Inſomuch that all the Prophets, and Apoſtles do but adde the explication of the Law, if it be not taken in too ſtrict a ſenſe. Hence is that commandment of not adding to it, or detracting from it. And in what ſenſe the Apoſtle ſpeakes againſt it, calling it the <hi>killing letter,</hi> &amp; the <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of death working wrath,</hi> is to be ſhewed hereafter. When our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. gave thoſe ſeverall precepts, he did not adde them as new unto the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> but did vindicate that from the corrupt gloſſes and interpretations of the Phariſees, as is to be proved. Indeed it may ſeem hard to ſay that Chriſt, and juſtifying faith, &amp; the doctrine of the Trinity, is included in this promulgation of the Law; but it is to be proved, that all theſe were then comprehended in the adminiſtration of it, though more obſcurely. Nor wil this be to confound the Law and the Goſpel, as ſome may think. This law therefore and rule of life which God gave the people of Iſrael, and to all us Chriſtians in them, is ſo perfect and full, that there is nothing neceſſary to the duty and worſhip of God, which is not here commanded; nor no ſin to be avoided, which is not here forbidden. And this made <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> (as you heard) compare it to the ten Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments.</p>

What, ſhall we revile that which is Gods great mercy to a people? Becauſe the Jews and Papiſts do abuſe the Law, and the works of it to juſtification, ſhall it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have its proper place and dignity? How ſacred are the laws of a Common-wealth, which yet are made by men? But this is by the wiſe God.</p>
               <p>Take heed therefore of ſuch phraſes, <hi>An Old-Teſtament-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and, <hi>His Sermon is nothing but an explication of the Law:</hi> For it ought much to rejoyce thee, to hear that pure and excellent image of Gods holineſs opened.

And if you ſay, Here is nothing of Chriſt all this while: I anſwer That is falſe, as is to be proved, if the Law be not taken very ſtrictly: And beſides, the Law and the Goſpel are not to be ſevered, but they mutually put a freſh reliſh and taſte upon each other. And ſhall no mercy be eſteemed, but what is the Goſpel? Thou art thankfull for temporall mercies, and yet they are not the Goſpel; but this is a ſpiritual mercy.</p>

               <p>I Have already begun the diſcourſe about the <hi>Morall Law;</hi> and ſhall at this time conſider thoſe hiſtorical paſſages, which we meet with in the promulgation of it; that ſo the excellency of it may hereby be more known; for, whoſoever ſhall diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the circumſtances of the hiſtory of the Law, he ſhall finde, that God did put glory upon it: and howſoever the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. and 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3. doth prefer the Goſpel above this miniſtration of <hi>Moſes;</hi> yet abſolutely in it ſelf, it was greatly honoured by God. In the general therefore, you may take notice, that <hi>therefore did God ſo ſolemnly, and with great majeſty give the Law, that ſo the greater authority may thereby be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. The Law was given with great majeſty, thereby to procure the greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to it</note> 
                  <hi>procured to it.</hi> Hence it is related of many Heathens, that they have feigned ſome familiarity with their gods, when they made their laws, that ſo the people might with greater awe and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence receive them: Thus <hi>Numa</hi> feigned his diſcourſe with the goddeſs <hi>Aegaeria</hi> for his laws; and it's related of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that he had a tamed Eagle, which he would cauſe to come flying to him, to make people think his ſentences were delivered from heaven to him.

Again, in the next place, take alſo this generall Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">There is a difference between the Morall, Iudiciall, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were given at the ſame time.</note> 
                  <hi>That although the</hi> Judiciall <hi>and</hi> Ceremoniall <hi>lawes were given at the ſame time with the</hi> Morall Law, <hi>yet there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</hi> And this is to be taken notice of, leſt any ſhould think, what will this diſcourſe make for the honour of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law,</hi> more then the other lawes? It's true, theſe three kinds of lawes agree in the common efficient cauſe, which was God; and in the miniſter, or mediator, which was <hi>Moſes;</hi> in the ſubject, which was the people of Iſrael; and all and every one of them; as alſo in the common effects, of binding and obliging <note place="margin">The Morall Law more excellent then the Iudiciall and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</note> them to obedience, and to puniſh the bold offenders againſt them. But herein the <hi>Morall Law</hi> is preheminent: 1. In that it is a foundation of the other lawes, and they are reduceable to it. 2. This was to abide alwaies, not the other. 3. This was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately writen by God, and commanded to be kept in the Ark, which the other were not.</p>
               <p>Laſtly obſerve, theſe two things in the generall, about the <note place="margin">God hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Iſraelites before he gave them his Law.</note> time of the delivery of the Law: Firſt, <hi>God did not give them his Law, till he had deeply humbled them;</hi> and it may be now, Chriſt will not ſettle his ordinance with us, till he hath brought us low: And ſecondly, <hi>Before they come unto the Land of promiſe, God ſetleth his worſhip and lawes.</hi> When he hath done this, then he bids them, <hi>Deut. 2. 1. Goe towards Canaan.</hi> This ſheweth, A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot have Canaan, till the things of God be ſetled.</p>
               <p>But we come to the remarkable parts of the hiſtory of the <note place="margin">God ſetled his worſhip before he gave them Canaan.</note> promulgation of this Law; and firſt, you may conſider <hi>the great and dilligent preparation of the people to heare it.</hi> Exod. 19. for, firſt, <hi>They were to ſanctifie themſelves, and to waſh their clothes.</hi> This indeed, was peculiar unto thoſe times, yet God did hereby require the cleanſing &amp; ſanctification of their hearts. The ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious <note place="margin">Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required before the hearing of the Law. 1. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt ſanctifie themſelves.</note> imitating of this was among the Gentiles, who uſed to waſh, that they may goe to ſacrifice, <hi>Plaut in Aulul. Act, 3. ſcen.</hi> 6. yea, this ſuperſtition was brought into the Church, Chryſoſt. Hom. 52. in Mat. <hi>We ſee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this cuſtome confirmed in many Churches, that many ſtudy diligently how they may come to Church with their hands waſht and white garments:</hi> And, Tert. cap. 11. de Orat. <hi>Hae ſunt verae mundiciae, non quas pleri<expan>

This is true cleannes, and not that, which many ſuperſtiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard, waſhing their whole body in water, when they goe to pray. but this by the way, God did hereby fignifie what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and holineſs of heart ſhould be in them to receive his Law.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing requiſite was, <hi>to ſet bounds, ſo that none</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. They muſt not touch the Mount.</note> 
                  <hi>might touch the Mount.</hi> It's a violent perverting of Scripture which the popiſh Canons have, applying this a llegorically to a lay-man, if he reade, or medle with the Scripture; whereas not only a beaſt, but not the Prieſts themſelves ſhould touch this mountain: and hereby God would have men keep within their bounds, and not to be too curious. The Doctrine of the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> are ſuch a mountain, that a man muſt keep at the bottome of it, and not climb up.</p>
               <p>The third thing was, <hi>not to come at their wives.</hi> Some do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <note place="margin">3. Nor come at their wives.</note> this to thoſe women that were legally polluted; but it may be well underſtood of their conjugall abſtinency, not as a thing ſinfull, but that hereby God would have them put off not only affections to all ſinnes, but all lawfull things: ſo that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for three dayes, doth make much for the excellency of the Law, and ſheweth how ſpirituall we ſhould be in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it,</p>

                  <note place="margin">2. The Law was given with great Majeſty, that ſo the people might be raiſed up to reverence the Law-giver.</note> 
                  <hi>of it:</hi> For, although it muſt be granted, that this was an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated way to the Law, that did convince of ſinne, and terriſie, (hence the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 12. 18, 19, &amp;c.</hi> preferreth the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel above it) yet this alſo was a true cauſe, why thundrings and terrours did accompany the promulgation of it, that ſo the people might be raiſed up to fear, and reverence of the Law-giver. Hence <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 5. God is deſcribed in his Majeſtie ſitting upon his throne, and lightnings with thunders procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from him. Now it's very probable, that theſe were raiſed by God in an extraordinary manner, to overcome the heart of the ſtouteſt. And in this nature we are ſtill to ſuppoſe the Law preached to us; for, howſoever all that terrour be paſt, yet the effect of it ought to abide upon every man, ſo far forth as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption abideth in him: for, what man is there, whoſe pride,

               <p>It's ſaid <hi>Exod. 19. 18. God deſcended upon the mount Sinai in a ſmoak of fire, and a cloud:</hi> all was to ſhew the incomprehenſible Majeſty of God, as alſo his terrour to wicked men; and in this reſpect the diſpenſation of the Goſpel was of greater ſweetneſs. Hence <hi>Gal</hi> 4. 24. the Apoſtle makes this mount Sinai to be Agar, generating to bondage. This I ſay, muſt be granted, if you ſpeake comparatively with Goſpel-diſpenſations; but yet the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes of this abſolutely in it ſelfe, as a great mercy, <hi>Pſal, 50. 2. Out of Sion, the perfection of beauty, God hath ſhined;</hi> and the fire about him did ſignifie his glorious ſplendour, as alſo his power to overthrow his enemies, and conſume them: ſo <hi>Pſal</hi> 96. All the earth is bid to rejoyce at the Lords reigning, which is deſcribed by his ſolemne giving of the Law, which the Church is to rejoyce at; yea, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. it is applyed to Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. though the Apoſtle followes the Septuagint: ſo that if you take theſe things abſolutely, they are lookt upon as mercies; yea, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt. And it is made a wonderfull mercy to them that God did thus familiarly reveale himſelfe to them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 7. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 4. yea learned men think, that Chriſt, the Son of God. did in the ſhape of a man deliver this Law to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſpeake familiarly with him; but eſpecially ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 3. where the word <hi>loving</hi> ſignifies imbracing by way of protection in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. The gifts of the holy Ghoſt were given with fiery tongues, and a mighty ruſhing wind, ſo that the Goſpel is fire, as well as the Law.</p>

                  <hi>tables of ſtone.</hi> The Rabbins conceit, ſaying, that becauſe it is ſaid <hi>of ſtone</hi> in the ſingular number, that therefore it was but one table, which ſometimes did appeare as one, ſometimes as two, is not worth the confuting. That which is here to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and makes much to the dignity of the Law, is, that it was written by God, upon tables of ſtone, to ſhew the perpetuity, and ſtability of it.</p>
               <p>And howſoever this of it ſelfe be not a demonſtrative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to eſtabliſh the perpetuity of the Law againſt any Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian, yet it may prevaile with any reaſonable man.

Some think, they thought <hi>Moſes</hi> was dead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſired ſome viſible god among them, as the Egyptians had: and becauſe they worſhiped <hi>Apis,</hi> an Oxe, hence they made a Calfe, wherein their wickedneſs was exceeding great (though, againſt the truth, ſome Rabbins excuſe them from idolatry) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did immediately upon the promulgation of the Law, when they had ſo ſolemnly promiſed obedience, fall into this
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65695:83"/>
ſin; and not only ſo, but worſhipped it, and gave the glory of all the benefits they injoyed unto this: not as if they were ſo ſimple, as to think this a god, but to worſhip the true God by this. And this confuteth all thoſe diſtinctions that Idolaters uſe, eſpecially Papiſts, about their falſe worſhip. We are not to follow our own hearts, but the Word. As the childe in the womb liveth by fetching nouriſhment by the navell only from the mother, ſo doth the Church by fetching inſtruction and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The time of</hi> Moſes <hi>his abode on the Mount.</hi> This alſo is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable <note place="margin">5. <hi>Moſes</hi> his abode in the Mount, procured authority both to himſelf and the Law.</note> in the ſtory; for hereby God did not only procure great ground of Authority for <hi>Moſes</hi> among the people, but alſo unto the Law: And therefore, as ſome compare the time of giving the Law, with the effuſion of the gifts of the holy Ghoſt in the Goſpel, making the former to be the fiftieth day of their egreſſe out of Egypt, called Pentecoſt: ſo at the ſame time the holy Ghoſt was given to the Church: Thus alſo they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Moſes</hi> forty dayes upon the Mount, with our Saviours forty days in the wilderneſs, when he was tempted. It was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a miraculous preſervation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he ſhould be there ſo long, and neither eat, nor drink. But this example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with that of our Saviours, is very vainly, and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably brought for faſting in Lent.</p>

                  <hi>Tables.</hi> When <hi>Moſes</hi> came down, he ſaw how the people had tranſgreſſed the Law of God, which ſo moved him, that, in his zeal, he brake the Tables that were firſt made. This certainly was by the immediate ordering of God, to ſignifie, that this could not be a way of juſtification for them: and indeed, to hold that the Law can juſtifie, is ſo great an errour, that we are all Antinomians in this ſenſe. One hath ſaid, that <hi>the Law was like the tree of knowledge of good and evil, but the Goſpel that is like the tree of life:</hi> yet this muſt be rightly underſtood; for God <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> his zeal in breaking the Tables, vindicated from raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſinful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of minde,</note> uſeth the Law, as he doth his whole World, to beget and increaſe the life of grace in us, only this life is not that which can juſtifie us: and in this effect of the Law, to increaſe life, <hi>David</hi> doth often commend it.</p>
               <p>Now ſome have attributed this to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a ſin, accounting

it his impatiency and raſhneſs to break the Tables. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be a good zeal for the main; onely they think here was ſome ſtrange fire, as well as the fire of the Sanctuary. But although this excandeſcency of <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſudden, yet I ſee not, why it ſhould be attributed as raſhneſs in him to break the Tables; for he had brought thoſe Tables as a ſign of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſtricken with God: but now, they having broken it by their Idolatry, it was very juſt to have the Tables broken in the eyes of the people, that ſo they might ſee how God was aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them: ſo that we think, he did it not with any ſinfull perturbation of minde, but an holy zeal: God hereby alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that they ſhould underſtand, God would enter into a new Covenant with them; which made <hi>Auſtin</hi> cry out, <hi>O ira prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, &amp; animus non perturbatus, ſed illuminatus!</hi> O anger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall, and a minde not diſturbed, but inlightned.</p>

Moſes</hi> deſireth Gods preſence to be with him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting of the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and, as a ſign, whereby he might be confirmed of his preſence, he deſireth to ſee Gods glory. It is hard to ſay, what was <hi>Moſes</hi> his petition in this thing. I cannot be of their minde, who make this onely a viſion, and nothing really acted: nor of theirs, who think that <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee the eſſence of God. I will not diſpute that Queſtion, <hi>Whether the bodily eyes of a man may be lifted up to that perfection, as to ſee God, Who is a ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can I think that they attain to the truth, who think by <hi>the glory of God,</hi> to be meant the reaſons and grounds of Gods mercies, and in particular, his providence to the Iſraelites and by the <hi>back-parts,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> was allowed to ſee, the effects themſelves of his mercy and providence, as if God intended to ſhew <hi>Moſes</hi> his wonderful effects, but not the reaſons of them.</p>
               <p>Nor laſtly, That <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee the humanity of Chriſt in glory, like that viſion of transfiguration: therefore I judge
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65695:84"/>
this moſt literall, that although it's ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. that Moſes <hi>spake with God face to face,</hi> which argueth familiarity, yet for all that, even then God was clothed as it were in a cloud interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it ſelf. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> he deſireth, that God would manifeſt himſelf in a more ſenſible, viſible, and glorious way of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhape; even as before he would have known Gods Name. Now God in part anſwereth him, and in part denieth him, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a glorious object, that yet he was not able to ſee, but where the light was leſſe intenſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The reparation of the Tables again.</hi> And here is ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <note place="margin">8. Though the writing of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tables was Gods work, yet the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them was the work of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </note> between the former and the later Tables: The former, God provided both for the ſhape and the writing, as you heard; but here the forming or poliſhing of the Table is <hi>Moſes</hi> his work, and the writing is Gods. The firſt is ſaid expreſly, <hi>Exod. 34. 1. Go, hew thee two Tables of ſtone like the former, and I will write upon theſe Tables.</hi> Here is the ſecond expreſly. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3. ſo that the writing of the Law on the ſecond Tables, was as im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mediately Gods work, as the former; but not the poliſhing or preparing of the Tables. Onely there is one place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which troubleth the Learned much, that ſeemeth to oppoſe this, and to make the writing upon the ſecond Table to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the act of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and mediately onely of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he commanded and directed <hi>Moſes</hi> to do ſo.</p>
               <p>The place that ſeemeth to oppoſe this, is <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 27, 28. I confeſſe, if we look into the coherence of theſe Texts, we ſhall finde ſome things difficult. But two things will help to clear it: firſt, that the things which <hi>Moſes</hi> did write, were not the ten Commandments, but the ſeverall precepts, that were by way of explication; and then the ſecond thing is, that whereas the 28. <hi>verſe</hi> ſeemeth to ſpeak of the ſame ſubject, <hi>Moſes;</hi> yet the two former predicates are to be attributed to him. <hi>viz.</hi> his ſtaying with God fourty dayes and nights, and his neither eating nor drinking all that while: Then the third predicate is to be given to God, <hi>viz.</hi> writing upon the ten Commandments; for it's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary with the Hebrews, to refer the relative to ſome remote ſubject, and not the neereſt; and this may untie that knot. There is this remarkable, that though the former Tables were
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65695:85"/>
broken, yet now God enters into a Covenant of grace with them, as appeareth by proclaiming himſelf long-ſuffering, and gracious; but yet God cauſeth the ten Commandments to be written again for them, implying, that theſe may very well ſtand with a Covenant of grace, which oppoſeth the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>The extraordinary glory that was upon</hi> Moſes. This is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable <note place="margin">9. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary glory that was upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law to be glorious.</note> paſſage; for the Apoſtle ſpeaking of this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. doth acknowledge the miniſtration of the Law to have a great deal of glory; but yet ſuch as was to vaniſh. Where, by the way, take notice againſt the Antinomian, that the Apoſtle doth not there ſpeak of the Law abſolutely in it ſelf, as if that were to be done away; but, the particular adminiſtration and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of it, that was no more to continue, which all grant. Now the Antinomian confounds the Law, with the adminiſtration of it. This glory and ſhining that was upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> was (as it may ſeem probable) communicated unto him, when he beheld the glory of God. How long it continued, is not certain: that hath no probability of the Rabbins, who hold, it did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue all his life time. The Vulgar Tranſlation makes it horned, <hi>Cornuta;</hi> hence the Painters pictured <hi>Moſes</hi> with horns: but the word that ſignifieth <hi>an horne,</hi> is alſo for <hi>to glitter,</hi> and <hi>ſhine:</hi> as alſo thoſe rayes of light might be caſt forth from <hi>Moſes</hi> his face like horns. This was ſo glorious, that he was forced to put a vail upon his face, when he ſpake to the people. Now the Text ſaith, <hi>Moſes</hi> did not know his face ſhone. It's an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing, when God puts a great deal of glory upon a man, and he doth not know it. <hi>Gregory</hi> applyeth this of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to Miniſters, that, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe the people could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the glorious light of his face, put a vail upon it, that ſo the people might converſe with him: thus the Miniſter, whoſe parts and ſcholarſhip is far above the people, ſhould put on a vail, by condeſcending to the people. But the Apoſtle maketh another myſticall meaning, wherein the hard things ſhall in <note place="margin">10. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Law in the Ark makes much for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it.</note> time (God willing) be opened.</p>

of the Law. As this one was witten by the immediate hand of God, ſo was it only commanded to be preſerved in the Ark. Now here is a great diſpute in matter of Hiſtory: for 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 9. it's expreſly ſaid, that <hi>in the Ark there was nothing ſave the tables of ſtone;</hi> but <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 4. there is joyned <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, and the pot of manna. Thoſe that for this reſpect would reject the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as of no authority, are too bold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent. Some think we cannot reconcile them; yet the Scripture is true, onely our underſtandings are weak. Some think, that at firſt God commanded thoſe two to be laid with the tables of the Covenant; but when the Temple was built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> then all were laid aſide by themſelves: and therefore, ſay they, that the Hiſtory of the <hi>Kings</hi> ſpeaketh of it as a new thing. Some, as <hi>Piſcator,</hi> make <hi>in</hi> to be as much as <hi>coram, before or hard by:</hi> and ſo they ſay, the pot and rod were <hi>by</hi> the Ark. But I ſhall cloſe with that of <hi>Junius,</hi> who obſerves, that the relative is in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine, <gap reason="foreign">

And this, though it may be capable of ſome objection, yet doth excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconcile the truth of the hiſtory with <hi>Paul.</hi> Now how long theſe Tables of ſtone were kept, and what became of them at laſt, we have no certainty. This proveth the great glory God did put upon the Law above any thing elſe, which I intended in all theſe hiſtoricall obſervations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Of Inſtruction. How willing God was to put marks <note place="margin">Seeing God hath put ſuch marks of glory upon the <hi>Law,</hi> let us take heed of diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it.</note> of glory and perpetuity upon the Law; and therefore we are to take heed of diſparaging it. For, how neceſſary is it to have this Law promulged, if it were poſſible, as terribly in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, as it was on Mount <hi>Sinai?</hi> This would make the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Antinomians finde the power of the Law, and be afraid to reject it. Certainly, as the Phyſitian doth not purge the bodies till he hath made them fluid, and prepared; ſo may not the Miniſters of Chriſt apply grace, and the promiſes thereof, to men of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurean or phariſaicall ſpirits, till they be humbled by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſin, which is made by the Law. And I doubt it may fall out with an Antinomian, who accounts ſin nothing in the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65695:86"/>
beleever, becauſe of juſtification, as with one <hi>Dionyſius</hi> a Stoick (as I take it) who held, that pain was nothing; but, being once ſick, and tortured with the ſtone in the kidnies, cried out, that all that he had writ about pain was falſe; for now he found it was ſomething: So it may fall out that a man, who hath writ, and preached, that God ſeeth no ſin in a believer, may ſometime or other be ſo awed and troubled by God, that he ſhall cry out, All that he preached about this, he now findes to be falſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let thoſe that have diſparaged, or deſpiſed it, ſee their ſin, and give it its due dignity. They report of <hi>Steſichorus,</hi> that when in ſome words he had diſparaged <hi>Helena's</hi> beauty, he was ſtruck blinde; but afterwards when he praiſed her again, he obtained the uſe of ſeeing. It may be, becauſe thou haſt not ſet forth the due excellency of the Law, God hath taken away thy eye-ſight, not to ſee the beauty of it; but begin with <hi>David</hi> to ſet forth the excellent benefits of it, and then thou mayeſt ſee more glory in it then ever.</p>

               <p>But many interpreters underſtand it of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he was the Mediator in the Law, and indeed the words following ſeem to approve of this; for ſaith the Apoſtle, a Mediator is not a Mediator of one, that is, of thoſe that are one in conſent, and accord, but of thoſe that diſſent; now <hi>Moſes</hi> could not be truly and really a Mediator between God, and the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when God was angry with them for their ſins. Beſides, the Law, as is to be ſhewed, is a Covenant of grace, and Chriſt onely can be the Mediator in ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by way of Office, becauſe he only is <hi>Medius</hi> in his nature. <hi>Beza</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed brings Arguments againſt this interpretation, but they ſeem not ſtrong enough to remove this ſenſe given, neither doth this phraſe, <hi>by the hand</hi> (which is an <hi>Hebraiſme)</hi> denote alwaies <hi>miniſtery</hi> and <hi>inferiority,</hi> but ſometimes power and ſtrength, but more of this in the explication of the doctrine.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rogate from it. Indeed though Chriſt gave the Law, yet the Apoſtle make the preheminency of the Goſpel far above it, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave the Law one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the form of an Angel, but he gave the goſpel when made man, whereby was manifeſted the glory not of <hi>Angels,</hi> but of the <hi>onely begotten Son of God.</hi> how carefull then ſhould men be, leſt they offend, or tranſgreſs that Law, which hath ſuch ſacred authority. It is a wonder to ſee how men are afraid to break mans Law, which yet cannot damn, but tremble not at all, in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of that Law-giver, who is only able to ſave, or deſtroy. For the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of this conſider: Firſt, that Ieſus Chriſt is the Angel that gave this Law, as the chief captain of all thoſe Angels that did accompany him: For <hi>Act. 7. 35. It is the ſame that appeared to Moſes in the buſh,</hi> God the Father hath committed the whole Government and guidance of the redemption of that people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the hands of Chriſt: Hence <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 3. 9. he is called the Angel of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> becauſe he made that Covenant of the Law, with his people on <hi>mount Sinai:</hi> This is the Angel, that <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 2. God ſaid he <hi>would ſend before them to drive out the Nations of the land,</hi> and <hi>v</hi> 14. there he is called <hi>the face of God,</hi> or his preſence which ſhould go before them, and you have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table place, <hi>Exod. 23. 20. I will ſend an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place, which I have prepared: beware of him, provoke him not, for he will not pardon your tranſgreſſions, for my name is in him:</hi> by this it is clear, that it was Ieſus Chriſt who was ſubſervient to the Father, in this whole
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65695:87"/>
work of Redemption out of <hi>Aegypt. Grotius</hi> in the explication of the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> judgeth it a grievous errour, to hold that the ſecond perſon in the Trinity was the <hi>Angel</hi> who gave this Law, and indeed all the Socinians deny this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſay, Chriſt had no ſubſiſtency before his Incarnation: ſome Papiſts alſo think it to be a created Angel; but he muſt needs be God, becauſe this <hi>Angel</hi> beginneth thus in the promulgation of the Law, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Aegypt.</hi> Neither wil that ſerve for an anſwer, which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith, that the Angel cals himſelf the God that brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> becauſe he is an Embaſſador, and ſpeaks in the name of the Lord: for were not the Prophets Gods Embaſſadors, yet their language was, Thus ſaith the Lord, they never appropriated the name of <hi>Iehovah</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whereas this <hi>Angel</hi> is called <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 9. The Iews are ſaid to tempt Chriſt, becauſe he was the <hi>Angel</hi> that did deliver them by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is diſputed, whether, when any <hi>Angel</hi> appeared who was alſo God, that it was alſo the <hi>Son of God;</hi> ſo that in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> the Father, and the Holy ghoſt never appeared, but the Son only; <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought it a queſtion worth the deciding, when he ſpent a great part of his ſecond book of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in handling of it. Many of the ancient Fathers thought that it was the Son onely that appeared, ſo that all the apparitions which were to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Moſes;</hi> the God that ſpake then, they underſtand to be the Son, and this was done they ſay, as a preludium to his Incarnation: But ſome of thoſe Ancients give a dangerous, and falſe reaſon, which was, becauſe they held, the Father only was inviſible, and ſo apply unto the Father only that text, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time,</hi> ſo that they thought the Son might be ſeen, but not the Father, which paſſages, the Arrians did greedily catch at afterwards.</p>
               <p>But this is certain, the ſecond Perſon is no more viſible, or mutable then the firſt; only it may be doubted, whether all thoſe adminiſtrations and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions which were by God in the Old Teſtament, were not by the ſecond Perſon: indeed, in the New Teſtament, that voice from heaven, <hi>This is my welbelou Son,</hi> muſt needs be from the Father immediatly: It hath been very hard to know when the Angel that appeared hath been a created one, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, the Son of God. <hi>Toſtatus</hi> gives this rule, when the things communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in Scripture, as done by an Angel, are of ſmall conſequence or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to one man, or a few men, then it is a created Angel; but if they be matters of great concernment, or belonging to many people, then it is by an increated Angel; he enumerates many examples, which are not to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, neither may we be curious in determining of the former queſtion. Let the uſe of this be to take heed, how we cry down this Law, which God hath ſo honoured, either by <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or <hi>Practiſes.</hi> We may live down the Law, and we may preach down the Law, both which are a reproach to it; and the Law is of ſuch a perpetuall, immutable obligation, that the very being of a ſin is in this, that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a tranſgreſſion of the <hi>Law,</hi> ſo that if there be no obligatory power of the Law, there can be no ſin. If the Heathen thought politicall Laws, were the wals of a City, and it were no advantage to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65695:88"/>
have fortified wals, and proſtrated laws; how much more is this true of Gods Commandments: Thoſe three things which are required in a <hi>Law giver,</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, wiſdom, and holineſs, were tranſcendently in God, therefore every ſin hath diſobedience in it, becauſe it is againſt authority; folly in it, becauſe it's againſt wiſdom; and injuſtice in it, becauſe againſt righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>In the next place, it's worth the obſerving how <hi>Paul</hi> in this place, and ſo in his other Epiſtles is ſtill carefull ſo to bound the doctrine of the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> ſo as neither may incroach upon each other, from whence floweth this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Law ought ſo to be preached, as that it ſhould not obſcure the Goſpel, and the Goſpel ſo commended, as that there may be no deſtruction to the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was <hi>Pauls</hi> method in all his <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> which he diligently obſerved: Indeed, it hath been very hard ſo to give both their due, that either the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or the hearer, hath not thereby been inclined to make one prejudiciall to the other: Not but that the <hi>Gospel</hi> is to be preferred, and that in divers reſpects, but when it is ſo extolled that the <hi>Law</hi> is made uſeleſs, and unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, this is to go beyond lawfull limits; and how difficult it hath been to hit the mark here, appeareth in that the Iews, Papiſts, Arminians, Socinians, and generally all Heretiques have advanced the <hi>Law,</hi> to the eclipſing of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> and there have been few who have extolled the <hi>Gospel</hi> to the prejudice of the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To proceed therefore regularly, we will ſhew when the <hi>Law</hi> is preached pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicially to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and when the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place, the <hi>Law</hi> is then ſtretched too far, when the works of it are preſſed to juſtification, whether theſe works be the fruits of grace, or ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneous to grace, it is not much difference to this point; and this is that dangerous doctrine of the <hi>Law,</hi> which the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle, doth ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently withſtand, and for which, he is not afraid to charge the teachers thereof, with <hi>apoſtacy</hi> from Chriſt, and ſuch who make Chriſt, and all his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in vain. And this is indeed to be a legall Preacher, inſomuch that it is an high calumny to charge Proteſtant Preachers, with the odious accuſation of legall preachers; for he is not a legall preacher in the Scripture ſence, which preſſeth the duty and works of the <hi>Law</hi> but that urgeth them for juſtification, and that righteouſneſs which we muſt rely upon before the Tribunall of God: and thou mayſt juſtly fear it is thy unſanctified &amp; corrupt heart, which makes thee averſs from the <hi>Law</hi> in the former ſence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Law</hi> is uſed derogatory to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> when Chriſt is not indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from juſtification, but Chriſt and works are conjoyned together, and this is more <hi>ſugred poiſon</hi> then the former: Now this was the doctrine of thoſe falſe Apoſtles among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> they did not totally exclude him, but yet they did not make him all in all: but God doth not approve of ſuch unequall yoking. It is equall impiety to preach no Chriſt, or an half and imperfect Chriſt; and therefore as thoſe were curſed Doctrines which take away any of his natures, ſo alſo are thoſe which diminiſh of his ſufficiency. There is but one <hi>Mediator,</hi> and as <hi>God</hi> will not give his glory to another, ſo neither will Chriſt that of his <hi>Mediatorſhip</hi> to any other; ſo that, as <hi>God</hi> is jealous of his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65695:88"/>
honour, when men give it to fools, no leſs is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when men give it to the <hi>works</hi> they do. And this makes the way of juſtifying Faith ſo difficult, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo inbred in mens hearts, to have ſomething of their own, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing are they to be beholding to Chriſt for all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then is the <hi>Law</hi> preached prejudicially to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> when it is made of it ſelf inſtrumental to work <hi>grace.</hi> It cannot be denied, as is hereafter to be ſhewn, that the <hi>Law</hi> is uſed by <hi>God</hi> to begin and increaſe <hi>grace,</hi> but this cometh wholly by Chriſt. It is not of the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelf, that this ſpirituall vertue is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to men. Even as when the woman touched the hem of Chriſts garment, It was not efficacy from the hem, but from Chriſt that wrought ſo wonderfully in her. It is one thing to ſay <hi>grace</hi> is given with the preaching of the Law, and another thing by the Law; ſo that the Goſpel muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the onely fountain both of <hi>grace</hi> juſtifying, and ſanctifying, for as in natural things, if no Sun did ariſe, every creature would lie dead, as it were in its own inability to do any thing there would be no naturall life, or growth; ſo if the Son of righteouſneſs do not ariſe with healing, no Law, or Ordinance, could ever be beneficiall to us.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, the Goſpel may be extolled to the ruin of the Law; and that firſt, when it is ſaid to bring a liberty not only from the damnatory po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but alſo the obligatory power of it: How well would it be if the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomiſts,</hi> in all their Books and Sermons, while they ſet up <hi>grace</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> would make to themſelves this objection with <hi>Paul, Do we then make void the Law? God forbid.</hi> Certainly if you take away the condemning power, and the commanding power of the Law, there will not ſo much remain of it, as did of <hi>Jezebels</hi> corps, when the dogs had gnawn it. Therefore ſtand faſt indeed in the liberty of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but ſtudy again, and again, whether that be <hi>Gospel-</hi>liberty, or prophane Licence that thou pleadeſt for: certainly, he that ſets up the <hi>Gospel</hi> in a ſcripture way, and not a fancy-way, will go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the bounds of the Scripture; do not uſe <hi>Gospel-grace</hi> as a cloak for thy more ſecure and looſe walking. I tell thee, there is a great danger in thoſe expreſſions, I have had enough of the Law; the time was, I dared not omit time of prayer: I was ſtrict on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> and in all family duties, but now I underſtand my liberty better. Oh, know this is a <hi>Gospel</hi> of thy own making, Free-grace of thy own minting. I deny not, but that the people of God may by the Devil be kept among the Tombs, as that <hi>Demoniack</hi> was in ſad thoughts, and ſlaviſh fears, which are oppoſite to the promiſe: I grant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that a Miniſter may as unſeaſonably preſs the Law upon ſome humbled <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as if the Samaritan had taken ſalt inſtead of oil, and poured it into the wounds of that man of <hi>Jericho.</hi> But for all this, the unskilfulneſs of the <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> may not derogate from the medicine; and as there is a time, when the <hi>Law</hi> may be unſeaſonably preached, ſo alſo there may be a time, when the promiſes ſhould not be preſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then is the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or <hi>grace</hi> ſet up contrary to the Law, when <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are wholly taken off from humiliation for ſin, or from the threatnings that are in the Law. What a dangerous expreſſion is that of an Antinomian, that the <hi>Law</hi> hath no more to do with a believer, then the law of <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:65695:89"/>
with an <hi>Engliſhman;</hi> There is nothing more ordinary, even in the New-Teſtament, then to awaken Believers with ſad, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere threatenings. Take heed therefore, leſt that condition, which thou ſo bleſſeſt thy ſelf in, by Goſpel light, be not worſe, and more dangerous, then that wherein thou groanedſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law. I ſpeak not this, as if the people of God ought not to ſeek for a ſpirit of adoption, and to ſtrive for an <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall</hi> temper, which certainly is moſt heavenly, and holy; but to take heed of temptations, and being drunk with this ſweet wine. Let therefore from hence, both Miniſters and people make an <hi>harmonious accord</hi> of the Law and Goſpel in their practical obſervations. If on the <hi>Mount of transfiguration, Chriſt was in glory,</hi> and <hi>Moſes in glory,</hi> and yet both together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any oppoſition; ſo may the Law be a glorious Law, and the Goſpel a glorious Goſpel in thy uſe, and to thy apprehenſion.</p>

               <p>WE have already conſidered thoſe hiſtorical Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are in the delivery of the Law, and improved them to the dignity and excellency thereof. I now come to the handling of thoſe Queſtions which make much to the clearing of the truths about ithat are now doubted of. And, firſt of all, it may be demanded, <hi>To what purpoſe is this diſcourſe about the Law given by</hi> Moſes? Are we Jews? Doth that belong to us? Hath not Chriſt aboliſhed the Law? Is not <hi>Moſes,</hi> with his Miniſtery, now at an end? It is therefore worth the inquiry, <hi>Whether the ten Commandments, as given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>do belong to us Chriſtians, or no?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the anſwering of this Queſtion, I will lay down ſome
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65695:89"/>
Propoſitions by way of Preface, and then bring arguments for the affirmative.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, <hi>Though it ſhould be granted, that the Morall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, though the Law, as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> did not binde Chriſtians.</note> 
                  <hi>Law, as given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>doth not belong to us Chriſtians; yet the doctrine of the Antinomians would not hold:</hi> for there are ſome learned and ſolid Divines, as <hi>Zanchy</hi> and <hi>Rivet;</hi> and many Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piſts, as <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> which hold the Law, as dilivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> not to belong to us, and yet are expreſly againſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomiſts: for they ſay, that howſoever the Law doth not binde under that notion as Moſaicall; yet it binds, becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Chriſt: ſo that although the firſt obligation ceaſeth, and we have nothing to do with <hi>Moſes</hi> now; yet the ſecond obligation, which cometh by Chriſt, is ſtill upon us. And this is enough to overthrow the Antinomian, who pleadeth for the totall abrogation of the Law.</p>
               <p>Thus, you ſee, that if this ſhould be granted, yet the Law ſhould be kept up in its full vigour and force as much as if it were continued by <hi>Moſes.</hi> But I conceive that this poſition go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon a falſe ground, as if our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. did there take away the obligation by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and put a new ſanction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, by his own authority; as if he ſhould have ſaid, The Law ſhall no longer binde you as it is <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, but as it is mine. Now this ſeemeth to overthrow the whole ſcope of our Saviour, which is to ſhew, that he did not come to deſtroy the Law: And therefore he doth not take upon him to be a new Law-giver, but an Interpreter of the old Law by <hi>Moſes.</hi> This I intend to handle, God willing, in that Queſtion, <hi>Whether Chriſt hath appointed any new duties, that were not in the Law before,</hi> Only this ſeemeth to be very cleare, that our Saviour there doth but interpret the old law, and vindicate it from corrupt gloſſes, and not either make a new Law, or intend a new confirmation of the old Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider in what ſenſe we ſay, that the Law doth binde us in regard of</hi> Moſes; And,</p>
               <p>Firſt, this may be underſtood reduplicatively, as if it did <note place="margin">The Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not bind us in regard of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </note> bind, becauſe of <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo that whatſoeveer is of <hi>Moſes</hi> his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery doth belong to us: and this is very falſe, and contrary
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65695:90"/>
to the whole current of Scripture; for then the <hi>Ceremoniall Law</hi> would alſo binde us, becauſe <hi>à quatenus ad omne valet conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> ſo that you muſt not underſtand it in this ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you may underſtand it thus, that <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">The Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as written for the Church of God, and intended for good to Chriſtians in the New Teſtament, is binding.</note> of the Scripture, writing this down for the Church of God, did by this intend good to Chriſtians in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and this cannot be well denyed by any, that do hold the Old-Teſtament doth belong to Chriſtians; for why ſhould not the books of <hi>Moſes</hi> belong to us, as well as the books of the Prophets?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, therefore we may underſtand it thus, that God, when he gave the ten Commandements by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people of Iſrael, though they were the preſent ſubject to whom he <note place="margin">Though the people of Iſrael were the preſent ſubject to whom the Morall Law was given, yet the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation thereof was intended for the Church of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually.</note> ſpake; yet he did intend an obligation by theſe Laws, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Jewes, but alſo all other Nations that ſhould be converted, and come to imbrace their Religion: And this is indeed the very proper ſtate of the Queſtion, not, <hi>Whether</hi> Moſes <hi>was a Miniſter, or a Mediator to the Chriſtians as well as the Jewes?</hi> (for that is clearly falſe) but, <hi>Whether, when he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ten Commandements, he intended only the Jewes, and not all that ſhould be converted hereafter?</hi> It is true, the people of Iſrael were the people to whom this Law was immediately promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; but yet the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether others, as they came under the promulgation of it, were not bound to receive it as well as Jews?</hi> So that we muſt conceive of <hi>Moſes</hi> as receiving the <hi>Morall Law</hi> for the Church of God perpetually; but the other Lawes in a peculiar and more appropriated way to the Jewes: For the Church of the Jewes may be conſidered in their proper pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar way, as wherein moſt of their ordinances were typicall, and ſo <hi>Moſes,</hi> a typicall Mediator; or, Secondly, as an Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or Schoole, or Library, wherein the true doctrine about God and his will was preſerved, as alſo the interpretations of this given by the Prophets then living; and in this latter ſenſe, <note place="margin">The Morall Law is bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. 1. In Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the matter of it.</note> what they did, they did for us, as well as for the Jewes. And, that this may be the more cleared to you, you may conſider the <hi>Morall Law to binde</hi> two wayes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of the matter,</hi> and ſo whatſoever in it is the Law
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65695:90"/>
of Nature, doth oblige all: and thus, as the Law of Nature, it did binde the Jewes before the promulgation of it upon Mount <note place="margin">2. In regard of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive authority put upon it.</note> Sinai.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or you may conſider it ſecondly, <hi>to binde in regard of the preceptive authority, and command, which is put upon it;</hi> for when a Law is promulged by a Meſſenger, then there cometh a new obligation upon it: and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> a Miniſter, and <note place="margin">The obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Morall Law perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</note> Servant of God, delivering this Law to them, did bring an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon the people.</p>
               <p>Now the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether this obligation was temporary or perpetuall?</hi> I incline to that opinion, which <hi>Pareus</hi> alſo doth, that it is perpetuall, and ſo doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Howſoever <hi>Rivet</hi> ſeemeth to make no great matter in this Queſtion, if ſo be that we hold the Law obligeth <hi>in regard of the matter,</hi> though we deny it binding <hi>in regard of the promulgation of it by</hi> Moſes: howſoever (I ſay) he thinkes it a Logomachy and of no great conſequence; yet certainly it is: For, although they profeſſe themſelves againſt the Antinomiſts, and do ſay, The Law ſtill obligeth, becauſe of Chriſts confirmation of it; yet the Antinomians do profeſſe they do not differ here from them, but they ſay, the Law bindeth in regard of the matter, and as it is in the hand of Jeſus Chriſt. It is true, this expreſſion of theirs is contradicted by them, and neceſſarily it muſt be ſo: for <hi>Iſlebius,</hi> and the old Antinomians, with the latter alſo, do not only ſpeake againſt the Law as binding by <hi>Moſes;</hi> but the <hi>bona opera,</hi> the good works, which are the matter of the Law, as appeareth in their dangerous poſitions about <hi>good works,</hi> which heretofore. I have examined: but, truly, take the Antinomian in their former expreſſions, and I do not yet underſtand how thoſe Orthodox Divines differ from them. And therefore if it can be made good without any forcing or conſtraining the Scripture, that God when he gave the ten Commandements (for I ſpeak of the <hi>Morall Law</hi> only) by <hi>Moſes,</hi> did intend an obligation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall of the Jewes, and all others converted to him, then will the Antinomian errour fall more clearly to the ground; only when I bring my Arguments for the affirmative, you muſt ſtill remember in what ſenſe the Queſtion is ſtated, and that I ſpeak
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65695:91"/>
not of the whole latitude of the Miniſtery of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, in the firſt place, I bring this Argument, (which much <note place="margin">Argum. 1.</note> prevaileth with me:) <hi>If ſo be the Ceremoniall Law, as given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>had ſtill obliged Chriſtians, though there could be no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the matter, had it not been revoked and aboliſhed; then the Morall Law given by</hi> Moſes <hi>muſt ſtill oblige, though it did not binde in reſpect of the matter, unleſſe we can ſhew where it is repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> For the further clearing of this, you may conſider, that this was the great Queſtion, which did ſo much trouble the Church in her infancy, <hi>Whether Gentiles converted were bound to keep up the Ceremoniall Law? Whether they were bound to circumciſe, and to uſe all thoſe legall purifications?</hi> Now how are theſe Queſtions decided, but thus? That they were but the ſhadows, and Chriſt the fulneſſe was come, and therefore they were to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>And thus for the Judiciall Laws, becauſe they were given to them as a politick body, that polity ceaſing, which was the principall, the acceſſory falls with it; ſo that the <hi>Ceremoniall Law,</hi> in the judgement of all, had ſtill bound Chriſtians, were there not ſpeciall revocations of theſe commands, and were there not reaſons for their expiration from the very nature of them. Now no ſuch thing can be affirmed by the Morall Law; for the matter of that is perpetuall, and there are no places of Scripture that do abrogate it. And, if you ſay, that the Apoſtle in ſome places, ſpeaking of the Law, ſeemeth to take in Morall, as well as Ceremoniall, I anſwer it thus: The queſtion which was firſt ſtarted up and troubled the Church, was meerly about Ceremonies, as appeareth <hi>Act</hi> 15. and their opinion was, that by the uſage of this Ceremoniall worſhip they were juſtified; either wholly excluding Chriſt, or joyning him together with the Ceremoniall Law. Now it's true, the Apoſtles, in demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing this errour, do <hi>ex abundanti</hi> ſhew, that not onely the works of the Ceremoniall Law, but neither of the Morall Law do juſtifie; but that benefit we have by Chriſt onely: Therefore the Apoſtles, when they bring in the Morall Law in the diſpute, they do it in reſpect of juſtification, not obligation; for the maine Queſtion was, <hi>Whether the Ceremoniall Law did ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige:</hi> and their additionall errour was, that if it did oblige, we
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65695:91"/>
ſhould ſtill be juſtified by the performance of thoſe acts; ſo that the Apoſtles do not joyn the Morall and Ceremoniall Law in the iſſue of obligation (for, though the Jewes would have held, they were not juſtified by them, yet they might not have practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them) but in regard of juſtification: and this is the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument is <hi>from the Scripture, urging the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Argum. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Law upon Gentiles converted, as obliging of them, with the ground and reaſon of it;</hi> which is, that they were our fathers: ſo that the Jews and Chriſtians beleeving are looked upon as one people. Now, that the Scripture urgeth the Morall Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Heathens converted, as a commandment heretofore deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, is plain When <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the Romans, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. 8, 9. he telleth them, <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law;</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reckons up the commandments which were given by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thus when he writeth to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that were not Jews, <hi>cap.</hi> 6. 2. he urgeth children to honour their father and mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>it's the firſt Commandment with promiſe.</hi> Now this was wholly from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and could be no other way: And this is further evident by <hi>James, chap.</hi> 2. 8, 10. in his Epiſtle, which is generall, and ſo to Gentiles converted, as well as to the Jews. Now mark thoſe two expreſſions, <hi>v. 8. If you fulfill the royall Law, according to the Scriptures;</hi> that is, of <hi>Moſes,</hi> where the ſecond Table containeth our love to our neighbour: and then, <hi>v. 10. He that ſaid, Do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo, Do not kill;</hi> where, you ſee, he makes the Argument not in the matter, but in the Author who was God by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people of Iſrael. And if you ſay, Why ſhould theſe Commandments reach to them? I anſwer, becauſe (as it is to be ſhewed in anſwering the objections againſt this truth) the Jews and we are looked upon as one people. Obſerve that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. The Apoſtle, writing to the Corinthians, ſaith, <hi>Our fathers were all baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the cloud and ſea,</hi> &amp;c. Now how could this be true of the Corinthians, but only becauſe ſince they beleeved, they were looked upon as one?</p>
               <p>The third Argument is <hi>from the obligation upon us to keep the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Sabbath day:</hi> This is a full Argument to me, that the Morall Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> doth binde us Chriſtians; for, ſuppoſing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65695:92"/>
that opinion (which is abundantly proved by the Orthodox) that the Sabbath day is perpetuall, and that by vertue of the fourth Commandment, we cannot then but gather, that the Commandments, as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> do binde us: For here their diſtinction will not hold of binding <hi>ratione materiae,</hi> by reaſon of the matter; and <hi>ratione miniſterii,</hi> by reaſon of the miniſtry: for the ſeventh day cannot binde from the matter of it, there being nothing in nature, why the ſeventh, rather then the fifth, ſhould oblige; but only from the meer Command of God for that day: and yet it will not follow, that we are bound to keep the Jewiſh ſeventh day, as the Learned ſhew in that controverſie.</p>
               <p>Now then, thoſe that deny the Law as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> muſt needs conclude, that we keep the Sabbath day at the beſt, but from the grounds of the New-Teſtament, and not from the fourth Command at all: And, howſoever it be no argument to build upon, yet all Churches have kept the morall Law with the Preface to it, and have it in their Catechiſmes, as ſuppoſing it to belong unto us.</p>
               <p>And when thoſe prophane opinions, and licentious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines came up againſt the Sabbath Day; did not all learned and ſound men look upon it as taking away one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? Therefore that diſtinction of theirs, <hi>The Morall Law bindes as the Law of Nature, but not as the Law of</hi> Moſes, doth no wayes hold: for the Sabbath day cannot be from the Law of Nature, in regard of the determinate time, but hath its morality and perpetuity from the meere poſitive Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
               <p>The fourth Argument from Reaſon, that <hi>it is very incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Argum. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>to have a temporary obligation upon a perpetuall duty.</hi> How probable can it be, that God, delivering the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhould intend a temporary obligation only, when the matter is perpetualy; As if it had been thus ordered, <hi>You ſhall have no other gods</hi> but till <hi>Moſes</hi> his time: <hi>You ſhall not murder or commit adultery</hi> but till his miniſtry laſteth, and then that obligation muſt ceaſe, and a new obligation come upon you. Why ſhould we conceive that, when the matter is neceſſary and perpetuall, God would alter and change the obligations? None can give a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65695:92"/>
probable reaſon for any ſuch alteration. Indeed, that they ſhould circumciſe, or offer ſacrifices till <hi>Moſes</hi> miniſtry laſted onely, there is great reaſon to be given; &amp; thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> that objected God was worſhipped other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the Old-Teſtament then in the New: That is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> if that which be worſhipped be the true object, though it be worſhipped divers waves (when appointed by him) no more then when the ſame thing is pronounced in divers Languages.</p>
               <p>The fifth Argument, <hi>If the Law by</hi> Moſes <hi>do not binde us, then</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Argum. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the explication of it by the other Prophets doth not alſo belong unto us:</hi> For this you muſt know, that <hi>Moſes</hi> in other places doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane this Law; and <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, and <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbs, as alſo the Propheſies of the Prophets, ſo farre as they are Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, are nothing but explications of the Morall Law. Now what a wide doore will here be open to overthrow the Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament? If I bring that place <hi>Deut. 32. 46. [Set your hearts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe words which I teſtifie to you this day, becauſe it is your life,</hi> &amp;c.] to urge Chriſtians to keep the Commandments of the Lord, it may be replyed, What is that to us? we have nothing to do with <hi>Moſes:</hi> The matter, indeed doth belong to us as it is in the New-Teſtament, but as it is there written, ſo we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with it. And by this meanes all our Texts, and proofes, which are brought in our Sermons may be rejected. And therefore <hi>Dominicus à Soto</hi> (who is among the Papiſts for the negative) expreſly ſaith, <hi>lib. 2. de Juſt. &amp; jure, quaest. 5. Art.</hi> 4. that no place can be brought out of the books of the Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, unto Chriſtians, as in reſpect of the obliging force of it. This is plainly to overthrow the Old-Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Now let us conſider what are the chiefeſt Arguments which <note place="margin">Arguments of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians, whereby they would prove, <hi>that the Law, as given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>does not bind Chriſtians,</hi> examined &amp; anſwered, <hi>Argum.</hi> 1.</note> they bring for the ſupport of this opinion, that the Law, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Moſes,</hi> doth not binde Chriſtians. And, firſt, they urge the Preface <hi>[I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.]</hi> This doth not belonge to us, becauſe we nor our fathers ever were in Egypt: &amp;, ſay they further, The temporall Promiſe to keep the Law, doth not belong to us: therefore <hi>Epheſ. chap.</hi> 6 2. when <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth that Commandment with Promiſe, he doth not keep to the Promiſe particularly, <hi>that thy life may be
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65695:93"/>
long in the land the Lord thy God ſhall give thee;</hi> but ſpeakes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, firſt by adding ſomething, <hi>that it may be well with thee,</hi> which was not in the firſt Promiſe; &amp; then ſecondly, by detracting, ſaying only, <hi>that thou mayeſt live long upon the earth</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
               <p>Now to the Preface ſome anſwer thus, That we may be ſaid <note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> literally to be in Egypt: and they goe upon this ground, that we are made one with the people of the Jewes; and they bring the eleventh of the <hi>Romanes</hi> to prove this, where the Gentiles are ſaid to be <hi>graffed in,</hi> ſo that they become of the ſame ſtock. And it is plane, that the Beleevers are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; and then, by this interpretation, whatſoever mercy was vouchſafed unto them, we are to account it as ours. This cannot well be rejected, but yet I ſhall not pitch upon this. Others therefore they ſay, <note place="margin">Anſw. 2.</note> That this bondage was typicall of our ſpirituall bondage; and the deliverance out of it was typicall, of our deliverance from Hell. But this is not ſo literall an interpretation as I deſire, though I think it true. Therefore, in the third place, I ſhall anſwer, That there may be peculiar arguments that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <note place="margin">Anſw. 3.</note> to the Jewes, why they ſhould keep the Commandments, and there are genarall ones that belong to all. The generall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> this belongs to us; and then that peculiar argument may belong to them. And this is no new thing to have a perpetuall duty preſſed upon a people, by ſome occaſionall, or peculiar motive. Hence <hi>Jerem.</hi> 16. 14. 15. God ſaith there by the Prophet, that they <hi>ſhall no more ſay, The Lord that brought up out of the land of Egypt, but that brought up out of the land of the North.</hi> Where you ſee a ſpeciall new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may be brought for the generall duty. And as for the particular temporall Promiſe, I grant that did onely belong to them; but Ideny the conſequence, that therefore the precept doth not: for the Scripture uſeth divers arguments to the obedience of the ſame Command. <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes for the moſt part, and ſome of <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles, as <hi>Philemon,</hi> &amp;c. were written upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſions, yet the matter of them doth ſtill belong to us.</p>
               <p>The ſecoud Argument is, that, If the Law did oblige us as <note place="margin">Argum. 2.</note> given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> then it did the Gentiles, and Heathens alſo,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65695:93"/>
and ſo the Heathens were bound to thoſe Commandements, as well as the Jewes: but that is not ſo; therefore <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2. ſpeaketh of the Gentiles without this Law, and as thoſe that ſhall be judged without it.</p>
               <p>Now this may be anſwered: It doth not follow that the <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Law by <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt preſently binde the Gentiles, but when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged and made known to them; as at this time, Infidels and Pagans are not bound to beleeve in Ieſus Chriſt: but if the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt were promulged to them, they were then bound. And I make no queſtion but other Nations were then bound in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> his miniſtery, to enquire after the true God, and to worſhip him in the Jewiſh way, ſo far as they could. Thus we read of the Eunuch coming up to Jeruſalem to worſhip And certainly, if a whole Nation had then been converted, either they muſt have worſhipped God according to their own inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or God would have revealed unto them ſome different way of worſhipping him from the Jews, or elſe they were bound ſo far as they could (for the Ceremoniall worſhip bound them no otherwaies) to worſhip God in the Jewiſh way, then appointed by him. The Law then given by <hi>Moſes</hi> did binde Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as it was made known to them: Thus the ſtranger in the gates was to keep the Sabbath, though that be meant of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that had received their religion; yea, <hi>Nehem. 13. 19. Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> would not ſuffer the Tyrians that were ſtrangers, who did not ſubmit to the Jewiſh Law, to pollute the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Now to all this that hath been ſaid, you muſt take this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Though the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not belong to us in all the particulars of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, yet in the obliging power of it. it does.</note> That the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not belong to us in all the particulars of the adminiſtration of it. The giving of the Law in that terrible manner might be a peculiar thing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Jewes, as becoming the diſpenſation of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; but yet the giving of the Law it ſelf, in the obliging power of it, doth belong to us. We all acknowledge that the Old Teſtament had a peculiar adminiſtration from the New; it was fuller of terrour, and ſo did gender more to bondage then the New: Hence ſome ſay, that the Law was given on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> which it was ſo called from <hi>Seneh,</hi> a bramble buſh (the buſh God appeared in.) the Mountaine being full of bramble buſhes, repreſenting unto us the terrible and pricking power of the Law.</p>

                  </note> leſt at the ſame time we reject the whole Old-Teſtament: for it is ſaid of the Prophets, as well as the Law, <hi>that they are till John;</hi> and then why ſhould they limit the Law to <hi>Moſes</hi> his hands, more then others? Why ſhould they not ſay, The Law, as by <hi>David,</hi> as by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> doth not binde? And if you ſay, they in other places ſpeake of Chriſt; ſo doth <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, as our Saviour expreſly ſaith. So that I ſee not how an Antinomian can follow his principle, but he muſt needs caſt off the Old-Teſtament, except it be in what it is propheticall of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>THe Law as you have heard, may be conſidered either abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, as a Rule, or relatively, as a Covenant: We are handling of it in the firſt conſideration, and have proved, that, as it was delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> it doth belong to us Chriſtians.

That therefore I may the better come to my matter intended, take notice in the generall, that theſe words are part of Chriſts Sermon upon the Mount; ſo that as the Law was firſt given upon a Mount, ſo alſo it is explained and interpreted by Chriſt upon a Mount. And in this Sermon is obſervable; firſt, that Chriſt begins with the end of actions, Bleſſedneſſe; for ſo Morall Philoſophy, which is practicall, doth alſo begin. Secondly, he deſcribes the Subjects who ſhall be made partakers of this, and they are deſcribed by ſeverall properties. In the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65695:94"/>
next place as ſome think <hi>ver.</hi> 13. he inſtructs the Apoſtles about their peculiar Office, <hi>Ye are ſalt</hi> (not honey, as one obſerveth) which is bitter to wounds: <hi>Ye are light,</hi> which is alſo offenſive to ſore eyes. In the next place he inſtructs the people (though ſome make this only ſpoken to the Diſciples) and that firſt about the ſubſtance of the Precepts, what duties are to be done, againſt the falſe interpretations of the Phariſees and Scribes: and in the next Chapter he ſheweth the end, Why we do the good things God requireth of us, and that is for the glory of God, which ought to conſume all other ends, as the Sunne puts out the light of the fire: and the firſt ſubſtantiall duty of the Commandments which he inſtanceth in, is this in my text.</p>

By ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>words,</hi> which are not in the Scripture; for they ſpeake peremptorily, <hi>He ſhall dye:</hi> whereas theſe words ſeem to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65695:95"/>
and doubtfull, He ſhall be brought before the judges to be tryed, whether he be guilty or no. The ſecond corruption they conceive in the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and that is, as if the Phariſees did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Commandment only to forbid actuall murder, but not murderous thoughts, affections, or intentions: And this laſt ſeemeth clearly to be the truth, as is to be ſhewed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: but for the former I do ſomething doubt, becauſe, though that addition be not expreſt in ſo many words, yet there ſeemeth to be that which is equivalent; for, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 30. there we read, the murderer who was to be put to death, was to be tryed by witneſſes, which argueth there were Judges to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the cauſe. The ſecond particular, is that <hi>ver. 43. Thou ſhalt hate thy enemy:</hi> where ſome learned men obſerve a three-fold depravation: 1. An implyed one, as if a friend were only a neighbour: 2. A plain omiſſion; for <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. it's added, <hi>as thy ſelf,</hi> which is here omitted. 3. A plain addition of that which was not only not commanded or permitted, but expreſly prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, as <hi>Exod. 23. 4. Prov.</hi> 25. 21. And this may probably be thought an interpretation of the Scribes and Phariſees arguing on the contrary, that if we were to love our neighbours, then we were to hate our enemies; yet there are ſome who would make the ſenſe of this in the Scripture; that is, in a limited ſenſe to the Canaanites; for they think that becauſe they were commanded to make no Covenant with them, but to deſtroy them, and not to pity them, therefore this is as much as to hate them: and thereupon, they underſtand the two fore quoted places, that ſpeak of relieving of our enemies, to be only meant of enemies that were Jews their Country-men and not of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. And the Jews thought they might kill any idolaters; Therefore <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith of them, there was <hi>miſericordia in prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptu apud ſuos, mercy to their own;</hi> but <hi>contra omnes alios hoſtile odium, hoſtile hatred againſt all others:</hi> yet this command of God to deſtroy thoſe Nations, ſome underſtand not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely but limitedly, if ſo be they did refuſe the conditions of peace. I therefore incline to thoſe, who think it a perverſe addition of the Scribes and Phariſees, yet am not able to ſay the other is falſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether our Saviour do oppoſe himſelf here to others as a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65695:95"/>
Law-giver, or as an Interpreter, cleanſing away the mud and filth from the fountain.</hi> And this indeed is worthy the diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for this chapter hath been taken by the Manichees and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites of old, and by other erroneous perſons of late, to countenance great errours; for ſome have ſaid, that the Author of the Old-Teſtament, and the New Teſtament are contrary; ſome have ſaid, that the New-Teſtament or the Goſpel containeth more exact and ſpirituall duties then the Old: Hence they conclude, that many things were lawful then which are not now; and they inſtance in Magiſtracy, reſiſting of injuries, ſwearing, and loving of our enemies; and many counſels of perfection added. And this is a very neceſſary Queſtion; for hereby will be laid open the excellency of the Law, when it ſhall be ſeen, that Jeſus Chriſt (ſetting aſide the poſitive precepts of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, &amp;c.) commanded no new du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but all was a duty before, that is now.</p>
               <p>Now, that our Saviour doth only interpret, and not adde new Laws, will appear,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From that proteſtation and ſolemn affirmation he makes, <note place="margin">Chriſt does only inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the old, adds no new laws.</note> before he cometh to inſtruct the hearers about their duties: <hi>Think not that I came to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfill it.</hi> Now, although it be true, that Chriſt may be ſaid to fulfill the Law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe wayes: yet I think he ſpeaks here moſt principally, for his doctrinall fulfilling it; for he oppoſeth teaching the Law, to breaking of the Law: and if this be ſo, then our Saviours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was, that he came not to teach them any new duty, to which they were not obliged before; onely he would better explicate the Law to them, that ſo they might be ſenſible of ſin more then they were, and diſcover themſelves to be fouler, and more abominable then ever they judged themſelves. Thus <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact, As a painter doth not deſtroy the old lineaments, only makes them more glorious and beautifull, ſo did Chriſt about the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, Chriſt did not adde new duties, which were not commanded in the Law, becauſe the Law is perfect, and they were bound not to adde to it, or detract from it: Therefore we are not to continue a more excellent way of duty, then that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed there.</p>

Indeed the Goſpel doth infinitely exceed in regard of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy preſcribed for afflicted ſinners, and the glorious manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his grace and goodneſſe; but if we ſpeak of holy and ſpirituall duties, there cannot be a more excellent way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, this being an idea and repreſentation of the glorious nature of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That nothing can be added to the Law, appeareth by that Commandment of loving God with all our heart and ſoul: Now there can be nothing greater then this; and this command is not only indicative of an end which we are to aime at, but alſo preceptive of all the means which tend thereunto.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, our Saviour ſaith not, <hi>Except your righteouſneſſe exceed that of</hi> Moſes <hi>his Law,</hi> or <hi>which was delivered by him,</hi> but <hi>that of the Scribes and Phariſees;</hi> implying by that plainly, his intent was to detect and diſcover thoſe formall and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall wayes which they pleaſed themſelves in, when indeed they never underſtood the marrow, and excellency of the Law.</p>
               <p>Queſtion 4. <hi>What was the opinion received among the Phariſees</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees were of opinion, that the law did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reach the outward man, and forbid out ward acts.</note> 
                  <hi>concerning the Commandments of God?</hi> That you may know the juſt ground our Saviour had thus to expound the Law, it will be manifeſt, if you conſider the generall opinion received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews about the ſenſe of the Commandments; and that was, The Law did onely reach to the outward man, did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid outward acts, and that there was no ſin before God in our hearts, though we delighted in, and purpoſed the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts, if they were not outwardly committed. And this we may gather by <hi>Paul,</hi> that all the while he was bewitched with Phariſaicall principles, he did not underſtand inward luſt to be ſin: and as famous, as it is falſe, is that expoſition brought by the Learned of <hi>Kimchy</hi> upon that <hi>Pſalm 66. 18. If I regard ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in my heart, he will not hear:</hi> he makes this ſtrange mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, <hi>If I regard iniquity onely in my heart,</hi> ſo that it break not forth into outward act, <hi>the Lord will not hear,</hi> that is, hear, ſo as to impute it, or account it a ſin. And thus it is obſerved of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that he derideth <hi>Polybius</hi> the noble hiſtorian, becauſe he attributed the death of <hi>Antiochus</hi> to ſacriledge onely in his purpoſe and will, which he thought could not be; that a man,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65695:97"/>
having a purpoſe onely to ſin, ſhould be puniſhed by God for it. But the Heathens did herein exceed the Phariſees, <hi>fecit quiſ<expan>

                     </expan> quantum voluit:</hi> its <hi>Seneca</hi>'s ſaying. And, indeed, its no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the Phariſees did thus corrupt Scripture, for its a doctrine we all naturally incline unto, not to take notice, or ever be humbled for heart ſins, if ſo be they break not out into acts. Oh, what an hell may thy heart be, when thy outward man is not defiled? Good is that paſſage, 2 <hi>Chron 22. 26. Hezekiah humbled himſelf for the pride of his heart.</hi> Certainly, as God, who is a ſpirit, doth moſt love ſpirit-graces; ſo he doth moſt abhor ſpirit-ſins. The Schools do well obſerve, that outward ſins are <hi>majoris infamiae, of greater reproach,</hi> but inward heart-ſins are <hi>majois reatûs, of greater guilt,</hi> as we ſee in the devils. And from this corruption in our nature, ariſeth that poiſonous principle in Popery, which is alſo in all formall Proteſtants, <hi>That the commands of God do onely forbid the voluntary omiſſion of outward acts, whereas our Saviours explication will finde every man to be a murderer, an adulterer, &amp;c.</hi> Now our Saviours expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Law go upon thoſe grounds which are obſerved by all ſound Divines, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the Law is ſpirituall, and for. bids not onely the fruit and branches of ſin, but even the root it ſelf and fountain: And 2. that whereſoever any ſin is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and in what latitude ſoever; the contrary good things are commanded, and in that proportionable latitude. This therefore conſidered, may make every man tremble and be afraid of his own heart, and with him to cry out, <hi>Gehenna ſum Domine,</hi> I am a very hell it ſelf. Let us not therefore be afraid of preaching the Law as we ſee Chriſt here doth, for this is the great engine to beat bown the formality, and Phariſaiſme that is in people.</p>
               <p>And thus I come to raiſe the Doctrine, which is, that <hi>The Law</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> 
                  <hi>of God is ſuch a perfect rule of life, that Chriſt added no new precept or duty unto it:</hi> But even as the Prophets before did onely explicate the Law, when they preſſed morall duties; ſo alſo Chriſt and the Apoſtles, when they urge men unto holy duties, they are the ſame commanded heretofore: I do not ſpeak of Sacraments, or the outward poſitive worſhip, which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then was in the Old-Teſtament (they had circumciſion, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65695:98"/>
we have Baptiſme) but of the Morall duties required of us.</p>
               <p>It is true, in the Old-Teſtament many things were expreſſed <note place="margin">No ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the duties in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, from thoſe of the New, but only graduall in their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation. The Law did not only command the outward duty, but required the worſhip of the heart.</note> more groſly and carnally, which the people for the moſt part underſtood carnally; yet the duties then commanded were as ſpirituall as now: There is onely a graduall difference in the manifeſtation of the duties, no ſpecificall difference of the duties themſelves. And that this may appeare the more to the dignity and excellency of the Law, I will inſtance in particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Law of God required the heart-worſhip and ſervice.</hi> That this may be underſtood, take this for a generall rule, which is not denied by any: <hi>That when there are any Morall duties preſſed in the Old-Teſtament, the Prophets do it, as explainers of the Law; they do but unfold and draw out that Arras which was folded together before.</hi> This being premiſed, then conſider thoſe places in the Old-Teſtament that call for the heart: Thus <hi>Pro. 3. 1 Let thine heart keep my commandements;</hi> So <hi>Pro. 23. 26. My ſonne, give me thine heart:</hi> So that all the duties then performed, which were without the heart and inward man, were not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: God required then heart-prayer, and heart humiliation. Its true, the people for the moſt part underſtood all carnally and groſly, thinking the outward duty commanded onely: and that is no marvell; for do not people, even in theſe times of the Goſpel, look to the externall duty, not examining whether they pray or humble themſelves according as the Word ſpeaks of ſuch duties? Thus <hi>David</hi> was very ſenſible of his heart-neglect, when he prayed, <hi>Unite my heart to feare thy Name:</hi> and are not the people of God ſtill under the ſame temptations? They would pray, they would humble themſelves; but oh how they want an heart! That is ſo divided and diſtracted, that if after any duty we ſhould put that queſtion to it, as God did to Satan, <hi>From whence commeſt thou?</hi> it would returne Satans anſwer, <hi>From compaſſing the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It preferred duties of Mortification and Sanctification, before</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The Law preferred inward gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before outward duties.</note> 
                  <hi>religious outward duties.</hi> This you ſhall ſee frequently preſſed and inculcated by the Prophets. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1. how doth God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre there all their ſolemne duties, making them abominable even like carrion, and all becauſe they did not waſh them, and make them clean? So <hi>David</hi> ſaith, A broken and contrite
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65695:98"/>
heart, it was more then any burnt offering now under the times of the Goſpel. This is an high duty, and few reach unto it. Doth not the Apoſtle reprove the Corinthians for deſiring gifts, rather then graces; and abilities of parts, rather then holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? So that this is an excellent duty preſcribed by Gods Law, that to be able to mortifie our affections, to have ſanctified na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is more then to have Seraphicall knowledge, and Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binicall affections in any duty. Who then can be againſt the preaching of the Law, when it is ſuch an excellent and pure rule, holding forth ſuch precious holineſſe? <note place="margin">All the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law, were to be done, 1. In Faith.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It required all our duies to be done,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In faith:</hi> for who can think, that when God required in the firſt Table having him for their God, that hereby was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded faith and truſting in him, as a God in Covenant, who would pardon ſinne? How could the Jewes love God, or pray unto him acceptably, if they had not faith in him? Therefore the Law is to be conſidered moſt ſtrictly, as it containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but precepts of things to be done in which ſenſe, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, though ſeldom, taken. And 2. more largely, as it had the Preface, and Promiſes added unto it: and ſo it did neceſſarily require juſtifying faith; for it cannot be conceived, that when God commanded the people of Iſrael by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to worſhip him, and to acknowledge him as their God, but that his will was, they ſhould beleeve on him as a Father: But more of this when we ſpeak of the Law as a Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In love:</hi> and this is ſo much commanded by the Law, that Chriſt makes the ſumme of the Law to be in theſe two things; <note place="margin">2. In love.</note> love of God, and of our neighbour. Therefore I wonder at the Antinomian, who is ſo apt to oppoſe the doing of things in love, and doing of them by the Law together: for, doth not the Law of God command every duty to be in love, to pray in love to God? Yea, by the law we are to love God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee hath given Chriſt for us; for the Law commands us to love God for whatſoever benefits he beſtoweth upon us: now, if we are to love him for temporall benefits, much more for ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>It is true, the diſpenſation of the Law was in a terrible way, and did gender to bondage; but the doctrine of the Law, that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65695:99"/>
was for love, and the more any Jew did any thing in love to God, the more conformable he was to Gods Law.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It required ſuch an heavenly heart, that we are to love God more then any thing elſe.</hi> It did not only require love to God, but alſo it commanded it in ſuch a preheminency, as that none under <note place="margin">Love to God in as great a meaſure comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Law as by the Goſpel.</note> the times of the Goſpel can do an higher duty, or expreſſion of love than then was commanded; ſuppoſe a man be a Martyr, will loſe his life for Gods cauſe, this is an obedience to the firſt Commandement. When our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that loveth father or mother more then me, is not worthy of me;</hi> he commands no higher thing of any Chriſtian, then every Jew was bound to do; hence <hi>Levi</hi> was ſo commended, becauſe in executing of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he knew not father or mother: and it muſt needs be ſo; for what can be more then all? and yet God requires all the minde, all the heart, all the ſtrength; not that we are bound to love God <hi>in quantum eſt diligibilis,</hi> for God can only can love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but <hi>nihil ſupra, aequè,</hi> or <hi>contra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>It required ſpirituall motives for all our ſolemn addreſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</hi> There are ſome men who look upon all the Jewes under <note place="margin">In all our addreſſes to God, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> the Old Teſtament as ſo many bruit beaſts, that did only minde earthly things: and that as children are allured by Apples and Nuts rather then by a great Inheritance; ſo they were only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to duties by carnall and temporall motives, not by any ſpirituall conſiderations. Now how falſe this is, appeareth by the Prophets generall complaints, that when they faſted, it was not to him, even to him; and ſo they howled, becauſe of their miſeries, but not becaſe God was offended: And thus <hi>David,</hi> though he had received the pardon of his ſinne, yet how kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſpiritually doth he mourn, <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned?</hi> Thus <hi>Micah 7. I will beare the indignation of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſinned againſt him.</hi> What can be more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall?</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>It required joy and contentedneſſe in him more then in any</hi>

Did not his heart faint, and yern within him? What a ſweet ſtrain is that of him, when baniſhed, he doth not wiſh for his kingdome, nor outward eſtate, but to <hi>ſee God in the beauties of holineſſe?</hi> Therefore, howſoever the diſpenſation was not ſo cleare and manifeſt, yet thoſe that were diligent and bleſſed by God, did ariſe to ſuch excellent tempers.</p>

It is true, the Law of it ſelf cannot work grace; no more can the Goſpell of it ſelfe work grace: only here is the difference, we cannot be juſtified by any works of the Law that we are inabled to do, only we are juſtified by Faith; not as it is a work, for ſo its commanded in the Law, but as an inſtrument applying Chriſt. Therefore Gods ſpirit doth graciouſly accompany us in the preſſing of theſe duties; and hereby we become like a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Law: neither doth this exclude Chriſt, but advance him the more.</p>

               <p>BEcauſe my purpoſe is to ſet forth the dignity of the Morall Law, I ſhall therefore briefly demonſtrate in this preſent Sermon, the falſhood of that opinion, maintained by Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, and Socinians, <hi>That Chriſt came to give us more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act precepts then</hi> Moſes <hi>delivered to the Jewes, and therefore that Chriſt was not here an Interpreter, but a Reformer.</hi> It cannot be denyed, but this Sermon of our Saviours hath bred many thoughts of heart: for, becauſe of theſe precepts here, not rightly underſtood, the Heathens took occaſion to calumniate the Chriſtian Religion, as that which could not ſtand with a Common-wealth: And the Ancient Fathers were much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in anſwer to their objections; for when <hi>Julian</hi> and others did urge, that ſeeing by Chriſts commands we might not reſiſt evill, but rather be prepared to receive more injuries, therefore
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65695:100"/>
no Warre no Magiſtracy, no places of Judicature were lawfull: the Fathers in their anſwer did ſeeme to yeeld this, only they ſaid, Here was a lawfull way, and a better way: To warre, or to take places of Juſtice were lawfull wayes; but yet to refuſe theſe, and not to medle with them at all, was a more ſublime, Chriſtian way. And from this miſtake came that erroneous opinion of Precepts and Councels. Beſides, it's thought by the Learned, that ſome of the Ancient Fathers, being Philoſophers before, did retaine much of that ſtoicall diſpoſition in them, and ſo made Chriſts Precepts comply with their affections: But this I ſhall endeavour to prove, that there is no lawfull Morall way heretofore commanded by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Jewes, which doth not at this time alſo belong to Chriſtians. Only let me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thus much, That, howſoever the things queſtioned by the <note place="margin">Swearing neither abſolutely unlawfull, not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by our Saviour with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why.</note> Adverſaries, are lawfull to Chriſtians; yet there are few that riſe up to the practiſe of them as Chriſt commanded. Certainly theſe places; Of not reſiſting evill, Of giving our cloak to him that would take away our coat, &amp;c. though they do not exclude the office of a Magiſtrate, or our deſire of him to aide us in our defence; yet they do forbid the frequent and common practiſe of moſt Chriſtians; ſo that we may ſay, there are few ſtates; and Kingdomes which do riſe up to the practiſe of that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and chriſtian meekneſſe, which we ſee here commanded. inſo much that kingdomes are more the kingdomes of the world then of Chriſt, and the lawes and practiſes of Common-wealths are ſuch as ſute more with humane ſtates then with the lawes of Chriſt. But I come to the particulars.</p>
               <p>And firſt, whereas it's granted to be lawfull by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſwear, now (ſay ſome) under the Goſpel it's made abſolutely unlawfull, under any pretence whatſoever, and (ſay they) here our Saviour forbids it abſolutely, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> following this of our Saviour, doth the like. Hence their opinion is, that it is not only unlawfull, to ſwear falſely and vainly, but at all in any reſpect. And this (ſay they) is a perfection required of Chriſtians above thoſe of the Law. Nor is it any wonder that men of late have doubted of this, ſeeing the Learned ſhew, that ſome of the Fathers of old have thought it abſolutely unlawfull for a Chriſtian to ſwear. In
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65695:101"/>
                  <hi>Euſebius</hi> one <hi>Baſilides,</hi> a Chriſtian, being commanded to ſwear, replied, It was not lawfull for him, becauſe he was a Chriſtian: And <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, that to ſwear was permitted to the Jews, or infants, as to offer ſacrifices unto God; yet I cannot ſee, but that they did ſwear alſo, although ſometimes they ſpeak as if they thought there were an abſolute prohibition of it. Yet <hi>Athanaſius</hi> made a ſolemn oath, to purge himſelf, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to the Emperour: and <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, though the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians refuſed to ſwear <hi>per genium Principis,</hi> becauſe that they conceived it a devill, yet they did ſwear <hi>per ſalutem principis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some again have thought, that it is lawfull to ſwear, but then only in religious things, or in things that do concerh the ſafety of the Publique, but that it is not lawfull to ſwear in any thing of our own, or about any money matter: and <hi>Baſil</hi> doth object to the Chriſtians of his time, the Example of one <hi>Clinius</hi> a Pythagorean, who being fined a great ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and might have eſcaped it by an oath, yet choſe rather to undergoe that dammage then to ſwear.</p>
               <p>Some have thought it better, if in humane affairs, where promiſſory oaths uſe to be, there were only a naked promiſe, yet with as great a puniſhment upon the breaking of it, as if it were perjury, becauſe men are for the moſt part more awed with fear of puniſhment then breaking an oath But, whatſoever the thoughts of men may be about limiting of ſwearing; yet it is lawfull in ſome caſes to ſwear: neither is our Saviour ſo to be underſtood as univerſally forbidding.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe then he would have deſtroyed the Law, which yet he denyeth that he doth; for <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. to ſwear by God, is a command not indeed of a thing abſolutely in it ſelf, but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, as opportunity ſhall be: Therefore the word that ſignifieth <hi>To ſweare</hi> in the Heb. is in the paſſive ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> implying that we are not voluntarily to chooſe to do ſo, but when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity requireth it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, again, Chriſt doth not abſolutely prohibit it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the uſe and end of an oath is perpetuall, which is to end controverſies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. Therefore. <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith well, that, what firſt principles are in ſpeculatives, to determine all concluſions, the ſame an oath is in practicalls, to end controverſies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:65695:101"/>
Thirdly, and laſtly, we have the example of <hi>Paul</hi> ſwearing ſometimes in his Epiſtle; ſo that our Saviour doth not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Corrupt gloſſes of the Phariſees, touching Swaring, reproved.</note> forbid it, but he reproveth the Phariſees corrupt gloſſes, which were, 1. To think that if a man did not name God in his oath, though it were by other creatures, it was not perjury, if he did falſifie that oath. And how many come neer this, who think if they ſweare by the creatures, ſo that God is not named, it's not ſuch an hainous thing. The ſecond corrupt interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, They thought that Gods Name was not polluted, if ſo be they intended to make good their promiſe, though they did uſe the Name of God in their oathes, about unneceſſary, and vain matters. Now this our Saviour forbids by his affirmative Direction, <hi>Let your yea, be yea, and nay, nay, what ſoever is more then this is of ſinne.</hi> He ſpeakes there of our ordinary &amp; familiar diſcourſe as private perſons; not concerning a publike conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: even as afterwards, when he mentioneth the duty of not reſiſting evil, he forbids private revenge, and not publique juſtice. Although ſome underſtand this of our Saviours, and that of <hi>James,</hi> not of aſſertory oathes (for it's ſpoken by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in addition unto that, <hi>Thou ſhalt pay unto the Lord thy vows)</hi> but of promiſſory oaths; and ſo the meaning, is, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou intend to performe or do ſuch a thing, yet doe not ſweare, becauſe things are ſo uncertain, and many things may fall out: and this is very probable. Only if you underſtand it the former way, you muſt not take it ſo, as if an oath were ſuch a lawfull thing, as that it is <hi>propter ſe appetendum;</hi> but only as phyſick is, which is ſometimes neceſſary for another thing. Thus therefore having cleared, that our Saviour intendeth no higher thing then that was lawfull before, give me leave to reprove the common practiſe among men, who ſay they are Chriſtians, about ſwearing. If you obſerve men in their diſcourſe, in their trading, do they carry themſelves ſo, as if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Sweare not at all;</hi> and not rather, as if he ſaid, Sweare alwayes and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? Oh therefore that this common cuſtomary way of ſwearing, which doth ſo directly oppoſe Chriſt, were wholy laid aſide! The very Heathens will condemne us herein, and among the Heathens, <hi>ex animiſui ſententià,</hi> was in ſtead of an oath. It ſeemeth this cuſtome of ſwearing in diſcourſe hath been
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65695:102"/>
of old; for <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> are very vehement againſt it in their Sermons. Now let us proceed.</p>
               <p>There are ſome who from thoſe words of our Saviour ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>ver.</hi> 38, 39, 40, 41. do gather, that now under the Goſpel it's not lawfull, 1. To put any man to death for any fault what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. 2. That it's not lawfull to warre. 3. Not to go to law in any caſe, 4. Not to ſeek to a Magiſtrate for the defence of our ſelves; Therefore in theſe opinions they thinke they hold forth much of Chriſtian meekneſſe and patience: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to the particulars, let us conſider in what ſenſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In what ſenſe the words,</hi> An eye for an eye, A tooth for a tooth, are <hi>to be taken.</hi>
                  </note> it'a ſaid, <hi>An eye for an eye, A tooth for a tooth.</hi> This kind of Law was an ancient one among other Nations: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cals it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And we read of a double retaliation, one Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall, which was wicked and ungodly, holding that if a man did thieve from one, the ſame might thieve from him again: The other Moſaicall, which was good, and had juſtice in it. Onely the Queſtion is, Whether this be literally to be underſtood, that it was lawfull for a man, who had his eye or tooth ſtruck out by another, to deſire of the Judge, that he, who did this violence, ſhould alſo have his eye or tooth beaten out.</p>
               <p>You may reade the Law <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 23. and how it ought to be moderated by Judges, (private men not being left to revenge themſelves) <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 19. This Law was not given (as one wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly ſaith) to indulge the childiſh condition of the Jewes, as being apt to revenge, and therefore makes it an imperfect Law, (ſaying that many lawes of men were more perfect lawes) but it was given againſt private revenge, and the end was that juſtice might be done. Now ſome have ſaid, this law was literally obſerved, and that a man who was wounded by another, hee himſelfe was wounded againe. But I doe rather thinke that the command in the letter of it was not obſerved, but that a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence was made according to the judgment of the Judge for the <note place="margin">Capitall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven death it ſelfe, may be inflicted upon Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenders: 1. Becauſe. command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God.</note> loſſe: and it would have been a very hard thing, if one man had wounded another, to inflict juſt ſuch a wound, neither dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nor broader, nor doing no more hurt upon the man who offered violence.</p>
               <p>Wee therefore come to the Queſtions: And firſt concerning capitall puniſhments to be inflicted upon ſome offenders. There
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65695:102"/>
are thoſe that ſay, It doth not ſtand with the goodneſſe and meekneſſe of a Goſpel-ſpirit to put any man to death for any crime whatſoever. But the falſeneſſe hereof doth appeare, 1. In that it's a command of God from the beginning, with a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reaſon added to it, that he who was guilty of murder, ſhould be put to death; ſo that at leaſt in this caſe there ought to be a capitall puniſhment. Now the command that God gave is <hi>Gen. 9. 6. Whatſoever ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood beſhed,</hi> and there is the reaſon given of it, <hi>becauſe the image of God,</hi> viz. in his ſoule, <hi>is in him</hi> To elude this, they ſay that this is not a command but a meere prediction: God doth here fore-tell (ſay they) what will befall the murderer, not what a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is bound to do. But that is a meere evaſion; for why ſhould God fore-tell this, but becauſe it was a duty to be done? Therefore it's not ſaid indefinitly, <hi>He that ſheddeth mans blood, his blood ſhall be ſhed,</hi> but he addeth, <hi>by man it ſhall be ſhed.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, howſoever a great <note n="*" place="margin">Grotius.</note> Scholar ſaith, that thoſe are deceived, who think capitall puniſhments are appointed by the Law of Nature, or any perpetuall Law of God; yet this place demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrateth the contrary: neither is it any matter that <hi>Plato</hi> would have reduced into his common-wealth the abrogation of capital puniſhments; or that the Romans for a while did uſe no heavier puniſhment, then deportation, or baniſhment; we muſt live by commands, and not by examples, eſpecially humane. It's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in <hi>Cain,</hi> who, though he killed his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> yet God did not deſtroy him. It muſt be granted, that, Gods indulgence to <hi>Cain</hi> was very great; for he doth not only ſpare his life, but ſets a marke upon him to preſerve him (what this was, they are moſt to be commended, who dare not determine it, becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is ſilent in it.) and not only ſo, but he addeth a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere puniſhment to that man that ſhall kill <hi>Cain,</hi> then was due to the killing of any man. Although it may be thought God in ſuffering <hi>Cain</hi> to live, was not ſo much indulgent as ſevere, in ſuffering him to be an inſtance of his diſpleaſure againſt him to all the world; As <hi>Pſal. 59. 11. Slay them not</hi> (ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt) <hi>leſt my people forget:</hi> ſo that it is one thing, what God may do for ſpeciall reaſons; and another, what the common Law of Nature, and the perpetuall Law of God requireth.</p>

                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:65695:103"/>
A ſecond Argument for capitall puniſhents under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <note place="margin">2. Becauſe it is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates office. 3. Becauſe practis'd under the Goſpel, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi> and ſo not repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant to it.</note> is from the Magiſtrates office, who, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. is ſaid, <hi>not to beare the ſword in vaine:</hi> Now the <hi>ſword,</hi> doth imply a power of life and death, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>If I have done any thing worthy of death,</hi> implying there were ſome things that did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that to put to death men for faults, is not repugnant to the ſpirit of the Goſpel, appeareth by the judgement upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi> You cannot reade of a-more ſevere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion under the Law, then that was of the Goſpel; ſo that as we are indeed to labour for the meeknes and patience of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, yet we are not to forget zeale for Godsglory, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, it being cruelty to the good to ſpare the bad: and if we would pity ſuch a man offending, we muſt much more pity the common-wealth.</p>
               <p>That which is objected to this is, 1. The rebuke that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> gave to his Diſciples, when they would have had fire come downe from heaven: They are reproved upon this ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they knew not what ſpirit they were of.</hi> Now, ſay they, this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the ſpirit of the New Teſtament, which is oppoſed to the Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> in the Old. The anſwer is obvious that Chriſt doth not there oppoſe the Spirit of the New Teſtament &amp; the Old to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <note place="margin">Sol.</note> but their ſpirit, and <hi>Elias</hi> his ſpirit. What <hi>Elias</hi> did, he was moved unto by the Spirit of God, not for any private revenge, but that the glory of God might be illuſtrated. Now this fire of theirs was raſh and vindicative: It was not elementary fire, but culinary; nouriſhed by low and unworthy conſiderations.</p>
               <p>In the next place they urge the fact of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 8. to <note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> the adultereſſe; where he doth not proceed to the ſtoning of her, but rather freeth her.</p>
               <p>The anſwer is, that Chriſt in his firſt coming was not as a <note place="margin">Sol.</note> Judge, and therefore did not take upon him to medle in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhments, only as a miniſter, he laboured to bring them unto repentance, both the woman, and the accuſers.</p>
               <p>And whereas againe it's objected, that this way of putting to death, is againſt charity and love of mens ſouls, becauſe many <note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> are put to death without any ſeeming repentance, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to ſend them to Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:65695:103"/>
The anſwer is, that all Magiſtrates, they are to take care for the <note place="margin">Sol.</note> ſalvation of the melefactors ſoules, as much as in them lyeth; but if they doe periſh in their ſins, this ariſeth not from juſtice done, which is rather to bring them in mind of their ſins, and to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them but it cometh from the frowardneſſe, &amp; obſtinacy in their owne hearts. And in that, we ſee a Magiſtracy confirmed in the Goſpel, we need not require an expreſſe command in the New Teſtament for the putting of ſome malefactors to death.</p>
               <p>The third thing which they ſay was allowed in the Law, but forbid by Chriſt in the Goſpel is <hi>Warre:</hi> And certainly we may reade in Antiquity, that the Chriſtians did refuſe warre, but <note place="margin">Warre al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel.</note> not univerſally; for there were Chriſtian ſouldiers, only there were ſome peculiar cauſes, why in thoſe times, the Chriſtians might decline it; As, firſt, becauſe in their military oath, there was a calling upon a heathen god, and their banners lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up <note place="margin">Two cauſes for which the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might decline warre</note> were polluted with idolatry. And ſecondly, becauſe they ſhould be forced ſometimes to be inſtruments in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the Emperours Edicts againſt the Chriſtians, which they would not do: Now if we bring places out of the Old-Teſtament for the lawfulneſſe of warrs, they care not; for, ſay they, the laws of Nature, and of <hi>Moſes</hi> are to be reformed by the Lawes of Chriſt, God indeed (ſay they) gave the Jewes in the Old-Teſtament leave to fight, becauſe they had a temporall inheritance and poſſeſſion given them which they could not keep but by force of armes: now under the New-Teſtament, God hath not done ſo to his people. Thus they ſay, but this is a ſhift, for we know <hi>Abraham,</hi> by a meere law of nature, went to war, and delivered his nephew <hi>Lot,</hi> being oppreſſed by enemies.</p>
               <p>By that Warre is allowed by Chriſt, appeareth plainly by comparing 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. where the Apoſtle would have us pray for Magiſtrates, &amp; ſuppoſeth, that while they are Magiſtrates, they may be Chriſtians, and come to the faith; ſo that thereby we may live a quiet and godly life under them; now how can this be unleſſe they draw their ſword upon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders? And if they cannot in an ordinary legall way be brought to judgement, then by force of Armes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond knowne argument is from <hi>Luke.</hi> 3. where <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> counſelleth the ſouldiers not to lay downe their office,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65695:104"/>
but to look to ſuch duties as were neceſſary to them in that place; and, which is to be obſerved, theſe were mercenary ſouldiers, as it is thought, they were at that time. As for the Objections, they are taken from ſuch conſiderations, as will be examined in the next particular; only the Orthodox that do hold war lawfull, they do acknowledge many rules neceſſary for the godly and holy managing of it: and it is an hard thing to have an holy camp; and this made <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſay, in regard of the concomitant evils of it, that <hi>Omne bellum etiam juſtum eſſe deteſtandum;</hi> yet not but he thought it neceſſary to have it uſed, when it concerned the glory of God, and the good of the publique.</p>

               <p>THere remain two Queſtions more to be decided in this buſineſſe, concerning Chriſts interpretation of the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> The one is <hi>about the lawfulneſſe of repelling force by force:</hi> The other <hi>about applying our ſelves to the Magiſtrate, to defend us againſt the injury, and violence of others.</hi> Now, that I may not be tedious in the diſcuſſing of theſe, I will lay down fome few grounds that ſerve to the clearing of the truth herein, and ſo proceed to other matter, although (as you have heard) this tendeth much to the dignity and excellency of the Law.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore take notice, that <hi>there is in all a curſed prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to do things by way of revenge:</hi> Inſomuch that there is not <note place="margin">All men naturally prone ta re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</note> one in a thouſand that doth riſe up in practiſe to this excellent way, and rule of patience. The Heathens, they thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge our ſelves was lawfull: Thus <hi>Tully, It is the firſt office of Juſtice to hurt no body, unleſſe firſt provoked by injury: O quam ſimplicem, veram<expan>
                        <am>

Now whatſoever the thoughts of men may be about the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it's certain, the practiſes of men are much contaminated this way. In State and Civil matters, in Church matters, what a revengefull ſpirit breatheth in men? This certainly cometh much ſhort of our Saviours Directions. There is no injury or violence offered unto thee, but, in ſtead of revengefull affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there may be holy mortifying thoughts in thee: As when <hi>Sheba</hi> curſed <hi>David,</hi> ſee how that brought him to the ſenſe of ſinne, to look up unto God more then to the inſtrument. All defamations and reproaches may ſerve to make thy graces more ſplendent. As <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerveth, the Gardener planteth his unſavory herbs, Garlike and Onyons neer his ſweeteſt Roſes, that ſo the ſmell thereof may be the more prized. That was an excellent temper of <hi>Calvin,</hi> when reviled by <hi>Luther,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amſi</hi> Lutherus <hi>millies me diabolum vocet, ego tamen illum inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Domini ſervum agnoſco.</hi> Although <hi>Luther</hi> call me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times a Divell, yet I acknowledge him, an eminent ſervant of God. Why is it, that there are ſuch ſuſpicions, heart-burnings, defamations of one another, hard ſpeeches and cenſures, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this leſſon of Chriſt is not learned by us?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider this, <hi>that the primitive Chriſtians have gone very farr in this Queſtion, holding it unlawfull to defend a mans ſelf</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians held it unlawfull for a man in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to kill the invader.</note>

It is maintained by ſome, that though indeed a man is not bound to be killed rather then to kill; yet if he do chuſe the former rather then the latter, he doth a work full of charity, and worthy of admiration. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, theſe precepts of Chriſt were given to the Diſciples, who were by their blood to increaſe the Church, and by their patience and humility to convert tyrants: but now <hi>modernis non congruit, nec locum habet hodie, eſſet enim ad detrimentum Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae;</hi> It doth not hold in theſe latter times, for that would be to the prejudice of the Church; A fooliſh aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. As theſe go too high, ſo the Jeſuits in their caſes, they go too low, and give too much roome to the revenge of man; for ſo it's determined by them, That a noble man, though he may ſave his life by flying, when invaded ſuddenly,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65695:105"/>
yet is not bound to fly, but may lawfully kill the invader, If he cannot otherwiſe preſerve his life and honour together. But this is corrupt counſell, and opens a way to many murders upon a pretence of honour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take notice of this, <hi>That the Law of God in the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was as ſtrict againſt revenge as any precept in the New-Teſtament,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Revenge as ſtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the Old Teſt. as in the New.</note> 
                  <hi>and therefore nothing is now required of us, which was not then.</hi> Conſider that place, <hi>Lev. 19. 16. Thou ſhalt not avenge, or beare any grudge againſt the children of thy people, but thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe:</hi> What can be clearer then this, to ſubdue thoſe waves and tempeſts that do riſe in our hearts?

In ſtead therefore of diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let us ſeriouſly ſet upon the practiſe of the duty, &amp; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe it's ſweeter then honey it ſelfe to our corrupt hearts; and at this time this ſinne doth much rage every where.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Our Saviour doth not here forbid a lawfull publique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and forbidden by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</note> 
                  <hi>but a private one.</hi> This diſtinction of publique and private revenge, being unknown to the Fathers in the primitive times, made them runne into very hard and incommodious expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſome giving occaſion hereby of that diſtinction of <hi>counſels</hi> and <hi>precepts:</hi> others, as <hi>Auſtin,</hi> making the revenge allowed in the Old-Teſtament to be peculiar to the diſpenſation of thoſe times: Hence, when one <hi>Voluſianus</hi> objected to him, that the Doctrine of Chriſt did not agree to the manners of a Common-wealth; he anſwereth by comparing the Precept of Chriſt with that of <hi>Caeſars,</hi> That he uſed to forget nothing, but injuries. Now this doth not indeed ſpeake according to the ſcope of our Saviour here, who is giving rules to private Chriſtians, not to publique Magiſtrates. Now that there is ſuch a diſtinction as this, appeareth plaine, thus; <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12. 18. exhorteth Chriſtians not to avenge themſelves, becauſe <hi>vengeance belongs to God;</hi> yet, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. ſpeaking of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. he ſaith, <hi>He is the avenger to execute wrath upon him
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65695:105"/>
that doth evil:</hi> ſo then there is revenge and a revenger, which is not God; nor yet our ſelves, but the Magiſtrate; yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge that the Magiſtrate inflicteth may well be called the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God, becauſe it's Gods appointment he ſhould doe it. Thus <hi>Numb. 31. 3. Arme your ſelves, and avenge the Lord on the Midianites:</hi> ſo 2. <hi>Chron. 19. You execute the judgments of the Lord, and not of men;</hi> yet for all this, you muſt know that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates may have revengefull affections in them, even when they execute juſtice; and ſo people, when they implore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates aid, it may not be out of zeale to juſtice &amp; love to the publique good, but becauſe of private affections, and carnall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. And oh the bleſſedneſſe that would accrew to the Common-wealth, if all were carried in their ſeverall places up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this publique ground!</p>
               <p>Having therefore diſpatched briefly theſe controverſies, I come to another, wherein the Antinomian doth directly dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the profitable effect &amp; benefit of the Law. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is an aſſertion which an <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntinomian Authour maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>the Law is not an inſtrument of true ſanctification,</hi> &amp; <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The preach ing of the Law not onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, but (being bleſſed by God) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally works the converſion of men.</note> 
                  <hi>the promiſe or the Goſpel is the ſeed and doctrine of our new birth</hi> &amp; for this he bringeth many arguments, and the judgments of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe learned men, <hi>Aſſertion of grace, pag.</hi> 163. And it may not be denyed, but that many ſpeeches might fall from ſome men, which might ſeem to comply with that opinion. I ſhall now labour to maintaine the poſitive part, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Law of God preached, may be bleſſed by him inſtrumentally to work the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of men:</hi> and it is neceſſary to make this good; for, were the contrary true, it would be a Miniſters duty in great part to lay aſide the preaching of the Morall Law, as not inſtrumentall, or ſubſervient to that maine end of the Miniſtery, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſoules. Nor can I yeeld to that, that the preaching of the Law works onely preparatorily, or ſome terrours about ſinne, and can goe no further; but (I ſuppoſe) that Jeſus Chriſt hath obtained of God by his death, that ſuch efficacy and vertue ſhould goe forth in the Miniſtry that whether it be by Law, or Goſpell he preacheth, the ſoules of men may be healed, and converted thereupon: Onely two things muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:65695:106"/>
Firſt, that the Law could never work to regeneration, were <note place="margin">The Law without Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> it not for the Goſpel-promiſe. <hi>Nemo poteſt implere legem, per legem, None can obey the Law, by the Law meerly.</hi> Had not God graciouſly promiſed to give a new heart through Chriſt, there had been no way to make any thing effectuall that we preach out of the Law; ſo that (for inſtance) while a Miniſter, preaching of any Commandement, doth thereby mould, and new frame the heart; all this benefit comes by Chriſt, who therefore died, and aſcended into Heaven, that ſo the things we preach may be advantagious to our ſouls: ſo that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in the Church of God meer pure Law, or meer pure Goſpel. But they have been ſubſervient to each other in the great work of converſion. The queſtion is not then, whether converting grace, be <hi>ex lege,</hi> or <hi>vi legis,</hi> of, or by the power of the Law, but whether it may be <hi>cum lege,</hi> with the preaching of the Law. I know it's of great conſequence to give an exact difference between the Law and the Goſpel. It is well ſaid of <hi>Luther, Qui ſcit inter Legem &amp; Evangelium diſcernere, gratias agat Deo, &amp; ſciat ſe eſſe Theologum:</hi> but I ſhall not meddle with that now. This is that which I aſſert, <hi>That, as to the point of a mans converſion, God may make the opening of the Morall Law inſtrumentally to concur thereunto, onely this cometh by Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which I premiſe is this, <hi>that howſoever the Law preached may be bleſt to converſion, yet the matter of it cannot</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Law may be bleſſed to converſion. yet the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it can neither be ground of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to us.</note> 
                  <hi>be the ground of our juſtification, or adoption:</hi> ſo that when a man doth repent, &amp; turn unto God from his ſins, he cannot have hope or conſolation in any thing he doth, but it muſt be in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Goſpel; ſo that the difference of the Law and Goſpel lieth not in this, (as ſome do aſſigne) that one is the inſtrument of grace, and the other not; (for God uſeth both, as I ſhall ſhew) but in this, that the holineſſe wrought in us by preaching of the Word of God, whether it be Law or goſpel, doth not juſtifie us; but this favour is in an evangelicall manner, by forgiving whatſoever is irregular in us, and communicating Chriſt his righteouſneſſe to us. Therefore let us not confound the Law, or Goſpel, nor yet make them ſo contrary in their natures and effects, that where one is, the other cannot be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:65695:106"/>
To theſe two, there is alſo a third thing to be premiſed, and <note place="margin">The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall is a <hi>medium,</hi> working by Chriſt to our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> that is, <hi>how the word of God in generall is a</hi> medium, <hi>or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to our converſion.</hi> For, the clearing of this well, muſt needs diſcover, that the Law of God, being part of Gods word, doth convert as well as the Goſpel: and this muſt needs be the opinion of all ſound Divines, whatſoever may fall from them at other times, as appeareth by their common anſwer to the Papiſts Queſtion. If the Law, and the commands thereof be impoſſible, to what purpoſe then doth he command them? why doth he bid us turne to him when we cannot? Then we anſwer that theſe commandements are not onely informing of a duty, but they are practicall and operative means appointed by God, to work, at leaſt in ſome degree, that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Hence thoſe commands are compared, by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to that command of our Saviour to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>riſe up and walk.</hi> It doth alſo further appeare, in thoſe ends they aſſigne of Gods revealing the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> to make us ſee as in a glaſſe our Deformity, to be humbled before God; to be affrighted out of our ſelves, to ſeek for grace in Chriſt; now can the meer Law of it ſelfe do this; doth not grace work this in us by the preaching of the Law; and is not this the initiall grace of converſion? as <hi>Austin</hi> ſaid, Tract. 12. in <hi>Johan: cumcaepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit tibi diſplicere quod feciſti, inde incipiunt bona opera tua, quia accuſas mala operatua: Initium operum bonorum, eſt confeſſio ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum:</hi> The beginning of good in us, is the accuſation of that which is bad.</p>
               <p>Therefore, for the clearing of this generall, take notice, 1. <hi>That the word of God as it is read, or preached, worketh no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The word read or preached concurres obejctively onely to mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</note> 
                  <hi>then objectively to the converſion of a man, if conſidered in it ſelf.</hi> Take it (I ſay) in it ſelf, not animated by the Spirit of God, and the utmoſt effect it can reach unto, is to work onely as an object upon the Underſtanding. And in this ſenſe it is that the Scripture is compared to a light. Now we know the Sun giveth light by way of an object, it doth not give a ſeeing eye to a blind man. It is a noble Queſton in Divinity, <hi>Seeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is attributed both to the word, and to Baptiſme, how one worketh it differently from the other:</hi> Or, <hi>If both work it, why is not one ſuperfluous?</hi> Now concerning the word preached, we may
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65695:107"/>
more eaſily anſwer, then about the Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> that it works by way of an object upon the ſoul of a man: and were it not ſet home by the Spirit of God, this is the furtheſt worke it could obtaine. And this doth plainly appeare, in that the word of God doth only convert thoſe who are able to heare and underſtand. And the word of God being thus of it ſelfe onely a directive and informative rule: hence it's compared to the Pilots Compaſſe, to <hi>Theſeus</hi> his thred, leading us in the Circean gardens of this world: and therefore take away the Spirit of God, and we may ſay, the whole Scripture is a letter killing, yea that which we call the Goſpel. Preach the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Goſpel a thouſand times over, they convey no grace, if the ſpirit of God be not there effectually. Indeed, if the communicating of grace were inſeparably annexed to the preaching of the Goſpel, then that were of ſome conſequence which is objected by the Antinomian. But ſad experience ſheweth, that notwithſtanding the large promiſes of grace to overflow like a fountain; whereas in the Old Teſtament, it was by drops only, yet the greater part to whom the grace of God is offered, are not converted.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the next place conſider this, <hi>Whatſoever good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">All the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the ſoul by the preaching of the word, are efficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Gods Spirit.</note> 
                  <hi>or benefit is conveyed to the ſoul by the preaching of the Law, or the Goſpel, it's efficiently from Gods Spirit:</hi> ſo that we muſt not take the Law without the Spirit of God; and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the Goſpel, having the Spirit of God, for that is une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall. And by the ſame reaſon, I may preferre the Law ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before the Goſpel; for I may ſuppoſe a Miniſter, opening the duties of the Law, as Chriſt doth here in this Chapter, and the Spirit of God accompanying this, to change the heart of a man: and on the otherſide, one preaching the Goſpel, in the greateſt glory of it, yet not accompanyed with Gods Spirit, there may not be the leaſt degree of grace wrought in any hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Therefore I cannot well underſtand that, the Law indeed that ſheweth us our duty, but the Goſpel, that giveth us grace to do it; for, if you take the Goſpel for the Promiſes preached, how many are there that heare theſe, that yet receive no benefit by them? and on the other ſide, if the Law, ſetting forth our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be accompanyed with Gods Spirit, that may inſtrumentally
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65695:107"/>
work in us an ability to our duty; and without the Spirit the Goſpel cannot do it. It is true, if this were the meaning, that had there been only Law, there could never have been any grace vouchſafed, but it is by reaſon of Chriſt, and ſo the Promiſes of the Goſpel, that any good is brought to the ſoules; and ſo the Law worketh as a <hi>medium</hi> to our Converſion by Chriſt. If, I ſay, this be the meaning, then it's true; but the obſcure, and unclear expreſſing of this, giveth an occaſion to the Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an errour.</p>
               <p>Now that the Scripture, as it is written, or preached, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">The VVord without the Spirit, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not convert us, and why.</note> the Spirit of God cannot convert us, is plain, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the devils, and great men of parts, which do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the letter of the Scripture better then others, would be ſooner converted; partly becauſe the Scripture, ſo far as it's a word read, or preached, cannot reach to the heart, to alter and change that. Hence the Word of God, though it be compared to a ſword, yet it's called a <hi>Sword of the Spirit, Epheſ.</hi> 6. 17. Yet, although this be true, we muſt not fall into that extream errour of ſome, who therefore deny the neceſſity of the Scripture, and would have us wholly depend upon the Spirit of God, ſaying, The Scripture is a creature, and we muſt not give too much to a creature; for the Spirit is the efficient, and the Word is the ſubordinate, and theſe two muſt not be oppoſed, but compoſed one with the other. <note place="margin">Six Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove the Law, and the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, means of Converſion. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now having cleared this generall. I bring theſe Arguments to prove the Law, and the preaching of it, the means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That which is attributed to the whole word of God, as it is Gods word, ought not to be denyed to any part of it.</hi> Now this is made the property of the whole Word of God, to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Converſion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. where you have the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold effects of Gods word, <hi>To reprove, to correct, &amp; to inſtruct in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be thorowly furniſhed to every good work.</hi> Now mark the univerſality of this, <hi>All Scripture,</hi> whether you take all collectively or diſtributively, it will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate this argument, becauſe every part of Scripture hath it's partiall ability, and fitneſſe for theſe effects here mentioned. Thus <hi>Math</hi> 13. the Word of God in generall is compared
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65695:108"/>
to ſeed fown, that bringeth forth fruit: ſee alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſecond Argument is taken from thoſe places where the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>Law is expreſly named to be inſtrumentall in this great work.</hi> Not to name that place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. where the Law is called <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,</hi> in this reſpect as well as in others, becauſe it is that which works ſpiritually in us; as <hi>Paul</hi> was carnall, becauſe he worked carnally: The places are cleare out of the 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> and <hi>Pſal. 19. 7. The Law of God is perfect, converting the ſoul.</hi> It is true, ſome underſtand the converting of the ſoul, to be as much as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of it, as if the ſoul were ready to ſwoune away through the troubles thereof; but then the Law doth revive them again, and comfort them: and according to this ſenſe they take Law largely, as comprehending the Goſpell; but it ſeemeth hard to expound that phraſe in ſuch a manner. That therefore which the Antinomian doth object againſt this place is, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word doth ſignifie <hi>largely any doctrine,</hi> and ſo may compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the whole Word of God. But this is eaſily anſwered: Firſt, the ſame Hebrew word is commonly uſed for the <hi>Law, when it is ſtrictly taken;</hi> and therefore this maketh more againſt them, that the word <hi>[Law]</hi> in the Hebrew notion doth not ſignifie ſuch a commanding, terrifying and damning thing, but rather that which doth inſtruct and informe.</p>
               <p>But, in the next place, grant that the Word hath ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and comprehenſive ſenſe, yet it doth not exclude the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, but doth alwayes include. Can any man think, when <hi>David</hi> commends the Law of God, that he meaneth all the Word of God but the Morall Law, when indeed that was the greateſt part of it at that time?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That opinion, which would make Chriſt not take an inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall way for the converſion of men in his firſt Sermon, wherein he</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>was very large, that muſt not be aſſerted; but to hold that the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Law is not a</hi> Medium <hi>to converſion, muſt needs be to ſay, that Chriſt did not take the neereſt way to convert his hearers;</hi> for if you conſider that Sermon, it's principally ſpent in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Morall Law, and preſſing the duties thereof: and how can we thinke, but that our Saviour judged this profitable and ſoul-ſaving matter? Nor can I ſee, why it ſhould be ſaid to be only the occaſion, and not <hi>medium,</hi> if powerfully ſet home by Gods Spirit.</p>

                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:65695:108"/>
4. <hi>If the Law of God have that objectively in it, that may work exceedingly upon the heart, when ſet home by Gods Spirit, then it may be uſed inſtrumentally as well as the Goſpell; but it hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively ſuch a nature in it:</hi> which doth appeare by <hi>Davids</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and delighting in Gods Law: by <hi>Paul. Rom.</hi> 7. who delighted in the Law of God. When therefore a Miniſter ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth the lovely purity and excellency of the matter of the Law, how it reſembleth the nature of God, why may not the Spirit of God, in the exerciſe hereof, raiſe up the heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to be more and more in love with it? If the Heathen ſaid of Vertue, that <hi>if it could be ſeen with corporall eyes, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof would raviſh men:</hi> how much more may this be true of the purity and holineſſe of the Law?</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>If the Ceremoniall Law, the Sacraments and Sacrifices were bleſſed by Gods Spirit, while they were commanded to be uſed for the ſtrengthening and increaſe of grace, notwithſtanding the deadly nature of them now; then the Morall Law may alſo be bleſſed by God for ſpirituall effects, ſeeing it ſtandeth ſtill in force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the <hi>Uſe</hi> then of this be, by way of admonition, that in <note place="margin">

               <p>I Shall in the next place diſcuſſe that famous Queſtion, about the abrogating of the Morall Law: only I muſt anſwer to ſome Objections that are made againſt the former poſition, <hi>That the Law may be uſed by God in the preaching of it to mans Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in the ſenſe explained:</hi> which, if not attended unto, may make the aſſertion ſeem harſh, and incredible. But before I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Objections, let us conſider a great miſtake of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian author, <hi>Aſſert. of grace, pag.</hi> 171. where he makes the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ground, why they are charged with Antinomianiſme, to be, becauſe they do not hold the Law to be uſed by God inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally for the converſion of men. Certainly this is a great miſtake, for there are many learned men, who hold the work of the Law by the power of Gods Spirit to be no more then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory; yet for all that, do peremptorily maintain the uſe and the obligation of the Law in reſpect of believers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not in this reſpect condemned for that errour.</p>
               <p>Another conſideration that I will propound is this, <note place="margin">Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not wrought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally by the word read or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but is to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Covenant of grace in Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>That the work of converſion is not wrought totally in a man without the Gospel:</hi> for, as I told you, now in the preaching of the Word there is not meere Law, nor meer Goſpel, but they are to be compoſed and to be made helpfull to each other; and alſo, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever benefit or effect we get in the hearing, preaching, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating upon the Law of God, it is to be attributed unto the Convenant of grace in Chriſt. And therefore all theſe places, which attribute converſion and holineſſe to the Goſpel, do not at all make againſt my Aſſertion; for the Queſtion is not, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65695:109"/>
by the power of the Law we come to obey the Law; but, <hi>Whether grace may not uſe the Precepts, or Law preached, for the inflaming of our affections ſo in love with the things commanded, that we are thereby made more holy.</hi> And thus I interpret thoſe Authors that deny the Law to be inſtrumentall to holineſſe, that is, not animated by Gods Spirit, or ſeperated from it.</p>
               <p>I come therefore to conſider of thoſe places which are brought againſt this truth delivered: I ſhall not take all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one anſwer may ſerve for many, they being built upon the ſame ground.</p>
               <p>And, firſt the ſtate and Queſtion is obſcurely propounded by him; for thus he ſaith, <hi>[The promiſe, or the Goſpel, and not the Law, is the ſeed or doctrine of our new birth.]</hi> Aſſert. of grace, <hi>pag.</hi> 163. Now here are Ambiguities; as firſt, <hi>the promiſe or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> for by this he ſeemeth to decide a great Queſtion, that <hi>whatſoever is a promiſe in the Scripture, that belongs to the Goſpel; and whatſoever is not that, but a command or threatning, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Law:</hi> whereas this needs a great diſcuſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſtate of the Queſtion is not about the Goſpel, or the Law, as they are both a doctrin in the Scripture: but about the Spirit of God, working by one or the other; and the not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to this, makes the argument ſo confounded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſaith it's not the ſeed of the New birth; whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or regeneration is made the writing of the Law in the heart: and <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. the Word of God in generall is compared to ſeed ſowne, that brings forth different fruit; as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but to let this paſſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt inſtance that is brought, cometh from <hi>John</hi> 17. v. 17. <note place="margin">Inſtance 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy Word is truth.</hi> Where, ſaith the Authour, <hi>to ſanctifie,</hi> is <hi>to ſeperate any thing from a common uſe, and to conſecrate it to God:</hi> and, applied here to man inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth two things; 1.

An inward renewing, &amp; change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, purifying the heart and life by degrees, &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 165.</p>
               <p>I anſwer. 1. The word <hi>ſanctifie,</hi> when applied to men, doth <note place="margin">Anſwer 1.</note> not only ſignifie juſtification, or renovation, but ſetting apart to ſome peculiar office and charge: and there are Learned men
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65695:110"/>
who take this to be the meaning of Chriſts prayer here; That as the Prieſts and Levites, who were to enter into the ſanctuary, did firſt waſh their hands and feet, being alſo cloathed with goodly garments: ſo the Apoſtles are here prayed for by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that they may be fitted for their great charge. And thus <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> you have a parallel place <hi>Jer. 1. 5, Before thou cameſt forth out of the womb, I ſanctified thee, and I ordained thee a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet unto the Nations.</hi> And this expoſition is confirmed by the manner <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>in truth</hi> (ſo they reade it, &amp; mention not the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is not in ſome copies) ſo that they take it as an expreſſion oppoſing the ſanctification of the Prieſts, which was by legall types and ſhadowes. But that which doth eſpecially confirme this expoſition, ſeemeth to be the two verſes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>As thou haſt ſent me into the world, ſo have I alſo ſent them into the world, and for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelfe, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may be ſanctified through the truth.</hi> Now ſanctification as it comprehends juſtification and renovation, cannot be applied to Chriſt: but it muſt ſignifie the ſegregating and ſetting apart himſelfe for the office of the Mediatour. Beſides, if ſanctification do here include juſtification, how, by the Antinomian princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, can our Saviour pray for the juſtification of thoſe, who are already juſtified?</p>
               <p>But in the next place, grant that interpretation, of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Anſwer. 2.</note> for renovation, how doth this prove that the Law is not uſed inſtrumentally? For our Saviours argument is univerſall, <hi>thy word is truth.</hi> And may not this be affirmed of the Law, as well as the Goſpel? Doth not <hi>David,</hi> ſpeaking of the Law, call it <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>cleane,</hi> that is <hi>true,</hi> having no falſhood in it? Yea, it is thought probable by a learned man, that this ſpeech of our Saviours is taken out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 142. where are theſe words <note place="margin">Gerhard.</note> expreſly, <hi>Thy Law is the truth:</hi> Where the word <hi>Law</hi> cannot exclude the Morall Law, though it may include more.</p>
               <p>The next inſtance is <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. ver. 11. 12. <hi>For the grace of God that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Inſtance 2.</note> 
                  <hi>bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ungodlineſſe, and wordly luſts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, All this may be granted, and nothing makes againſt <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> this opinion: for none deny the Goſpel, to be the inſtruments of holineſſe: But is not here a contradiction? The Author
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65695:110"/>
before made the Goſpel and a Promiſe all one, whereas here it doth command holineſſe and godlineſſe. Is not this, with the Papiſts, to make the Goſpel a new Law? Let him reconcile himſelfe. In the next place, he doth ambiguouſly put into the argument, the word <hi>effectually</hi> which is not in the Text; for, although God doth by his grace in the Goſpel effectually move thoſe that are elected to Godlineſſe; yet Scripture, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſheweth, that where the grace of the Goſpel hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, thus teaching men, yet all are not effectually turned unto holineſſe from their wordly luſts.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the argument may be retorted upon him: What word teacheth to deny all ungodlineſſe, that ſanctifieth, inſtructeth, but the Law doth ſo, inſomuch that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. A young man whoſe luſts are ſtrongeſt, and temptations moſt violent, may be cleanſed by attending thereunto: only you muſt alwayes take notice of the preheminency of the Goſpel, above the Law; for the Law could never have any ſuch good effect upon the heart of man, were it not for the gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by Chriſt: Therefore all the godly men in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that received benefit by the Morall Law, in ſtudying of it, and meditating upon it, did depend upon the Goſpel, or the grace of God in Chriſt, as appeareth by <hi>David,</hi> praying ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to be quickned by Gods Law. And here, by the way, let me take notice of a remarkable paſſage of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in his Comment on the 7. Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Rom. ver.</hi> 14. where, ſpeaking of the great commendation the Pſalmiſt gives the Law of God, that it converts the ſoul, (and we may adde thoſe places, of inlightning the minde, that they cleanſe a mans way, &amp;c.) he maketh this Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Law doth ever obtain ſuch effects or no?</hi> And he anſwereth affirmatively, that it doth, but then when it's written not in tables, but in the hearts and bowels of men: ſo that he conceiveth the Spirit of God doth uſe the Law inſtrumentally, ſo that he writeth it in our hearts. And this is all we ſo contend for.</p>
               <p>A third and laſt inſtance out of Scripture, in anſwering of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſtance 3. Anſw.</hi> Three Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to be taken heed of in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Gal</hi> 3. 2.</note> which all is anſwered, is from <hi>Gal. 3. 2. Received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law; or by the hearing of faith?</hi> that is, of the Goſpel, the doctrine of faith. In the opening of this text, we
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65695:111"/>
muſt take heed of three errours: Firſt, of thoſe, who hold we <note place="margin">Errour 1.</note> have faith firſt, before we have the Spirit; for how can we come to have faith? By our own reaſon and will? This were to make it no work of God. The Apoſtle therefore certainly ſpeakes of the increaſe of the graces of the Spirit; for it is well obſerved by <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> that in cauſes and effects, there is a kinde of circle, one increaſing the other: As the clouds ariſe from the vapours, then theſe fall down again, &amp; make vapours; only you muſt acknowledge one firſt cauſe, which had not it's being from the other, and this is the Spirit of God, which at firſt did work faith.</p>
               <p>The ſecond errour is of the Papiſts, that maketh this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <note place="margin">Errour 2.</note> between the Law and the Goſpel, That the ſame thing is called the Law, while it is without the Spirit; and when it hath the Spirit, it is called the Goſpel; This is to confound the Law and Goſpel, and bring in Juſtification by works.</p>
               <p>The third is of the Socinian mentioned afterwards. Theſe <note place="margin">Errour 3.</note> rocks avoided, we come to conſider the place: and firſt I may demand, <hi>Whether any under the Old-Teſtament were made partakers of Gods Spirit, or no?</hi> If they were, how came they by it? There can be no other way ſaid, but that God did give his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in all thoſe publique Ordinances unto the beleeving Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites; ſo that although they did in ſome meaſure obey the Law, yet they did it not by the power of the Law, but by the power of Grace.</p>
               <p>Again, in the next place, (which hath alwaies much prevailed with me) did not the people of God receive the Grace of God offered in the Sacraments at that time? We conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain againſt the Papiſts, that our Sacraments and theirs differ not for ſubſtance. Therefore in Circumciſion and the Paſchall Lamb, they were made partakers of Chriſt as well as we: yet the Apoſtle doth as much exclude Circumciſion, and thoſe Jewiſh Ordinances from Grace, as any thing elſe. Therefore that there may be no contradiction in Scripture, ſome other way is to be thought upon, about the expoſition of theſe words. Some there are therefore that doe underſtand by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the wonderfull and miraculous works of Gods Spirit: for this was reſerved till the times of the Meſſias, and by theſe miracles his
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65695:111"/>
Doctrine was confirmed to be from Heaven; and to this ſenſe the fifth verſe ſpeaketh very expreſly: and <hi>Beza</hi> doth confeſſe, that this is the principall ſcope of the Apoſtle, though he will not exclude the other gracious works of Gods Spirit: And if this ſhould be the meaning, it were nothing to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Again, thus it may be explained, as by <hi>faith</hi> is meant the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith, ſo by the <hi>works of the Law,</hi> is to be underſtood the doctrine of the works of the Law, which the falſe Apoſtles taught, namely, that Chriſt was not enough to juſtification, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the works of the Law were put in as a cauſe alſo. And if this ſhould be the ſenſe of the Text, then it was cleare, that the Galathians, were not made partakers of Gods Spirit, by the corrupt doctrine that was taught them alate by their ſeducers, but before, while they did receive the pure doctrine of Chriſt: and therefore it was their folly, having begun in the ſpirit, to end in the fleſh. This may be a probable interpretation. But that which I ſhall ſtand upon, is this, The Jewes and falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles they looked upon the Law as ſufficient to ſave them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt: conſider <hi>Rom</hi> 2. 17, 18, 19. or when they went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, they joyned Chriſt, and the obſervance of the Morall Law equally together for juſtification and ſalvation: whereas the Law ſeparated from Chriſt, did nothing but accuſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, not being able to help the ſoul at all. Therefore it was a vain thing in them, to hope for any ſuch grace, or benefit as they did by it. So that the Apoſtles ſcope is, not abſolutely to argue againſt the benefit of the Law, which <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſo much commend, but againſt it in the ſenſe, as the Jewes did commonly dote upon it, which was to have juſtification by it alone; or at the beſt, when they put the Law and Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Now both theſe we diſclaime, either that God doth uſe the Law for our juſtification; or that of it ſelfe, it is able to ſtirre up the leaſt godly affection in us.</p>
               <p>More places of Scripture are brought againſt this, but they will come in more fitly under the notion of the Law as a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Thus therefore I ſhall conclude this point, acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many learned and orthodox men ſpeake otherwiſe, and that there is a difficulty in clearing every particular about this
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65695:112"/>
Queſtion: but as yet that which I have delivered, earrieth the more probability with me; and I will give one Text more, which I have not yet mentioned, and that is <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 38. where the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law that <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to receive, that he might give the Iſrealites, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the lively Oracles;</hi> that is, not <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba vitae,</hi> but <hi>verba viva &amp; vivificantia,</hi> ſo that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is as much as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>giving life:</hi> not that we could have life by vertue of any obedience to them; but when we by grace are inabled to obey them, God, out of his mercy, beſtoweth eternall life. Let me alſo adde this, that I the rather incline to this opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſee the Socinians, urging theſe places, or the like, where juſtification and faith is ſaid to be by Chriſt, and the Goſpel, that they wholly deny that any ſuch thing as grace and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was under the Law, and wonder how any ſhould be ſo blind as not to ſee, that theſe priviledges were revealed firſt by Chriſt in the Goſpel under the new Covenant; whereas it is plain, that the Apoſtle inſtanceth in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> (who lived under the Law as a ſchoole maſter,) for the ſame kinde of juſtification as ours is.</p>
               <p>And thus I come to another Queſtion, which is the proper and immediate ground of ſtrife between the Antinomian and us, and from whence, they have their name; and that is, <hi>the abrogation of the Morall Law:</hi> And howſoever I have already delivered many things that do confirme the perpetuall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it; yet I did it not then ſo directly, and profeſſedly, as now I ſhall; The Text (I have choſen) being a very fit foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build ſuch a ſtructure upon. I will therefore open <note place="margin">The Text opened.</note> the words and proceed as time ſhall ſuffer. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> having laid down in verſes preceding, the nature of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo exactly, that we may finde all the cauſes, efficient, meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, formall, inſtrumentall and finall deſcribed; as alſo the conſequent of this truth, which is the excluding of all ſelf-confidence and boaſting in what we do; he draweth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion or inference, <hi>ver,</hi> 26. And this concluſion is laid down firſt affirmatively and poſitively, <hi>[A man is juſtified by faith,]</hi> the Phraſes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are all equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with the Apoſtle: And then, to prevent all errours and cavils, he doth ſecondly lay it down excluſively <hi>without works.</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:65695:112"/>
And this propoſition he doth extend to the Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo from the unity or oneneſſe of God; which is not to be underſtood of the unity of his Eſſence, but Will and Promiſe. Now when all this is aſſerted, he maketh an objection (which is uſuall with him in this Epiſtle;) and he doth it for this end, to take away the calumny and reproach caſt upon him by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, as one that would deſtroy the Law. The objection then is this, (propounded by way of interrogation, to affect the more,) <hi>Do we make voyd the Law?</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; The Apoſtle uſed this word in this Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and it fignifieth <hi>to make empty and voide,</hi> ſo that, The Law ſhall be of no uſe, or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Now to this, the Apoſtle anſwereth negatively, by words of defiance and deteſtation, <hi>God forbid:</hi> So that by this expreſſion you ſee how intolerable that doctrine ought to be unto the people of God, that would take away the Law. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth not only defie this objection, but addeth, we eſtabliſh the Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Metaphor from thoſe that do corroborate and make firm a pillar, or any ſuch thing that was falling. It hath much troubled Interpreters, how <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, <hi>he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the Law,</hi> eſpecially conſidering thoſe many places in his Epiſtles which ſeem to abrogate it. Some underſtand it thus, That the righteouſneſſe of faith, hath it's witneſſe from the Law and Prophets, as <hi>ver.</hi> 21. in this Chapter; ſo that in this ſenſe they make the Law eſtabliſhed, becauſe that which was witneſſed therein, doth now come to paſſe. Even as our Saviour ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> did bear witneſſe of him. But this interpretation doth not come up to the Apoſtles meaning. Thoſe that limit this ſpeech to the Ceremoniall Law, do eaſily interpret it thus: That the ceremonies and types were fulfilled in Chriſt; who, being the ſubſtance and body, they are all now fulfilled in him. But the Apoſtle comprehends the Morall Law under the word <hi>[Law.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Papiſts they make the Goſpel a new Law, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the old Law having the Spirit, as two things diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring only gradually; ſo that they ſay, the old Law is eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the new, as the childhood is eſtabliſhed by elder age: which is not by abolition, but perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:65695:113"/>
That which I ſee the Orthodox pitch upon, is, that the Law <note place="margin">The Law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed three wayes by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</note> is eſtabliſhed three wayes by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Firſt, whereas the Law did threaten death to every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, this is eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, who ſatisfied the juſtice of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that the Law requireth perfect obedience, this is alſo fulfilled in Chriſt. Now this is a matter worth diſcuſſion, <hi>Whether the righteouſneſſe we are yet juſtified by, be the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For thoſe learned men, that are againſt the imputation of Chriſts active obedience, they urge this argument, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to carry much ſtrength with it: That if Chriſts active obedience be made ours, and we juſtified by that, then are we ſtill juſtified by the works of the Law, and ſo the righteouſneſſe of faith and works is all one; faith in us, and works in Chriſt. If therefore active obedience be made ours, (as I conceive the truth to be in that doctrine) then we may eaſily ſee the Law is eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, but laſtly, which I take to be the truth, and <hi>Auſtin</hi> heretofore interpreteth it ſo, the Law is eſtabliſhed, becauſe by the Goſpel we obtain Grace in ſome meaſure, to fulfill the Law; ſo that we ſtill keep the Law in the preceptive and informative part of it: and do obtain by faith in Chriſt, obedience in ſome degree to it; which obedience alſo, though it be not the Covenant of grace, yet is the way to Salvation.</p>

               <p>THis Text is already explained; and there are two Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations <note place="margin">'Tis hard to ſet up Chriſt and grace, and not be thought to deſtroy the Law.</note> do naturally ariſe from it, as firſt, <hi>That it is an hard thing ſo to ſet up Chriſt &amp; grace, as not thereby be thought to deſtroy the Law.</hi> Thus was <hi>Paul</hi> miſunderſtood by ſome; and ſo the Antinomians, not rightly underſtanding in what lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

the Orthodox in their diſputations againſt Popery did oppoſe the Law to the Goſpel, were thereby plunged into a dangerous errour. But on this point I will not inſiſt. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond doctrine is that which I intend, namely, <hi>That the doctrine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt and grace, doth eſtabliſh the Law.</note> 
                  <hi>of Chriſt and grace in the higheſt and fulleſt manner, doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, but eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> And this doctrine will directly lead us to lay our hands on the chiefe pillars of that houſe, which the Antinomians have built. The Queſtion then at this time to be diſcuſſed is, <hi>Whether the Law be abrogated or no by Chriſt, to the beleevers under the Gospel.</hi> And this Queſtion I will anſwer by ſeverall propoſitions that may conduce to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the the truth: for it would ſeem, as if the Scripture held out contradictions in this point. In my Text it's denyed, that the Apoſtles do <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>to diſſolve the Law.</hi> Grave therefore and ſerious is <hi>Chemnitius</hi> his admonition, <hi>In all other things, generall words beget confuſion, and obſcurity; but in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the abrogation of the Law they are very dangerous, unleſs it be diſtinctly explained, how it is abrogated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place therefore conſider, <hi>That about a Law there</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Interprta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, &amp;c. affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Law.</note> 
                  <hi>are theſe affections</hi> (if I may call them ſo;) There is an <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> a <hi>diſpenſation,</hi> or <hi>relaxation:</hi> and theſe differ from an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation;</hi> for the former do ſuppoſe the Law ſtill ſtanding in force, though mitigated; but <hi>Abrogation</hi> is then properly, when a Law is totally taken away. And this Abrogation ariſeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the expreſſe conſtitution at firſt, which did limit and preſcribe the time of the lawes continuance: ſometimes by an expreſſe revoking and repealing of it by that authority which made it: ſometimes by adding to that repeale an expreſſe law commanding the contrary. Now it may be eaſily proved, that the Ceremoniall, and Judiciall lawes they are abrogated by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe repeale. The Judiciall Law 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. where they are commanded to <hi>be ſubject to every ordination of man:</hi> and this was
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65695:114"/>
long foretold <hi>Geneſ. 49. 10. The Law-giver ſhall be taken from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi> The Ceremoniall Law that is alſo expreſly repealed <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and in other places: not that theſe were ill or that they did come from an ill author; but becauſe the fulneſſe and ſubſtance of them was now come, of whom the ceremonies were a ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow. Yet ſtill you muſt remember, that while they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, they were the exerciſes of faith and piety, &amp; God did diſpenſe grace in the uſe of them; only they were beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly and empty to ſuch who truſted in them, &amp; neglected Chriſt. Nor doth this aſſertion contradict that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 15. where he cals thoſe ordinances <hi>enmity,</hi> and <hi>decrees againſt us:</hi> for thoſe ceremonies may be conſidered two wayes; firſt as they were ſignes of Gods grace and favour: and ſecondly as they were demonſtrative of a duty, which we were tyed unto, but could not performe, and in this ſenſe all thoſe purifications and cleanſings were againſt us. Thus we ſee theſe lawes in every conſideration made void; ſo that it is not now an indifferent thing to uſe them, though we would not put our truſt in them, but ſinfull. Hence I cannot ſee how that of <hi>Luther</hi> is true upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. who ſath, <hi>He beleeveth, that if the Jewes beleeving had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Law and Circumciſion in that manner which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles permitted them, that Judaiſme had yet ſtood, and that all the world ſhould have received the ceremonies of the Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, if we would ſpeake exactly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>We cannot ſay, in any good ſenſe, that the Morall Law is abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">We may ſay that the Morall Law is mitigated, as to our perſons, but 'tis not abro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gated.</note> 
                  <hi>at all.</hi> It is true indeed, our learned Writers ſhew, that the Law in abrogated in reſpect of juſtification, condemnation, and rigour of obedience; all which I ſhall inſtance in afterwards: but if a man would ſpeake rigidly, he cannot ſay, it is abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Wee may ſay, it's mitigated, as to our perſons, though Chriſt our ſurety did fully undergoe its: for if God had taken away the Law ſo, that man nor his ſurety had been under the curſe of it, or ſhould have obeyed it, then had it been properly abrogated: whereas now, ſeeing our ſurety was bound to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie it, and perfectly to obey it and we ſtill obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme unto it, we cannot ſo properly in the generall ſay, it was abrogated. Therefore we may more properly ſay that there is a change and alteration in us towards the Law, then that the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65695:114"/>
Law is changed or abrogated. Hence obſerve, though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle denyeth that he doth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>make void the Law,</hi> yet he uſeth this expreſſion <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>we are freed or abrogated from the Law,</hi> rather then that is abrogated. Thus it is, if we would ſpeake properly: yet, becauſe the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and obedience is by Chriſt, and not by us, we may ſay, that it is abrogated to us, ſo that we may not look for remiſſion of ſins, or juſtification by it. But you muſt ſtill diſtinguiſh, when we ſpeake of the Law, ſome parts of it from the whole: ſome parts of the Law may be aboliſhed, and yet not the whole nature of it: for there is in the Law theſe parts; Firſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. <note place="margin">Three parts of the Law.</note> Secondly, the Promiſes of life to him that doth them; and thirdly, the threatnings of eternall wrath to him that faileth in the leaſt. Now the Morall Law, though it be abrogated in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the two later to a beleever, yet in reſpect of the former it doth ſtill abide; yea, and will continue in Heaven it ſelfe. And we have already proved againſt the Antinomians, that one part of the Law may abide, when the other doth not. <note place="margin">The Law is aboliſhed as it is a Covenant, but not as it is a Rule.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third propoſition,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe that ſay the Law is aboliſhed as it is</hi> foedus, <hi>but not as it is</hi> regula; <hi>ſay true.</hi> The Law may be conſidered as it is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or as it is an abſolute Rule, requiring conformity unto it: Now it may be truly granted, that the Law is aboliſhed in the former notion, though not in the later; only in expreſſing this Covenant there is difference among the Learned: ſome make the Law a Covenant of works, and upon that ground that it is abrogated: others call it a ſubſervient covenant to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, and make it only occaſionally, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, to put more luſter and ſplendour upon grace: Others call it a mixt covenant of works and grace; but that is hardly to be underſtood as poſſible, much leſſe as true. I therefore think that opinion true, as ſhall be hereafter ſhewed, that the <note place="margin">The Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> a Covenant of grace.</note> Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Covenant of grace; and that God did not. ſince man fallen, ever tranſact with him in any other Covenant, but that of grace: Though indeed this Covenant of grace did breake out more clearly, in ſucceſſion of ages, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the wiſe diſpenſation of Gods good pleaſure. So then the Law, as a Covenant, though of grace, is abrogated, becauſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65695:115"/>
though there be ſtill the ſame eſſence of the former and later covenant, yet the adminiſtration of the former is altogether an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated. This fully appeareth in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 18, 19. and again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 8. whoſoever therefore expects life and juſtification by the Law, he ſets up the covenant of works again. Nor is it any advantage to ſay, theſe workes are the workes of grace, and wrought by Chriſts spirit; for ſtill if we were juſtified by doing whatſoever the works were, yet it would be in ſuch a way as <hi>Adam</hi> was, though with ſome difference. We therefore doe deſire to lift up our voices, as vehemently as any Antinomian, againſt ſelf Juſticiaries, againſt phariſaicall, Popiſh, formall men, that ſay unto the good workes they doe, Theſe are thy Chriſt, Theſe are thy Jeſus, oh my ſoul. In matter of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we would have all of <hi>Pauls</hi> Spirit, to know nothing but Chriſt crucified, to account all things dung and droſſe We deſire to bewaile, and abundantly to bewaile the little need and want that people feel of Chriſt in all their duties. We are troubled, that any can be quiet in their duties, and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and do not cry out, None but Chriſt, None but Chriſt. All this we pleade for, and preach; only we hold the Law as a rule ſtill to walk by, though not a Covenant of works to be juſtified by.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Antinomian diſtinction of the Law aboliſhed as a Law,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to ſay the matter of a Law bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but not as a Law.</note> 
                  <hi>but ſtill abiding in reſpect of the matter of it, is a contradiction.</hi> This is a rock, that the adverſary hath daily refuge unto. <hi>The Law</hi> (ſaith the Antinomian) <hi>in the matter of it, ſo farre as I know, was never denyed to be the rule, according to which a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever is to walk and live: Therefore I take the contrary</hi> imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>to be an impudent ſlander.</hi> Aſſer. of grace, <hi>pag.</hi> 170.</p>
               <p>But to reply, if they hold the matter of the Law to be a rule, how can they ſhelter themſelves from their own argument; for if the matter oblige then when a beleever walketh not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his duty, he ſinneth, and, to ſinne the curſe is due: ſo that this evaſion will no wayes helpe them, for ſtill an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or bond lyeth upon them, which, if broken they are made obnoxious unto the Law, of God. Again, to ſay the matter of the Law bindeth, but yet not as a Law, is a meere contradiction; for what is a Law, but ſuch an object held forth by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65695:115"/>
and will of a ſuperiour? Then I demand whether <hi>[love to God]</hi> being the object, or matter held forth, have not alſo Gods will paſſing upon it that it ſhould binde. According to the Antinomian aſſertion, it ſhould be true, that love to God ſhould binde us, becauſe the matter it ſelfe is good; but nob e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God willeth us to love him: Nay, they muſt neceſſarily deny the will of God obliging us in the Law to love him; for a law is nothing but the will of the Law-giver, that ſuch things ſhould be obeyed, or avoided. And if there were any colour for that diſtinction between the matter of the Law binding, and not the Law, it would only hold in that matter which is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and neceſſarily good; as. To love God, to honour pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: but in that matter which is only good by ſome poſitive divine inſtitution; as, Keeping of the Lords Day, there we muſt ſay, that the Law binds, as a Law, and not meerly from the matter of the Law.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Law is no more abrogated to a beleever under the Old-Teſtament,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Law equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated to beleevers under the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                  <hi>then to one under the New.</hi> This aſſertion will much diſcover the falſeneſſe of the adverſaries opinion: for they carry it, as if the Law were abrogated only to the beleevers under the Goſpell. Now how can this ever be made good? for either they muſt deny that there were any beleevers under the Old-Teſtament; or, if there were, then they are freed from the Law as much as any now. Indeed if you take the Law for the whole adminiſtration of the Covenant in the Old Teſtament, we grant that it was pedagogicall, and more ſervile; ſo that a beleever under the Old-Teſtament, did not meet with ſuch cleare and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident diſpenſations of love as a beleever under the Goſpel: yet in reſpect of juſtification and ſalvation, the Law was the ſame to them as to us, and to us as to them.</p>
               <p>We do not deny but that the adminiſtration of the later covenant is farre more glorious then that of the former, and that we enjoy many priviledges which they did not then: but whatſoever is neceſſary and eſſentiall to juſtification or ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were made partakers of them, as well as we. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reſemblance of theirs, and our happineſſe; is by thoſe two, ſpoken of <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 23. that bare upon the ſtaffe the cluſter of grapes from the land of Canaan, if then we ſpeake of the Law
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65695:116"/>
in regard of the eſſentiall parts of it, which are <hi>directing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, threatning, promiſing life upon perfect obedience:</hi> Theſe are either ſtill equally in power, or elſe equally abrogated unto all beleevers, whether under the Old or New Teſtament. Let them therefore conſider whether the arguments againſt belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſubjection under the New Teſtament, be not alſo equally as ſtrong againſt thoſe that are under the Old. Therefore it is wild Divinity of an Antinomian (in <hi>Chap. 6. of the Honey-combe of free juſtification:)</hi> who makes three different eſtates of the Church: one under the Law, and another under <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and a third under the Goſpel. Now he compareth theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſheweth how we under the Goſpel exceed thoſe of the Law that were godly: and among other things, there are two notorious falſhoods; as firſt, <hi>That God indeed ſaw ſinne in the beleevers of the Old Teſtament, but not in thoſe of the New.</hi> But how abſurd and contradictory to the Author himſelf is this aſſertion? For was not that place which they ſo much urge <hi>[God ſeeth not iniquity in</hi> Jacob] ſpoken of the Church in the Old Teſtament? And beſides, if the godly were then in Chriſt, doth it not neceſſarily follow by his principles, that God muſt ſee no ſinne in them? This I bring, not as if there were any truth in that opinion of God his ſeeing no ſinne in beleevers, whether of the Old, or New Teſtament; but only to manifeſt their abſurd contradictions.</p>
               <p>The ſecond difference he makes is, <hi>That God ſeeing ſinne in thoſe of the Old Teſtament, did therefore puniſh them and afflict them for ſinne but he doth not this under the Goſpel.</hi> Hereupon he ſheweth, how <hi>Moſes</hi> for a word was ſtrucken with death, and ſo <hi>Jonah, Uzzah, Eli:</hi> theſe had ſudden puniſhments upon them. <hi>Hence alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>came there terrible faimines upon them.</hi> Now who ſeeth not how weak and abſurd theſe arguments are? For, doth not the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. ſpeaking of thoſe under the New Teſtament, that <hi>ſome were ſiok,</hi> and <hi>ſome did ſleep,</hi> and that they <hi>were judged of the Lord?</hi> were not <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira</hi> ſtricken dead immediately? Are there not famines, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the bloudy warre upon men under the Goſpel? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, theſe aſſertions are contradictions to themſelves: for if their arguments from Gods Law, and from Chriſt prove the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65695:116"/>
quite taking away of ſin, and the puniſhments of it; then it holdeth as firmly for all beleevers as for ſome.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The arguments of the Antinomian for the greater part, which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the uſe of the Law both to beleevers and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belevers.</note> 
                  <hi>they urge do not only overthrow the uſe of it to beleevers, but alſo unbeleevers.</hi> This alſo is good to be attended unto; for the Apoſtle in many places, where he ſpeaks of the Law as a Schoolmaſter, and the continuance of it for a time, doth not ſpeake comparatively of a beleever with an unbeleever, but of the ſtate of the Goſpel, and the ſtate of the Old Teſtament: ſo that, as a wicked man may not circumciſe, or take up the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, ſo neither may he uſe the Morall Law, as commonly the Jewes did, which was as diſtinct from Chriſt, and as if that of it ſelf were able alone to ſave. Therefore I wonder why the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians bring many of their arguments to prove that a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is freed from the Law; for, certainly, moſt of thoſe places will inferre, that unbeleevers alſo under the New Teſtament are; for, the Apoſtle, for the moſt part, doth argue againſt that ſtate of the Church and adminiſtrations that were uſed formerly; as in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. when the Apoſtle makes the adminiſtration of the Law to be death, and of the Goſpell life. Here he ſpeaketh not of particular perſons, but of the generall ſtate under the Goſpel: So in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. and 3. <hi>Chapters</hi> he argueth againſt the whole diſpenſation of the Law, and makes it equally abrogated unto all. And it may probably be thought, that that famous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>[ye are not under the Law but under grace]</hi> is not only to be underſtood of every particular belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but generally of the whole diſpenſation of the Goſpell under the New Teſtament. <note place="margin">The Law to a beleever is abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>We will grant, that to a beleever the Law is, as it were, abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, in theſe particulars:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of Juſtification.</hi> Though, I ſay, <hi>mitigation</hi> might be properly here uſed, yet we will call it <hi>abrogation</hi> (with the <note place="margin">1. In reſpect of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Orthodox) becauſe to the godly it is in ſome ſenſe ſo. And that which is moſt remarkable, and moſt comfortable, is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of juſtification; for now a beleever is not to expect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation at the throne of grace in himſelf, or any thing that he doth, but by relying on Chriſt. The Papiſts they ſay, this is the way to make men idle and lazy; doing in this matt er, as
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65695:117"/>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> did, who made a Law that none ſhould eate of any thing, and ſo <hi>Jonathan</hi> muſt not taſte of the honey. <hi>Saul</hi> indeed thought hereby to have the more enemies killed; but <hi>Jonathan</hi> told him, that if they had been ſuffered to eate more honey, they ſhould have been more revived and inabled to deſtroy their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. Thus the Papiſts, they forbid us to eat of this honey, this precious comfort in Chriſt, as if thereby we ſhould be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in our purſuit againſt ſinne, whereas indeed it is the only ſtrength and power againſt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Condemnation and a curſe.</hi> Thus ſtill the condition of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever <note place="margin">2. In reſpect of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> is made unſpeakably happy, <hi>Rom. 8. There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:</hi> And, <hi>Chriſt became a curſe for us:</hi> ſo that by this means the gracious ſoul hath daily matter of incouragement, arguing in prayer thus: O Lord, though my ſins deſerve a curſe, yet Chriſt his obedience doth not: Though I might be better, yet Chriſt needeth not to be better: O Lord, though I have ſinned away my own power to do good, yet not Chriſts power to ſave. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. you have a phraſe there <hi>[flying for arefuge]</hi> doth excellently ſhew forth the nature of a godly man, who is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by ſin as a malefactor was for his murder, and he runneth to Chriſt for refuge: and ſo <hi>Beza</hi> underſtands that expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>[And be found in him,]</hi> which imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the juſtice of God ſearching out for him, but he is in Chriſt.

But what godly man is there, whoſe ſpirit is ſo willing alwayes, that he doth not finde his fleſh untoward and backward unto any holy duty? How many times do they need that Chriſt ſhould draw them, and alſo that the Law ſhould draw them? So that there is great uſe of preaching the Law even to beleevers ſtill, as that which may inſtrumentally quicken and excite them to their duty. <hi>Qui dicit ſe amare legem, mentitur, &amp; neſcit quid dicit: Tàm e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim amamus legem, quàm homicida carcerem,</hi> ſaid <hi>Luther:</hi> and this is true of us, ſo far as we are corrupt.

The greatneſſe of the light doth not blind, and hebetate the eyes; for light was eſpecially created of God for them; but it is the infirmitie and weakneſſe of the eyes, which are not able to endure ſuch clearneſſe: ſo the Law which of it's ſelfe is holy and juſt, of fraile man requiring ſevere obedience, doth more and more overwhelme him: And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place Serm. 115.

                  <hi>beleever,</hi> which is nothing but conformity to the Law: ſo that, when we reade the Apoſtle ſpeaking againſt the Law, yet that he did not meane this of the Law as a rule, and as obliging us to the obedience thereof, will eaſily appeare: For when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4. had vehemently informed them of their wofull condition who would be juſtified by the Law, yet <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and 14. preſſing them not to uſe their liberty as an occaſion to the fleſh, he giveth this reaſon, <hi>For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> What doth the Apoſtle uſe contradictions in the ſame Chapter? Preſſe them to obey the Law, and yet reprove them for deſiring to be under it? No certainly, but when they would ſeek juſtification by the Law, then he reproveth them: and when, on the other ſide, they would refuſe obedience to the Law, then he admoniſheth them to the contrary. As for their diſtinguiſhing between the matter of the Law, and the Law, we have already proved it to be a contradiction.</p>

Now then, when <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits adultery, when <hi>Peter</hi> denyeth Chriſt, are not theſe ſins in them?

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65695:119"/>
love of Chriſt, and no otherwayes, this cannot hold; for then there ſhould be no ſinnes, but ſinnes of unkindneſſe, or unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. As this Law is in the hand of Chriſt; ſo murder is a ſin of unkindneſſe: but as it is againſt the Law ſimply in it ſelf, ſo it is a ſin of ſuch kind as murder, and not of another kinde; ſo that the conſideration of Chriſts love may indeed be a great motive to obey the commands of God, yet that doth not hinder the command it ſelfe from obliging and binding of us, as it is the will of the Law giver.

               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Ceremoniall Law had not for it's object that which is perpetuall, and in it ſelf holineſſe:</hi> To circumciſe, and to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, theſe things were not in themſelves holy and good, nor is the leaving of them a ſin; whereas the matter of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law is perpetually good, and the not doing of it, is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a ſin. I ſpeak of that matter, which <hi>Divines</hi> call Morall naturall. Can we thinke that to the Apoſtle it was all one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man was a murderer, adulterer, or chaſt and innocent; as it was whether a man was circumciſed, or not circumciſed? <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid well, Lib. de Pud.

               <p>Again, <hi>The Ceremoniall Law was typicall, and did ſhadow forth Chriſt to come.</hi> Now when he was come, there was no uſe of theſe ceremonies.</p>
               <p>And, laſtly, <hi>The Jewes and the Gentiles were to conſociate into one body, and no difference be made between them.</hi> Now to effect this, it was neceſſary that partition-wall ſhould be pulled down, for as long as that ſtood, they could not joyn in one.</p>

               <p>I Shall not ſtand upon any more arguments to prove the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall obligation of the Morall Law, becauſe this is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly maintained in that aſſertion already proved, that the Morall Law as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> doth ſtill oblige us.</p>
               <p>I come therefore to thoſe places of Scripture which ſeeme to <note place="margin">Places of Scripture ſeeming to hold forth the duration of the Moral Law for a time only, anſwered.</note> hold forth the duration of the Morall Law for a prefixed time only; even as the ceremoniall Law doth. I ſhall ſelect the moſt remarkable places, and, in anſwering of them, we ſhall ſee the other fully cleared. And I will begin with that, <hi>Luke 16. 16. The Law and the Prophets were untill John.</hi> It ſhould therefore ſeeme, that the Law was to continue but untill <hi>Johns</hi> time. I will not hereſtand to diſpute whether <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was to be reckoned under the Old Teſtament, or the New; only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that we cannot make a third different eſtate, wherein the Covenant of grace ſhould be diſpenſed, as an Antinomian au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth: for our Saviour ſeemeth fully to conclude, that he did belong to the Old Teſtament; therefore he ſaith, <hi>The leaſt in the kingdome of heaven is greater then he</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Minimum maximi, eſt majus max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imo minimi.</note>: Although in this reſpect he was greater then any of the Prophets that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, that he did not propheſie of a Meſſias to come, but pointed with his hand to him who was already come. And, as for the text it ſelfe, none can prove that the Law was to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated when <hi>John Baptist</hi> came; for, leaſt any ſhould by that expreſſion think ſo, our Saviour addeth, <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall ſooner paſſe away, then that one title ſhould fall to the ground.</hi> Therefore the meaning is, that the Law, in reſpect of the typicall
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65695:120"/>
part of it, as it did ſhadow forth, and prefigure a Chriſt, ſo it was to ceaſe. Therefore the Law and the Prophets are put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as agreeing in one general thing, which is, to foretell of Chriſt, and to typifie him: And this will be clearer, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Matth</hi> 11. 13. with this of <hi>Luke,</hi> where it is thus ſet down, <hi>All the Prophets and the Law propheſied unto John:</hi> whereby it is cleare, that he ſpeakes of the typicall part of the Law; yet not ſo, as if the Ceremonies were then immediatly to ceaſe, only from that time they began to vaniſh.</p>
               <p>The next place of Scripture, is that famous inſtance, ſo much urged in this controverſie <hi>Rom. 6. 15. [For you are not under the Law, but under grace.]</hi> Now to open this, conſider theſe things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In what ſenſe the Apoſtle argueth againſt the Law; and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle argueth againſt the Law, in compariſon of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>what was the proper ſtate of the Queſtion in thoſe dayes.</hi> And that appeareth <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 5. where you have a relation made of ſome beleeving Jewes that were of the ſect of the Phariſees, who preſſed the neceſſity of Circumciſion: and ſo would joyn the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt together. Now it ſeemeth, though the Apoſtles in this councell had condemned that opinion, yet there were many that would ſtill revive this errour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in that to the <hi>Galathians</hi> doth reprove this falſe doctrine, and labour much againſt it. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> and other papiſts, they think that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie was only about the Ceremoniall Law; and this they do, to maintain their juſtification by the works of the Law; when wrought by grace. But, though it muſt be granted, that the doubts about keeping the Ceremoniall Law were the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that great difference, and the moſt principall thing in queſtion; yet the Apoſtle, to ſet forth the fulneſſe of grace, and Chriſt, doth extend his arguments and inſtances even to the Morall Law: for the Jewes did generally think, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and obſervation of the Morall Law without Chriſt, was enough for their peace and comfort. That the Apoſtle argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the Law in their abuſed ſenſe of it, is plain, becauſe when he ſpeaks of it in it's own nature, he commends it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols it. The Jewes becauſe they had the Law given them in ſuch a Divine and glorious manner, attributing too much to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65695:120"/>
thought by the obedience to this alone, without Chriſt, to be juſtified, as appeareth <hi>Rom,</hi> 10. 1. Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaketh againſt it in their ſenſe, looking for Juſtification by it; as if a learned man confuting ſome Philoſophers, which do hold that the ſecond cauſes do work by their own proper ſtrength, without any concourſe of God; he muſt in his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuppoſe ſuch a power of the ſecond cauſe, which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary pleadeth for in his minde, and in expreſſions ſometimes, yet none can gather from that, therefore there is ſuch a power in the ſecond cauſes. And if they could perſwade themſelves, that the externall performing of the Ceremoniall Law was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make them acceptable with God, though they lived in groſſe diſobedience to the Morall Law, (as <hi>Iſai. 1. &amp; alibi,</hi> it many times appeareth they did) how much more, when they lived a life externally conformable to the Morall Law; muſt they needs be ſecure of their favour with God? And in this ſenſe it is, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks ſeemingly derogatory to the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they took it without Chriſt: Even as he calleth the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies <hi>beggerly elements,</hi> when yet we know, they were ſignes of an Evangelicall grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Apoſtle uſeth the word</hi> [Law] <hi>in divers ſenſes, which hath been the occaſion of ſo much difficulty in this point.</hi> Now in moſt of thoſe places, where the Law ſeemeth to be aboliſhed, it is taken in one of theſe two ſenſes: Either, firſt ſynecdochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, the Law put for part of the Law: to wit, for that part <note place="margin">The word <hi>Law</hi> taken in a two-fold ſenſe.</note> which actually condemneth, and accuſeth; as when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>[Againſt ſuch there, is no Law:]</hi> here he ſpeaketh as if there were nothing in a Law but condemnation; whereas we may ſay, A Law is for a thing by way of direction and preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as againſt a thing by accuſation. Or, ſecondly, the word <hi>[Law]</hi> is put for the miniſtery of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was farre inferiour unto the miniſtery of the Goſpel: And in this ſenſe, the Apoſtle doth much uſe it in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> So that here is a continuall miſtake, when the Antinomians heap place upon place, which ſeem to aboliſh the Law, and do not firſt declare what Law, and in what ſenſe thoſe places are to be expounded.</p>

Secondly, unwillingly &amp; by way of compulſion, when not out of love but feare, men do obey the Law &amp; this is ſinful, in the former ſenſe all beleevers may be ſaid to be under the Law but yet, becauſe the Apoſtle uſeth it for the moſt part in an ill ſenſe, as here in the text, and in that place, tell me, ye that deſire to be under the Law, (though Law there be uſed for the whole Miniſtery of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not of the Morall Law) let us conſider in what ſenſe this is denied to the Godly.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Interpretation of ſome, though of ſolid Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſenſe of that Phraſe, <hi>Not to be under this Law.</hi> rejected.</note> who make the phraſe <hi>[Not to be under the Law]</hi> to be as much as, <hi>Not under the curſe of the Law;</hi> or, <hi>Not obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the guilt by it,</hi> ſeemeth not to agree with the context. I know this is generally received as the ſenſe of the place; and there is this argument urged for it, becauſe the Apoſtle maketh an objection from hence; <hi>Shall we ſinne becauſe we are not under the Law, but under grace?</hi> Therefore it ſhould ſeem that the Law is taken for the condemning power of it, and grace for pardoning and free Juſtification: but becauſe the Apoſtle is here ſpeaking of ſanctification, both in this Chapter, and the Chapter following, I preferre <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beza's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerpretation of the phraſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd.</note> 
                  <hi>Beza's</hi> interpretation, which makes the <hi>being under the Law,</hi> to be the ſame in ſenſe with, <hi>under ſin;</hi> for the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of himſelfe as carnall, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. ſaith, that <hi>the Law wrought in him all manner of evill:</hi> and this indeed is the work of the Law in every unregenerate man; ſo that the more the Law is applyed to him, the more doth his corruption break forth. Now then this is the Apoſtles argument, <hi>Let not ſin reign in you, for now you are not under the Law</hi> ſtirring up ſin, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking it in you, <hi>but under grace;</hi> not juſtifying or pardoning, as properly and immediately meant here (though they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that alſo) but ſanctifying and healing. And the Apoſtle maketh the objection following <hi>[What then, ſhall we ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65695:122"/>
we are not under the Law?]</hi> becauſe the phraſe was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous,, and might be thought to have ſuch a ſenſe, as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines make it to have, to wit, to do every thing as we pleaſe without any controule by any Law: and in this explication, we ſhall ſee a ſweet harmony in the context.</p>
               <p>The third inſtance is <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. eſpecially in the beginning of the Chapter: but the anſwer to the former Objection, will alſo cleare this, becauſe the apoſtle continueth in the ſame matter, explaining <hi>what it is to be under the Law,</hi> by a ſimilitude from a wife married to an husband, who is bound to him ſo long as he liveth, but when he dyeth, ſhe is free. Now in the reddition of the ſimilitude, there is ſome difference among Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: but I take it thus, Sin, which by the Law doth irritate and provoke our corruptions, that is the former husband the ſoul had, and luſts they are the children hereof; but when we are regenerated, then Chriſt becomes the husband of the godly ſoul: ſo that they are deceived who make the Morall Law the husband, but ſin is properly the husband: And if you will ſay the Morall Law, you muſt underſtand it in this ſenſe only, as it doth inflame the heart to all evil; therefore the Apoſtle (as is well obſerved by the Learned) doth not ſay, the Law is dead, but, <hi>we are dead;</hi> for indeed the Law is never ſo much alive as in the godly, who do conſtantly obey it, &amp; live accordingly to it.</p>
               <p>This will alſo ſerve for that place, <hi>Gal. 5. 18. If ye be led by the ſpirit, ye are not under the Law;</hi> That is, under the Law forcibly compelling.</p>

               <p>I Have already handled the Law as it is a Rule, and now come to conſider of it as a Covenant, that ſo the whole Law may be fully underſtood. I ſhall not be long upon this, though the matter be large and difficult, though the ſubject be like the Land of Canaan, yet there are many Gyants, and great Objections in the way. I will rather handle it poſitively, then controverſally; for I do not finde in any point of Divinity, learned men ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and perplexed (being like <hi>Abrahams</hi> Ram, hung in a buſh of briars and brambles by the head) as here. That I may methodically proceed, obſerve the context of this verſe, and the ſcope, <hi>Moſes</hi> being to perſwade the people of Iſrael to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">Arguments uſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> to perſwade obedience to the Law.</note> of the Law, uſeth ſeverall forcible arguments.</p>
               <p>As, <hi>ver. 1. The good and profitable iſſue thereof,</hi> which is to live and poſſeſſe the land, not as if this mercy were only temporall, but by this was repreſented eternall life in heaven.</p>
               <p>A ſecond argument is, <hi>from the perfection of it,</hi> that nothing may be added to it, or detracted from it.</p>
               <p>The third argument is, <hi>from the great wiſdome and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhall hold forth hereby to all other Nations,</hi> there being no people under the ſun, that had ſuch holy and perfect lawes as they had, and if that be true of <hi>Bernard, Sapiens eſt cui res ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt pro ut ſunt,</hi> he is a wiſe man to whom things do taſte and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh as they are divine and holy things, as holy; earthly things, as earthly and fading; then certainly, by this Law of God, there was true wiſdome preſcribed. Other arguments <hi>Moſes</hi> doth bring, as, <hi>The great authority God put upon the Law, The
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65695:123"/>
great mercy in giving it to them rather then another Nation.</hi> And the verſe I have read belongs to that argument which proveth the dignity and glorious authority of the Law, <hi>from the manner of delivering it:</hi> Which Law he declareth to us by the name and title of a Covenant. Now this take notice of, that the word <hi>Covenant</hi> (to omit other ſignifications) is taken ſometimes ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecdochially, for part of the Covenant, as it is here in theſe words.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine I will inſiſt upon, is, <hi>That the Law was delivered</hi>

Even as when the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 6.

               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65695:123"/>
his conſent and willingneſſe to be their God, if they will keep ſuch Commandements there and then delivered to them <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Secondly, you have the peoples full conſent, and ready willingneſſe to obey them, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>ver.</hi> 7. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Covenants uſed to be written down for a memoriall unto poſterity, therefore we ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> writing the precepts down in a book. Fourthly, becauſe Covenants uſed to be confirmed by ſome outward viſible ſignes, eſpecially by killing of beaſts, and offering them in ſacrifice, therefore we have this alſo done, and halfe of the blood was ſprinkled on the Altar, to denote Gods entring into Covenant, and the people alſo were ſprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with blood, to ſhew their voluntary covenanting. Thus we have reall covenanting when the Law is given.</p>
               <p>So alſo you may ſee this in effect, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12, 13. where it's expreſly ſaid, <hi>that they ſtood to enter into Covenant with God; that he may eſtabliſh them to be a people unto himſelf, and that he may be a God unto them.</hi> Again, you have this clearly in <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 17, 18. where it is ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walke in his wayes—And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people.</hi> So, that it's very plain, the Law was given as a Covenant; yea, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle cals it a Teſtament: for howſoever ſome have diſliked that diſtinction of the Old and New Teſtament, eſpecially as applied to the books &amp; writings of the holy Pen-men of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (thinking as <hi>Auſtin,</hi> they may be better called the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Inſtruments,</hi> becauſe they are authenticall, and confirmed by ſufficient witneſſes: As <hi>Tertullian</hi> cals the Bible, <hi>Noſtra digeſta,</hi> from the Lawyers; and others called it, <hi>Our Pandects,</hi> from them alſo) yet 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. doth warrant ſuch a diſtinction. Only the queſtion is, how this <hi>Covenant</hi> can be called properly a Teſtament, becauſe Chriſt died not twice, and there cannot be a Teſtament, without the death of a Teſtator. But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that there was a typicall death of Chriſt in the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that was ground enough to make the Covenant to be <note place="margin">The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Learned different in declaring what Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is here meant.</note> called a Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Having proved it is a Covenant, all the difficulty remaineth in declaring what Covenant it is; for here is much difference of judgements, even with the Learned and Orthodox: and this
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65695:124"/>
doth ariſe from the different places of the Scripture, which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be not contrary one to another, yet the weakneſſe of our underſtandings is many times overmaſtered by ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Some (as you have heard) make it a Covenant of workes, others a mixt Covenant, ſome a ſubſervient Covenant; but I am perſwaded to goe with thoſe who hold it to be a Covenant of grace: and indeed, it is very eaſie to bring ſtrong arguments for the affirmative; but then there will be ſome difficulty to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuch places as are brought for the negative; and if the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative prove true, the dignity and excellency of the Law will appeare the more. Now, before I come to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which induce me hereunto, conſider in what ſenſe it <note place="margin">In what ſenſe it may be a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> may be explained, that it is a Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>Some explaine it thus, that it was indeed a Covenant of grace, but the Jewes, by their corrupt underſtanding, made it a Covenant of workes, and ſo oppoſed it unto Chriſt: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſay they, the Apoſtle argueth againſt the Law, as making it to oppoſe the promiſes and grace: not that it did ſo, but only in regard of the Jewes corrupt minds, who made an oppoſition where there was none. This hath ſome truth in it, but it is not full.</p>
               <p>Some make the Law to be a Covenant of grace, but very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely; and therefore they hold the Goſpel and the Law to be the ſame, differing only as the acorne while it is in the huske, and the oke when it's branched out into a tall tree. Now if this ſhould be underſtood in a Popiſh ſenſe, as if the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law and the Goſpel were all one, in which ſenſe the Papiſts ſpeake of the old Law and the new, it would be very dangerous and directly thwarting the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Some explain it thus: God (ſay they,) had a primary or ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent will in giving of the Law, or a ſecondary and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: His primary will was to hold out perfect and exact righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, againſt which the Apoſtle argueth, and proveth no man can be juſtified thereby: but then God knowing mans im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency and inability, did ſecondarily command repentance, and promiſeth a gracious acceptance through Chriſt; and this may be very well received, if it be not vexed with ill interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:65695:124"/>
But, laſtly, this way I ſhall go: The Law (as to this purpoſe) may be conſidered more largely, as that whole doctrine delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on Mount Sinai, with the preface and promiſes adjoyned, and all things that may be reduced to it; or more ſtrictly, as it is an abſtracted rule of righteouſneſſe, holding forth life upon no termes, but perfect obedience. Now take it in the former ſenſe, it was a Covenant of grace; take it in the later ſenſe, as abſtracted from <hi>Moſes</hi> his adminiſtration of it, and ſo it was not of grace, but workes.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction will overthrow all the Objections againſt the negative. Nor may it be any wonder that the Apoſtle ſhould conſider the Law ſo differently, ſeeing there is nothing more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary with <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle, and that in theſe very contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, then to doe ſo: as for example, take this inſtance, <hi>Rom. 10. ver.</hi> 5, 6. where <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe of the Law from thoſe words, <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> which is ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 5. but we find this in effect, <hi>Deut 30. v.</hi> 16. yet from this very Chapter the Apoſtle deſcribeth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which is by faith: And <hi>Beza</hi> doth acknowledg, that that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes of the Law, <hi>Paul</hi> doth apply to the Goſpel: Now how can this be reconciled, unleſſe wee diſtinguiſh between the generall doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> which was delivered unto the people in the circumſtantiall adminiſtrations of it, and the particular doctrine about the Law, taken in a limited and abſtracted conſideration? Onely this take notice of, that although the Law were a Covenant of grace, yet the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of works and faith differ as much as heaven and earth. But the Papiſts, they make this difference: <hi>The righteouſneſſe of the Law</hi> (ſaith <hi>Stapleton,</hi> Antid. in hunc locum) <hi>is that which we of our owne power have and doe by the knowledge and underſtanding of the Law:</hi> but the righteouſneſſe of faith, they make the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law, to which wee are enabled by grace through Chriſt: So that they compare not theſe two together, as two contraries, (in which ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> doth) but as an imperfect righteouſneſſe with a perfect. But we know, that the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the workes of <hi>David</hi> &amp; <hi>Abraham,</hi> that they did in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, to which they were enabled by grace; ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary is it in matter of juſtification and pardon to exclude all
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65695:125"/>
workes, any thing that is ours; <hi>Tolle te à te, impedis te,</hi> ſaid <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> well. Nor doth it availe us, that this grace in us is from God, becauſe the Apoſtle makes the oppoſition wholy between any thing that is ours, howſoever we come by it, and that of faith in Chriſt. Having thus explained the ſtate of the Queſtion, I come to the arguments to prove the affirmative: And thus I ſhall order them;</p>
               <p>The firſt ſhall be taken <hi>from the relation of the Covenanters;</hi>

                  <hi>God on one part, and the Iſraelites on the other: God did not deale at this time, as abſolutely conſidered, but as their God and Father.</hi> Hence God ſaith <hi>hee is their God;</hi> and when Chriſt quoteth the commanders, hee brings the preface, <hi>Heare O Iſrael, the Lord thy God is one.</hi> And, <hi>Rom. 9. 4. To the Iſraelites belong adoption, and the glory, and the covenants and the giving of the Law, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi> Now, unleſſe this were a covenant of grace, how could God be their God, who were ſinners? Thus alſo if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the people of Iſrael into what relation they are taken, this will much confirme the point. <hi>Ezod. 19. 5, 6.

                  <note place="margin">Argum. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>muſt needs be a Covenant of grace:</hi> for there we have remiſſion and pardon of ſinne, whereas in the Covenant of workes, there is no way for repentance or pardon. In the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God is deſcribed to be <hi>one ſhewing mercy unto thouſands:</hi> and by <hi>ſhewing mercy</hi> is meant <hi>pardon,</hi> as appeareth by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>viſiting iniquity.</hi> Now doth the Law, ſtrictly taken, receive any humbling &amp; debaſing of themſelves? no, but curſeth every one that doth not continue in all the things commanded, and that with a full and perfect obedience. Hence, <hi>Exod. 34. ver.</hi> 6, 7. God proclaimeth himſelfe in manifold attributes of <hi>being gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> and <hi>long-ſuffering, keeping mercie for thouſands, and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving iniquity;</hi> and this he doth upon the renewing of the two Tables: whereas, if the people of Iſrael had been ſtrictly held up
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65695:125"/>
to the Law, as it required univerſall perfect obedience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any failing, they muſt alſo neceſſarily have deſpaired, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed without any hope at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If we conſider the duties commanded in the Law ſo generally taken, it muſt needs be a Covenant of grace:</hi> for what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note> of the firſt Commandment, but to have one God in Chriſt our God by faith? For if faith had not been on ſuch tearmes commanded, it had been impoſible for them to love God, or to pray unto God. Muſt not the meaning then be, to love, and delight in God, and to truſt in him? But how can this be without faith through Chriſt? Hence ſome urge, that the end of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is love from faith unfeigned; but becauſe <hi>Scultetus</hi> doth very probably, by commandment, underſtand there, <hi>The Apoſtles preaching and exhortation,</hi> (it being in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and the Apoſtle uſing the word in that Epiſtle in the ſame ſenſe) I leave it. It's true there is no mention made of Chriſt, or faith in the firſt Commandment, but that is nothing, for love alſo is not mentioned: yet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour diſcovers it there, and ſo muſt faith and Chriſt be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there by neceſſary conſequence. And can we think, that the people of Iſrael, though indeed they were too confident in themſelves, yet when they took upon themſelves to keep and obſerve the Law, that the meaning was, they would do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſpot or blemiſh by ſinne, or without the grace of God for pardon, if they ſhould at any time break the Law.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>From the Ceremoniall Law.</hi> All Divines ſay, that this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <note place="margin">Argum. 4.</note> to the Morall Law, ſo that Sacrifices were commanded by vertue of the ſecond Commandment. Now we all know, that the Sacrifices were evangelicall, and did hold forth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinns through the blood of Chriſt: If therefore theſe were commanded by the Morall Law, there muſt neceſſarily be grace included, although indeed it was very obſcure and dark. And it is to be obſerved, that the Apoſtle doth as much argue againſt circumciſion, and even all the Ceremoniall Law, as the Morall; yea the firſt riſe of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſie was from that: Now all muſt confeſſe, that circumciſion and the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices did not oppoſe Chriſt, or grace, but rather included them.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65695:126"/>
And this hath been alwaies a very ſtrong argument to perſwade me for the affirmative. It is true, the Jewes they reſted upon theſe, and did not look to Chriſt; but ſo do our Chriſtians in theſe times upon the Sacraments, and other duties.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This will appear from the viſible ſeale to ratifie this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which you heard, was by ſacrifices, and ſprinkling the people</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Argum. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>with blood:</hi> And this did ſignifie Chriſt, for Chriſt he alſo was the Mediatour of this Covenant, ſeeing that reconciliation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be made with a ſinner, through the Mediation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mortall man. When therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> is called the Mediatour, it is to be underſtood typically, even as the ſacrifices did waſh away ſin typically. And, indeed, if it had been a Covenant of works, there needed no Mediatour, either typicall, or real; ſome think Chriſt likewiſe was the Angell ſpoke of <hi>Act.</hi> 7. with whom <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the wilderneſſe; and it is probable. Now if Chriſt was the Mediatour of the Law as a Covenant, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian diſtinction muſt fall to the ground, that makes the Law as in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not in the hand of Chriſt; whereas on Mount Sinai, the Law was in the hand of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>If the Law were the ſame Covenant with that oath, which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Argum. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>God made to Iſaac, then it muſt needs be a Covenant of grace:</hi> But we ſhall finde that God, when he gave this Law to them; makes it an argument of his love and grace to them; and therefore remembers what he had promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Deut. 7. 12. <hi>Wherefore it ſhall come to paſſe, if ye hearken to theſe judgements, and do them, that the Lord thy God ſhall keep unto thee the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, &amp; the mercy which he ſware unto thy fathers.</hi> And, certainly, if the Law had been a Covenant of works, God had fully abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and broken his Covenant and Promiſe of grace which he made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. Therefore, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 18. oppoſeth the Law and the promiſe together, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the inheritance by one, &amp; not the other; it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood according to the diſtinction before mentioned of the Law taken in a moſt ſtrict and limited ſenſe: for it is plain, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in the adminiſtration of this Law, had regard to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Promiſe, yea made it the ſame with it. <note place="margin">Obiections impugning the former Arguments anſwered.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now to all this, there are ſtrong objections made from thoſe
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65695:126"/>
places of Scripture, where the Law and faith, or the promiſe, are ſo directly oppoſed, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. before quoted, ſo <hi>Gal. 3. 18. Rom</hi> 4. 14. ſo likewiſe from thoſe places, where the Law is ſaid to be <hi>the miniſtery of death, and to work wrath.</hi> Now to theſe places, I anſwer theſe things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that if they ſhould be rigidly, and univerſally true, then that doctrine of the Socinians would plainly prevaile, who from theſe places of Scripture do urge, that there was no grace, or faith, nor nothing of Chriſt, vouchſafed unto the Jewes; whereas they reade they had the Adoption, though the ſtate was a ſtate of bondage.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place conſider that as it is ſaid of the Law, <hi>it worketh death,</hi> ſo the Goſpel is ſaid to be <hi>the ſavour of death,</hi> and men are ſaid <hi>to have no ſin, if Chriſt had not come;</hi> yea they are ſaid <hi>to partake of more grievous judgements, who deſpiſed Chriſt, then thoſe that deſpiſed the Law of Moſes:</hi> ſo that this effect of the Law was meerly accidentall through our corruption: only here is the difference, God doth not vouchſafe any ſuch grace, as whereby we can have juſtification in a ſtrict legall way: but he doth whereby we may obtain it in an Evangelicall way.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh theſe derogatory paſſages (as they may ſeem to be) as well of the Ceremoniall Law; yet all do acknowledge here was Chriſt and grace held forth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, much of theſe places is true in a reſpective ſenſe, according to the interpretation of the Jew, who taking theſe without Chriſt, make it a killing letter, even as if we ſhould the doctrine of the Goſpel, without the grace of Chriſt. And, certainly, if any Jew, had ſtood up and ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Why do you ſay, you give us the doctrine of life; it's nothing but a kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling letter, and the miniſtery of death, would he not have been judged a blaſphemer againſt the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi> The Apoſtle therefore muſt underſtand it, as ſeperated, yea and oppoſed to Chriſt and his grace.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, we are ſtill to retain that diſtinction of the Law in a more large ſenſe, as delivered by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and a more ſtrict ſenſe, as it conſiſteth in precepts, threatnings and promiſes upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition impoſſible to us, which is, the fulfilling of the Law in a perfect manner.</p>

                  <q>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay, but of faith.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THe Apoſtle delivered in the words before moſt compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and fully the whole doctrine of juſtification in the <note place="margin">The words opened.</note> ſeverall cauſes of it, from whence in this verſe, he inferreth a concluſion againſt all boaſting in a mans ſelf; which he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth by ſhort interrogations, that ſo he might the more ſubdue that ſelfe confidence in us: <hi>Where is boasting?</hi> ſaith he. This is to be applyed univerſally both to Jew and Gentile; but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the Jew, who gloried moſt herein. and <hi>Chryſostome</hi> makes this the reaſon why Chriſt deferred ſo long, &amp; put off his coming in the fleſh, <hi>viz.</hi> that our humane pride might be debaſed: for if at firſt he had come unto us, men would not have found ſuch an abſolute neceſſity of a Saviour. The ſecond Queſtion is, by what Law boaſting is excluded; and this is anſwered, firſt negatively, <hi>not by the Law of works.</hi> Secondly poſitively, <hi>by the law of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle, by <hi>the law of works,</hi> meaneth the doctrine of works, preſcribing them as the condition of our juſtification and ſalvation; and he ſaith <hi>works,</hi> in the plurall number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one or two good works, though perfectly done (if that were poſſible) would not ſatisfie the Law for our acceptation, unleſſe there were a continuall and univerſall practiſe of them, both for parts and degrees: and he cals the doctrine of faith, <hi>the law of faith,</hi> either becauſe (as <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith) he would ſweeten and indeare the Goſpel to the Jewes, by giving it a name which they loved; or, as <hi>Beza,</hi> he ſpeaks here mimeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, according to the ſenſe of the Jewes, as when <hi>John.</hi> 6. he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65695:127"/>
calleth <hi>Faith a work,</hi> becauſe the Jewes asked, What ſhould they do? Now we have in the Scripture two lively comments upon both theſe parts of the Text. The Phariſee mentioning what he did, reckoning up his works, and never naming the grace of God, is a boaſter by the Law of works, but the Publican, that looketh upon himſelfe only as a ſinner, and ſo judgeth himſelf, he excludeth all boaſting by the law of faith.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts they mean by works here in the Text, thoſe <note place="margin">The Papiſts corruptly gloſſe upon this Text.</note> which go before faith, and they quote a good rule out of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> though to a foul errour, <hi>Non per opera venitur ad fidem, ſed per fidem ad opera: We do not come by works to faith, but by faith to Works.</hi> But this gloſſe of theirs corrupts the text, becauſe the Apoſtle in this controverſie inſtanceth in <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhewing how he had not wherewith to glory in himſelf, and therefore by beleeving gave glory to God. If you ask why works do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply boaſting, though we be enabled thereunto by the grace of God? The anſwer is ready, becauſe we attribute juſtification to that work of grace within us, which yet is defective, that is, wholly to be given unto Chriſt. <note place="margin">Doctr.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The doctrine I ſhall purſue out of theſe words, is, <hi>That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Law, given by God to the Iſraelites, was a Covenant of grace, yet in ſome ſenſe the Law and Gospel do oppoſe and thwart one another,</hi> And this matter I undertake, becauſe hereby the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Goſpel and the Law will be much diſcovered. <hi>It is an errour,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi> lib. 2. Inſtit. cap. 9. <hi>in thoſe who do never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe compare the Goſpel with the Law, then the merit of works with the free imputation of righteouſneſs: and</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis or oppoſition is not to be refuſed, becauſe the Apoſtle doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times make them contrary, meaning by the Law that rule of life, whereby God doth require of us, that which is his own, given us no ground of hope, unleſſe in every reſpect we keep the Law; but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>quum de totâ lege agitur, when he ſpeaks of the Law more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, he makes them to differ, only in reſpect of clearer manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> or, as, <hi>Pareus</hi> ſaith of the old and new Covenant, they <note place="margin">The Law and the Goſpel may be compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one with another in a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</note> differ not eſſentially, but, as we ſay, the old and new Moon.</p>
               <p>Therefore, before I come to ſhew the exact oppoſition, take notice of two things as a foundation: firſt, that the Law and the Goſpel may be compared one with another, either in reſpect
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65695:128"/>
of the grace God gave under the Old-Teſtament, &amp; the New, and then they differ onely gradually; for they under the Law did enjoy grace and the Spirit of God, (though Socinians deny it) although indeed in reſpect of the Goſpel, it may compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively be ſaid, no ſpirit, and, no grace; as when it is ſaid, <hi>The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt was not yet given,</hi> becauſe it was not ſo plentifully given: Or, ſecondly, the doctrine of the Law in the meere preceptive nature of it, may be compared with the doctrine of the Goſpel, having the grace of God annexed unto it and going along with it. Now this is in ſome reſpects an unequall compariſon; for if you take the doctrine or letter of the Goſpel without the grace of God, that letter may be ſaid to kill as well as the letter of the Law: only this is the reaſon, why we cannot say, The Spirit of God, or grace, or life is by the Law, becauſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſpirituall good was vouchſafed to the Jewes, it is not of the Law, but of the grace of God, or the Goſpel. Therefore, whenſoever we compare Law and Goſpel together, we muſt be ſure to make the parallel equall, and to take them ſo oppoſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we may not give the one more advantage, or leſſe, then the nature of it doth crave and deſire.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place therefore, in this controverſie, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to carry along with you the different uſe of the word <note place="margin">The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent uſe of the word <hi>[Law]</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be obſerved.</note> 
                  <hi>[Law]</hi> as to this point; for if you take Law ſtrictly, and yet make it a Covenant of grace, you confound the righteouſneſſe of works, and of faith together, as the Papiſts do: but if large<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, then there may be an happy reconciliation.</p>
               <p>For the better opening of this, conſider, that as the word <note place="margin">What meant by Law taken largely and what ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</note> 
                  <hi>[Law]</hi> ſo the word <hi>[Goſpel]</hi> may be taken <hi>largely,</hi> or <hi>ſtrictly.</hi> We will not trouble you with the many ſignifications of the word (or whether it be uſed any where of a ſorrowfull meſſage, as well as glad newes, as ſome ſay, in two places it is uſed, 1. <hi>Sam. 4. 17. 2 Sam.</hi> 1. 10. according to that rule of <hi>Mercers, Non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequens eſſe, ſpecialia verba interdum generaliter ſumi.)</hi> It is enough to our purpoſe, that in the Scripture it is ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>more largely,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>more ſtrictly:</hi> when it's taken <hi>largely,</hi> it ſignifieth the whole doctrine, that the Apoſtles were to preach, <hi>Mar. 16. 15. Preach the Goſpel to every creature:</hi> &amp; ſo <hi>Mar. 1. 1. The beginning of the Goſpel, i. e.</hi> the doctrine &amp; preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65695:128"/>
of Chriſt. Or elſe it is taken <hi>moſt ſtrictly,</hi> as when <hi>Luke 2. 10. Behold I bring you glad tydings,</hi> &amp;c. In which ſtrict ſence it's called <hi>the Goſpel of peace,</hi> and <hi>of the grace of God:</hi> So that you ſee, the word <hi>[Law]</hi> is taken differently, <hi>largely</hi> and <hi>ſtrictly;</hi> thus alſo is the word <hi>[Goſpel.]</hi> Now it's a great diſpute, <hi>Whether the command of repentance belong unto the Goſpel, or no?</hi> I finde the Lutherans, Antinomians, and Calviniſts to ſpeak differently: but of that, when we take the Law and Goſpel in their moſt ſtrict ſenſe. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth it as an argument, that the Proteſtants do deny the neceſſity of good works, becauſe they hold that the Goſpel hath no precepts, or threatnings in it, <hi>lib. 4. de Juſtif. cap.</hi> 2. And he urgeth againſt them, that <hi>Cap. 1. ad Rom.</hi> where the wrath of God is ſaid to be revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Goſpel; but (as is to be ſhewed) he there doth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the ſtate of the controverſie taking the word <hi>[Goſpel]</hi> in a larger ſenſe then they intended. Thus on the other ſide <hi>Iſlebius,</hi> the father of the Antinomians, he taught that repentance was not to be preſſed from the Decalogue, but from the Goſpel; &amp; that, to preſerve the purity of doctrine, we ought to reſiſt all thoſe who teach, the Goſpel muſt not be preached but to thoſe who are made contrite by the Law: whereas the right unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the word <hi>[Goſpel]</hi> would make up quickly thoſe breaches.</p>
               <p>The Law therefore and the Goſpel admitting of ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent acception, I ſhall firſt ſhew the oppoſition between the Law and the Goſpel taken in their large ſenſe and then in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited ſenſe, And this is worth the while, becauſe this is the foundation of all our comfort, if rightly underſtood. Now the Queſtion in this larger ſenſe is the ſame with the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Old and New-Teſtament, or Covenant; wherein the Learned ſpeak very differently, and, as to my apprehenſion, moſt confuſedly. I ſhall not examine whether that be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of calling it <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New,</hi> which <hi>Auſtin Chemnitius,</hi> and others urge, becauſe it preſſeth the old man &amp; condemneth that; whereas the new incourageth and comforteth new: I rather take it to be ſo called, becauſe the old was to ceaſe and vaniſh away, being before the other in time. Now in my method I will lay down the falſe differences, and then name the true.</p>

                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:65695:129"/>
The falſe differences are firſt of the Anabaptiſts and Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, <note place="margin">Falſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law and the Goſpel: 1. Of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, and Socini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That they under the Law in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed only temporall bleſſings.</note> who make all that lived under the Law to have nothing but temporall earthly bleſſings in their knowledge and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And for this they are very reſolute, granting indeed that Chriſt and eternall things were promiſed in the Old Teſtament but they were not enjoyed by any till the New Teſtament, whereupon they ſay, that <hi>grace and ſalvation was not till Chriſt came.</hi> And the places which the Antinomians bring for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers under the New Teſtament, they take rigidly and univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if there had been no eternall life, nor nothing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God till Chriſt came. Hence they ſay, the Goſpel began with Chriſt, and deny that the promiſe of a Chriſt, or Meſſias to come is ever called the Goſpel, but the reall exhibition of him only. This is falſe; for, although this promiſe be ſometimes called <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 32. <hi>the promiſe made to the fathers, yet it</hi> is ſometimes alſo called the <hi>Goſpel, Rom.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. And there are cleare places to confute this wicked errour, as the Apoſtle inſtancing in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> for juſtification, and remiſſion of ſinnes, which were ſpirituall mercies; and that eternall life was not unknown to them, appeareth by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours injunction, commanding them to ſearch the Scriptures, for in them they hope for eternall life, <hi>John</hi> 11. 39. Thus alſo they had hope and knowledge of a reſurrection, as appeareth, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 14. therefore our Saviour proved the reſurrection out of a ſpeech of Gods to <hi>Moſes.</hi> And howſoever <hi>Mercer</hi> (as I take it) thinke that expoſition probable about <hi>Jobs</hi> profeſſion of his knowledge <hi>[That his Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſee him at the laſt day]</hi> which make his meaning to be of <hi>Jobs</hi> perſwaſion of his reſtitution unto outward peace and health again; yet there are ſome paſſages, in his expreſſion, that ſeem plainly to hold out the contrary. Though therefore we grant that that ſtate, was the ſtate of children, and ſo carried by ſenſible objects very much; yet there was under theſe temporall good things, ſpiritual held forth. Hence the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. maketh the Jewes to have the ſame ſpirituall matter and benefit in their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments <note place="margin">2. Of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</note> which we partake of.</p>
               <p>In the next place, let us conſider the falſe difference of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; and they have the Socinians alſo agreeing with them in ſome things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:65695:129"/>
Firſt, they make this a great difference, that Chriſt, under the <note place="margin">1. That Chriſt hath added more perfect Laws under the New Teſtament.</note> New Teſtament, hath added more perfect Laws, and ſound counſells then were before, as, Wilfull poverty, Vowed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity: and the Socinians, they labour to ſhew how Chriſt hath added to every precept of the Decalogue; and they begin with the firſt, that he hath added to it theſe things: 1. <hi>A command to prayer,</hi> whereas in the Old Teſtament, though Godly men did pray, yet (ſay they impudently) there was no command: and then Chriſt (ſay they) did not only command to pray, but gave a preſcript form of prayer. The ſecond thing added (ſay they) <hi>is to call upon Chriſt, as a Mediatour in our prayers,</hi> which they in the Old Teſtament did not. And thus they go on over all the Commandements, ſhewing what new things Chriſt hath added, <hi>Smal. refut. Theſ. pag.</hi> 228. But I have already ſhewed that Chriſt never added any morall duty which was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded before.</p>
               <p>The ſecond difference of the Papiſts, is, to make the Law and <note place="margin">2. That the Law and Goſpel are capable of no opoſite conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the Goſpel capable of no oppoſite conſiderarion, no not in any ſtrict ſenſe, but to hold both a Covenant of works, and that the Fathers under the Old Teſtament, and thoſe under the New, were both juſtified by fulfilling the Law of God. And herein lyeth that groſſe errour, whereby Chriſt and grace are evacuated. But the falſhood of this ſhall be evinced (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) when we ſpeak of the Law and Goſpelſtrictly, which the Papiſts, upon a dangerous errour, call the <hi>Old Law,</hi> and <hi>the New.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. That the Fathers that died under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, went not immed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Papiſts make a third difference, that under the Old Teſtament, the Fathers that dyed went not immediatly to heaven; therefore (ſay they) we do not ſay, Saint <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> or, Saint <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> but after Chriſts death then a way was opened for them and us: Hence is that ſaying, <hi>Sanguis Chriſti, eſt clavis Paradiſi,</hi> The blood of Chriſt, is the key of paradiſe: but this is ſufficiently confuted in the Popiſh controverſies.</p>
               <p>I come therefore to the Antinomian difference, and there I <note place="margin">3. Of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians.

Juſtification was not ſo much revealed, the vaile was not removed.</hi> What a weak reaſon is this? Did the leſſe, or more revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of free Juſtification make God juſtifie the leſſe freely? It had been a good argument to prove that the people of God in the Old Teſtament did not know this doctrine ſo clearly as thoſe in the New, but that God ſhould ſee the more or leſſe, becauſe of this, is a ſtrange Conſequence. The places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which he brings, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 14. would make more to the purpoſe of a Socinian, (that there is no pardon of ſin, and eternall life but under the Goſpel) rather then for the Antinomian: and one of his places he brings, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. maketh the contrary true; for there God promiſeth pardon of ſin, not to the beleevers under the Goſpel but to that reſidue of the Jews which God would bring back from captivity, as the context evidently ſheweth: ſo the place <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 17. how groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is it applyed unto the beleevers of the Goſpel only? for, had not the Godly under the Old Teſtament the Law written in their hearts? and had they not the ſame cauſe to take away their ſins <hi>(viz.</hi> Chriſts blood) as well as we under the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>His ſecond reaſon is, <hi>God ſaw ſin in them, becauſe they were children, that had need of a rod; but he ſees none in us, becauſe full grown heirs.</hi> What a ſtrange reaſon is this? for parents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſee leſs ſin in their children, while young, then when grown up: and their childiſhneſs doth more excuſe them. And although children only have a rod for their faults, yet men grown up they have more terrible puniſhments. Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle threatens beleevers that deſpiſe Chriſt, with puniſhment above thoſe that deſpiſed <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His third Reaſon is, <hi>becauſe they under the Law were under a School-maſter, therfore he ſeeth ſin in them, but none in us, being no longer under a School-maſter.</hi> But here is no ſolidity in this Reaſon: for firſt, the chiefeſt work of a School-maſter is to teach and guide; and ſo they are ſaid to be under the Law as a School-maſter, that ſo they may be prepared for Chriſt: and thus it is a good argument to Chriſtians under the Goſpel, that their lives ſhould be fuller of wiſdome and grown graces, then the Jewes; becauſe they are not under a School-maſter as children: As if one ſhould ſay to a young man, that is taken
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65695:130"/>
from the Grammar ſchool, and tranſplanted in the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he ſhould take heed he doth not ſpeak falſe Latine now, for he is not in a Grammar ſchoole now, but in an Univerſity. Thus you ſee, the chief notion of a School-maſter is to prepare and guide, his correcting is accidentall; yea, if we may believe <hi>Qintilian</hi> a maſter in this kinde, he is againſt the School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters beating of boyes, as that which would make them of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile diſpoſition. But <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth better rules. Grant therefore that this is to be underſtood of knocks and blows which they had, what can we ſay under the Goſpel, that we are children freed from the rod? Though we have not a Shool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, yet we have a father to correct us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5, 6, 7, 8. Do we not in that place finde a plain contradiction of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? For the Apoſtle doth there alleadge a place of the Old Teſtament, to us now under the Goſpel: And, certainly, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are as neceſſary to the godly now, as fire to the droſſy veſſell and filing to the ruſty iron. As the ſcourging and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the garment with a ſtick, beateth out the mothes and the duſt; ſo do troubles and adverſities corruptions from the children of God.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon why God ſaw ſin in them, war, <hi>Becauſe they were not made perfect according to the conſcience, Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 14. Who would not think that the author were ſome Papiſt, or Socinians? for if the text prove any thing to his purpoſe, it will evince that the godly then were made partakers of no more then a legall bodily cleanſing. But as for the place, that is miſerably arreſted; for the Apoſtle, his intent is to ſhew, that the godly then could not obtain righteouſneſs by any of thoſe ſacrifices, and therefore the good they enjoyed was from Chriſt the true ſacrifice: ſo that unleſs he will deny Chriſts blood to be effectuall and operative in the Old Teſtament, this reaſon muſt fall to the ground. Other reaſons he brings, which are to the ſame purpoſe, and therefore may eaſily be overthrown; as, that God ſaw no ſin in them, <hi>becauſe their preachers did not open the kingdome of heaven, but he ſeeth none in us, becauſe the leaſt of our Miniſters do bring us, into this Kingdome.</hi> Every-one may ſee the weakneſs here; for it ſuppoſeth that God did not ſo fully pardon and forgive, becauſe the doctrine of theſe things
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65695:131"/>
was not ſo clearly preached. If the Authors arguments had been, that Chriſt died not ſo fully for them, or that Chriſt his righteouſneſs was not ſo fully imputed unto them, then there had been ſome probability. Thus you ſee this falſe difference alſo. I do not medle with that opinion, Of ſeeing ſin in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, becauſe it is not the proper place.</p>
               <p>I find other differences between the Law and the Goſpel, made by another Antinomian, and they are in a Sermon upon the two Covenants of grace, where the Authour, hauing truely aſſerted, <hi>that God did tranſact with the Jewes in a Covenant of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. That the Covenant God made with the Iews &amp; this under the Goſpel are two diſtinct Covenants.</note> 
                  <hi>grace;</hi> yet he makes that Covenant, and this under the Goſpel, to be two diſtinct Covenants: <hi>They are not</hi> (ſaith hee, <hi>pag.</hi> 45.) <hi>one and the ſame Covenant diverſly adminiſtred, but they are two diſtinct Covenants:</hi> His arguments are, <hi>becauſe they are called Old and New:</hi> But thoſe names inforce no eſſentiall difference. The Commandment of love is called an old Commandment, and a new; yet it is the ſame for eſſence: ſo likewiſe the termes of a <note place="margin">3. That Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins under the Goſpel, not ſo under the law, becauſe no ſacrifice ſave for ſins of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> good, and better, do imply no more then a graduall difference in their excellency. But that which I ſhall eſpecially animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert upon, is, the differences he giveth between theſe two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of grace ſo really diſtinguiſhed, as he ſuppoſeth, and in this matter, the Authour ſpeaketh much error in a few lines.</p>
               <p>The firſt difference aſſigned by him is in reſpect of remiſſion of ſinnes; but he goeth on other grounds then the <hi>Hony-combe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Confut. 1. All Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were not only for ſins of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> doth. <hi>They had not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a plenary remiſſion of all ſorts of ſinnes: There were ſacrifices for ſinnes of ignorance, but notfor other ſinnes that were done preſumptuouſly: and if no ſacrifices were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, then conſequently no pardon obtained: but under the Goſpel, Chriſts blood cleanſeth from all ſin,</hi> pag. 54. Now here is an heape of falſhoods:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that all the legall ſacrifices were only for ſinnes of meer ignorance; (This is alſo an errour among Socinians) but <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. 2, 3. there is a ſacrifice appointed for him that ſhall lye, and ſweare falſly in detaining of his neighbours goods, and this could not be but a ſinne of knowledge. This is alſo aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed in <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. where the feaſt of expiation and atonement is made for all the ſinnes of the people, <hi>ver. 16. He ſhall make an atonement, becauſe of the uncleaneſs of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65695:131"/>
of Iſrael, and becauſe of their tranſgreſſions in all their ſinnes.</hi> So <hi>ver. 21. He ſhall confeſs over the live goat all the iniquities of the children of Iſrael, and all their tranſgreſſions in all their ſinnes.</hi> Thus <hi>ver. 30. that ye may be cleane from all your ſinnes before the Lord;</hi> &amp; <hi>ver. 34. This ſhall be an atonement for the children of Iſrael once a yeare for all their ſinns.</hi> Thus you ſee the Scripture ſpeakes plainly for all their ſinnes; yet the Antinomian ſpeakes as boldly, as if nothing were true; that there were ſacrifices for ſome ſorts of ſinnes only. So that you are wiſely to judge of ſuch books, and not beleeve every confident expreſſion. It's true the Apoſtle calls theſe ſinnes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 7. we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it <hi>errours;</hi> for the Apoſtle doth not meaneſinnes, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. but therefore are all ſinnes called, ſo becauſe <hi>omnis malus ignorat:</hi> There being no ſinne which doth not proceede from ſome errour in the practicall judgment? for although a man ſin wilfully and adviſedly, ſo that there is <hi>Nulla alia cauſa malitae niſi malitia,</hi> (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeakes of ſome of his ſinnes) yet there is even an errour in that mans conſcience.</p>
               <p>But in the ſecond place, grant, that there were no legall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices <note place="margin">2. No leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

How fooliſh then were <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> in ſuing out par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for their blood-guiltineſs, if there were no ſuch thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by God? How groſs is this errour? If this doctrine were true, then moſt of thoſe that are reckoned as godly in the Old Teſtament could have no pardon, becauſe many of them did fall into ſuch groſs ſins, for which there was no particular ſacrifice appointed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again under the New Teſtament, is there not the ſin <note place="margin">3. The ſin againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt under the Goſpel not cleanſed by Chriſts bloud.</note> againſt the holy Ghoſt for which no pardon is promiſed?

               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:65695:132"/>
                  <hi>But,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>under the Goſpel it is ſaid, the bloud of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> Now, if the Jews would have brought all their eſtates to have been admitted, to bring a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſuch or ſuch a ſin, they could not have done it. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what and if they could bring no ſacrifice, could they not therefore have pardon? Why then doth God proclaime him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them, <hi>a God gracious, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin?</hi> Why doth he, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. call upon Ieruſalem to repent of her whoredoms, murders, ſaying, <hi>If their ſins were as ſcarlet, they ſhould be made as white as ſnow.</hi> This errour is ſuch a dead fly, that it is enough to ſpoile the Authors whole box of oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides, was not that true ever ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, as well as under the Goſpel <hi>[Chriſts blood cleanſing from all ſin]</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how any but a Socinian will deny it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another difference that the Author makes about remiſſion <note place="margin">4. That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old Covenant, God gave not remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins to any, but upon ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; not ſo under the Goſpel.</note> of ſinnes to them, and us under the Goſpel, is as ſtrange, and falſe as the former: It is this, <hi>God did not give the grace of remiſſion of ſinnes to any under the old Covenant, but upon ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent conditions; they were to be at coſt for ſacrifices.</hi> (How doth this agree with his former reaſon, if he mean it univerſaly?) <hi>They were to confeſs their ſinnes to the Prieſts, yea, in ſome caſes to faſt: but now under the Goſpel there is no antecedent doing of any thing to the participation of the Covenant.</hi> But in this difference alſo there is much abſurd falſhood, and contradiction to himſelfe: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction (I ſay) for he bringeth <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. where God ſpeaks to the Church, that while ſhe was in her blood, he ſaid to her, <hi>Live;</hi> therefore there was no antecedent condition. But what man of reaſon doth not ſee that God ſpeaks there of the Church of the Iews, as appeareth through the whole Chapter? Therefore it makes ſtrongly againſt the Author, that ſhe had no preparations; ſo that other place, <hi>Iſa. 65. 1. I am found of them that ſought not for me;</hi> grant that it be a propheſie of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, yet was it not alſo true of the Iews, before God called them? Did the Iews firſt ſeek God, or God them? How often doth God tell them, that the good he did to them, was for his own names ſake, and not any thing in them?</p>
               <p>Again, if theſe things were required as antecedent qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in them for the remiſſion of ſins, then all thoſe argum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65695:132"/>
will hold true upon them, which they would faſten, as injuries to Chriſt and grace, upon us. <hi>If</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and humble our ſelves, and ſo have pardon, this is to caſt off Chriſt, this is to make an idoll of our owne righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Jews under the Old Teſtament might do all theſe things without blame: A Iew might ſay, My ſervices, my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, my prayers will do ſomething to the remiſſion of my ſinnes: but a Chriſtian may not. The Author urgeth alſo that place, <hi>While we were enemies, we were reconciled to God:</hi> but doth not this hold true of the Iews? Did they firſt make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves friends with God? What is this but to hold the doctrine of free-will and works in the time of the Law; and the doctrine of grace under the new only? As for faith, whether that be a condition or not, I ſhall not here meddle: only this is plain, it was required of them under the old Covenant, in the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as it is of us now.</p>
               <p>A third difference made as to remiſſion of ſinnes, is this: <hi>Their remiſſion of ſinnes was</hi> gradatim, <hi>ſucceſſively, drops by drops.</hi> If a <note place="margin">5 That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law was ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively and imperfect, under the Goſpel at once and perfect.</note> man had ſinned, and offered ſacrifice, then that ſinne was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; but this did not extend to future ignorance, that was not pardoned till a new ſacrifice. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>there was a remembrance of ſinne;</hi> but <hi>Chriſt by one ſacrifice once offered, hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> To this I anſwer, 1. That this difference grew upon this ſuppoſition, as if the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice offered did by it's own vertue take away ſinne. For, if we ſuppoſe (as we muſt) that Chriſt the true ſacrifice was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in every ſacrifice, and all the vertue and benefit to come from Chriſts bloud, and not the bloud of the ſacrifices, then could that take away all ſinnes as well as ſome ſinnes: unleſs the Author were a Socinian, denying the efficacy of Chriſts blood, at all, under the Old Teſtament, he can never expedite himſelfe from this.</p>
               <p>Again, this contradicts themſelves; for the reaſon why they ſay, faith doth not juſtifie, but evidence and declare it only, is, becauſe Gods love and free grace to juſtifie, is from all eternity, and therefore no ſins paſt, or future, can hinder this. Now I ask, whether God did not juſtifie <hi>David,</hi> and the ungodly in thoſe dayes from all eternity, (as they ſpeak) and if he did, why
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65695:133"/>
ſhould not all their ſins be remitted fully once, as well as the ſins of beleevers under the Goſpel? Certainly, the Apoſtle brings <hi>David</hi> for an inſtance of juſtification and remiſſion of ſins, as well under the New Teſtament, which doth ſuppoſe that we are juſtified, and have our ſins pardoned in the like manner.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, let me ſet one Antinomian to overthrow another, for one of that way brings many arguments to prove that we are juſtified, and ſo have all our ſins done away before we beleeve. Now, if all ſins are done away, then there is no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive remiſſion. Well then, you ſhall obſerve moſt of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hold for the beleevers under the old Teſtament, as well as New; for they are elected as well as we, God laid their ſins, upon Chriſt as well as ours: if God love us to day, and hate us to morrow, let <hi>Arminians</hi> heare and wonder why they ſhould be blamed that ſay, <hi>We may love God to day, and hate him to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> Now all theſe reaſons will fall foul upon this Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian whoſe errour I confute, and he much neceſſarily hold, that the godly had but halfe pardons, yea, that they were loved one day, and hated the next.</p>
               <p>Again, conſider that the place of the Apoſtle urged by him for his errour, <hi>viz. Chriſt offering himſelfe once for all, to perfect thoſe that are ſanctified,</hi> is of a perpetuall truth ever ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall: and it was as efficacious to thoſe before his death, as after; therefore he is called <hi>a Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world,</hi> although the Socinians would pervert and wreſt that place.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I deny that even under the Goſpel that all ſins are forgiven to the juſtified perſon at once. He is indeed put into a ſtate of juſtification, whereby no condemnation will fall upon him, yet his ſins are not forgiven before they are committed and repented of. And for this purpoſe we pray for the daily pardon of them, which is not to be underſtood of the meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration or aſſurance of the pardon, but for the pardon it ſelf. But this ſhall be on purpoſe ſpoken to in the matter of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The forenamed Author hath ſome other differences, but they are confuted already for the ſubſtance of them.</p>

               <p>WE have confuted the falſe differences, and now come to lay down the true, between the Law and the Goſpel, taken in a larger ſenſe.</p>
               <p>And, firſt, <hi>you muſt know that the difference is not eſſentiall,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law and the Goſpel is not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, but accidentall only.</note> 
                  <hi>or ſubſtantiall, but accidentall:</hi> ſo that the diviſion of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Covenant into the Old, and New, is not a diviſion of the <hi>Genus</hi> into it's oppoſite <hi>Species;</hi> but of the ſubject, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it's ſeverall accidentall adminiſtrations, both on Gods part, and on mans. It is true, the Lutheran Divines, they do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly oppoſe the Calviniſts herein, maintaining the Covenant given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be a Covenant of works, and ſo directly contrary to the Covenant of grace. Indeed, they acknowledge that the Fathers were juſtified by Chriſt, and had the ſame way of ſalvation with us; only they make that Covenant of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be a ſuperadded thing to the Promiſe, holding forth a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perfect righteouſneſs unto the Iews, that they might be convinced of their own folly in their ſelf-righteouſneſs. But, I think, it is already cleared, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Covenant, was a Covenant of grace: &amp; the right unfolding the word <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> doth eaſily take away that difference which ſeemeth to be among the Learned in this point; for, certainly, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iews did not reſt in the Sacrifices, or Sacramenrs, but by faith did really enjoy Chriſt in them, as well as wee in ours. Chriſt was figured by the Mercy-ſeat: Now, as both the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims looked to that, ſo both the people of the Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did eye and look to Chriſt. For although Chriſt had not
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65695:134"/>
aſſumed our fleſh then, yet the fruit and benefit of his incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was then communicated, becauſe of the decree and promiſe of God, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This difference is more particularly ſeen, in reſpect of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heavenly obiects more clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the N. Te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtament, then in the Old.</note>

The ſumm of all heavenly doctrine is reduced to theſe three heads: <hi>credenda,</hi> things to be beleeved: <hi>ſperanda,</hi> things to be hoped for: <hi>&amp; facienda,</hi> things to be done.</p>
               <p>Now, if you conſider the objects of faith, or things to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, <note place="margin">1. It is ſo for the <hi>credenda.</hi>
                  </note> they were more obſcurely delivered to them: The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, the Incarnation of Chriſt, and the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, theſe things were but in a dark manner delivered, yet, according to the meaſure of that light then held forth, they were bound to beleeve thoſe things: ſo that, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had a vail upon him, thus alſo his doctrine had; and, as the knowledge we have here is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, in reſpect of that in the New.</p>
               <p>As it is thus for the <hi>credenda,</hi> things to be beleeved, ſo it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <note place="margin">2. For the <hi>speranda.</hi>
                  </note> for the <hi>ſperanda,</hi> things hoped for. The opinion of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians and others is very wicked, which makes them before Chriſt, only to hope in temporall good things, and the notion of the Papiſts obſerving that the Church under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> but never <hi>Synagoge;</hi> &amp; the meeting of the Jews, called always <hi>Synagoge,</hi> but never <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> doth ſuppoſe that the Jews were gathered together as ſo many beaſts, rather then called together as men. But this notion is judged falſe; and they inſtance <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. and <hi>James</hi> 2. where the Church of the Chriſtians is called <hi>Synagoge;</hi> although <hi>Cameron, Praelect. de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. pag.</hi> 66. doth induſtriouſly labour to prove that the Apoſtles did purpoſely abſtain from the word <hi>Synagoge</hi> in reference to Chriſtians: but his reaſon is not that the Papiſts urge, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the good things promiſed were for the moſt part tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and carnal, yet theſe figured ſpirituall and heavenly. It's <hi>Auſtins</hi> obſervation, ſhewing that the Jews ſhould firſt be allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65695:134"/>
by temporal mercies, and afterwards the Chriſtians by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: As, ſaith he, firſt that which is animal, and then that which is ſpiritual: The firſt man was of the earth, earthly; the ſecond man was of heaven, heavenly: Thus we may ſay of the Jew and the Chriſtian, That which was animal was firſt, and then that which is ſpiritual. Hence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16. <hi>Abraham</hi> and others are ſaid to <hi>ſeek an heavenly country;</hi> ſo that although it be true which <hi>Auſtine</hi> (as I remember) ſaid, <hi>though you look over the whole book of the Old Teſtament, yet you ſhall never find the kingdome of heaven mentioned there:</hi> yet we ſee <hi>David</hi> making God his portion, and profeſſing that he hath nothing in heaven but him, which argueth, that they looked farther then meer out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies. Theſe good things promiſed to the Jews were figurative, ſo that as a man conſiſteth of a ſoul and body, thus alſo doth the promiſes; there is the kernel and the ſhell: but the Jews, for the moſt part, looked only to the outward. Hence Chriſt, when he opened thoſe things to his Diſciples, did like a kind father, that breaketh the ſhell, and giveth the kernel to his children.</p>
               <p>In the third place, there are <hi>facienda,</hi> things to be done. Now <note place="margin">3. For the <hi>facienda.</hi>
                  </note> although it be true, (as I have proved) that Chriſt hath added no new command to the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and whatſoever is a ſin now in moral things, was alſo then; yet the doctrine of theſe things was not ſo full, penetrating, and clear as now under the Goſpel. There is a dangerous book, called, <hi>The Practicall Catechiſme,</hi> that venteth much Socinian poyſon, and in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, among other things, that Chriſt added to the Law, and perfected it, filled up ſome vacuities in it; Certainly, the Law of God being perfect, and to which nothing muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, cannot be ſaid to have vacuities in it; and Chriſt is ſaid to fill the Law, in reſpect of the Phariſees, who by their corrupt gloſſes had evacuated it. And one of his reaſons, which he brings to prove his aſſertion, makes moſt againſt him, <hi>viz. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, &amp;c.</hi> This maketh againſt him, becauſe our Saviour doth not ſay. <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Law and the Prophets;</hi> (which he muſt have ſaid, if his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion were true) but, <hi>of the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> who had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65695:135"/>
the text with their falſe gloſſes. I will not conſider his other reaſons; for they are ſo weak, that he ſeemeth to be afraid of them: And, certainly, it would be ſtrange Divinity, to ſay, that a Jew might have luſted after a woman in his heart, and not have ſinned; but now it would be ſin in a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond particular difference is in reſpect of the meaſure of grace.</hi> Hence the Scripture ſpeakes, as if they had under the Old <note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily greater in the Goſpel, then under the Law.</note> Teſtament none at all, meerly becauſe there was not ſuch a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull effuſion of his Spirit upon them: not but that if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſome particular perſons, they might have ſuch degrees of grace, that few under the Goſpel can be compared unto them, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> but this was not according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſpenſation of his graces then: So that as one ſtarre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from another in glory, thus did the Church of the Jewes, from that of Chriſtians. They had drops, but we have the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; they had glimmerings, but we have the ſun it ſelfe. Now, as theſe are priviledges, ſo they are alſo great engagements for more eminent knowledge, and holineſs then was in thoſe dayes. But all that the Prophets reproved in their people, ignorance, ſelfe confidence, reſting upon externall duties, &amp;c. the ſame may we in our hearers <note place="margin">The Iews under the Law were in a more ſervile condition, then Chriſtians under the Goſpel.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Their condition was more ſervile. All things did preſs more to fear, and bondage, then now among us. Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 30. compareth their condition to the ſons of the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman. Hence <hi>Auſtine</hi> makes <hi>Timor,</hi> and <hi>Amor,</hi> the difference of the two Teſtaments; God met man ſinning in the Law, as he did <hi>Adam,</hi> with terrour, charging ſin upon him; but under the Goſpel, as the father did the prodigall ſon, coming home to him. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. this difference conſidered by <hi>Paul,</hi> Yee are not come to Mount Sinai, &amp;c. Only you muſt rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this. The Jewes had a two fold conſideration; one, as being ſervile, and another of them, as ſonnes, but under age: ſo that they were not wholly excluded from the Spirit of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: yea, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the Promiſes, and Adoption did belong unto thom;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> doth appropriate God unto himſelfe as his God, in his prayer, which argued he had the Spirit of Adoption, inabling him to call, Abba, Father. Now,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65695:135"/>
as they were more obnoxious to an inward bondage, ſo they were under an outward bondage alſo, oppoſite unto which is that Chriſtian liberty <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of, whereby the yoke of all thoſe ceremonious burdens is taken off them; and <hi>Paul</hi> doth vehemently and fervidly diſpute againſt thoſe that would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce them.</p>
               <p>In the aſſerting of this difference, one ſcruple is to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which is this, <hi>How could the Jewes be ſaid to be in more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude then the Chriſtians;</hi> meerly becauſe of thoſe ceremonies and ſacrifices? for, ſeeing they were commanded by God, and had ſpirituall ſignifications, they did thereby become helpes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their faith, and were exerciſes of their piety. As under the Goſpel none can ſay that the Sacraments are a burden, and tend to bondage, becauſe they are viſible ſignes: But rather God doth hereby condeſcend in his great love unto us for, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerveth, if wee had been incorporeall, God would not then have appointed viſible Sacraments, (no more then he doth to Angels) but now conſiſting of ſoul and body, he doth inſtitute ſome things in an accommodated way to helpe us, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our faith.</p>
               <p>But this may be anſwered, that although they were ſpirituall in ſignification, yet they being many, and requiring much bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily labour, they could not be obſerved without much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and therefore no prieſt, or Levite, that was ſpiritually mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in thoſe dayes, but would rather chooſe to exerciſe the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery under the Goſpel, then to buſie himſelf in the killing of beaſts, and fleaing of them, which was their duty to do. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well did <hi>Austine</hi> obſerve the love of God in appointing for us Sacraments, fewer in number, eaſier in obſervation, and more cleare in ſignification. Again, thoſe bodily exerciſes did rather fit thoſe that were children, and were more convenient to that low condition, then unto the full age of the Church: and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, though they be an help, yet they ſuppoſe ſome imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity in the ſubject: therefore in heaven there ſhall be none at all. Only take notice, that Popery, having introduced ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ceremonious obſervations, and ſuch a multitude of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precepts, hath made the times of the Goſpel to be the times of none-age again. This alſo diſcovereth that ſuch are not ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65695:136"/>
that delight in ceremoniall wayes: and the more men fix their heart upon ſenſible obſervations, the leſs they partake of ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>I will inſtance but in a fourth (becauſe theſe differences are given by moſt that treate on this ſubject) and that ſhall be the <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the Law was to laſt, but till the coming of Chriſt.</note> continuance and abode of it. The Law, in that Moſaicall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, was to indure but till Chriſt the fulneſs came; and then, as the ſcaffolds are pulled down when the houſe is built, ſo were all thoſe externall ordinances to be aboliſhed, when Chriſt himſelfe came. A candle is ſuperfluous when the ſun appeareth. A School-maſter is not neceſſary to thoſe that have obtained perfect knowledge. Milke is not comely for thoſe who live on ſolid meat. The chaff preſerves the corn, but when the corn is gathered, the chaff is thrown away. And when the fruit commeth, the flower falleth to the ground And in this ſenſe the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. doth argue againſt it, ſaying, it could bring nothing to perfection, Neither could any of thoſe purifications work any good and ſpiritual effect. It beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therefore that a Chriſt ſhould be exhibited, which would work all thoſe ſpirituall mercies for us, Hence had there been no farther proceeding, but we muſt alwaies have ſtayed in ſuch offerings, and ſacrifices, it had been impoſſible for ever that God ſhould have been pleaſed with us. It is therefore in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that it was to be antiquated, and a better covenant to come in the room of it. The Apoſtle calleth thoſe things, <hi>Heb. 10. a ſhadow:</hi> Now a ſhadow, that doth ſhew a man, but yet the ſhadow, that doth not live, or eate, or ſpeak: ſo thoſe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices they ſhadowed out Chriſt, but yet they could not exhibite the reall benefits by Chriſt. As <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſent his ſervant with a ſtaff to raiſe up the Shunamites ſon, but he could doe nothing; then cometh the Prophet himſelf, and raiſeth him up: ſo it's here, <hi>Moſes</hi> was like the Prophets ſervant, he went with a ſtaff to raiſe up thoſe dead in ſin, but could not do it without Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Here may be one Queſtion made upon theſe things, and that is, <hi>Why God appointed ſuch various and different adminiſtrations?</hi> This providence of God became a rock to the Marcionites, and Manichees, inſomuch that they denyed the ſame God to be Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65695:136"/>
of both the Teſtaments. To anſwer this; certainly God, if he pleaſed, could have as clearly revealed Chriſt, and poured out his pirit, giving eternall life as plentifully under the Law, as under the Goſpel. But to aske why he did thus, would be as preſumptuous and arrogant, as to aske, why he created the world no ſooner. If the School-maſter teach the new beginner in another way, then he doth the proficient in ſtudy, no man doth blame his wiſedom. As in the Paſchall Lamb, they were to eate the fleſh, but to throw away the bones; ſo in all matters of religion, thoſe things that are revealed and profitable we may feed upon, and whatſoever is abſtruſe and difficult, we may let goe. <hi>Praeſtat per Deum neſcire, quia ipſe non revelaverit; quàm per hominem ſcire, quia ipſe praeſumpſerit,</hi> Tert. de Anima. <note place="margin">Difference between the Law ſtrictly taken and the Goſpel ſtrictly taken.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now, to conclude, I come to give the difference between the Law ſtrictly taken, as requiring exact and perfect obedience, promiſing eternall life upon no other termes: and the Goſpel ſtrictly taken, as a ſolemne promulgation of Chriſt, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to a broken ſinner.</p>
               <p>And the firſt is this, <hi>The Law in ſome meaſure of it is made</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. The Law in ſome meaſure is known by the light of Nature, but the truth of the Goſpel muſt be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God.</note> 
                  <hi>knowne by naturall light, and ſo agreeable to a naturall conſcience.</hi> I ſay in ſome meaſure; for there is much of the duty of the Law that is unknown to naturall conſciences, yet the moſt externall and outward duties are knowne, and accordingly, as the truth of them is diſcerned by naturall light, ſo the will doth joyne with them as good to be done (though not in a godly way.) <hi>But it is otherwiſe with the Goſpel, for the very truth of it muſt be wholy revealed by God, ſo that no naturall acumen in the world, could ever excogitate this wonderfull remedy, of juſtification and ſalvation by Chriſt.</hi> And as it is thus above knowledg, ſo the heart is more averſe from this way.</p>
               <p>And by this you may ſee, why it is ſuch an hard thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; why the people of God are ſo hardly perſwaded, when loaden with guilt, to roule their ſoules upon Chriſt. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorris, there is nothing in his natural conſcience to further him in this duty. Preſs a man againſt murder, theft, adultery; here is naturall conſcience joyning for this duty: but urge him to beleeve, this is altogether above nature. Hence it is alſo, that naturally we ſeek to be juſtified by the works we do; ſo that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65695:137"/>
to be juſtified by faith is another way, then corrupted nature in us, or right nature in <hi>Adam</hi> would have inclined unto, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let not the people of God be ſo diſcouraged in their ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and combats about their unbeliefe: Let them know, that a little degree of faith is of great conſequence. And if he ſaid, that Chriſti anity was <hi>perpetua naturae violentia,</hi> a perpetuall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to nature, this is moſt ſure in a matter of faith. We are as froward in rejecting of a promiſe, as ſtubborn in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing of a command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond difference is in the object matter: The Law holdeth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The Law requires perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: the Goſpel brings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don through Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>forth a perfect righteouſneſs, and will not admit of any other; but the Goſpel, that condeſcends, and brings pardon through Chriſt.</hi> And this is the maine difference, and in which they can never be made one. Now the Papiſts, Arminian, Socinian, and others do overthrow this grand and maine difference holding juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by works under ſome notion, or other: whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle maketh an immediate oppoſition, <hi>If of faith, then not of works.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not diſtinguiſh of works of nature, and works of grace, or works of grace perfect imperfect: but ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth abſolutely, &amp; ſo doth alſo exclude that ſubtile opinion, of making faith to juſtifie as a work; for the Apoſtle, making an oppoſition between faith and works, muſt neceſſarily take faith under ſuch a notion, as cannot be a work. And this truth is that which is the pillar of the Church of God, and that which differenceth us from Jews, Turks, Papiſts, and many Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third difference is from the manner of obtaining the good</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. If righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs were by the Law, etern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life were a debt, but the Goſpel holds it forth as Gods meere indulgence.</note> 
                  <hi>thing promiſed: He that ſhall obtain eternall life by the Law, hath it of debt, and by way of juſtice, Rom.</hi> 4. 4. Not as if <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency could have merited at Gods hands; or as if God became in ſtrict juſtice a debtor; ſeeing <hi>Adam</hi> was behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for all: but in ſome ſenſe it would have been ſo. Hence boaſting would not then have been excluded: eternall life being the reward of thoſe holy works, which he ſhould have done, but <hi>now all is of grace, through Chriſt; our righteouſneſs is meerly Gods indulgence: not the holineſs that is in us, but the ſinn pardoned makes us acceptable.</hi> So that the broken contrite heart can never ſufficiently admire the grace and goodneſs of God in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65695:137"/>
the Goſpel-way: And no marvell if ſo be that <hi>Paul</hi> is ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently raviſhed with the conſiderations thereof. This may well be caIled good newes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> And if our hearts were ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually affected, we ſhould ſay, <hi>How beautifull are the feet of thoſe that bring theſe glad tydings?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth difference is in reſpect of the ſubject: The Law, ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. The Law is only for thoſe that have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nature the Goſpel. for broken-hearted ſinners.</note> 
                  <hi>taken, is only for thoſe who have a perfect and holy nature:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's a Covenant, (as you heard) of friendſhip, and not of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, ſo that there is no neceſſity of any Mediatour. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there is good uſe of urging it to proud Phariſaicall men, to bring them out of love with themſelves; to groſs ſinners, that their hearts might be broken, ſeeing the curſes belong to them; yea, to the godly alſo, to teach them the faire copy they are to write after: but, in reſpect of juſtification by it, and eternall life, there is none can have that benefit but ſuch who ſhall be found perfectly holy: It was not <hi>Moſes,</hi> but the ſerpent that did heale; ſo it is not the Law, but Chriſt that can comfort bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearts ſtung with ſin. The Prieſt, and the Levite they paſs by, not pitying of him. <hi>But now the Subject to whom the Goſpel is given, is a broken hearted ſinner, one that feeleth himſelfe ready to be covered over with all confuſion, one that lyeth wounded in conſcience, crying for ſome oyle to be poured into his wounds.</hi> Oh! what miſerable comforters then muſt all Popiſh and Socinian Doctors be, who will adviſe the ſinfull tempted man to ſeek out works for the Law, which is as uncomfortable, as to bid a ſick diſeaſed man get ſome of the Philoſophers ſtone, or to eat a piece of a Phoenix, and then, and not till then, he ſhall be in eaſe?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>The Law differeth in the forme of it from the Goſpel: The</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. The Law conditional. the Goſpel abſolute.</note> 
                  <hi>Law is conditionall, but the Goſpel abſolute.</hi> I find this Queſtion a very troubleſome one, <hi>Whether the Goſpel be abſolute or no? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel be a doctrine of works? Whether it hath precepts, or thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atnings?</hi> Now the meaning of this Queſtion is not, <hi>Whether the Goſpel be ſo abſolute that it requireth not faith as a condition:</hi> Or <hi>Whether it be ſo abſolute, as that it excludeth all repentance and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;</hi> he is an infant in Scripture that thinketh ſo: But, <hi>Whether the Gospel doth promiſe eternall life to a man for any dignity, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, merit, work, or any diſpoſition in us under any diſtinction or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65695:138"/>
whatſoever; or only to faith apprehending Chriſt.</hi> Now the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that if we take the Goſpel largly, for the doctrine of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, there is no queſtion, but they preſſed duty of mortification &amp; ſanctification, threatning thoſe that do not ſo: but if you take the Goſpel ſtrictly, then it holdeth forth nothing but remiſſion of ſins through Chriſt, not requiring any other duty as a condition, or uſing any threatning words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. But then it may be demanded, To which is repentance reduced? Is it a duty of the Law, or a duty of the Goſpel? Of the Law ſtrictlytaken, it cannot be, becauſe that admitteth none. Muſt it not therefore be of the Goſpel? And I find in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, different either expreſſions or opinions, and generally the Lutheran Divines do oppoſe the Antinomians upon this very ground, that the Goſpel is not a Sermon of repentance, nor doth exhort thereunto; but it muſt be had from the Law, which doth prepare them for Chriſt. I ſhall therefore, becauſe this was the foundation of Antinomianiſme, and it had it's riſe from hence, handle the next day this Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Goſpel doth command repentance, or no.</hi> Or, <hi>Whether it be only from the Law.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The word</hi> [Repentance,] <hi>is taken ſometimes largely, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Repentance ſtrictly taken, is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Faith.</note>

Thus, <hi>they repented not, that they might beleeve;</hi> and faith and repentance are put together, Now all the while a man hath
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65695:138"/>
trouble and ſorrow for ſin, without faith, it is like the body without the ſoul; yea, it carrieth a man with <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> into the very pit of diſpair; when a man ſeeth how much is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and not how much is for him, it cannot but cruſh, and weigh him down to the ground. The tears of repentance are like thoſe waters, very bitter, till Chriſt ſweeten them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider this, that the Law was never meerly and ſolely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, nor yet the Goſpel, but they are twins, that are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Law and the Goſpel are inſeperably united in the Word and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</note> 
                  <hi>united in the Word and Miniſtery.</hi> Howſoever ſtrictly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, there is a vaſt gulf of oppoſition between each other; yet in their uſe they become exceeding ſubſervient, and helpfull mutually. It is not good for the Law to be alone, nor yet the Goſpel. Now the old Antinomians, they taught repentance by the Goſpel only, that ſo the Law might be wholly excluded. thus they did not conſider what uſefull ſubſerviencie they had to one another. The Law directeth, commandeth, and humbleth: The Goſpel, that comforteth, refreſheth, and ſupporteth. And it is a great wiſedom in a Chriſtian, when he hath an eye upon both. Many are caſt down, becauſe they only conſider the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Law, and their inability thereunto: on the other ſide, ſome grow ſecure and looſe, by attending to free-grace only. I do acknowledge, that free-grace will melt the heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to kindneſs, and the fire will melt, as well as the hammer bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into pieces; but yet, even this cannot be done, without ſome uſe of the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Therefore, being there is ſuch a neer linck between both theſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Faith and Repentance are wrought both by the Law and the Goſpel.</note> 
                  <hi>in their practicall uſe, we need not, with ſome learned men, make two Commandements of the Goſpel only; to wit, the command to</hi> beleeve, <hi>and the other command to</hi> repent: <hi>neither need we, with others, make theſe commands Appendices to the Goſpel. but conclude thus, that, ſeeing Faith and Repentance have ſomething initial in them, and ſomething conſummative in them, therefore they are both wrought by Law and Goſpel alſo:</hi> ſo that, as they ſay there is a legal repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and an evangelical; ſo we may ſay, there is a legal faith, which conſiſts in believing of the threatnings, &amp; the terrours of the Lord; and there is an evangelical faith, which is in applying of Chriſt in the Promiſes. So that legal faith, and repentance, may be called ſo initially; and when it is evangelical, it may
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65695:139"/>
be ſaid to be conſummate. If therefore you aske, <hi>Whether Faith and Repentance be by the Law, or by the Goſpel;</hi> I anſwer, It is by both and that theſe muſt not be ſeperated one from the other in the command of theſe duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hence, fourthly, unbeliefe is a ſin againſt the Law, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vnbeliefe a ſin againſt the Law, as well as the Goſpel.</note> 
                  <hi>the Gospel.</hi> Indeed the Goſpel, that doth manifeſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the object of juſtifying faith, but the Law condemneth him that doth not believe in him: therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Law is ſaid to bear witneſs of Chriſt, and to accuſe the Jews for refuſing the Meſſias. The Law, that requireth belief in whatſoever God ſhall reveal: The Goſpel that makes known Chriſt; and then the Law, is as it were, enlightened by the Goſpel, doth faſten a command upon us to beleeve in Chriſt. This is true, if you take the Law ſtrictly and ſeperately from <hi>Moſes</hi> his adminiſtration of it: but if you take it largely, as it was delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> then faith in Chriſt was immediately commanded there, though obſcurely, becauſe (as is proved) it was a Covenant of grace. You ſee then, that as in the transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, there was Chriſt, and <hi>Moſes</hi> together in glory; ſo likewiſe may the Law, and the Goſpel be together in their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and it is through our folly, when we make them practically to hinder one another.</p>
               <p>Though all this be true, yet if the Goſpel be taken ſtrictly, it <note place="margin">The Goſpel taken ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends no more then the glad tidings of a Saviour.</note> is not a doctrine of repentance, or holy works; but a meere gracious promiſe of Chriſt to the broken heart for ſin; and doth comprehend no more then the glad tydings of a Saviour. It is true, learned men do ſometimes ſpeak otherwiſe, calling Faith and repentance the two Evangelicall commands, but then they uſe the word more largely, for the doctrine of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, but in a ſtrict ſenſe its only a promiſe of Chriſt, and his benefits: And in this ſenſe we may ſay, the Goſpel doth not terrifie, or accuſe. Indeed there are wofull threatnings to him that rejecteth Chriſt; yea more ſevere then to him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <hi>Moſes,</hi> but this ariſeth from the Law joyned in practicall uſe with the Goſpel. And in this ſenſe alſo it is ſaid to be <hi>the ſavour of death unto many.</hi> This ariſeth not from the nature of the Goſpel, but from the Law, that is enlightened by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: ſo that he being already condemned by the Law, for not
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65695:139"/>
beleeving in Chriſt, he needeth to be condemned again by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>If you ſay, May not the ſufferings of Chriſt make us to repent of ſin, and all the love he ſhewed therein? Do not godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to work people into an hatred of ſin, tell them the price of blood is in every ſin committed? Is it not ſaid, <hi>that they ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn for their ſins?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, all this is true, but then theſe things work by way of an object, not as a command; and it is from the Law, that we ſhould ſhew our ſelves kind unto him who loved us unto death; ſo that the object is indeed from the Goſpel, but the command, to be affected with his death, becauſe of his kindneſs therein manifeſted, doth ariſe from Gods Law: Let therefore thoſe who ſay, that the preaching of the Goſpel will humble men, and break their hearts for their ſins, conſider how that it is true, by the Goſpel as an object, by the Law, as that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſuch affections to thoſe objects.</p>
               <p>Let the uſe of this doctrine be, to direct Chriſtians in their practicall improvement of Law and Goſpel, without hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring each other. There are many things in Chriſtianity that the people of God make to oppoſe one another, when yet they would promote each other, if wiſely ordered. Thus they make their joy and trembling, their faith, and repentance, their zeal and prudence, the Law and Goſpel to thwart one another; whereas by ſpiritual wiſdom they might unite them: take the Law for a goad, the Goſpel for a cordial: from the one be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, from the other be ſupported: when thy heart is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and dull, run thither to be excited; when thy ſoul is deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fearfull, throw thy ſelf into the armes of the Goſpel. The Law hath a lovelineſs in it as well as the Goſpel: the one is a pure character and Image of the holineſs of God; the other is of the mercy and goodneſs of God; ſo that the conſideration of either may wonderfully inflame thy affections and raiſe them up.</p>

               <p>AS the Phyſitian, (ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr)</hi> who intends to give ſtrong phyſick which may expell noxious humours in the diſeaſed body, doth prepare the body firſt by ſome poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make it fluid and fit for operation: ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> being ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accuſe the Jews, and to drive them out of their ſelfe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, doth manifeſt his love to them, ſugaring the bitter pill that they might ſwallow it with more delight, And this his love is manifeſted, partly by his expreſſion <hi>[brethren,]</hi> partly by his affections and prayers <hi>[my hearts deſire and prayer.]</hi> The occaſion of this his affection is the zeale that they have for God, but in a wrong way: As the skillfull husbandman, that ſeeth a piece of ground full of weeds, and brambles, wiſheth he had that ground, which by culture and tillage would be made very fruitfull. <hi>Amo unde amputem,</hi> ſaid the Orator, <hi>I love the wit that needs ſome pruning.</hi> The luxuriancie is a ſigne of fertility.</p>
               <p>This zeale was not a good zeale, partly becauſe it wanted knowledge, and therefore was like <hi>Sampſon</hi> without his eyes: <note place="margin">Zeal that either wants knowledge, or puffs up, no good zeale.</note> partly becauſe it made them proud, which the Apoſtle fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth in two particulars: 1, <hi>They ſought to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſs. They ſought,</hi> this did imply their willfull pride and arrogancy, and <hi>to eſtabliſh,</hi> which ſuppoſeth their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was weak and infirme, ready to fall to the ground: but they would ſet it up for all that, as the Philiſtims would their Dagon, though he was tumbled downe before the Ark. 2. The Apoſtle expreſſeth it ſignally, when he ſaith, <hi>They ſubmitted not themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God;</hi> In the originall, <hi>They were
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65695:140"/>
not ſubmitted,</hi> in the paſſive ſignification, which ſtill ſuppoſeth the great arrogancy that is in a man naturally, being unwilling to deny his owne righteouſneſs, and to take Chriſt for all. This being ſo, take notice by the way of a foule errour of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian, who denying aſſurance and comfort by ſignes of grace, laboureth to prove, that an unregenerate man may have univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall obedience, and ſincere obedience, bringing this inſtance of the Jews for ſincere obedience.</p>
               <p>But ſincerity may be taken two waies: Firſt, as it oppoſeth <note place="margin">Sincerity taken two waies.</note> groſs hypocriſie, and ſo indeed the Jews zeale was not hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall, becauſe they did not goe againſt their conſcience: or, Secondly, it may be taken as it oppoſeth the truth of grace, and ſo the Jews zeale was not a true gracious zeale for the reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove named. Now my Text, that is given as a reaſon, why the Jews did look to their owne righteouſneſs, &amp; not that of Gods, becauſe they neglected Chriſt, who is here ſaid to be the end of the Law for righteouſneſs. The word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> what it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth.</note> 
                  <hi>the extreme and laſt end of a thing:</hi> Thus <hi>Mark. 13. 7. The end is not yet;</hi> ſo thoſe who are againſt the calling of the nation of the Jews, bring that place, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. ver. 16. <hi>Wrath is come upon them</hi>

                  </gap>, as if there were no mercy to be expected. But this may admit of another expoſition. Sometimes the word is uſed for <hi>perfection and fullfilling of a thing,</hi> acording to the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>if it fullfill the Law? So James 2. 8. If you fullfill the royall Law.</hi> In this ſenſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> called the ſoul <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>as that which did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi> And the ſacrifices before marriage, which was the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of that neer bond, or becauſe of the coſt then beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law.</hi> Therefore I think, this is a great part of the meaning here, <hi>Chriſt is the end,</hi> that is, the perfection, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law. Yet, I ſhall take in alſo the end of intention, or a ſcope, unto which the Law-giver aimed when he gave the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65695:141"/>
Law: and this will be ſhewed in the particulars; The doctrine is, <hi>That Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every beleever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the opening of this conſider, 1. That an <hi>end</hi> may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either for that of <hi>conſumption</hi> and <hi>abolition;</hi> or for that of <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>confirming: Finis interficiens,</hi> and <hi>finis perficiens,</hi> as <hi>Auſtine</hi> called it. Now, in the former ſenſe, Chriſt was the end of the Ceremoniall Law: the end aboliſhing; although that was alſo an end of perfection to them: and ſo ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the Ceremoniall Law, &amp; the Propheſies: They all ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out Chriſt, and ended in him. And this indeed is a truth, but it is not pertinent to the ſcope of the Apoſtle, who ſpeaketh of ſuch a Law, that the Jews expected righteouſneſs by in the performing of it; which muſt be the Morall Law only.</p>
               <p>Now, when we ſpeak of the Morall Law, having Chriſt for the end of it, then in the ſecond place that may be conſidered two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either <hi>rigidly, and in an abſtracted conſideration from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Law, as it is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in the abſtract, ſo Chriſt is not the end thereof, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be by accident.</note> 
                  <hi>of it, as it doth require perfect obedience, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe that have it not:</hi> now in this ſenſe Chriſt cannot be the ſcope, or end of the Law, but it is meerly by accident, &amp; oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionall, that a ſoul abaſed and condemned by the Law doth ſeek out for a Chriſt: only you muſt know, that the Law even ſo taken doth not exclude a Chriſt. It requireth indeed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs of our own; yet if we bring the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſurety, though this be not commanded by the Law, yet it is not againſt the Law, or excluded by it; otherwiſe it would have been unjuſtice in God to have accepted of Chriſt our ſurety for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Or elſe the Law may be taken in a more large way for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it by Moſes, in all the particulars of it;</hi> and thus <note place="margin">As the Law is taken largely for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it by Moſes, ſo Chriſt was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly.</note> Chriſt was intended directly, and not by accident; that is, God when he gave the Law to the people of Iſrael, did intend that the ſenſe of their impoſſibility to keep it, and infinite danger accrewing thereby to them, ſhould make them deſire and ſeek out for Chriſt: which the Jews generally not underſtanding, or neglecting, did thereby, like <hi>Adam,</hi> go to make fig-leaves for their covering of their nakedneſs, their empty, externall obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:65695:141"/>
According to this purpoſe <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath a good diſtinction about an end; That an end is two-fold: <hi>Either ſuch, to which a thing doth naturally incline of it ſelf:</hi> Or ſecondly, <hi>that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh an end, by the meere appointment and ordination of ſome Agent.</hi> Now the end of the Law, to which naturally it incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, is eternall life to be obtained by a perfect righteouſneſs in us; but the inſtituted and appointed end, which God the Lawgiver made in the promulgation of it, was the Lord Chriſt: So that, whatſoever the Law commanded, promiſed, or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it was to ſtir up the Iſraelites unto Chriſt. They were not to reſt in thoſe precepts or duties, but to go on to Chriſt; ſo that a beleever was not to take joy with any thing in the Law till he came to Chriſt, and when he had found him, he was to ſeek no further, but to abide there. Now this indeed was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult duty, becauſe every man naturally would be his own Chriſt, and Saviour. And what is the reaſon, that under the Goſpel belevers are ſtill ſo hardly perſwaded to reſt only on Chriſt for righteouſneſs, but becauſe of that ſecret ſelfe depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, within them.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed theſe things, I come to ſhew how Chriſt is <note place="margin">Chriſt is the end of intention in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Law.</note> the end of the Law taken largely in the miniſtry of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And in the firſt place, Chriſt was the ſcope and end of intention: God by giving ſo holy a Law requiring ſuch perfect obedience, would thereby humble and debaſe the Iſraelites; ſo that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould the more earneſtly fly unto Chriſt, even as the Iſraelite, ſtung by a ſerpent, would preſently caſt his eyes upon the braſen Serpent. It is true, Chriſt was more obſcurely and darkly held forth there; yet not ſo, but that it was a duty to ſearch out for Chriſt in all thoſe adminiſtrations. And this you have fully ſet forth in that allegory which <hi>Paul</hi> maketh 2 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> 3. 7. I ſhall explain that place, becauſe it may be wreſted <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cot.</hi> 3. 7. opened.</note> by the Antinomian; as if, becauſe that kinde of miniſtery which was by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was to be done away and evacuated, therefore <note place="margin">The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpel more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then that of the Law in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</note> the preaching of the Law was alſo to be abrogated: but that is far from the Apoſtles ſcope; for the Apoſtle his intent there is to ſhew the excellency of the miniſtery of the Goſpel above that of the Law, and that in three reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:65695:142"/>
1. <hi>In regard one is the miniſtery of death and condemnation, the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Becauſe it is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of life and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Law of death and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</note> 
                  <hi>other of life and righteouſneſs</hi> Therefore the one is called <hi>Letter,</hi> and the other <hi>Spirit.</hi> Now this you muſt underſtand warily, taking the Law nakedly, and in it ſelf, without the Spirit of God, and the Goſpel with the Spirit; for, as <hi>Beza</hi> well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, if you take the Goſpel without Gods Spirit, that alſo is the miniſtration of death, becauſe it is as impoſſible for us to beleeve, as it is to obey the Law by our own power: only life and ſpirit is attributed to the Goſpel, and not to the Law; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt, who is the author of the Goſpel is the fountain of life; and when any good is wrought by the Law, it cometh from the ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond excellency is in regard of continuance and duration.</hi> The miniſtery of <hi>Moſes</hi> was to be made void and aboliſhed; which <note place="margin">2. Becauſe of its dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to abide alwayes, but the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be aboliſhed.</note> is to be underſtood of that Jewiſh pedagogy, not of every part of it; for the Morall, as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> doth ſtill oblige us Chriſtians, as hath been already proved: but the miniſtery of the Goſpel is to abide alwaies; that is, there is no new mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtery to ſucceed that of the Goſpel; although in heaven all ſhall ceaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third difference is in regard of glory: God cauſed ſome mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall glory to ſhine upon</hi> Moſes, <hi>while he gave the Law, hereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Becauſe the glory that cometh by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, that which ſhone upon <hi>Moſes</hi> but materiall.</note> 
                  <hi>the greater authority and majeſty to the Law; but that glory which cometh by the Goſpel is ſpirituall, and far more tranſcendent, bringing us at laſt into eternall glory.</hi> So that the former glory ſeemeth to be nothing in compariſon of this: Even as the light of a candle or torch ſeemeth to be nothing (ſaith <hi>Theophylact)</hi> when the light of the Sun ariſeth. Now the Apoſtle, handling theſe things doth occaſionally open an allegory, which had not <hi>Paul</hi> by the Spirit of God found out, we neither could, or ought to haue done it. And the conſideration of that, will ſerve much for my preſent matter. I know divers men have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thoughts about expoſition of this place; ſo that there ſeemeth to be a vail upon the Text, as well as upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his face: But I ſhall plainly underſtand it thus; <hi>Moſes</hi> his face <note place="margin">What ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the ſhining of <hi>Moſes</hi> his face.</note> ſhining when he was with God, and coming from him, doth ſignifie the glory and excellency of the Law, as in reſpect of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65695:142"/>
Gods counſells and intentions; for although the Law did ſeem to hold out nothing but temporall mercies, devoid of Chriſt and heaven, yet, as in reſpect of Gods intention, it was far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. Now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The Jews were not able to fix their eyes upon this glory;</hi> that is, the carnall Iſraelites did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſt in the miniſtery of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe a vail is upon their hearts. The Apoſtle makes the vail upon <hi>Moſes</hi> to be a type of the blindneſs and hardneſs of heart in the Iſraelite: ſo that, as the vail upon <hi>Moſes</hi> covered the glory of his face, ſo the vail of blindneſs and ſtupidity, upon the heart of the Jews doth hinder them from the glory of the Law, which was Chriſt. And that this is ſo, doth appeare <hi>viz.</hi> where the Iſraelite is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to look ſtedfaſtly, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> (the word in my Text) <hi>to the end</hi> of that miniſtery, which was to be aboliſhed, and that end was Chriſt: ſo that this Text doth fully prove my intent, which is, that Chriſt was in ſome meaſure a glorious object in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Law, but the vail upon the Iſraelites heart hindered the ſight of it.

I will give another inſtance, that Chriſt was the end of intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or aime in the diſpenſation of the Law, from <hi>Galat. 3. 23, 24. We were kept under the Law, till Faith came:</hi> Wherefore the Law was our School-maſter, to bring us unto Chriſt. In which words, not the Morall Law ſimply taken, but the whole diſpenſation of the Jews, is compared to the inſtruction of a School maſter. Now, as a School-maſter doth not only beat or correct, but teach alſo and direct: Thus the Law did not only ſeverely curb and keep from ſin, but did alſo teach Chriſt. Hence we are ſaid to be kept under the Law; which although ſome make an expreſſion from the ſtrict keeping and watching which ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65695:143"/>
in a garriſon uſe to make, yet a learned man makes it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the duty of a School maſter, as one who is to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſuch committed to his charge: In which ſenſe <hi>Cain</hi> ſaid, <hi>Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> The Law then as a School-maſter did not only threaten and curſe, or, like the Egyptian task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, beat and ſtrike, becauſe the work was not done, but did ſhew where power and help was to be had, <hi>viz.</hi> from Chriſt only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the ſecond place Chriſt is the end of perfection to the Law:</hi> for, <note place="margin">2. Chriſt is the end of perfection to the Law.</note> the end of the Law being to juſtifie, and to bring to eternall life, this could not be attained by our own power and induſtry; not by any defect of the Law, but by reaſon of our infirmity. Therefore Chriſt he hath brought about this intent of the Law, that we ſhould be juſtified, and have life. If the end of humane laws be to make good and honeſt men, much rather is the end of the Morall Law appointed by God himſelf: But the Law is ſo far from making us good, as that it worketh in us all evill, which effect of the Law in himſelf the Apoſtle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth: ſo that as good food and nouriſhment received by a diſeaſed ſtomack, doth increaſe the diſeaſe more, according to that rule, <hi>Corpora impura, quantò magis nutrias, deteriora red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis;</hi> thus it is in every man by nature: The Law, which is for holineſs and life, becometh to cauſe ſin and death. Chriſt therefore, that the Law may have its end, he taketh our nature upon him, that the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt is the end of perfection of the Law, in that the meere</hi>

and other Papiſts obſervations on this place, as if the righteouſneſs by faith, or of Chriſt, were the ſame in kinde with the righteouſneſs of works, differing only gradually, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and a grown man; for, if ſo, the Apoſtle would have ſaid <hi>working,</hi> and not <hi>beleeving.</hi> It is a great skill in Divinity to amplifie this righteouſneſs of faith without works, ſo as neither the Papiſt, or the Antinomian may incourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereby: but of that in ſome other place. As you take notice of the ſubject <hi>[Beleever]</hi> ſo the univerſality, <hi>every one,</hi> which doth take in both Jew and Gentile: Therefore the Jew could not, or ought not to think that thoſe externall Rites and obſervations could bring them to a true righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, conſider in the Text, for what end Chriſt is thus the <note place="margin">Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the end for which Chriſt is thus the perfection of the Law.</note> perfection of the Law; and that is for righteouſneſs. The proper ſeat of handling this is in the doctrine of Juſtification, only let me briefly anſwer a Queſtion made by ſome, <hi>Whether the righteouſneſs of faith, or that we have by Chriſt, be the ſame in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the righteouſneſs of works and of the Law? Stapleton</hi> ſaith, They muſt needs be one, becauſe the Law will direct to no other righteouſneſs then that of its own. It it true, the Law ſtrictly taken, will not properly and <hi>per ſe</hi> direct to any righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but that which the Law requireth; yet by accident, and indirectly it may: yea, as it was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> it did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and properly intend Chriſt, though not primarily, as ſome think; but finding us unable to attain to its own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, did then lead us unto Chriſt: Yet theſe two righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſes are divers, rather then contrary, (unleſs in reſpect of juſtification, and ſo indeed its impoſſible to be juſtified by both thoſe waies) otherwiſe they are both together in the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, yea a righteouſneſs of faith doth neceſſarily draw along with it in the ſame ſubject a righteouſneſs of works, though it be imperfect and ſo inſufficient to juſtifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> Is Chriſt the end of the Law for righteouſneſs? Then <note place="margin">The belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath great cauſe to bleſs God, for providing ſuch a righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſneſs for him.</note> let the beleever bleſs and praiſe God for providing a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and ſuch a righteouſneſs for him. How deſtitute and naked was thy condition? Had juſtice taken thee by the throat, and bid thee pay what thou oweſt, thou couldſt not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned that anſwer, <hi>Let me alone, and I will pay thee all.</hi> Neither
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65695:144"/>
Angels nor men could provide this righteouſneſs for thee. Doſt thou thank God for providing clothes for thy body, food for thy belly, an houſe for habitation? Oh, above all thanke him that he hath provided a righteouſneſs for thy ſoul. Thou troubled ſoul becauſe of ſin, thou thinkeſt with thy ſelfe, Oh if I had no ſin, if I were guilty of no corruption, how well were it! O ye glorious Angels and Saints, ye are happy, becauſe ye have a righteouſneſs! Why doeſt thou not conſider, that God hath found out for thee, even for thee, in this world, a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, whereby thou art accepted of him?</p>
               <p>Again conſider it is ſuch a righteouſneſs that ſatisfieth and pleaſeth God. Thy holineſs cannot content him for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that of Chriſt can. As the light of the Stars and Moon cannot diſpell totally the darkneſs of the night, only the light of the Sun can do that.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For the opening of this conſider, that the doctrines of men may either <hi>directly,</hi> and with an open face overthrow the Law, as the Marcionites and Manichees did: or elſe <hi>interpretatively,</hi> and more covertly; and that is done three waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>when they make not the Law of God to be ſo full and exenſiue
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65695:145"/>
in it's obligation, as indeed it is;</hi> and thus the Phariſees they made void the Law, when they affirmed outward acts to be only ſins: and thus the Papiſts do in part when they make the Law no further to oblige, then it is poſſible for us to keep it. Theſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines doe <hi>in tantum,</hi> though not <hi>in totum</hi> deſtroy the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When men hold ſuch principles, that will neceſſarily by way of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 VVhen they hold principles by neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing the abrogation of it.</note> 
                  <hi>conſequence inforce the abrogation of the Law.</hi> And thus, though ſome Antinomians do expreſly and boldly aſſert the aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, at leaſt to beleevers; yet thoſe that have more learning and warineſs, do diſclaime it, and account it a calumny: but even at the ſame time, while they do diſclaime it (as it is to be ſhewed preſently) they hold ſuch aſſertions, as do neceſſarily inferr the abrogation of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Law may be doctrinally diſſolved, by preſſing ſuch duties</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. VVhen they preſs ſuch duties up on men, as will neceſſitate them to break the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God.</note> 
                  <hi>upon men, whereby they will be neceſſitated to breake the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</hi> Thus when the Phariſees taught, that whatſoever vow was made concerning any gift, they were bound to do it, though thereby they were diſinabled to honour their parents. And this is moſt remarkably ſeen in the Church of Rome, who, by the multitude and neceſſity of obſervation of their Church precepts and conſtitutions, make men to break the plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. Now I ſhall briefly inſtance generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe errours that diſſolve Gods Law, and then more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly about the Antinomian doctrine.</p>
               <p>The firſt Hereticks that oppoſed it, were the Marcionites and <note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites and Manichees, the firſt oppugners of the Law.</note> Manichees, <hi>Marcion</hi> (whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls <hi>Mus potincus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his arroding and gnawing the Scripture, to make it ſerviceable to his errours; he, among other errours, broacheth this, <hi>That the old Law</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>was evill, and that it came from an evill god.</hi> To him in this opinion ſucceeded <hi>Manes,</hi> (who truly might be ſo called, becauſe of his madneſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his followers to take away that reproach, called him <hi>Mannichaeus,</hi> as much as one that poured forth Manna, as ſome affirme.) This mans errours, though they were very groſs, yet ſo propagated, that it was two hundred yeares ere they were quieted. Theſe and their followers all agreed in this, to reject this Law of God. There were alſo Hereticks called <hi>Anomi,</hi> (as it were <hi>ſine lege)</hi> but their errour was, <hi>to think that they could by
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65695:146"/>
their knowledge comprehend the divine nature:</hi> And they gave ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much to this their faith, that they held, <hi>Whoſoever ſhould imy brace it, though he committed hainous and atrocious ſins, yet thes ſhould do him no hurt,</hi> Epiphan. lib. 3. Haereſ. 36. But to let paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſe, we may ſay, Popery is in a great part Antinomianiſme. And Antichriſt he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that lawleſs One:</hi> for, is not their doctrine, that the Pope may diſpenſe with the Laws of God, and that the Pope and Chriſt have the ſame Conſiſtory, Antinomianiſme? and in particular, we may inſtance in their taking away the ſecond Commandement out of ſome Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes, becauſe it forbiddeth the worſhipping of Images. Hence <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> one of their <hi>Goliahs,</hi> doth expreſly maintain, that the ſecond Commandement did belong only to the Jews, and ſo not obliging us Chriſtians, thinking it impoſſible to anſwer our arguments againſt their Image-worſhip, if that be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged ſtill in force.</p>
               <p>Is there not alſo a generation of men, who do by doctrine deny the fourth Commandement? How many late books and practiſes have been for that opinion? But hath it not fallen out according to the later expoſition of my Text, that they are the <hi>leaſt in the Kingdome of heaven;</hi> men of little account now in the Church while reforming?</p>
               <p>I might likewiſe ſpeak of ſome Anabaptiſts, (for there are of that ſect that diſclaim the opinion) who overthrow the fifth Commandement by denying Magiſtracy lawfull for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>But I will range no further: The Antinomians do more fall againſt this Text then any, in that they do not only by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine teach the diſ-obligation of the leaſt commandement, but of all, even of the whole Law. This doth appeare true in the firſt Antinomians in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, of whom <hi>Iſlebius</hi> was the captain: he was a School-maſter, and alſo profeſſor of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at Iſlebia. It ſeemeth he was a man like a reed ſhaken with every winde: for firſt he defended, with the Orthodox, the Saxon Confeſſion of Faith; but afterwards was one of thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled the Book called the <hi>Interim.</hi> When <hi>Luther</hi> admoniſhed him of his errour, he promiſed amendment, but for all that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſcattered his errour; which made <hi>Luther</hi> ſet forth pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65695:146"/>
ſix ſolemn diſputations againſt the Antinomians, that are to be ſeen in his works: which argueth the impudency of thoſe that would make <hi>Luther</hi> on their ſide. By theſe diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Luthers</hi> he was convinced, and revoked his errour, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing his recantation in print: yet when <hi>Luther</hi> was dead, this <hi>Euripus</hi> did fall into his old errour, and publikely defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Now how juſtly they might be called Antinomiſts, or, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſometimes, Nomomachiſts, appeareth by theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which they publikely ſcattered about in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: as.</p>

                  <item>1. The Law doth not ſhew good works, neither is it to be preached that we may do them.</item>
                  <item>2. The Law is not given to Chriſtians; therefore they are not to be reproved by the Law.</item>
                  <item>3. The Preachers under the Goſpel are onely to preach the Gospel, not the Law; becauſe Chriſt did not ſay, <hi>Preach the Law, but Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to every creature.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. The legall Sermons of the Prophets doe not at all belong to us.</item>
                  <item>5. To ſay that the Law is a rule of good works, is blaſphemy in Divinity.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Thus you ſee how directly theſe oppoſe the Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come under our Saviours condemnation in the Text: yet at other times, the proper ſtate of the Queſtion between the Orthodox &amp; Antinomiſts, ſeemeth to be, not, <hi>Whether a godly man do not delight in the Law, and do the works of the Law;</hi> but, <hi>Whether he doth it,</hi> Lege docente, urgente, &amp; mandante, <hi>the Law
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65695:147"/>
teaching, urging,</hi> and <hi>commanding:</hi> As for the latter Antinomians, Doctor <hi>Taylor,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> who preached, and wrote againſt them, do record the ſame opinions of them. Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> in his Preface to his Book againſt them, ſaith, <hi>One preached, that the whole Law, ſince Chriſts death, is wholly abrogated and aboliſhed. Another, that to teach obedience to the Law, is Popery. Another, That to do any thing, becauſe God commands us; or to forbeare any ſin, becauſe God forbids us, is a ſigne of a morall man, and of a dead and unſound Chriſtian.</hi> Others deliver, <hi>That the Law is not to be preached, and they that do ſo, are Legall Preachers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Burton</hi> alſo in his Book againſt them, affirmeth, <hi>they divided all that made up the body of the Church of England into Hogs or Dogs:</hi> Hogs <hi>were ſuch that deſpiſed juſtification, living in their ſwiniſh luſts;</hi> Dogs <hi>ſuch, who ſought to be juſtified by their works.</hi> He tels of one of their diſciples, that ſaid, <hi>Away with this ſcurvy ſanctification;</hi> and that <hi>there is no difference between godly here, and in their ſtate of glory, but only in ſenſe and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Many other unſavory aſſertions are named by thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but theſe may ſuffice to give a taſt of their opinions; for it is elegantly ſpoken by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> in ſuch falſhoods as theſe are, <hi>lib. 2. c. 34. adverſus Haereſes. We need not drink up the whole ſea, to taſt whether the water be ſalt; but as a ſtatue that is made of clay, yet outwardly ſo gilded, that it ſeemeth to be gold, if any man take a piece of it in his hand, and diſcover what it is, doth make every one know what the whole ſtatue is:</hi> ſo it is in this caſe.</p>
               <p>For my my part, I am acquainted with them no other waies, but by their Books which they have written, and in thoſe every er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is more warily preſſed, then in ſecret. There I finde, that ſometimes they yeeld the Law to be a rule of life, yea they judge it a calumny to be called Antinomiſts; and if ſo, their adverſaries may be better called Antifidians And it cannot be denied, but that in ſome parts of their Books there are wholſome and good paſſages; as in a wood or forreſt, full of ſhrubs and brambles, there may be ſome violets and primroſes: yet for all this, in the very places where they deny this aſſertion as theirs, they muſt be forced to acknowledge it. The Author of <hi>the Aſſertion of Free-grace,</hi> who doth expreſly touch upon theſe things, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes the opinion againſt the Law, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. and <hi>pag.</hi> 6. yet he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65695:147"/>
there ſuch principles, from whence this concluſion will neceſſarily follow.</p>
               <p>For firſt, he makes no reall difference either in Scripture, or uſe of words, between the <hi>Law reigning</hi> and <hi>ruling;</hi> ſo that if the Law rule a man, it reigneth over him, Now then, they deny that the Law doth reign over a beleever (and ſo do the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox alſo) therefore they muſt needs hold, that it cannot be a rule unto him. And then, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. whereas Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> had ſaid, <hi>The Apoſtle doth not looſe a Chriſtian from the obedience to the Law, or rule thereof</hi> (he adds,) <hi>He dare not truſt a beleever without his keeper, as if he judged no otherwiſe of him, then of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor of Newgate, who wouldrob and kill, if his Gaoler be not with him.</hi> Again, this is moſt clear by what he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth that diſtinction of being under the mandatory power of the Law, but not the damnatory: he makes theſe things inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and as impoſſible for the Law to be a Law, and have not both theſe as to take the brains and heart from a man, and yet leave him a man ſtill. Now then, ſeeing he denieth (and ſo do all Proteſtant Writers) that a beleever is under the damnatory power of the Law, he muſt alſo deny, he is under the mandatory, becauſe (ſaith he) this is inſeperable.</p>
               <p>I will in the next place give ſome Antidotes againſt this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <note place="margin">Antidotes againſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</note> and the Authors thereof. <hi>Luther</hi> calleth them, <hi>Hoſtes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, Organa Satanae:</hi> he ſaith, their doctrine is more to be taken heed of, then that of the Papiſts; for the Papiſts, they teach a falſe or imperfect repentance, but the Antinomians take all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Church. <hi>Rivet</hi> cals them <hi>Furores Antinomorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place, <hi>awe thy heart with a feare againſt errours in</hi>

                  <hi>doctrine as that which may damn thee, as well as an open groſs ſin.</hi> Conſider that place <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 20. where hereſies are reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe ſins that are very groſs, and do exclude from the Kingdome of Heaven: and that he takes hereſies there in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious conſideration, is plain, becauſe it's made to differ from ſeditions, ſtrifes, and variances. Neither do thou pleaſe thy ſelf in that queſtion, <hi>What is hereſie? Tu Haereticus mihi &amp; ego tibi;</hi> for, the Apoſtle makes it there a manifeſt work of the fleſh, and 2 <hi>John</hi> 10. ſee how much afraid the people of God ought to be of any evill doctrine; and there the Apoſtle cals e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill doctrine, <hi>evill deeds.</hi>

Look upon thoſe places of Scripture, where du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as thoſe where Chriſt and grace are ſpoken of.</note> is a perpetuall fault among the Antinomians: they only pitch upon thoſe places; where Chriſt and his grace is ſpoken of; but not of thoſe Texts, where duties are commanded, eſpecially thoſe places of Scripture, where the Law of God is wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended, for the many reall benefits that come by it; where likewiſe the perpetuity and eternity of it is much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated. <hi>Lex Dei in aeternum manet; vel implenda in damnatis, vel impleta in beatis,</hi> The Law of God abideth alwaies, either to be fulfilled in the damned, or already fulfilled in thoſe that are made happy, ſaid <hi>Luther.</hi> What a curb would it be unto this errour, if they would conſider, with what an holy paſſion &amp; zeal the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth deny, that he deſtroyeth the Law, making this very objection to himſelf, <hi>Do we then make void the Law? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</hi> Now can we thing that the Apoſtle, who in the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> doth ſo vehemently deny, that he deſtroyeth the Law, ſhould ſo much forget himſelf, as in the fourth chapter to aboliſh it? No ordinary man would fall into ſuch a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>

But now, when men deſire to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded in the world, they ſuggeſt to their inward diſciples, as if they had found out ſome new unheard thing; and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers broach it abroad, and ſo they come to be exalted. thus they do like <hi>Pſaphon</hi> the Libyan: It's reported of him, that he kept ten tame birds at home, and taught them to ſing, <hi>Magnus deus Pſaphon;</hi> and when he had done ſo, he let theſe birds flye into the woods and mountains, where all the other birds learned the ſame ſong of them: which the Libyans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and thinking it no plot, but a divine accident, decreed <note place="margin">4.

Religion.</hi> As the childe groweth crooked, for not being well looked to at firſt; and many errours do now ſpread themſelves, becauſe men are not well catechiſed. They build without a foundation. It was a grave complaint of <hi>Maximus</hi> an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Writer, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
