         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

mention, leſt being, as they are, diſperſt into private hands, they may chance be hereafter loſt; for, beſides his Fancies of the Three, Foure, Five and Six Parts to the Viols and Organ, he hath made above thirty ſeverall ſorts of Muſick for Voices and Inſtruments: Neither was there any Inſtrument then in uſe, but he compos'd to it ſo aptly, as if he had only ſtudied that.

Living, he was generally known, and (for his Parts) much honoured by Perſons of beſt quality and condition. To give a further Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of him I ſhall forbeare, becauſe of my neer relation, and rather referre that to thoſe Elegies which many of his noble Friends have written in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Book: But, as to what he hath done in Muſick, I ſhall deſire the preſent and the future Age, that ſo much of his Works as are here publiſhed, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as the leaſt part of what he hath compos'd, and but a ſmall Teſtimony of his greater Compoſitions, (too voluminous for the Preſſe) which I the rather now

mention, leſt being, as they are, diſperſt into private hands, they may chance be hereafter loſt; for, beſides his Fancies of the Three, Foure, Five and Six Parts to the Viols and Organ, he hath made above thirty ſeverall ſorts of Muſick for Voices and Inſtruments: Neither was there any Inſtrument then in uſe, but he compos'd to it ſo aptly, as if he had only ſtudied that. As for that which is my part in this Compoſition, I had not thought at all (though much urg'd) to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; but that, as they had their birth at the ſame time with his, and are of the ſame kinde, ſo they might enter both into the light together, and accompany one another being ſo neere allied; Mine taking precedence of order only, not of worth.
