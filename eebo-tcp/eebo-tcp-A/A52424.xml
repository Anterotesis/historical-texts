         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE Letters herelaid open to thy
View are a late Correspondence
between my self and a Gentlewoman,
and to add to thy Wonder, a young
Gentlewoman. Her Name I have not
the Liberty to publish. For her Person,
as her Modesty will not suffer me to say
much of her, so the present Productions
of her Pen make it utterly needless to say
any thing, unless it be by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
to obviate a Diffidence in some
who from the surprizing Excellency of
these Writings may be tempted to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether my Correspondent be really
a Woman or no. To whom my Answer
is, that indeed I did not see her write
<pb facs="tcp:50053:5"/>
these Letters, but that I have all the
moral and reasonable Assurance that she
did write them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is the true Author
of them, that can be had in a thing of
this Nature, And I hope my Credit
may be good enough with those that know
me to be believed upon my serious Word,
where there is no other Satisfaction to be
given.</p>
            <p>The Subject of this Correspondence is
the best and greatest that the Thought of
an intelligent Creature can possibly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
it self about, <hi>the Love of GOD.</hi>
And 'twere much to be wished that this
were made more the Subject not only of
our Conversations and Letters (instead
of those many empty and impertinent Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
that usually fill and ingross
them) but even of our Books and more
elaborate Composures, which I think
would be better imployed in laying good
Foundations for the Love of GOD, and
raising the low-sunk Practice of it, than
<pb facs="tcp:50053:5"/>
in curious Researches of his Nature,
and an eternal Contention and tedious
<hi>Chicane</hi> about the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Men may
wrangle for ever about these abstruse
Theories, and sooner dispute themselves
out of Charity than into Truth, but our
Wills have at present a larger Capacity
than our Understandings, and our Love
of GOD may be very flaming and sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick,
when after the greatest Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Soar of Thought our Conceptions
of him are but faint and shadowy, and
we see him but in a Glass darkly. But
if we would even make this Glass more
transparent, 'tis Love that must clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and refine it. An affectionate Sense
of GOD will discover more of him to
us, than all the dry Study and Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scholastick Heads, the Fire of
our Hearts will give the best and truest
Light to our Eyes, and when all is done
the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD is the best <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50053:6"/>
However, I am sure it is the best
<hi>Practice.</hi> Love is not only the shortest
and most compendious Way to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the greatest Heighth and Pitch
of it. The more we have of Love, the
nearer Advances we make to GOD,
who is Love it self, and who breaths
forth from him essential and substantial
Love, the more fit we are to taste the
Sweetness of Divine Communion and
religious walking with him here, and
the better prepared to relish and enjoy
the fuller Display of his sovereign Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
hereafter.</p>
            <p>Heaven is but a State of the most
perfect and comsummated Love, and
therefore the best thing we can practice
upon Earth is to tune our Hearts to
this Divine Strain, to set them as high
as we can, for sure the best Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Love must be Love it self. But
whatever other Qualifications are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
a Heart once truly touched with
<pb facs="tcp:50053:6"/>
this divine Passion cannot long want
them. Love will draw along after it
all other Virtues, will perfect and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them, and will at least hide
those Faults of them which it cannot
correct. For this is that universal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
which supplies the Defects of
other Works, but which if wanting
(such a necessary and vital Part it is)
nothing else can supply or compound for.
Neither Tongues, nor Prophecy, nor
Knowledge, nor Faith, nor Alms, nor
even Martyrdom it self signifie any
thing without Charity. The Heart is
the Sacrifice that GOD demands, and
unless that be offered, the richest Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
will find no Acceptance. Other
Gifts and Graces, whether intellectual
or moral, come indeed from Heaven,
but they often leave us upon Earth.
Love only elevates us up thither, and
is able to unite us to God. 'Tis this
indeed that gives us the strictest Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:50053:7"/>
on with him in this Life. By Faith
we live upon GOD, by Obedience we
live to him, but 'tis by Love alone that
we live in him. And so St. <hi>John,
God is Love, and he that dwelleth
in Love dwelleth in God and God in
him.</hi> A Passage that makes highly for
the Privilege of Love, and which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
mention without calling to mind a
most Divine Remark which the <hi>Port
Royal, Abrege de la Morale des
Epistres,</hi> &amp;c. Tom. 4. Pag. 112. in
their late Abstract of the Morality of the
New Testament has upon it. <hi>O great
God, you are all Love in your
self, and all Love for Man and Man,
dares deliberate whether he should
love you, and to inquire when and
how far he is obliged to do it. If
to love GOD be to possess him, and
to be possessed by him, what an
Emptiness is there in that Heart
which does not love God, or of
<pb facs="tcp:50053:7"/>
what is it full if not of Vanity and
Indigence it self?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I may be concerned to <hi>plead</hi> as
well as to <hi>recommend</hi> the Greatness
of our Subject, which indeed is so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and vast, has such immense Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions,
such Heighths and Depths in
it, that there needs no other Apology
than the Theme we treat of to excuse the
Defectiveness of our Meditations upon
it. If there be any Argument that will
oppress a Writer with its Weight, daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle
him with its Glory, and make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that he shall think or say up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it appear little, it is this certainly
of the Love of God, which is a Theory
of too exalted a Nature for any humane
Pen, and such as Angels alone are fit
to write upon.</p>
            <p>They that contemplate the <hi>Face</hi> of
GOD can tell it may be in some Measure
how lovely he is, and the very Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport
of their high Passion, would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb facs="tcp:50053:8"/>
them with Expression, but 'tis hard
for a Soul that sees only his <hi>Back-parts</hi>
to give any tolerable Representation of
his Beauty, and for a Spirit that dwells
and converses upon Earth to speak the
Language of Heaven. There are <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi>
in the Love of God as well as in
other Parts of Religion which to the
Minds of Men arm'd as they are with
sensible Prejudices, will appear very
difficult, and which the most purged and
illuminated Spirits will not presently
comprehend, and which even those that
do will not easily explain so as to make
them intelligible to others. Practice
and Experiment will go furthest here,
but after all we must be often forced to
cry, <hi>O the Depth!</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> seems
to have been sensible of this when he
prayed for his <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that <hi>being
rooted and grounded in Love, they
might be able to comprehend with
all Saints, what is the Breadth and
<pb facs="tcp:50053:8"/>
Length and Depth and Heighth,
and to know the Love of Christ
which passes Knowledge.</hi> This
perhaps may be chiefly meant of the
Love of God to us, but 'tis as true of
our Love to him, which has its Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
too, a Depth which we can hardly
sound, and a Heighth which we can
hardly reach.</p>
            <p>Some it may be will be ready to say
here that we have reached beyond it, by
carrying the Measures of Divine Love
to too great a Heighth. But let me only
desire them to consider (besides what
they will find for the Iustification of our
Measure in the following Papers) that
the Love here discoursed of and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
is the Love of a <hi>God,</hi> that is,
of all that is good, of all that is perfect,
of all that is lovely, of all that is desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
in short, of all that truly is, and
can any Love be too great or too high for
such an Object? Or rather does he not
<pb facs="tcp:50053:9"/>
deserve infinitely more than we or any
of his Creatures can bestow upon him?
What can an infinite good be loved too
much, or is any Degree of Love too high
for him who is infinitely lovely, and
who infinitely loves himself? Is the
Heart of Man too great a Sacrifice for
a God, though it were intirely offered
and wholly burnt and consumed at his
Altar? Especially since he himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
it all, requiring us to love him
with our whole Heart, Soul, and Mind.
And would we present him with less?
What do we think the whole too great for
him that we thus mince and divide it!
But does not our Conscience secretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
us when we do so? Yes, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
upbraids to us the Love of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and is always like a faithful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
pleading in the Behalf of God,
and asserting his sovereign Right. And
why then should it be thought such a
Stretch of the Love of God to make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb facs="tcp:50053:9"/>
and exclusive of all other Loves?
Can we love God too much, or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
too little? Or is it such a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
to make the Church speak to Christ
in the same Language wherein he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendes
to speak to her, <hi>my Love, my
undefiled is but one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, is this such a rare
and unheard of Conclusion that God
ought to be the sole and intire Object of
our Love, to be so stared at as I find it
is, and lookt upon as such a <hi>Singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!</hi>
No certainly, nothing more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
in Books of Piety and Devotion,
than to meet with Expressions of this
Kind. St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Devotional Tracts
are full of them, and so are our modern
Writers who commonly run upon the
same Strain, as may be seen at large
(for 'tis endless to make particular
Quotations here) in all those Books
that are written after the mystical and
spiritual Way, particularly in the
<pb facs="tcp:50053:10"/>
Works of the great Spanish Seraphick
St. <hi>Theresa,</hi> especially in her <hi>Pensées
Sur L'Amour de Dieu,</hi> in <hi>Cardinal
Bona's via Compendii ad Deum,
Chrestien Interieur, Thomas a Kem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis</hi>
of the Imitation of Christ, and the
great <hi>French Poet Corneille</hi> in a
Book of Divine Poems upon the same
Subject, where he has this memorable
Passage.</p>

               <hi>Monsieur</hi> Jurieu <hi>has also a great deal
to the same Purpose in his Book of</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Devotion, <hi>and I might name
several among our own Writers, but
there is one that delivers himself so full
and home to the Business that I need
mention no more, but shall only present the
Reader with a Passage out of him. It
is</hi> Bishop Lake, <hi>who in his seventh
Sermon upon those Words,</hi> Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy Heart, <hi>&amp;c. Matth. 22. and
37. (the very Text we build upon)
expresses himself thus:</hi> In the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of Perfection Divines require
a double Perfection, one partium,
the other graduum. There is a
Perfection of the Parts in Man,
which must be seasoned with the
Vertue, and the Vertue in those
Parts must arise unto its full Pitch.
This Text requires both these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in Charity. The Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <pb facs="tcp:50053:12"/>
on of the Parts of Man are intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Enumeration of the
Heart, Mind, Soul and Strength,
unto which all our inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Abilities may be reduced. So
that there is no Power or Part of
Man that must not be qualified with
the Love of God. But of this
Perfection I have spoken when I
shewed you the Seat of Love.
I made it plain unto you that there
was to be in our Charity a Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Parts. That with which
we have now to do is the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Degrees. The Text will tell
us that it is not enough for every
of those Parts to have the Love of
God in them, they must also be
wholly taken up therewith. And
this Perfection is noted by the
Word (all) which is added to Heart,
Soul, Mind, and Strength.</p>
            <p>A Commandment is the sooner
<pb facs="tcp:50053:12"/>
admitted if the Reasonableness of
the ground thereof be first discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
I will therefore first discover
the ground upon the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
whereof this great Measure is
required. The ground is twofold,
one in <hi>GOD,</hi> another in us. The
ground that is found in God is taken
from the Preface of this Text, as
<hi>Moses</hi> has delivered it, and St.
<hi>Mark</hi> repeated it. The Preface is,
hearken O <hi>Israel,</hi> the Lord thy God
is one. But one, therefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Object of our Love. He
will not give this his Glory to any
other, neither will he indure any
Corsival herein. The Beginning,
the Middle and the End of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is only he that is <hi>Alpha</hi> and
<hi>Omega,</hi> the first and last. Had we
many Lord Gods then might we
have many Objects of our Love.
The Object can no more be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb facs="tcp:50053:13"/>
than he can. Take all the
Parts of his Title asunder, and you
shall find Oneness and Intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
therein. <hi>After a particular
Examination of and Descant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he proceeds.</hi> I suppose if you
have well heeded what I have said
you will acknowledge that there is
a fair ground in the Lord our God
why he should challenge all our
Love. Let us come now and look
upon our selves, and see what
ground thereof we can find there.</p>
            <p>When the Question was moved
unto Christ whether the <hi>Iews</hi>
ought to pay Tribute to <hi>Caesar</hi> or
not, he called for the Coin and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
whose Image and Superscription
it bare. And when they answered
him <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, he replied, give unto
<hi>Caesar</hi> those things which are <hi>Caesar</hi>'s.
But he addeth to our Purpose, that
upon the same grounds they must
<pb facs="tcp:50053:13"/>
give unto <hi>GOD</hi> those things which
are <hi>GOD</hi>'s. If the Image and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscription
were a just ground why
Coin should be paid unto <hi>Caesar,</hi>
where GOD's Image is found there
is as good a Reason that that should
be rendred unto him. Now God's
Image is found in us by Nature,
for we were made according to his
Image, so that all which we receive
from him we owe unto him by the
Law of Creation. A second way
is God's Image in us, by Grace.
For our Regeneration is but a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Creation, wherein we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
unto that Image according
to which God at first created us.
All then is due unto God a second
time, by the Law of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so that whether we look upon
our Heart, our Mind, our Soul,
or Strength, it may be demanded
of us, <hi>Quid habes, quod non accepisti?
<pb facs="tcp:50053:14"/>
What hast thou,</hi> &amp;c. And if we have
received it all, the Exaction is but
reasonable, <hi>Si totum exigit a te qui
totum fecit, refecit te.</hi> Surely St.
<hi>Paul</hi> thought so when he wills the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> to glorifie God with
their Bodies, and with their Souls,
adding this reason, for they are God's.</p>
            <p>Well then we have found fair
grounds of this Measure. For if
God be such and such to us, as you
have heard, the only lovely thing,
and all that can be beloved, and we
are all his, and all that we have is
due unto him, both by Nature and
by Grace, then ought we with all
to express our Love towards him.
But what is it to love him with all!
Surely it is to love him <hi>sine divisio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
&amp; sine remissione.</hi> None of our
Abilities must be divided, none of
them must be slack in doing this
Work. First of the Division, we
<pb facs="tcp:50053:14"/>
must not divide our Hearts, that is,
as the Scripture speaks, have a Heart
and a Heart, a Heart for God, and a
Heart for the World, <hi>&amp;c. Again,</hi> all
Division of our Abilities is a plain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning
of the Love of God, for
no Man can serve two Masters as
Christ tells us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God will have all
or none, <hi>&amp;c. Again says he,</hi> What is
the Use of all this but to make us see
how little we perform of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
and how little Cause we
have to boast of the best that we do
therein. VVho is he that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that his Abilities are divided, and
that he loves more things than God,
yea most things more than God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You see here is a great Man that not
only expresly delivers the same Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but endeavours to prove it too.
Whether his way of reasoning be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
or no I leave the Reader to judge.
All that I am at present concerned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<pb facs="tcp:50053:15"/>
is, that the Conclusion it self is far
from being such a Novelty or Singularity
as many imagin and object. No, it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to be met with, and all that I
have here and elsewhere done is only to
reduce a common Conclusion into clear
and distinct Principles, such as are
founded in the Nature and Reason of
Things. So that if what I advance be
no Truth, yet I am sure it is no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox,
which is enough to fence me from
Prejudice, and I am content that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should decide the rest.</p>
            <p>When I have desired the Reader to be
so just to me as not to meddle with these
Papers till he has first carefully perused
the Discourse to which they relate, and
which contains the Principle upon which
they proceed, I have nothing more to say
here unless it be to give some account of
the Reasons of our communicating a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Correspondence to the Publick,
concerning which I shall leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:50053:15"/>
to satisfie himself out of the Two
ensuing Letters, which contain my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of a Publication, with the Reason
and Manner of my Correspondents Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.
The Letters are as follows.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Madam,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>SInce we have now both of us conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
our Parts, and so sealed up our
Divine Subject with a double Seal, it
would be a little indecorous to break it
open again, especially for me who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think' it Prudence to travel on even in
so pleasant a Road after my Guide has
left me, to proceed further in a Subject
where you think fit to end, or to vitiate
with any Additions of mine the Relish
of an Argument upon which you have
left such a pleasing and delicious Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.
No Madam, let it stand as you
have left it, for though it should not be
absolutely finished (as indeed who can
say of such an immense Subject that it
ever is) yet 'tis most just and fit that
where-ever you please to end, there
should be the Conclusion, after which,
as in <hi>Apelles's Venus,</hi> there can be no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:50053:16"/>
without Presumption. I shall not
therefore be guilty of it, only give me
leave to lament a little that you conclude
so soon your Meditations and my Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
For methinks I could eternally
hear your Discourse upon this ever fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
ever ingaging and entertaining
Theme, which as great as it is receives
such an Advantage from your Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as might recommend it to those
dull cold Spirits whom its own natural
Excellency would never affect. The
very Tunings and looser Touches of a
sweet and well toned Instrument are
pleasant, and what then is the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
when it comes to be played on by a
Masterly Hand! And how is the musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Hearer grieved when he sees the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious
Artist unstringing it and laying
it aside. But Madam, there are some
Pleasures that are always short, if Time
be their Measure, and were your Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
here never so prolix I should still think
and be ready to complain they were done
too soon, so great and noble is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and so admirable both your
Thoughts and Expressions upon it, such
Choiceness of Matter, such Weight of
Sense, such Art and Order of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
<pb facs="tcp:50053:16"/>
such Clearness and Strength of
reasoning, such Beauty of Language,
such Address of Style, such bright and
lively Images and Colours of things, and
such moving Strains of the most natural
and powerful Oratory, and all this season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with such a Tincture of Piety, and
seeming to come from a true inward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Principle of the most sincere and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
Devotion. But why do I say <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
when 'tis next to impossible that such
lively and favoury Representations of the
Love of God should proceed from one
that is not intimately acquainted with
the Mysteries and Secrets of it, or that
there should be any such Knowledge
without the most hearty and affectionate
Sense of it, which alone is able to teach
and make it known. For, contrary to
the Method of other Sciences,' tis Practice
here that begets Theory, and those only
who have their Hearts thoroughly
warmed and animated with the Love of
God can either know or describe its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
                  <p>Madam, I am very sensible what Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
I am under to you for the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of your excellent Correspondence,
though I can never hope that my Thanks
<pb facs="tcp:50053:17"/>
should ever equal either the Pleasure or
the Advantage I have received by it, or
that I should be ever able to express the
Value I set upon your Letters, either as
to their Ingenuity or their Piety. The
former of which might make them an
Entertainment for an Angel, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sufficient (if possible) to make a Saint
of the blackest Devil. I am sure for my
own Part I have particular reason to
thank you for them, having received
great spiritual Comfort and Advantage
by them, not only Heat but Light, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
as well as moral Improvement.
For (as many Discourses as there are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Subject) to my Knowledge I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
met with any that have so inlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my Mind, inlarged my Heart, so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and took Possession of my Spirit,
and have had such a general and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
Influence over my whole Soul
as these of yours. And I question not
but that they would have the same Effect
upon other Readers if they were but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to their View, and would help to
fan and blow up that divine Fire which
our Saviour came to kindle upon Earth,
but which the Neglect of careless Men
has let almost go out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50053:17"/>
And indeed never was there more need
of such warm quickning Discourses than
in this cold frozen Age of ours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Flame of divine Love seems not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to burn with a blue expiring Light,
but to hang loose and hovering, just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to fly away and be extinct. <hi>Some
have not the Knowledge of God,</hi> was the
Complaint of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the chief
Character of his Time. But that of ours
is Want of the Love of God, and which
equally redounds to our <hi>Shame.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
more, since the natural Capacity of
our Wills is greater and more extensive
than that of our Understandings, and he
that knows but little may yet love
much. But to our Shame the Reverse
of this is now true. There is a great
deal of Knowledge now adays and but
little Love. Knowledge indeed is now
in its Meridian, diffusing at once a very
bright and universal Light, but the
Love of God is declining and just ready
to set. Strange that our Heads should
be so full of Life and Spirits, and yet that
the Pulse of our Hearts should beat so
low! But the Ends of the World are
come upon us, and a double Prophecy
must be fulfilled, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the later
<pb facs="tcp:50053:18"/>
Days Knowledge shall increase, and
that the Love of many shall wax cold.</p>
                  <p>O divine Love whither art thou fled,
or where art thou to be found? How
little art thou understood, and how
much less art thou considered and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed!
What Discoveries of thee have been
made by the Son of God, and yet what
a Riddle art thou still to the World!
What a Divine Teacher hast thou had,
and yet how few are thy Disciples! How
charming and ravishing are thy Pleasures,
and yet how very few hast thou inamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them! While in the mean time Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness
and Ambition have their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Altars and Votaries, and sensual
Love is continually spreading its Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and leading in triumph its inglorious
Captives. O God that thou shouldst be
so infinitely lovely, and yet so little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved!
That ever Mortal Beauties should
be suffered to vye with thine, that thy
Creatures should fall in love with one
another and in the mean time neglect
thee, thou infinite, thou only fair, who
alone art worthy to have, and who
alone canst reward their Passion? What
a just Indignation must every true Lover
of God conceive at this strange Disorder,
<pb facs="tcp:50053:18"/>
and how willing and ready will he be
to help it by promoting and propagating
as far as he can the Love of God in the
World! For this is one great Effect and
Sign of the Love of God (and the only one
I would have added to those you have
mentioned) that whereas the Lovers of
created Beauties are jealous of them, and
willing to ingross them to themselves,
being conscious of their Incapacity to
suffice for many, those that truly love
God are desirous to have others love him
too, to multiply his Votaries, and to
make the whole World if they can, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up their Sacrifices upon the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Altar. There cannot be a greater
Pleasure to a true Lovers of God than to
see him loved by others, nor a greater
Grief than to think what vast Numbers
of evil Spirits there are in Hell, and
wicked Men upon Earth who either hate
him or imperfectly love him. And
what would not such a Soul do, what
would she not suffer to gain Proselytes to
the Love of God, and promote the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Interest of it in the World, that so
God might be loved in Earth as he is in
Heaven? And how would it rejoyce her
to find her Endeavours succeed, to find
<pb facs="tcp:50053:19"/>
that by careful fanning and blowing, she
has at length lighted the Fire under the
Sacrifice, and that by her zealous Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
it burns and consumes, and
sends up to Heaven a grateful Fume?
What Satisfaction would she take, and
how comfortably would she warm her
self at the Fire which she has kindled.</p>
                  <p>And truly Madam, I know no better
Fuel wherewith to kindle and nourish
this sacred Fire than such Discourses as
yours, which therefore I think are too
useful to the Publick not to be due to it.
Treasures you know ought not to be
concealed, and so great is the Disorder
when they are, that Ghosts oftentimes
think it worth while to come into our
World on purpose to have them disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
To be plain and free, I do verily
think nothing can be more conducive
(next to the Breathings of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and the Writings by him inspired)
to promote the Love of God, than your
Divine Discourses, nothing more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
to inlarge its Empire in the Hearts
of Men, which is so excellent an End,
that I can hardly see how you can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
dispense with your self from serving
it when you have it so far in your power.
<pb facs="tcp:50053:19"/>
But I shall not assume to be your Casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist.
You know best what your Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
and what your Obligations are.
Only this, if you communicate your
Letters you will be a general Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
to Mankind, who will be highly
obliged to thank you, and which is
more, to bless God on your Behalf. But
if you deny the World so rich a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
all that I have to set against the
publick Loss will be my own greater Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,
which however for the common
Benefit would willingly be exchanged by</p>

                  <p>SInce 'tis your Pleasure to close this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Subject, that I might not
with it put an End to those great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which such an agreeable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
Correspondence affords me, I
<pb facs="tcp:50053:20"/>
designed (when I had taken notice of
some few incidentals in our former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
to propose a new Subject in this,
or else to desire you would please to make
choice of such an one as you shall judge of
greatest Usefulness, but that in good
Manners I think I am obliged to return
an Answer to that Request with which
you conclude the old Subject before I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
a new one. Perhaps by this time,
and upon maturer Consideration, you
have altered your Desire, which I should
be glad of for your sake, lest the World
which so justly values your Judgment in
other things, should have too much oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to decry it in this. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that Persons who have a great
deal of Worth themselves, are too apt to
over rate the least Appearances of it in
others, and give such Characters of their
Friends as better express what they
would have them be, than what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
are. It being the Property of those
only who are diffident of their own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to envy and endeavour to lessen their
Neighbours, and because <hi>they</hi> are little,
imagine that others are so, whilst those
who have noble Souls themselves, form
their Ideas of others according to their
<pb facs="tcp:50053:20"/>
own worth: And thus it comes that you
pass so undeserved a Character on my
Letters, concerning which I believe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few will be of your Mind. Is the
World do you think such an equitable
Censor that I should care to make it my
Confessor, and expose to its View Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
writ with the same Freedom with
which I think? Many are the Faults I
find in them my self, though we are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
over partial to our own Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Like fond Parents we think our
own Brood the fairest, how disagreeable
soever they appear to disinteressed Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
What think you then will the <hi>Beaux
Esprits</hi> discover? How will it grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that which they call Wit, but is more
truly ill Nature, to find so much Matter
to work on? For truly Sir, when we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
our Meditations to the World, we
give them a Right to judge, and we
must either be content with the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they pass or keep our Thoughts at
home. Charity and Wisdom indeed
would restrain them from that ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable
Liberty they usually take; they
may censure so it be with Candor; judge
equitably; ay, and pass Sentence too,
provided it be impartially. But though
<pb facs="tcp:50053:21"/>
'tis the Business of a true Critick to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Beauties as well as Blemishes, and
by a due ballancing of both, to pass a
found Judgment on the whole, such
Equity is not to be expected where so
much Envy abounds, where every Man
reckons another's Praises his Detraction,
and never thinks his Fame will reach so
high as when 'tis built on the Ruins of
his Neighbours. A very preposterous
Way in my Opinion, to get or encrease
Reputation. For where is the Glory of
excelling those who have little or no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
in them? No, let them shine
as bright as they can, and if then I can
out-shine them, I have made some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Addition to my Character.
The Censure therefore that abounds in
the World is one Reason why I am
against Printing. If a Body have no
Worth, to what End should they expose
themselves, and bring their Weakness to
the Light? And if they have, Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is their wisest Choice, since they
shall be sure to find more Envy than En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement?
For it is the Custom of
the World when they behold a shining
Virtue, to strive rather to reduce it to
their Level, than to raise to its exalted
<pb facs="tcp:50053:21"/>
Heighth. 'Tis odds whether such a
Man can benefit others, who are too oft
resolved not to be benefited by him, but
he is certain to suffer himself. Every
busie finger will be pulling the Flie out
of his Box of Oyntment, not to advance
but to lessen its Price. If he be guilty of
a little Mistake or Inadvertency (and
who is secure therefrom?) Charity shall
never be called on to dispose of it, but it
shall be bandied about, heightened and
aggravated, not only to his, but even to
the Reproach of Wisdom and Virtue it
self. Since then the Air is so unkind,
let's keep our tender Plants beneath a
Glass; 'tis enough that they lie open to
the Observation and Influence of the Sun
of Righteousness, and that when Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
serves, a Friend may be admitted to
view and take them. These and some
other Considerations have recommended
to me, my darling, my beloved <hi>Obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
which I court and doat on above all
Earthly Blessings, and am as ambitious
to slide gently through the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
so much as being seen or taken notice
of in it, as others are to bustle and make
parade on its Theater. And therefore,
though I desire by all laudable means to
<pb facs="tcp:50053:22"/>
secure a <hi>good,</hi> I will most industriously
shun a <hi>great</hi> Reputation. Not that I
want Ambition, perhaps there is too
much of that in my Temper, but because
I cannot endure to have my Glory and
Reward forestalled, nor can be content
ito receive my <hi>Plaudit</hi> from any but an
infallible Judge. 'Tis enough for me to
<hi>do</hi> well, let who will take the Praise of
doing it, there being in my Opinion no
<hi>Encomium</hi> comparable to that which they
shall one Day hear, who seek GOD's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and despise their own. And though
I bear in me too much Allay to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
of great Commendations; yet,
to confess the Truth, I as little care for
Censure, having not yet obtained that
perfect Indifferency to publick Fame
which I endeavour after, because I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
'tis scarce possible to command our
selves, and arrive at a true Generosity of
Temper, till we are perfectly mortified
to Praise and Dispraise as well as to other
things.</p>
                  <p>But besides this, me thinks the very
Form of a Letter renders such Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
improper for publick view. Those ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
which are but necessary, especially
when an Acquaintance is founding, will
<pb facs="tcp:50053:22"/>
give the captious World occasion to sneer
and laugh. It favours too much of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne's</hi>
Affectation to trouble the World
with such Particularities of our Humour,
and Infirmities as we may in private ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
laudably descend to, and which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
make a Part of some of my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Alas Sir, we are too prone to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
our selves, and consequently to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
whatever relates to us on no other
Account but because it does so, but we
must not expect to find People so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant
as to bear with this Temper, or
perhaps, so civil as not to ridicule and
expose it.</p>
                  <p>These are my Reasons against a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication,
I know not how they will weigh
with you, for I must needs confess one of
yours overballances them all; whatever
People may say of Temptation, to do
good seems to me the only irresistible
one. And indeed, could I be convinced
any thing I have writ would serve the
Ends of Piety, I should despise the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the wou'd-be-Criticks, and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>that</hi> would more than compensate all
other Inconveniencies. (And perhaps
a little Censure is necessary to correct
that Vanity your too good Opinion may
<pb facs="tcp:50053:23"/>
have raised in me, and which I desire
you would be less expressive of for the
future. Tis enough for me to obtain
the inward Esteem of any vertuous and
deserving Person, the greatest Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
they can shew is to acquaint me
with such Faults as lessen and obstruct it.)
But if those excellent and elaborate Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
that are abroad, have so little Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
on the Generality of Mankind, how
can I expect my crude Rapsodies should
have any? Pardon me that I express so
mean an Opinion of any thing you are
pleased to commend, I would not do it
in any other Case. But all Men will
not see with your Eyes, whose Candor
has bribed your Judgment, and I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to you as <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> are to
their Commentators for discovering
Beauties in them which they themselves
perhaps never so much as dreamt of.
Have you indeed been affected with my
Letters? 'Tis not through any Force of
theirs but the Goodness of your own
Temper. For Hearts so full of Love to
GOD, like Tinder, catch at every Spark.
But alas there is too much dry Wood in
the World to expect that such a languid
Flame should kindle it. Your Letters
<pb facs="tcp:50053:23"/>
indeed would be extremely useful, and I
think they are intire enough by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
nor do they need a Foil; so that
I cannot imagine to what Purpose mine
will serve, unless it be to decoy those to
a Perusal of them, who wanting Piety to
read a Book for its Usefulness, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
have the Curiosity to inquire what
can be the Product of a Womans Pen,
and to excite a generous Emulation in
my Sex, perswade them to leave their
insignificant Pursuits for Employments
worthy of them. For if one to whom
Nature has not been over liberal, and
who has found but little Assistance to
surmount its Defects, by employing her
Faculties the right way, and by a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Industry in it, is inabled to write
tolerable Sense, what may not they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
who enjoy all that Quickness of
Parts and other Advantages which she
wants? And I heartily wish they would
make the Experiment, so far am I from
coveting the Fame of being singular,
that 'tis my very great Trouble it should
be any bodies Wonder to meet with an
ingenious Woman.</p>
                  <p>If therefore you over-rule me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to have these Papers go abroad, it
<pb facs="tcp:50053:24"/>
shall be on these Conditions; first, that
you make no mention of my Name, no
not so much as the initial Letters; and
next, that you dedicate them to a Lady
whom I shall name to you, or else give
me leave to do it. For though none can
be less fond of Dedications, or has so little
Ambition to be known to those who are
called great; yet out of the Regard I
owe to the glorious Author of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
I cannot but pay a very great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to one who so nearly resembles
him. And where can a Discourse of the
Love of GOD be more appositely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
than to a Soul that constantly and
brightly shines with these Celestial
flames? One whom now we have duly sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
Measures, I may venture to say, I
love with the greatest Tenderness, for
all must love her who have any Esteem
for unfeigned Goodness, who value an
early Piety and eminent Vertue. All
true Lovers of GOD being like excited
Needles, which cleave not only to him
their <hi>Magnet,</hi> but even to one another.
A Lady, whom for the good of our Sex
I would endeavour to describe, were I
capable to write the Character of a
compleat and finished Person; but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb facs="tcp:50053:24"/>
a Soul as bright, as lovely, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
as her Ladyships, to give an exact
Description of such Perfections! A Lady
who dedicates that Part of her Life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to her Maker's Service, which the
generality think too short to serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Who in the Bloom of her Years,
despising the Temptations of Birth and
Beauty, and whatever may withdraw
her from <hi>Mary</hi>'s noble Choice, has made
such Advances in Religion, that if she
hold on at this rate, she'll quickly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip
our Theory, and oblige the World
with what was never more wanted than
now, an exact and living Transcript of
Primitive Christianity. So good she is
that even Envy it self has never a <hi>But</hi> to
interfere with her Praises, and though
Women are not forward to commend
one another, yet I never met with any
that had seen or heard of her, who did
not willingly pay their Eulogies to this
admirable Person, and if Praise be due to
any Mortal, doubtless she may lay the
greatest Claim to it. But not to relie
wholly on Report, I my self have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in her so much Sweetness and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
so free from the least Tincture of
Vanity, so insensible of that Worth

which all the World admires; such a
constant and regular Attendance on the
publick Worship of GOD, Prayers and
Sacraments; such a serious, reverent
and unaffected Devotion, so fervent and
so prudent, so equally composed of Heat
and Light, so removed from all Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Extremes of Coldness aud
Enthusiasme, as gave me a lively Idea of
Apostolical Piety, and made me every
Time I prayed by her, fancy my self in

as the Robe of Righteousness and the
Jewels of Piety. I am,</p>

            <head>Postscript to the Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THo' Authorities go but a very little way
with me in Questions whose Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
depends upon Measures of Reason, yet
finding that the great and general Objection
that lies against the present Conclusion is the
pretended Singularity of it, I think it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to set down a very signal Passage which
(since the writing the Preface) I have met
with in the late Continuation</hi> des Essais de
morale <hi>Part 2. Tom. 1. Pag. 59, where upon
that Text of St.</hi> Peter, I beseech you as strangers
and pilgrims abstain from fleshly Lusts, <hi>&amp;c. the
excellent Moralist has these Words,</hi> But what
is the Extent of these carnal Desires which St.
<hi>Peter</hi> forbids us? It is easie to mark it out. For
all that which is not God is carnal according to
the Scripture because it is a Consequence of the
Corruption of the Heart, which having separated
us from the Love of God has made the Soul wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to fill that Emptiness which she feels in her
self by the Possession of Creatures. Whether these
Objects are spiritual or Corporal, the Desires
which we have of them are always carnal in the
Language of Scripture. For which reasen it is
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts Dissentions and Emulations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Works of the Flesh. So that it is a no
less carnal Lust to desire Glory and Reputation,
and all that serves in order to it, than to desire
the Pleasures of the Body, because these Objects
are no more our true good than the other. God
does no more permit that we should part our Love
between him and Reputation, between him and
the <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Men, than between him and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb facs="tcp:50053:27"/>
and other Bodily Pleasures. For 'tis always
the Division of a thing which was all due to him.
'Tis always a Debasement of the Soul, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made for Good stoops beneath and degrades
her self in being willing to enjoy a Creature either
equal or inferiour to her self. God is great enough
to be the only and intire Object of our Heart, and
'tis to injure him to divide it, because 'tis in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to declare to him that he does not deserve it all.</p>
            <p>You see here is the Judgment of a whole
Society of great Men, no less than the illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Port Royal</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> in as clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Terms as can be to our purpose. 'Twere
infinite to appeal to all those Writers who
have either directly asserted this Conclusion,
or occasionally let fall Expressions that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and insinuate it. There is hardly a Book
of Morality or Devotion extant whererein
Passages of this Nature are not to be found.
I do not say there are many that offer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this Conclusion from Principles, but that
it is generally held, and upon all Occasions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
to and glanced at, which is enough to
shew the irresistible Prevalency of the Truth,
and to skreen them from the prejudice and
imputation of Novelty and Singularity, who
undertake upon a rational Ground to clear
and defend it.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THough some morose Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
wou'd perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to the Distaff or
the Kitchin, or at least to the Glass
and the Needle, the proper Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
as they fancy of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Life; yet expecting better
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50053:28"/>
things from the more Equitable
and ingenious Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> who is
not so narrow-Soul'd as to confine
Learning to his own Sex, or to
envy it in ours, I presume to beg
his Attention a little to the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies
of a Womans Pen. And
indeed Sir, there is some reason
why I, though a Stranger, should
Address to you for the Resolution
of my Doubts and Information of
my Judgment, since you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
my Natural Thirst for
Truth, and set me up for a <hi>Virtuso.</hi>
For though I can't pretend to a
Multitude of Books, Variety of
Languages, the Advantages of Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical
Education, or any Helps
but what my own Curiosity afford;
yet, <hi>Thinking</hi> is a Stock that no
Rational Creature can want, if they
know but how to use it; and this,
as you have taught me, with Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50053:28"/>
and Prayer, (which I wish
were as much practis'd as they are
easie to practise) is the way and
method to true Knowledge. But
setting Preface and Apology aside,
the occasion of giving you this
trouble is this:</p>
               <p>Reading the other day the Third
Volume of your excellent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
as I do every thing you
Write with great Pleasure and no
less Advantage; yet taking the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
that I use with other Books,
(and yours or no bodies will bear
it) to raise all the Objections that
ever I can, and to make them
undergo the severest Test my
Thoughts can put 'em to before
they pass for currant, a difficulty
arose which without your assistance
I know not how to solve.</p>
               <p>Methinks there is all the reason
in the World to conclude, <hi>That
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50053:29"/>
GOD is the only efficient Cause of
all our Sensations;</hi> and you have
made it as clear as the Day; and it
is equally clear from the Letter of
the Commandment, <hi>That GOD
is not only the Principal, but the</hi> sole
Object <hi>of our Love:</hi> But the reason
you assign for it, namely, <hi>Because
he is the only efficient Cause of our
Pleasure,</hi> seems not equally clear.
For if we must Love nothing but
what is Lovely, and nothing is
Lovely but what is our Good, and
nothing is our Good but what does
us Good, and nothing does us Good
but what causes Pleasure in us;
may we not by the same way of
arguing say, That that which
Causes Pain in us does not do us
Good, (for nothing you say does
us Good but what Causes Pleasure)
and therefore can't be our Good,
and if not our Good then not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50053:29"/>
Lovely, and consequently not the
proper, much less the only Object
of our Love? Again, if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of our Pleasure be upon that
account the only Object of our
Love, then by the same reason the
Author of our Pain can't be the
Object of our Love; and if both
these Sensations be produced by the
same Cause, then that Cause is at
once the Object of our Love, and
of our Aversion; for it is as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to avoid and fly from Pain, as
it is to follow and pursue Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?</p>
               <p>So that if these Principles, <hi>viz.
That GOD is the Efficient Cause of
our Sensations,</hi> (Pain as well as
Pleasure) <hi>and that he is the only
Object of our Love,</hi> be firm and
true, as I believe they are; it will
then follow, either that the being
the Cause of our Pleasure is not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50053:30"/>
the true and proper Reason why
that Cause should be the Object of
our Love, (for the Author of our
Pain has as good a Title to our
Love as the Author of our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;)
Or else, if nothing be the
Object of our Love but what does
us Good, then something else does
us Good besides what causes Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?
Or to speak more properly,
the Cause of all our Sensations,
Pain as well as Pleasure being the
only Object of our Love, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
being Lovely but what does
us Good, consequently, that which
Causes Pain does us Good as well
as that which Causes Pleasure; and
therefore it can't be true, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
does us Good but what
Causes Pleasure.</p>
               <p>Perhaps I have express'd my self
but crudely, yet I am persuaded
I've said enough for one of your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50053:30"/>
Quickness to find out either the
strength or weakness of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
I shall not therefore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you any further, but to beg
Pardon for this, and to wish you
all imaginable Happiness, (if it
be not absurd to wish Felicity to
one who already possesses a Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Large and Contemplative Soul,
and a quiet convenient Retirement,
which is indeed all the Happiness
that can be had on this side Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)

               <p>THough in Civility to your
Person, my Answer ought
to have been more speedy, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the weight of your Letter,
I think it cannot be well too slow,
and I hope you will in Equity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me some time to recover my
self out of that wonder I was cast
into, to see such a Letter from a
Woman, besides what was necessary
to consider the great and surprising
Contents of it. I find you throughly
comprehend the Argument of my
Discourse, in that you have pitch'd
upon the only material Objection
to which it is liable; which you
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50053:31"/>
have also press'd so well, and so very
home, that I can't but greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Light and Penetration of
your Spirit. One of your clear
and exact thoughts might easily sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your self in any Difficulty that
shall come in your way, as having
brightness enough of your own to
dispel any Cloud that may set upon
the Face of Truth; but however,
since you have condescended to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
your self to me for Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I shall endeavour as well as I
can to solve the Difficulty you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>I observe therefore first of all,
that you grant the two main things
contended for, <hi>viz. That God is the
only Efficient Cause of all our Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
and that by the Letter of the
Commandment, <hi>GOD ought to be
the Sole Object of our Love.</hi> Only
you say, that the Reason I assign
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50053:32"/>
for it seems not equally Clear, by
which I suppose you mean, that it
does not seem to follow from God's
being the only Cause of our Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that he is the only Object of
our Love; Or, that GOD is not
therefore the only Object of our
Love, because he is the only Cause
of our Sensations; that is in short,
you grant the things, but you
question the Connexion.</p>
               <p>Now before I consider the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
you urge against it, give
me leave to tell you that I think it
very clear, That not Absolute, but
Relative Good is the Formal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Love; that is, that we
love a thing not as it is good in it
self, but as 'tis good to us; and
consequently, GOD is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Love, not as he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
but as he is Relatively
Good, as he is our Good, or Good
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50053:32"/>
to us. For to Love GOD is to
desire him as our Good. I do not
deny but that the Absolute good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of GOD, the Natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of his Essence, is also the
true Object of our Love; but
not as Absolute, but as Relative;
that is, not as tis a Perfection in
him, but as the same may be a
Perfection to us, as it makes us
more happy by the Pleasure that we
take either in the Contemplation,
or in the Fruition of so glorious
and excellent a Being. So that the
absolute Perfection of GOD must
become relative before it can be
the Object of our Love.</p>
               <p>Indeed, when in thinking upon
GOD, we consider nothing but
an infinite Reality or Perfection,
we are ready to acknowledg that
Order requires we should <hi>esteem</hi>
him infinitely. But from this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50053:33"/>
we do not necessarily conclude
that we should adore him, fear
him, love him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> GOD consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
only in himself, or without
any Relation to us, does not excite
those movements of the Soul which
transport it to Good, or to the
Cause of its Happiness. Nothing
indeed is more clear, than that a
Being infinitely Perfect, ought to
be infinitely <hi>Esteem'd;</hi> and I am
apt to believe, that there is no
Spirit that can refuse <hi>GOD</hi> this
speculative Devoir, as consisting
only in a simple Judgment, which
is not in our power to suspend
when the Evidence is intire. So
that even wicked Men, those who
have no Religion, those who deny
Providence, may be suppos'd vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
to render <hi>GOD</hi> this sort
of Devoir. But then supposing
withall, that <hi>GOD</hi> (how perfect
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50053:33"/>
and good soever in himself) does
not at all interess or concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with us or our Affairs; and
that he is not the true and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Cause of all the good which
they enjoy, notwithstanding the
Notion they have of the Absolute
Perfection of <hi>GOD,</hi> they consider
him not as their good, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
do not apply themselves to
the Love of him, but brutally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the agreeable movements of
their Passions. From all which it
is is clear, that <hi>GOD</hi> is to be loved
not for his Absolute, but for his
Relative goodness.</p>
               <p>Now if it be true in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that Relative good is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Love, and that <hi>GOD</hi> is to
be lov'd as, and because he is our
<hi>good,</hi> then it will follow, that if
<hi>GOD</hi> only be our <hi>good,</hi> or the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <hi>good</hi> to us, then <hi>GOD</hi> only
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50053:34"/>
is to be lov'd by us. And so the
other way, that if <hi>GOD</hi> only be
to be lov'd by us, it must be, it
can be upon no other account than
as and because he only is our <hi>good,</hi>
as being the only true Cause of our
Pleasure. And I cannot imagine
upon what other ground you can
cast our Obligation to love <hi>GOD</hi>
only, (which you grant to be the
literal import of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
if not upon this, that he
only is our <hi>good.</hi> For as the reason
why we are to Love <hi>GOD</hi> at all,
is because he is our <hi>good,</hi> so the
reason why we are to Love him
only (which supposition you grant)
can be no other, but because he
only is our <hi>good.</hi> And since he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be our only <hi>good</hi> any otherwise,
than as he is the only true Cause
of our Pleasure, it follows, that
his being the only true Cause of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50053:34"/>
our Pleasure, is the true reason
why he ought to be the only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Love. This I think,
is clear and evident, and therefore
though I should rest here, as not
being able to Answer all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
to the contrary, this ought
not to be any prejudice to the
Truth of what is maintain'd. For
this I take to be a sure Rule, that
we are to stick to what we clearly
see, notwithstanding any Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that may be brought against it,
and not reject what is evident,
for the sake of what is obscure, it
being very possible for a Man to
be in sure and certain possession
of a Truth, though attended with
some Difficulties which he knows
not well how to solve. But let us
see whether yours are of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50053:35"/>
You say, if we must Love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is Lovely, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be Lovely but what is our
<hi>good,</hi> and nothing is our <hi>good</hi> but what
does us <hi>good,</hi> and nothing does us
<hi>good</hi> but what causes Pleasure in us,
may we not by the same way of
arguing prove, that what causes
Pain in us does not do us <hi>good,</hi> and
therefore can't be our <hi>good;</hi> and if
not our <hi>good</hi> then not Lovely, and
consequently is not the proper,
much less the only Object of our
Love? True, it is not so far as it
causes Pain; for the causing of Pain
as such, can be no reason of Love.
But I suppose your meaning is,
whether we may not by the same
way of arguing prove, that what
causes Pain is not at all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Love? To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That if that which causes
Pain does it in all respects after the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50053:35"/>
same manner as it causes Pleasure,
the causing of Pain will, for ought
I can at present see to the contrary,
be as good an Argument for its not
being to be lov'd, as its causing
Pleasure is for its being to be loved.
But thus it is not in the present Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
Though I acknowledge
Pain to be as truly the Effect of
GOD as Pleasure (for I know not
what else shou'd cause it) yet it is
not after the same manner the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of GOD as Pleasure is. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is the natural, genuine and
direct Effect of GOD, but Pain
comes from him only indirectly
and by Accident. For first, 'tis
of the proper Nature of GOD to
produce Pleasure, as consisting of
such essential Excellencies and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
as will necessarily beatifie
and make happy those Spirits, who
are, by being in their true rational
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50053:36"/>
Order, duly dispos'd for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of him. But if this same
excellent Nature occasion Pain to
other Spirits, this is only indirectly
and by Accident, by reason of their
Moral Indisposition for so Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
a Good. Again, as 'tis thus
in Reference to the Nature of
GOD, so in Reference to his Will.
GOD's antecedent and primary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
is the Happiness of all his
Creatures (for 'twas for this that he
made them) but if any of them, in
the event prove miserable, 'tis
wholly besides his first Design, and
only by a subsequent and seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Will. Again, when GOD
causes Pleasure, 'tis because he
wills it for its self, and naturally
delights in it, as comporting with
his primary Design which is the
Happiness of his Creatures; but
when he causes Pain, 'tis not that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50053:36"/>
he wills it from within, or for it
self (for so 'tis not at all lovely)
but only from without, and for the
sake of something else as it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the Order of his Justice.
For you are to consider, that if there
had been no Sin, there wou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have been such a thing as Pain,
which is a plain Argument that
GOD wills our Pleasure as we are
Creatures, and our Pain only as
we are Sinners. But now in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
our Devoirs to <hi>GOD,</hi> we
are not to consider how he stands
affected to us as sinners, but how
he stands affected to us as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
how he is disposed towards
us as we are <hi>his</hi> Work, and not as
we have made our selves. And
therefore if as Creatures he Loves
us, and Wills our Happiness, that
lays a sufficient Foundation for our
Love to him; and 'tis not his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50053:37"/>
treating us with Evil as sinners
that can overturn it.</p>
               <p>Indeed if <hi>GOD</hi> had designed us
for misery, and inflicted it upon
us as Creatures, if this had been
his primary and direct Intention,
his Natural and Original Will,
according to the systeme of those
who say, <hi>That GOD made Man on
purpose to Damn them,</hi> then indeed
I see nothing that should hinder
your Objection from taking place,
<hi>GOD</hi> would not then be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
much less (as you say) the
only Object of our Love, at least
as to those miserable Wretches so
destin'd to Ruin, which by the
way is to me a Demonstration of
the falshood of that strange Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis.
But upon the suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>GOD</hi> wills and causes
Pleasure in us as Creatures, and puts
us to Pain only as Sinners, there
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50053:37"/>
will not be the same reason for our
not loving him upon the account
of his being the Author of our
Pain, as for our loving him as the
Author of our Pleasure and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
For we stand obliged to
<hi>GOD</hi> as we are Creatures, and if
in that Relation <hi>GOD</hi> be our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor,
and the Author of our
<hi>good,</hi> he has a sufficient Right; and,
if the only Author, the only Right
to our Love, though as sinners he
puts us to pain, which being thus
will'd and effected by <hi>GOD</hi> after
a manner so different from our <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
cannot so well conclude for
our not loving him, as this does
for our loving him. Which may
serve to take off the force of your
first Instance.</p>
               <p>And will be equally applicable
to your second. For whereas you
further urge, that if both these
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50053:38"/>
Sensations, (<hi>viz. Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Pain</hi>)
be produced by the same <hi>Cause,</hi>
then that Cause is at once the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Love and of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version:
I answer by the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
that if both these Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
were to be produc'd by the
same <hi>Cause,</hi> acting alike in the one
as in the other, it would be as
you say. But since it is otherwise
as I have represented it, all that
you can argue from <hi>GOD</hi>'s being
the Author of our <hi>Pain</hi> as well as
<hi>Pleasure</hi> will be this, That he is
justly to be the Object of our
Fear, but not of our Aversion.
We are indeed to Fear him, and
him only, as being the <hi>true Cause</hi>
of all <hi>Pain,</hi> and only able to make
us miserable, according to that of
our Saviour, <hi>I will forewarn you
whom ye shall fear, &amp;c.</hi> But this is
no reason why we should hate him,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50053:38"/>
as never inflicting it but when Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Justice require it. And if
he did not inflict it then he would
be less perfect, and consequently
less amiable in the view of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and well-order'd Spirits. I
shall not determine any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Case of the Damn'd,
whether that invincible Love which
they have for Happiness may not
inspire them with an invincible
hatred against him who is the
Cause of their Misery. Perhaps
it may be so. Though whether
it should be so, and whether they
do not sin Eternally in so doing is
another Question. But I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
nothing here, thinking it
sufficient for my present purpose,
that this is no reason why <hi>GOD</hi>
should be the Object of any Mans
Aversion in this Life, whom as
the Author of Pain we are indeed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50053:39"/>
to Fear, but not to Hate, for the
reasons before alledged.</p>
               <p>Now as to your last Instance,
That if these Principles, <hi>viz. That
GOD is the Efficient Cause of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
Pain as well as Pleasure,</hi> and
that he is to be the <hi>only Object of our
Love,</hi> be firm and true, it will then
follow, either that the being the
Cause of our Pleasure (the doing us
good you should say to make a right
Antithesis) is not the true and
proper reason why that <hi>Cause</hi> should
be the Object of our Love, or else
if it be, then something else does
us Good besides that which causes
our Pleasure; or as you otherwise
word it, That which causes Pain
does us good as well as that which
produces Pleasure, I think neither
of these Consequences need be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
Not the First, because
I have shewn you, That God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50053:39"/>
the Cause of our Pleasure is a
sufficient and proper reason why he
should be the Object of our Love,
notwithstanding that Pain which
is also, but after a different manner
caus'd by him. As to what you sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
to the contrary, namely, That
the Author of our Pain has as good
a Title to our Love as the Author
of our Pleasure: 'Tis true, he that
is the Author of our Pain has as
good a Title to it as the Author of
our Pleasure, because they are both
one and the same; but not as he
is the Author of our Pain. He has
a Title to our Love not <hi>for</hi> that,
but <hi>notwithstanding</hi> that. 'Tis his
being the cause of our Pleasure that
makes him the proper Object of
our Love; which he is, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his being also the Author
of Pain. But then say you, if
his doing us good be the reason of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50053:40"/>
his being the Object of our Love,
then something else does us good
besides that which causes our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
namely Pain, the Cause of our
Sensations, Pain as well as Pleasure
being the Object of our Love. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
Pain may in some sense be said
to do us good, as it may occasion to
us some good that exceeds its own
proper Evil. But formally and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
it does not do us good, as not
making us while actually under it,
Happy but Miserable. Nor is there
need that upon our Supposition it
should, God being sufficiently love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to us as the Author of our <hi>Pleasure,</hi>
to which we need not add the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that may accrue by <hi>Pain,</hi> or
suppose <hi>Pain</hi> to be in it self as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
as <hi>Pleasure,</hi> 'tis enough if
the Evil of the former does not fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the Obligation that arises from
the good of the latter. As I have
shewn you that it does not</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:50053:40"/>
But after all Madam, there is
one thing I must further offer to
your Consideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That
your Objection, whatever force it
may have, is not peculiarly levell'd
against me, but lies equally against
all those who make the loveliness
of God to consist in his Relative
Goodness, or in his being our
Good, who I think are the most,
at least the most considerable. Those
of the common way say, God is
to be lov'd because he is our Good,
or the Author of our Good; which
Notion I think right, but only add
to it, That he is the only Author
of our Good, and therefore the
only Object of our Love. In which
Argument I suppose, these Men
would not deny the Consequence,
(as being the same with their own)
but only the minor Proposition.
But now if it be an Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50053:41"/>
my Notion, That God is
also the Author of Evil, then the
same will no less conclude against
the common way, proving as much
that God ought not to be lov'd at
all, as that he ought not to be
lovd only. I say it proves one as
well as the other, though I think
if you will attend to what I have
offer'd, you will find that it proves
neither.</p>
               <p>Madam, I have said all that at
present occurs to my Thoughts
upon this occasion, and I think as
much as is necessary, and have now
only to thank you for the great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of your Letter, assuring you
that whenever you shall be pleas'd
to do me that Honour again, you
shall have a speedier Answer from</p>
               <closer>

                  <p>ONE consideration more.
When you speak of <hi>GOD</hi>'s
being the cause of Pain, either you
mean as to this Life, or as to the
next. If as to the next, that has
nothing to do with the Duty that
we owe him here. If as to the
present Life, the pain that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
upon us here is only Medicinal,
and in order to our greater good,
and consequently from a Principle
of Kindness. And I think, setting
aside my other Considerations, there
will be no more pretence for not
loving or hating God for this, than
for hating our Physitian or Surgeon
for putting us to pain in order to
our Health or Cure.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU see how greedily I
embrace the advantageous
Offer you made me in the Close
of your excellent Letter; for which
I would return some Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments,
but that I want Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
suitable to its Value and
my Resentments. Nor is there
any thing in it from which I can
with-hold my Assent, but that too
favourable Opinion you seem to
have conceiv'd of a Person who
has nothing considerable in her but
an honest Heart, and a Love to
Truth. I am therefore exceeding
glad to find this noble and necessary
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50053:42"/>
Theory, <hi>That God is the sole Object
of our Love,</hi> so well establish'd. And
though any one of the three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
you argue from in your Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Discourse is a sufficient ground
for that Conclusion; though it may
be singly infer'd both from God's
being the Author of our Love, and
from the Obligation we are under
of conforming to his Will, as well
as from his being the true Cause of
our Pleasure, yet joyntly they are
irrefragable; and I have nothing
more left to wish, but that it were
as easie to perswade Men to fix the
whole weight of their Desire on
their Maker, as it is to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
that they ought to do it. For
when all is said, and all conclusions
are tried, there is no rest, no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for the Soul of Man but in her
God; she can never be at Ease nor
in Pleasure, but when she moves
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50053:43"/>
with her full bent and inclination
directly towards him, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and entirely depends on him.
Yet I am very well pleas'd that I
made the Objection which you
have so well resolv'd, because it has
procur'd me a clear and accurate
account of what before I had only
in confuse and indistinct Notion;
and has begun a Correspondence,
which if it may be continued I shall
reckon the greatest advantage that
can befall me. For though by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Rules, you have already
enrich'd the World with I may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
find out Truth, yet I can't
be assur'd I've done so, being too
apt to suspect my own Notions
merely for being my own, but if
they can pass so exact a Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
as your Judgment, I shall
without hesitancy subscribe to
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:50053:43"/>
So far am I from thinking that
<hi>GOD</hi>'s being the Author of our
Pain is any just Impediment to
our entire Love of him, that I'm
almost perswaded to rank it among
the Motives to it. For though
Pain considered abstractedly is not
a Good, yet it <hi>may</hi> be so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated,
and always <hi>is</hi> when
GOD inflicts it as to be a Good.
To the pious Man it is so both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally
and eventually; and
though inflicted as a Punishment
on wicked Men, it is however ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
good, being (as you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve)
an Act of GOD's Justice.
And I think it is an unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Maxim, that all our Good is
wholly and absolutely from GOD,
and all our Evil purely and intirely
from our selves. Whatever Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
<hi>GOD</hi> uses to draw us to
himself, I am fully perswaded are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50053:44"/>
good in themselves and good for
us, being they proceed from infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Goodness and tend towards
it. And therefore since he has
made us passible only for our
good, and designed Pain as well
as Pleasure in order to our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that by these two different
Handles he might the better move
and direct our Souls towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
their true and only Felicity, I
see no reason but to conclude that
he is every whit as lovely when he
produces Pain as when he causes
Pleasure.</p>
               <p>For the Truth is, my Letter
was principally designed in Favor
of a Notion which I have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
(and which you further
confirm me in by what you add
in your Postscript,) <hi>viz.</hi> That
Afflictions, by which we usually
understand something Painful, are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50053:44"/>
are not Evil but <hi>Good,</hi> which at
first seem'd to be contradicted by
your Assertion, That nothing does
us good but what causes Pleasure,
though upon second thoughts I
think they are consistent enough.
And if there by any shadow of a
difference, I suppose it arises only
from the equivocalness of the words
<hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> as in truth our
mistakes are chiefly owing to our
encumbring one word with divers
Idea's, most of the Controversies
that are in the World being (in
my Opinion) rather about words
than things.</p>
               <p>By Pleasure I suppose you mean
in general, all those grateful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
which Mankind is capable
of; that is, all such as are truly
agreeable to his Nature: For I
know not how it can consist with
the purity of the most holy <hi>GOD,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:50053:45"/>
to say, he is the Author of those
pleasing Sensations wicked Men
do, or <hi>pretend</hi> to feel in what we
call sinful Pleasures: so that we
must either conclude, that <hi>GOD</hi>
is not the Author of these irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Sensations, or else that they are
not Pleasures. I am for the latter,
and do indeed think it the greatest
nonsense in the World to call any
thing that is sinful pleasant.</p>
               <p>Pain you tell us, is nothing else
but a disagreeable Modification of
the Soul, an uneasie Thought oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
by some outward Bodily
Impression. In which Definition
there are two things considerable,
the Bodily Impression, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
Thought that is consequent
thereunto. And when you say
that <hi>GOD</hi> is the Author of Pain,
I suppose you mean no more than
that an uneasie Thought is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50053:45"/>
in the Soul of Man by the
Power and Will of <hi>GOD,</hi> at the
presence and by occasion of that
Impression which sensible Objects
make upon the Body. Now I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that this disagreeable Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is in the inferiour part of the
Soul, that which is exercis'd about
Objects of Sense, and does not
necessarily and directly affect the
superiour part, the Understanding
and Will, and therefore is no real
Evil to that which is properly the
Man. And this I take to be the
right Notion of Pain considered as
a Sensation, and as <hi>GOD</hi> is the
Author of it; but then I deny
that in this sense it is strictly and
properly an Evil.</p>
               <p>Now as this Sensation which
for distinction sake I will beg leave
to call <hi>sensible</hi> or Bodily Pain is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by some disorder in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50053:46"/>
parts of the Body, or else by the
presence of something disagreeable,
or absence of something necessary
to the well-being of the Bodily
Frame. In like manner, when the
Understanding and Will deviate
from the Order and Perfection of
their Nature, and are destitute of
their proper good, they are as truly
(and if they be in Health as sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly)
affected with Pain, as the
Body is when it suffers the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
displacences. This I
call <hi>mental</hi> Pain, and do reckon it
the only proper Evil of a Man,
both because the Mind being the
Man, nothing is truly and properly
his Good or Evil, but as it respects
his Mind; as also because so long
as he is under it, 'tis impossible for
him to enjoy any degree of real
Happiness. For where there is a
true Vital Principle, where the Soul
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50053:46"/>
is not quite mortified, or at least
Paralytick and Diseas'd, 'twill as
certainly feel Pain when 'tis thrust
out of its Natural Order, and does
not move towards <hi>GOD</hi> the true
Term of its Motion, as its Body
will when its Members are distort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
will be as sensibly affected
with craving and unsatisfied desires
when destitute of the Grace of
<hi>GOD,</hi> the proper aliment of the
Soul, as that is with Hunger and
Thirst when in lack of its neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Food; and will feel the same
uneasie chillness and darkness come
upon it when deprived of the Light
of <hi>GOD</hi>'s Countenance, that its
inferiour part does when it wants
the Sun's comfortable and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Beams. And this I take to be
the true meaning of what some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
call Desertion; pain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being as necessary to the Soul
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50053:47"/>
when she does not stand rightly
affected to her <hi>GOD,</hi> as to the
Body when under Sickness or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Violence: And in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the health of the Soul, and
the fineness of its Complexion, so
is the degree of its Pain when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
in its Motion towards
him.</p>
               <p>But can GOD in any sense be
said to be the Author of this Pain?
Hath he not taken all the Care that
is consistent with the Nature he
hath given us to secure us from it?
and has made all imaginable provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to prevent our falling into
that disorder which is necessarily
attended with mental Pain; so that
whenever we fall into it, 'tis purely
owing to our own Folly? For
though it be sometimes said that
GOD does arbitrarily withdraw
the chearing Beams of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50053:47"/>
which cannot but be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
to us so long as we are under
that Eclipse, yet for my own part,
I cannot think that he ever does it
unless to quicken our Desires and
exercise our Graces; and then,
since 'tis in order to our greater
good, it cannot strictly and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
be call'd an Evil. Or else,
'tis the noisom Vapours of our
Sins that raise a Cloud between us
and the Sun of Righteousness,
which being our own fault, we
only are to be blam'd for it. Nor
do I believe GOD ever denies his
Grace to any but such as have first
wilfully, obstinately and habitually
refus'd it. So that in fine, mental
Pain is neither more nor less than
Sin, which I take to be the true
and <hi>only</hi> Evil of a Man. For as
nothing is good but GOD, so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is essentially evil but Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50053:48"/>
nothing else is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the Essence of Goodness.
Since therefore GOD can in no
manner of Way be said to be the
Author of Sin, he cannot be the
Cause of mental Pain: And I know
no Hypothesis that does infer it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Predestinarian, which
for that Reason I look on as irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and absurd, and can scarce
forbear giving it severer Epithets.</p>
               <p>The short is, GOD is the
Author of Pain considered as a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and so he is of all our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and Powers; and as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from him it is <hi>good,</hi> designd
to do us <hi>good,</hi> and therefore our
<hi>good.</hi> But he is not the Author of
<hi>Pain</hi> considered as an Evil, as such
it is purely and entirely owing to
our selves; and since there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
truly and absolutely the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the hatred of a Rational
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50053:48"/>
Creature but Sin, because nothing
but that is its true and proper Evil,
consequently GOD's being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Pain can be no just bar to
our Love, much less any motive to
our Hatred or Aversion.</p>
               <p>I consider further, that though
Man does naturally desire <hi>Pleasure</hi>
in all his Capacities, and therefore
Indolence is necessary to perfect
Felicity, yet since there is no such
thing as perfect Happiness or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Misery in this World, that
which has a greater degree of <hi>good</hi>
than of <hi>evil</hi> in it, may properly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
be call'd a <hi>good;</hi> admitting
therefore that sensible Pain is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
to the lower Faculties of
the Soul, yet being it is designed
by GOD to better and improve the
Spirit of the Mind, and has a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to do good to our better
part, if we our selves do not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50053:49"/>
obstruct its operations, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply
and abuse those opportunities
it gives us, I see no reason but we
may reckon it a <hi>good,</hi> and therefore
Eligible. For though <hi>Pain</hi> (as
you say) does not formally and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
do us a <hi>good,</hi> yet if it cannot
hinder us of enjoying <hi>Pleasure,</hi>
methinks we have no just Cause to
fly it as an Evil. For what though
my Body suffer a little Hunger or
Thirst, or Cold, or the like, shall
I put that petty inconveniency in
competition with that most deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>Pleasure</hi> my Mind does, or
may at the same time enjoy in Acts
of Love and Contemplation? Nay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with that <hi>Pleasure</hi> which these
very inconveniencies occasion, the
entire Resignation of my Will to
GOD, and the Joy that arises from
that delightful Thought, that I am
capable of suffering something for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50053:49"/>
his sake, and in Conformity to his
Will: And as it were but a bad
bargain to gain the whole World
by suffering the least mulct or
damage in our Souls, so I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that the greatest sensible
Calamity, no not Death it self,
is worthy to be put in the ballance
with the very least spiritual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
For alas Sir, as you truly
say, this World is a mere shew, a
shadow, an emptiness! so little
Reason have our Pretenders to
Wit to discredit every thing that is
not the Object of Sense, that in
right estimate Spirits are the only
Realities, and nothing does truly
and properly occasion good or evil
to us but as it respects our Minds.
And I believe on these Principles
'twere easie to demonstrate that
Martyrdom is the highest Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
a rational Creature is capable
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50053:50"/>
of in this present State, a strange Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox
to the World! But I am
confident none to Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi>
who does not use to think after the
vulgar rate.</p>
               <p>But whilst I talk of Pain, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
how much you suffer by this
tedious Scribble. If I have said any
thing to the purpose 'tis because I
have your excellent <hi>Letter</hi> before me.
Ordinary Writers I can penetrate at
the first View, but every Period
of yours dilates my Mind, calls it
forth to pursue its recondite Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in a Train of useful and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Thoughts. I have brought in
my unwrought Ore to be refined
and made currant by the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Judgment, and shall
reckon it a great Favour if you
will give your self the Trouble to
point out my Mistakes, it being
my Ambition not to seem to be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50053:50"/>
without Fault, but if I can, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be so, and I know no way
more conducive to that end than
the Advantage of such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structor.</p>
               <p>Permit me to add a Word or
two more which is of greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
to me because of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Consideration; you have fully
convinced me that GOD is the
only proper Object of my Love,
and I am sensible 'tis the highest
Injustice to him and Unkindness to
my self to defraud him of the least
Part of my Heart; but I find it
more easie to recognize his Right
than to secure the Possession.
Though I often. say in your Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and Divine Words, <hi>No, my
fair Delight, I will never be drawn off
from the Love of thee by the Charms of
any of thy Creatures,</hi> yet alas, <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Beauty does too often press up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50053:51"/>
my Heart, whilst <hi>intelligible</hi> is
disregarded. For having by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
a strong Propensity to friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Love, which I have all along en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
as a good Disposition to
Vertue, and do still think it so if
it may be kept within the due
Bounds of Benevolence. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
likewise thought till you
taught me better, that I need not
cut off all Desire from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
provided it were in Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to, and for the sake of the
Creator: I have contracted such a
Weakness, I will not say by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(for I believe Nature is often
very unjustly blam'd for what is
owing to <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Custom)</hi> but by
voluntary Habit, that it is a very
difficult thing for me to love at all,
without something of Desire.
Now I am loath to abandon all
Thoughts of Friendship, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50053:51"/>
it is one of the brightest
Vertues, and because I have the
noblest Designs in it. Fain wou'd
I rescue my Sex, or at least as
many of them as come within my
little Sphere, from that Meanness
of Spirit into which the Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of 'em are sunk, perswade
them to pretend some higher Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
than a well-chosen Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tycoat,
or a fashionable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode;
and not wholly lay out
their Time and Care in the Ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of their Bodies, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
a Part of it at least in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishment
of their Minds, since
inward Beauty will last when out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is decayed. But though I
can say without boasting that none
ever loved more generously than I
have done, yet perhaps never any
met with more ungrateful Returns
which I can attribute to nothing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50053:52"/>
so much as the Kindness of my best
Friend, who saw how apt my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
were to stray from him, and
therefore by these frequent Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments
would have me learn
more Wisdom that to let loose my
Heart to that which cannot satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.
And though I have in some
measure rectified this Fault, yet
still I find an agreeable Movement
in my Soul towards her I love,
and a Displeasure and Pain when I
meet with Unkindness, which is a
strong Indication of somewhat
more than pure Benevolence; for
there's no Reason that we should
be uneasie because others won't let
us do them all the good we would.
And though your Distinction be
very ingenious, <q>That we may
seek Creatures <hi>for</hi> our good, but
not love them <hi>as</hi> our good,</q> yet
methinks 'tis too nice for common
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50053:52"/>
Practice; and through the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of our Senses, and Hurry
of our Passions, we shall be too
apt to reckon that our good whose
Absence we find uneasie to us.
Be pleased therefore to oblige me
with a Remedy for this Disorder,
since what you have already writ
has made a considerable Progress
towards a Cure, but not quite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
it. Thus you see Sir, what
a Trouble you have brought upon
your self by your obliging Condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centions

               </opener>
               <p>THE sincere Love you seem
to have for Truth, and
the great Progress you have made
in it, together with that singular
Aptness of Genius that appears to
be in you for further Attainments,
makes me not only willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a Correspondence with
you, but even to congratulate my
self the Opportunity of so uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
a Happiness. For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Improvement of which, and
that our Correspondence may be
the more useful, I would desire
that it may be continually imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon serious and important
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50053:53"/>
Subjects, such as may deserve the
Time, and reward the Pains that
shall be bestowed on them, and may
occasion such Thoughts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
to pass between us as may
serve to give true Perfection and
Inlargement to the Rational, and
right Movements and Relishes to
the Moral Part of our Natures.
And (since I have taken upon me
to prescribe) I would have these
Subjects well sifted and examined
as well as well chosen, that so we
may not enter upon a new Argument
till that which was first undertaken
be throughly discharged, whereby
we shall avoid a Fault very inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to common Conversation
(wherein new Questions are start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the first is brought to an
Issue) and which makes the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursings
of the most intelligent
Persons turn to so little an account.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50053:54"/>
But this Fault so frequent and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
unavoidable in the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
is easily remedied in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and therefore since we are
now fallen upon a noble and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
Subject, I desire we may go
to the Bottom of it, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
any new Matter till we
have gone over all that is of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Consideration in this of Divine
Love.</p>
               <p>So much by way of Proposal,
I proceed now to consider the
Contents of your present Letter, in
which I find very great and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
things, and such as will
deserve more, and more studied
Reflections than my present Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
(I fear) will permit me to
bestow upon them. However I
shall go as far as my Time and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
will allow, and if you think I
leave any thing considerable omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50053:54"/>
the Defects of this shall be
supplied in another Letter. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
then that though you declare
your self satisfied with the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
I gave in my last why
GOD's being the Author of Pain
should not strike off that Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Love which was grounded
upon his being the Cause of the
opposite Sensation of Pleasure, yet
(so greatly are you concerned to
have that ill Consequence effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
shut out) you advance another
Hypothesis for the Solution of the
Difficulty. And because it is very
ingenious and worth our consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I shall therefore first of all set
down what by comparing the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Parts of your Letter together
I take to be your Notion. Which
when I have stated and considered,
I shall reflect upon some single
Passages in your Letter that relate
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50053:55"/>
to it. And in this you have the
Model of the Answer that I intend.</p>
               <p>To begin then with an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of your Notion. You di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
of two Sorts of Pain;
that which is sensible or bodily,
and that which is mental. By sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Pain meaning that which is
in the inferiour Part of the Soul,
that which is exercised about Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Sense; and by mental Pain
that which affects the superiour
and intellectual Part. Now as
for mental Pain, that you allow to
be an Evil, and the only proper
Evil of Man, but then you say
GOD is not the Cause of that.
And as for sensible or bodily Pain,
that you allow GOD to be the
Cause of. But then you say that
is not truly and really an Evil,
as not affecting what is properly
the Man. And therefore though
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50053:55"/>
GOD be the true Cause of Pian
as well as Pleasure, yet since the
Pain which he causes is not of the
first Sort, <hi>viz.</hi> mental Pain
which is an Evil, but of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Sort, <hi>viz.</hi> sensible Pain
which is not the proper Evil of the
Man, this ought to be no Bar to
our Love of him, much less a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of making him the Object of
our Aversion. This I think is in
short your true System, which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus in a regular and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Draught may be the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
considered, which is the
Advantage I aim at by casting it
into this Form.</p>
               <p>My first Remark upon this is
that your Distinction of sensible
and mental Pain in the general is
right, and founded in the Nature
of things. For certainly the Ideas
of Joy and sensible Pleasure, Grief
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50053:56"/>
and bodily Pain are very distinct.
Some I know that pretend to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
confound these, making
that Pleasure or Pain (suppose)
which a Man feels upon his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near the Fire to be all one with
Joy or Grief. The Soul know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(say they) or feeling that the
Body which she loves is well or ill
disposed, that there happens some
good or ill to its mechanical
Frame, either rejoyces or is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at it. The one is our Pain, the
other our Pleasure. But this I
take to be gross Philosophy, though
the Authors of it think it fine. It
is true indeed, that as often as the
Sentiments of Pleasure or Pain do
give us notice that our Bodies are
well or ill disposed, we are affected
with Joy or Grief, but a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
may help us to perceive
that this Joy and Grief that are the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50053:56"/>
Consequences of our knowing
how 'tis with the State of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
differ exceedingly from those
antecedent Pains and Pleasures
whence the Information is receiv'd.
For these prevent our Reason,
whereas the other follow upon it.
Pain anticipates all Thought or
Reflection, but Grief supposes it
and is grounded upon it. I grieve
because I know my self to be in
Pain, or because I expect or fear
it, whence it is evident that my
Grief and my Pain are not one and
the same, but two very different
and distinct Sentiments. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
allow your Distinction,
though I am not so well satisfied
with the Ground of it. You
ground your Distinction of mental
and sensible Pain upon a double
Part of the Soul, the superiour
and the inferiour. The Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50053:57"/>
is authorised by Custom,
and (what is more) by you, but
I must own to you sincerely, that
I do not understand it. I have
heard much talk of this superiour
and inferiour Part of the Soul,
and have thought much about it,
but cannot for my Life form to my
self a clear Idea of any such Parts.
For besides that I think the Soul
has no Parts at all, if it had, sure
they are not such dissimular and
heterogeneous Parts as superiour
and inferiour, intellectual and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive.
The Soul I take to be an
intire simple uniform Essence, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
throughout, without
any Parts at all, much less such
heterogeneous Parts. Nor is
there any need that it should be
supposed to have any such for the
Establishment of the present Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.
The Distinction of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50053:57"/>
Sentiments does not need Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Parts in the Soul. The
same Essence of the Soul being
variously modified may be various<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected, and be capable of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Sentiments. Being modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
thus it shall be affected with
Grief, and being modified thus it
shall be affected with Pain, which
will be sufficiently distinguished
from each other, by saying that Pain
is a Modification of the Soul that
anticipates and prevents all Reason
and Reflection, and that Grief is
a modification that follows it, and
proceeds from it. Thus I choose
to distinguish them, rather than
by subjecting (as you) these two
Sensations in two parts of the
Soul, whereof I have no Idea;
or by calling (as others) that Pain
which the Soul suffers by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of the Body, and that Grief
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50053:58"/>
which the same Soul suffers in and
by her self without the Mediation
of the Body. For though accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Law of this State Pain
be always occasioned by some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Change in the Parts of the
Body, yet since 'tis the Soul that
truly feels it, and GOD that truly
raises it, I can easily conceive,
that GOD can, if he pleases,
raise the Sensation of Pain in her
though no Change be made in the
Body, nay though she had no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at all. That GOD for instance
can raise the Sensation of Burning
in the Soul without any Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Fire upon her Body. Which
by the way may serve to shew the
Impertinency of that Question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the School-men, how the
Soul that is an immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
can suffer when separate by
by a material Fire? For let them
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50053:58"/>
tell me how Fire affects the Soul
now she is in the Body, and I'll
tell them how it may torment it
when out of the Body. But this
by the by. The thing I directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
is, that since the Soul may be
capable of Pain as well without the
Mediation of the Body as with it,
this cannot be its Distinction from
Grief that it affects the Soul by the
Mediation of the Body.</p>
               <p>But to go on, as I am not satisfied
with the Ground of your Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
so neither am I with the
Use and Application you make of
it. Mental Pain say you is an
Evil, but such as GOD does not
cause. Again, sensible Pain GOD
does indeed cause, but then that is
not properly the Evil of Man.
Now I cannot accord with you in
either of these. As to the first,
I think it very certain that mental
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50053:59"/>
Pain being a real Modification of
the Soul is caused by GOD, who
alone is able to new modifie our
Souls, who only acts upon them
and is able to make them happy
or miserable, as I have sufficiently
proved in my Discourse of Divine
Love, and as you will evidently
perceive if you retire within your
self, and attentively consult your
Reason. And I wonder why you
should stick to allow GOD to be
the Author of mental <hi>Pain</hi> or
<hi>Grief,</hi> when you allow him to be
the Cause of mental <hi>Pleasure</hi> or
<hi>Ioy.</hi> If he be the Cause of our
Happiness, why cannot he be as
well the Cause of our Misery?
And if of <hi>Pain,</hi> why not of <hi>Grief?</hi>
For as to the other Part that sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pain which God causes, is not
properly an Evil, you will find it
very hard to perswade any one that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50053:59"/>
has felt it to this Paradox. That
I suppose which perswaded you to
it was your distinguishing the
Soul of Man into two Parts, a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
and an inferiour Part, the
Latter of which being not properly
the Man that Pain which is lodg'd
there cannot be said to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Evil of Man. Thus the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks
reasoned of old, and thus you
now. But besides, that this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of the Soul into a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
and inferiour Part which is
the Ground of this Supposition
wants it self a good Foundation.
I further consider, that if there
were such a thing as an inferiour
Part of the Soul, yet since the
higher is conscious of and affected
with what is transacted in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I do not see what Advantage
accrues from this Distinction.
And since 'tis the same Soul that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50053:60"/>
feels Pain and Grief, I see no Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of conceiving but that Pain
must be as truly an Evil as Grief.
And if 'twere put to my Choice,
there are several Degrees of Grief
that I would chuse to indure rather
than some Pains. And I would
fain know whether Pain be not
against the Happiness of Man, or
whether Happiness can consist
with it. You your self imply that
it cannot, when you say that <hi>Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is necessary to perfect Felicity.</hi>
And must not that then be an Evil
that is contrary to Happiness?
And should you not think your
self guilty of offending against that
Charity which you owe to your
Fellow-Creatures, and which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
you to wish and seek their
Welfare, if you should put any of
them without Cause to Bodily
Pain? Or would you try to bring
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50053:60"/>
your self off by your Distinction of
the superiour and inferiour Part of
the Soul? That the Pain which
you inflicted was only in the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Part, which being not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
the Man you could not be
said to have done any real Evil to
him, and so not to have trespassed
against Charity. I believe you
have too much good Nature as
well as Discernment to use such a
Plea as this: But now if Pain be
not a proper and real Evil, how
can it be against Charity to cause
it in any one? For what but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
an Evil to a Man can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to wishing well to him? It
must therefore be concluded that
sensible Pain is truly an Evil as well
as mental, evil I mean in it self for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
and simply considered, and
that it can become good only oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally
and consequentially, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50053:61"/>
it may be a Means to avoid a
greater Evil, or procure a greater
Good (and so may mental Pain
too) which when all is done I
think the best Apology that can be
offered for God's being the Author
of it, and to salve him from being
the Object of our Aversion upon
that Account, <hi>viz.</hi> to say, that
though sensible Pain be truly an
Evil as well as mental, and that
though <hi>GOD</hi> be the true Cause of
both, yet <hi>GOD</hi> does not will our
Pain as he does our Pleasure and
Happiness, for it self and as such,
but merely for the sake of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, as it is a means to our
greater good. And is therefore so
far from meriting our Hatred for
the Pain which he causes in us that
he ought for that very reason to be
loved by us, since 'tis for the sake
of Pleasure that he causes Pain.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50053:61"/>
This I take to be the most satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
Account of the Difficulty,
which as it resolves into what I
offered in my last so 'tis what you
your self think fit after all to take
up with as your last Expedient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the latter Part of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
where indeed you deliver your
self very nobly upon this Occasion.</p>
               <p>Madam, I have now done with
the Body of your Notion, and
have now only to consider some
looser Parts that relate to it. You
say you think it an unquestionable
Maxim that all our Good is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and absolutely from <hi>GOD,</hi> and
all our Evil purely and intirely
from our selves. The former
Part of this I absolutely allow and
contend for, concerning the latter
I distinguish, when you say that
all our Evil is purely and intirely
from our selves, if you mean of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50053:62"/>
moral Evil I grant it, but if you
mean of natural Evils then I must
distinguish again upon the Words
<hi>from our selves,</hi> which may signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
either a physical or moral, or
if you will, an efficient or a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Causality. We are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the meritorious Causes of all
our natural Evils, as bringing
them upon us by our Sins, but that
we are the <hi>efficient</hi> Causes of any of
them I deny. As all our good is
wholly from <hi>GOD,</hi> so in this
Sense is also our evil. We have
not the Power to modifie our
own Souls, and can no more raise
the Sensation of Pain in them than
that of Pleasure, <hi>GOD</hi> is the true
Author of both, as I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
shewn.</p>
               <p>You say again that Afflictions
are not evil but good, to which I
return that they are both in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50053:62"/>
Respects. They are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evil in their own formal Nature,
and simply in themselves consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and can be good only occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
or consequentially, as they
may serve as Means to some great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Good. And this I think may
serve to reconcile the Goodness of
Pain to that Assertion of mine,
that <hi>nothing does us good but what
causes Pleasure,</hi> that is, either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
and directly, or occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and consequentially, some Way or
other whatever does us good must
be supposed to cause Pleasure to us.
Now though Pain cannot cause Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
formally, as being a Sensation
formally distinct from it, yet it may
occasionally and consequentially,
and so may come within the Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of those things that do us good.</p>
               <p>You think fit to confine my
Sense of the Word <hi>(Pleasure)</hi> to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50053:63"/>
such only as are truly agreeable to
the Nature of Man, by which I
suppose you mean those Pleasures
which are called rational and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual.
To this I reply that it
seems to me very evident, and I
think I have elsewhere made it so,
that <hi>GOD</hi> is the true Cause of all
the Pleasure that is resented by
Man. But you say you know not
how it can consist with the Purity
of the most holy <hi>GOD</hi> that he
should be the Author of those plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Sensations which wicked
Men feel in what we call sinful
Pleasures. But 'tis your Mistake
to suppose that sensual Pleasures as
such are evil, or that there is any such
thing as a sinful Pleasure properly
speaking. As Sin cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
pleasant, so neither can Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
be formally sinful. All Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in it self is simply good, as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50053:63"/>
being a real Modification of the
Soul, 'tis the circumstantiating of
it that is the Evil. And of this
<hi>GOD</hi> is not the Cause, but the
Sinner, who rather than forego
such an agreeable Sensation will
enjoy it in such a Manner and in
such Circumstances as are not for
his own or for the common Good,
and therefore unlawful. But
concerning this matter you may
further satisfie your self out of
the Letters between Dr. <hi>More</hi> and
<hi>Me,</hi> and by reading the first and
second Illustration M. <hi>Malebranch</hi>
makes upon his <hi>De la Recharche de
la Verite.</hi> Where he shews you
that <hi>GOD</hi> does all that is real in
the Motions of the Mind and in the
Determinations of those Motions,
without being the Author of Sin.</p>
               <p>There are two other Passages in
your Letter which I know not how
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50053:64"/>
to assent to till I better compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
them. One is, that mental
Pain is the same with Sin, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, that Sin is the only true E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
of Man. I cannot stay long
upon these, but as to the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that Sin is an Act, and Pain
a Passion of the Soul; and that
Pain is a real Modification of our
Spirit, whereas Sin in its Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is not any thing positive but a
mere Privation, I say besides this,
if mental Pain be the same with
Sin, how shall we distinguish
Sin from the Punishment of it?
And how shall a Man repent for
his Sin? For if mental Pain be
the same with Sin, then to be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for one Sin will be to commit
another. Then as to the other
Part that Sin is the only evil of Man,
I grant it is the greatest, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think it the only one; for besides
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50053:64"/>
that mental Pain is as I have shewn
an Evil distinct from it, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a thing call'd Bodily Pain, which
I have also shewn to be an Evil.</p>
               <p>Now Madam as to what you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of me in the Conclusion of
your Letter, if you think that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of mine of seeking Creatures
<hi>for</hi> our good, but not loving them <hi>as</hi>
our good too nice. I further illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
it thus, you are to distinguish
between the Movements of the
Soul and those of the Body, the
Movements of the Soul ought not
to tend but towards him who only
is above her, and only able to act
in her. But the Movements of the
Body may be determined by those
Objects which environ it, and so
by those Movements we may unite
our selves to those things which
are the natural or occasional Causes
of our Pleasure. Thus because
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50053:65"/>
we find Pleasure from the Fire,
this is Warrant enough to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
it by a Bodily Movement,
but we must not therefore <hi>love</hi> it.
For Love is a Movement of the
Soul, and that we are to reserve
for him who is the true Cause of
that Pleasure which we resent by
Occasion of the Fire, who as I
have proved is no other than <hi>GOD.</hi>
By which you may plainly perceive
what 'tis I mean by saying that
Creatures may be sought <hi>for</hi> our
good, but not loved <hi>as</hi> our Good.
But after all I must needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that this (as all our other
Duties) is more intelligible than
practicable, though to render it so
I know no other Way than by
long and constant Meditation to
free our Minds of that early Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
that sensible Objects do act
upon our Spirits, and are the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50053:65"/>
of our Sensations, carefully to
distinguish between an efficient
Cause strictly so called, and an
Occasion, to attribute to GOD and
the Creature their proper Parts in
the Production of our Pleasures,
to bring our selves to a clear Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and habitual Remembrance
of this grand Truth, (the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Morality) that GOD
only is the true Cause of all our
Good, which when fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of we shall no longer question
whether he ought to be the only
Object of our Love. <hi>I am,</hi>

               </opener>
               <p>SO candid and condiscending
a Treatment of a Stranger, a
Woman, and so inconsiderable an
one as my self, shews you to be
as much above the Generality of
the World in your Practice, as
you are in your Theory and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.
Hitherto I have court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Truth with a kind of Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Passion, in spite of all Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and Discouragements: for
knowledge is thought so unnecessary
an Accomplishment for a Woman,
that few will give themselves the
Trouble to assist them in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of it. Not considering
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50053:66"/>
that the meliorating of one single
Soul is an Employment more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a wife Man, than most of
those things to which Custom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates
the Name of Business
and Affairs. But now, since you
have so generously put into my
Hand an Opportunity of obtaining
what I so greedily long after, that
I may make the best Improvement
of so great an Advantage, I give
up my self entirely to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
so far as is consistent with a
rational not blind Obedience, bring
a free and unprejudiced Mind to
receive from your Hand such Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
and Impressions as shall seem
most convenient, and though I
can't engage for a prompt and
comprehensive Genius, yet I will
for a docible Temper.</p>
               <p>The Esteem I have for those neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and useful Rules you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50053:67"/>
prescribed, shall appear by
my strict Observation of them.
For indeed the Span of Life is too
short to be trifled away in uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
and unprofitable Matters;
and that Soul who has any Sense of
a better Life, can't chuse but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that every Minute of her Time
may be employed in the regulating
of her Will with the most critical
Exactness, and the extending her
Understanding to its utmost
Stretch, that so she may obtain
the most enlarg'd Knowledge and
ample Fruition of <hi>GOD</hi> her only
Good, that her Nature is capable
of. I will therefore pass on to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
a little what I asserted in my
last, next add a few Thoughts
concerning Divine Love, and in
the last place a Proposal or two
for the better Prosecution of those
you have already made.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:50053:67"/>
               <p>Now in order to the first, I
am very well satisfied that <hi>GOD</hi>
is the Cause of Mental as well as
Bodily Pain, if by mental Pain you
understand Grief, my Mistake ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this, that I confounded Sin
and mental Pain. 'Tis indeed evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that Sin and Grief are two
distinct things; yet I cannot form
to my self any Idea of Sin which
does not include in it the greatest
Pain and Misery. For as Sin is
the meritorious Cause of all Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
so it seems to me that the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of Sin is concomitant
to the Act; Misery is inseparable
from Sin, and the Sinner is <hi>ipso
facto</hi> punished. When therefore
I said that mental Pain is the same
with Sin, I meant no more than
this, that as a musical Instrument,
if it were capable of Sense and
Thought, wou'd be uneasie and in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50053:68"/>
pain when harsh discordant Notes
are plaid upon it, so Man, when
he breaks the Law of his Nature
and runs counter to those Motions
his Maker has assign'd him, when
he contradicts the Order and End
of his Being must needs be in Pain
and Misery. And as the Health
and Perfection, Ease and Pleasure,
Good and Happiness (or whatever
you will call it) of a Creature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in its Conformity to the End
of its Creation, and the being in
such Circumstances as are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to its Nature, from which
when in the least it deviates it lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
both its Beauty and its Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
so the Soul of Man being
made on purpose for the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
and Love of <hi>GOD</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it ceases to pursue that End,
must needs be put out of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of its Nature, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50053:68"/>
depriv'd of all Pleasure and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
whilst it stands rightly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
towards <hi>GOD</hi> it cannot be
destitute of Pleasure, but whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
sets it in Opposition to him
does by that Act deprive it of all
Delight.</p>
               <p>So that my Hypothesis will lie
thus: That although <hi>GOD</hi> only
has Power to modifie the Soul of
Man, and to affect it with Pain
and Grief, yet since these are rather
<hi>Uneasinesses</hi> than Evils strictly so
call'd (nothing according to my
Notion being the proper Evil of
Man but Sin, of which more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non)
since they are design'd by
<hi>GOD</hi> as Mediums to good, and
are, if not formally, yet at least
consequentially Occasions of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
since the wilful and affected
Ignorance of the Understanding
and Pravity of the Will, or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50053:69"/>
Words Sin is the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Evil of a Man, because Sin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is absolutely and directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the Essence of Goodness;
and seeing <hi>GOD</hi> can no way be
said to be the Author of Sin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
his being the Cause of
our uneasie Sensations, can be no
just Bar to our Love, much less
any Motive to our Aversion.</p>
               <p>As for the Distinction of the
Soul into inferiour and superiour
Part, I am as little satisfied with
it as you can be, and do confess to
you ingeniously that I have no
clear Idea of that which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
my self, nor do I well know
how to distinguish its Powers and
Operations: For the usual Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
that are given of the Soul
are very unsatisfactory, that in your
Letter being the best I have met
with and therefore for want of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50053:69"/>
Expressions, I made use of this
Distinction, which I did the more
readily because I learned it from
your <hi>Christian Blessedness,</hi> P. 158.
All the remaining Difference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lies in this Question, <hi>whether
Sin be the only Evil?</hi> And in order
to the removing it, I shall first
shew you my Design in affirming
that it is, and then the Reasons
that incline me to it, and when I
have done so I will refer all to
your better Judgment.</p>
               <p>First, for what I aim at, I have
observ'd that most of the Folly
and Mischief that is in the World
proceeds from false Notions of
Pain and Pleasure, and Mistakes
concerning the Nature of good
and evil. For would Men be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that GOD is their only
good, so they might enjoy him
they would not much regret the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50053:70"/>
Absence of other things; neither
would they so greedily pursue the
Shell of Pleasure, nor fix their
Hearts on sensible Objects which
can never satisfie. And were they
but convinced that nothing is so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
as Sin, they would not <hi>choose Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
rather than Affliction.</hi> As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Account of Pleasure does
rectifie the Errors of our Love, so
I could wish that our Aversions
were better regulated than they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
are; and that Sin, which
though it be not the <hi>efficient,</hi> is yet
the <hi>moral Cause</hi> of all our Evils and
Displeasures, were so represented
as that it might appear the only
proper and adequate Object of our
intire Hatred and Aversion. This
is my Design.</p>
               <p>Now for the Reasons (besides
what are already intimated) which
incline me to think that Sin is the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50053:70"/>
only Evil. I grant that whatever
is contrary to the Pleasure and
Good of Man in any of his Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
may in some Sense be call'd
an Evil, and in this Latitude no
doubt but that both mental and
sensible Pain are Evils. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
when we speak of Evil we
usually understand something that
in its own Nature is the proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Aversion, evil as evil
being no way eligible; and since
mental and bodily Pain are not so
far evil but that in some Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
they may become eligible,
which yet they could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
assuming the Nature of good,
and therefore they are not pure and
absolute Evils. And further,
though 'tis easie in our Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Retirements to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
between greater and lesser
Evils, to compare and weigh them
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50053:71"/>
together, and to allot to each its
due Proportion of Choice or Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
yet since good and evil do
frequently present themselves to our
Minds in common Conversation
and Business, when we have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Time nor Appetite to abstract
and consider, but are determin'd
by this short and obvious Sillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism,
<q>Evil is not eligible, but
such a thing is Evil, therefore it
is not to be chosen:</q> Whereas
perhaps that which we refuse as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
(suppose bodily or mental Pain)
though formally, and in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Latitude of the Word it be an
Evil, yet comparatively and <hi>pro hic
&amp; nunc,</hi> it may be a Good, and so
the proper Object of our Choice.
To avoid which common Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mistake, and because the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man has so strong an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to every thing that bears the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50053:71"/>
Name of Evil, I wou'd rather call
Grief and Pain <hi>Uneasinesses</hi> than E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and wholly appropriate the
Name of Evil to Sin, which is

rather than commit the least sin. For
(not to dispute what Good <hi>GOD</hi>
may bring out of the Sins of Men,
or how he does it, which are Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
I will not now meddle with)
I have always thought that the least
moral Evil is not to be chosen, no
not in order to the greatest Good, as
I think may be inferred from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
arguing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. there is a
certain Peculiarity of Evil in Sin,
which (though you will not allow it
the only Evil, yet at least) renders it
an Evil paramont to all other Evils,
and excludes it from the least degree
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50053:72"/>
of Eligibility. For though Pain and
Grief put the Soul into uneasie
Circumstances, yet they don't with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
her from her true Good, they
rather excite her more strongly to
cleave to him, and that Trouble
which sensible things occasion, and
which she feels through the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of her own Thoughts, stirs
her up to fix more firmly on him,
whose Comforts in this Case are
her only Refreshment, whereas
Sin quite alienates the Soul from
her only true Good, and thereby
deprives her of the sole Prop she
has to rest on, and consequently
puts her in the most wretched,
helpless and evil Condition. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing but Sin has something of
good in it, because every thing
else proceeds from <hi>GOD;</hi> but Sin
is all over perfect Deformity, an
uncompounded Evil, and a direct
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50053:73"/>
Contradiction to Order and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and consequently to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and therefore is, or ought to
be, set at the greatest Opposition to
the Nature of Man, and to be the
proper Object of his intire Hatred
and Aversion. This is the Point I
drive at, and if it may be gained
am very indifferent whether it be
by mine, or some other Way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed to the next
Particular I have two Requests,
one is, That you would please to
oblige me with a Definition of
Pleasure; and the other, That you
would a little explain the Idea of
Pain, for I don't well understand
your Meaning when you say, <hi>That
Pain anticipates all Thought or Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
I did suppose it to be an <hi>unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
Thought,</hi> and how then can it
anticipate all Thought? The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50053:73"/>
Impression indeed prevents
Thought, but that is not properly
the Pain but the Occasion of it.</p>
               <p>Now in the next place to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
your Desire which falls in so
much with my own Inclinations,
<hi>That I should further communicate my
Thoughts concerning divine Love;</hi> a
Subject on which 'tis easie to be
endless, and yet impossible to say
too much: I take it to be the Sum
and Substance of all Religion, to
which all other Duties are reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which are but so many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Modifications of this Soul that
animates the Christian Life: And
therefore such Discourses as serve to
lay its Foundation deep, and raise
its superstructure high, such as
bring it Fuel by rational Motives,
and fan its Flame by devout and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
Expressions, do the Work of
Religion all at once; for were this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50053:74"/>
Divine Principle but once firmly
rooted in our Hearts, and suffered
to display it self in all its necessary
Effects and Consequences, 'twould
supercede all other Instructions, and
be instead of a Thousand Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>The Love of <hi>GOD</hi> is both the
best Preservative against Evil (in
its greatest Latitude) and the
strongest Impellent to good. 'Tis
the best Antidote against Sin, in
that it disarms Temptations of all
their Force, they cannot fasten
upon the Soul that entirely loves its
Maker. He who believes <hi>GOD</hi>
to be his only Good, if he attend
at all to that Conviction, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wilfully sin against him. For
Sin being a Disconformity to <hi>GOD,</hi>
a willing something contrary to his
Nature and Will, 'tis not possible
for a Man to chuse that which he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50053:74"/>
believes to be contrary to his only
Good, and which will therefore
consequently deprive him of it.
And it being nothing else but the
false Appearance of some seeming
Good that inclines a Man to chuse
amiss, he who considers <hi>GOD</hi> as
his only Good, and loves him
with an Entireness of Affection,
has shut up all the Avenues of his
Soul from that <hi>Syren</hi> apparent
Good, and is not capable of being
bewitch'd by it. Indeed if we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Creature to be in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
our good, 'tis hard to keep our
selves from desiring it, and if we
permit Desire, we can never be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from irregular Love, that
Shame and Misery of Mankind, it
being easier not to desire at all than
to desire with Moderation. For
Love is an insinuating Passion,
and where-ever 'tis admitted, will
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50053:75"/>
spread and make its Way. And
though the Charms of the Creature
be infinitely unworthy to rival
those of the Creator, yet they have
this Advantage, that they perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
press upon the outward Man,
and constantly present themselves
to our Senses, so that if we allow
them the least Share in our Hearts,
'tis odds but that at last they whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
withdraw it from him who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
has a Right to it.</p>
               <p>And as the Love of <hi>GOD</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
our Innocence, so it makes
the best Provision for our Pleasure.
The Soul of Man may as well
cease to <hi>be</hi> as cease to love; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
or other it must desire, but
so long as it moves towards the
Creature, it may amuse its Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
but can never satisfie them.
How often will the Objects of our
Love be wanting? How often
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50053:75"/>
will the Objects of our Love
be wanting? How often will
they be unkind? And suppose
them as present and as kind as
we can wish them, shall we
not be as sick of our Fruitions
as we were of our Desires?
For what is there in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
but Emptiness, Vanity and
Vexation? But the Object of
Divine Love is always essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
present, nothing can hide
him from us but our own Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect;
if we do but fix the
Eyes of our Understanding on,
and direct the Motions of our
Will towards him, we may
always contemplate and enjoy
his Beauty; may always as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage
our Thirst at this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and feast our hungry Souls
upon his never-failing Charms,
which though they will still
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50053:76"/>
draw us on to pursue a further
Enjoyment, because of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Amability and Perfection,
yet all along they will satisfie
and fill our Souls with unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Delight; though they don't
extinguish all Desire, yet they
will remove all Emptiness, and
at once replenish our Faculties
and enlarge them! But these ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
Delights which the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured
Soul feels in every Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to her Divine Lover are
better felt than expressed, and
when we have once tasted of
these most sapid Pleasures, we
shall for ever disdain the muddy
Streams of sensual Delights!</p>
               <p>Thus the Love of <hi>GOD</hi>
defends us from the Uneasiness
of Pain and Grief, as well as
from the Evil of Sin, and makes
us happy in all our Capacities.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50053:76"/>
It is so Divine a Cordial, that the
least Drop of it is able to sweeten
and outweigh all the Troubles of
this present State, and render the
most Calamitous Condition not
only <hi>easie</hi> but <hi>joyous.</hi> For it
gives an Anticipation of those
Joys in which it will at last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
us, brings down Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Bosoms e're it carries
us up thither; and were it but
largely shed abroad in our Hearts,
we should be out of the Reach
of Fortune, might slight and
trample on all Afflictions. Though
the Arrows of Pain and Grief
should ruffle our Skin, they could
not touch our Hearts; or they
might touch but could not hurt
us!</p>
               <p>Finally, to what Heights of
Piety will not this Divine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
elevate the amorous Soul!
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50053:77"/>
For what can be too difficult to
do to acquire a more perfect En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of what we love? What
can be too hard to suffer for the
sake of that Object that hath won
our Heart? 'Tis nothing else that
cramps our Endeavours, and slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
our Industry after one of the
brightest Crowns of Glory, but
the dividing our Love between
<hi>GOD</hi> and Mammon. If a
foolish ill-grounded Passion can
many times excite the Soul in
which it dwells to do things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it self, If the Love of dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Clay, or popular Breath can
reconcile us to Fatigues and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses,
and many things very
uneasie to our Animal Nature,
shall not the most rational and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Love, that Love which is
the End and Perfection of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which is secured from Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50053:77"/>
Jealousie, and all that
long Train of Pain and Grief
which attends Desire when it
moves towards the Creature, set us
above all Difficulties, render our
Obedience regular constant and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
refine and sublimate our
Natures, and make us become An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
even whilst we dwell on

               </opener>
               <p>IT deserves neither your Thanks
nor your Admiration that I
should endeavour to be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
civil to a Person of your extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Worth and Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which indeed appear so
great and so beyond what I ever
yet found or could imagine, as at
the same time to command and les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
the highest Respect and Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that can be shewn to you.
Your Hypothesis, as you now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
and rectifie it, runs clear and
unperplext, and has nothing in
it but what equitably understood
challenges my full Consent and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50053:79"/>
Approbation. The Defect of it
before lay partly in your supposing
<hi>GOD</hi> not to be the Author of
mental Pain (and that because you
made mental Pain to be all one
with Sin) and partly in your sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
sensible Pain of which you
allow'd <hi>GOD</hi> to be the Author,
not to be in it self a real Evil. But
now both these Faults are mended,
and all is right and as it should be.
For whereas before when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
mental Pain with Sin,
you pleaded thus against our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and for our loving <hi>GOD</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Pain which he is
acknowledged to inflict upon us,
mental Pain is truly an Evil, but
such as <hi>GOD</hi> does not cause, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Pain <hi>GOD</hi> does cause, but
then that is not truly an Evil.
Now distinguishing mental Pain
from Sin, and substituting Sin in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50053:79"/>
the room of mental Pain, you make
your Apology for the Love of <hi>GOD</hi>
run thus, Sin which is truly an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<hi>GOD</hi> does not cause, and as for
mental and sensible Pains whereof
<hi>GOD</hi> is the true Cause, they are
not truly and properly Evils. By
which latter Clause I presume you
mean not as you seem'd to do at
first, that they are not truly and
properly Evils in their own formal
Natures and as simply in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
considered (for so 'tis evident
that they are Evils, as being as such
against the Happiness and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
of a thinking and self-consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Nature) but only as in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Supposition, Juncture or
Circumstance wherein they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
by <hi>GOD,</hi> who having a
thorough comprehensive View of
our whole Condition, and so
knowing what upon all Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50053:80"/>
is best for us, thinks it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseable
sometimes to molest and
trouble our Repose with mental
or sensible Pain, not for their own
sakes, or that he is delighted in
them as such any more than we our
selves are, but in order to our
Good, and as they are necessary
Means to avoid some greater Evil.
In which respect both Pain and
Grief (though evil in their inward
formal Natures) do relatively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
so far put on the Nature of
Good as to be truly eligible, and
would not fail to be actually willed
and chosen by us for our selves, as
by GOD for us, if we had the
same Views and Prospects of
things that he has. In this Sense it is
very true and certain that both the
mental and the sensible Pain which
<hi>GOD</hi> inflicts in this Life (for as
to the Misery of the next I do not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50053:80"/>
apprehend the present Question
concerned in it) are not, all things
considered, truly and properly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
because upon the whole they
are eligible, which Sin can never
be, it being a contradictory Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that that should be eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as a Means to avoid a greater
Evil, which is it self the greatest
of all. And herein I take it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
the Peculiarity of the Evil of
Sin, that it is never eligible, but
always the due and just Object of
our Hatred and Aversion. So that
if in this Sense you will have Sin to
be the only Evil, that whereas all
other Evils are not so far Evils but
that in some Junctures and Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
they may become good and
eligible, Sin as being the greatest
Evil can in no Supposition imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
become good, but remains
ever a fixed and unchangeable Evil,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50053:81"/>
as GOD does a Good, without
the least Variation or Shadow of
turning, I intirely consent with
you, and do and hope always shall
think Sin to be thus the only Evil.
And since GOD is not the Author
of Sin which can never be eligible
but only of our uneasie Sentiments
which in some Circumstances may,
and then are no longer to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as Evils, this gives clear and
full Satisfaction to that Objection
against the Love of GOD taken
from his being the Cause of our
painful Sensations. And I can
now well conceive that GOD is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
lovely and to be loved by us,
not only when under the little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Uneasinesses of Life, but
when most miserable and afflicted,
even by a Martyr in his Flames.
And so we are come to a fair Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of this Difficulty concerning
the Love of GOD.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:50053:81"/>
As to what you say concerning
the Inferiour and Superiour Part
of the Soul, that you the rather
us'd this Distinction because you
learnt it from my Christian Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I confess that I do there
make use of this Scheme of Speech,
not intending thereby two parts of
the Soul Really and Physically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
but only the same Soul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly
consider'd, with respect to
different Objects and ways of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
In consideration of which
it is usually divided into Parts in a
popular way of speaking, which in
a popular Discourse and where
there was nothing of particular
Theory depending upon it, I had
no reason to depart from, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to comply with. But when
Good or Evil, Grief or Pain come
to be distinguished by their being
lodg'd in this or that part of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50053:82"/>
Soul in the Superiour or Inferiour
Part (which must then signifie
Parts really Distinct) I then deny
that there are any such Parts. In all
other Cases I should not scruple to
speak in the common Language,
not apprehending that I should
give any one thereby just occasion
to think that I held two real Parts
in the Soul, any more than by using
another popular mode of speaking
of the Vegetative, Sensitive, and
Rational Soul in Man, that it was
my real Opinion that he had three
Souls.</p>
               <p>I like your Ingenuity in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
that you have no Clear Idea
of that which is properly your self,
and I further tell you, that you
never will have while you are in
this State. We do not know our
Souls here by any Idea of them,
(as not seeing them yet in GOD)
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50053:82"/>
but only by Consciousness or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Sentiment, which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that the Knowledge we have of
them is so imperfect. We see Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
by their Idea's, but we know
no more of our Souls than what
we feel to be done in them. I
forbear enlarging upon this matter,
though a very noble and useful point
of Speculation, because you may
find a most excellent Account gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of it by <hi>M. Malebranche</hi> in the
7th Chapter of his Third Book <hi>de
la recherche de la Verite,</hi> page 352.
And again more at large in his Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration
upon that Chapter, <hi>page</hi>
461. of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> Edition. And
the same most excellent Person
elsewhere, <hi>viz.</hi> in his <hi>Meditations
Chrestiennes</hi> of <hi>Cologne</hi> Edition, <hi>page</hi>
152, gives a very satisfying Account
of the Reasons why it has not
pleased <hi>GOD</hi> to give us an Idea of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50053:83"/>
                  <hi>our own Souls, The first of which
is, that if we did see clearly what
we are, we could not be so closely
united to our Bodies as is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the preservation of this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Life. We should not look
upon it as a Part of our selves, and
unhappy as we are at present, we
should not think it worth our Care
to preserve it, and consequently ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so little Value and Regard for
it we should have no Sacrifice to
offer to GOD,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>His other
Reason he pursues more at large,
and because 'tis one of the loftiest
Strains of Reason and Eloquence
that I ever met with, I shall give it
you as near the Original as I can
translate it from the Author, who
thus brings in the eternal Wisdom,
speaking to her Disciple.</hi> Seconde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
parce que l'Idee d'une ame est
un Object si grand, &amp; si capable de
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50053:83"/>
ravir les Esprits de sa beuatè, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Secondly, because the Idea of a Soul is
an Object so great and so apt to ravish
Spirits with its Beauty, that if thou
hadst an Idea of thy Soul, thou wouldst
be no longer able to think upon any thing
else. For if the Idea of Extension which
represents only Bodies, does so strongly
touch Natural Philosophers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians,
that they oftentimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
all their Duties to contemplate it.
If a Mathematician has so much De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
when he compares Bignesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves thereby to discover
their Relations that he often sacrifices
his Pleasures and his Health to find out
the Properties of a Line, what Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
would not Men bestow upon the
Research of the Properties of their own
Being, and a Being infinitely more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than Bodies? What Pleasure would
they not take to compare among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by a clear View of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50053:84"/>
so many different Modifications the
bare Sentiment of which, however fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and confuse, does so strangely busie
and employ them. For thou must know
that the Soul contains in her self all
the Beauties and Finesses that thou seest
in the World, and which thou art wont
to attribute to the Objects that environ
thee. Those Colours, those Odours, those
Savours, with an Infinity of other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
with which thou hast not yet
been touched, are no other than Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of thy own Substance. That
Harmony which so elevates thee is not
in the Air which strikes thy Ear, and
those infinite Pleasures of which the
greatest Voluptuaries have but a feeble
Sentiment are included in the Capacity
of thy Soul. Now if thou hast a clear
Idea of thy self, if thou didst see in me
that Archetypal Spirit upon which thou
wast formed, thou wouldst discover so
many Beauties and so many Truths in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50053:84"/>
contemplating it, that thou wouldst neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
all thy Devoirs. Thou wouldst
discover with an Extremity of Ioy
that thou wouldst be capable of enjoying
an Infinity of Pleasures. Thou wouldst
know clearly their Nature, thou wouldst
be incessantly comparing them among
themselves, and thou wouldst discover
Truths which would appear to thee so
worthy of thy Application, that wholly
wrapt up and absorpt in the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thy own Being, full of thy self,
of thy Grandeur, of thy Excellencies,
and of thy Beauty thou wouldst be no
longer able to think of any thing besides.
But my Son, GOD has not made thee
to think of nothing but thy self. He has
made thee for <hi>himself.</hi> Wherefore I
shall not discover to thee the Idea of thy
Being, till that happy Time when the
View of the very Essence of thy GOD
shall deface and eclipse all thy Beauties,
and make thee despise all that thou art,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50053:85"/>
that thou mayst think only of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him.</p>
               <p>The Account of this excellent
Person is so satisfying, that I shall
not pretend to add any thing to it,
but shall only observe from it that
since 'tis so true that we have no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea
of our own Souls, and so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
that we should have none,
it would be in vain to go about to
define any of the Modifications of
our Spirit, which (since we have
no Idea of them) must be learnt by
inward Sentiment, and can no
more be made known by Words to
those that have not felt them than
Colours can be described to a Man
that is blind. And therefore you
must excuse me if I own my self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to gratifie your Request, in
giving you a Definition of Pleasure,
which though I know when I feel
it, and am able to distinguish from
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50053:85"/>
Light, or Colour, or Sound, or
from the opposite Sensation of
Pain, yet since I know it by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Consciousness only or Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not by Idea, I cannot
by Words render it intelligible to
any body else, but must remit him
that desires the Knowledge of its
Nature to Sense and Experience.
For he can never know it till he
feel it, and have those Motions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
in the Organs of his Sense, to
which the Author of Nature has
annexed this Sensation.</p>
               <p>However I may venture to call
Pain an <hi>uneasie Thought,</hi> not that I
intend thereby to define it (for I
think it no more capable of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
strictly so called than Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure)
but only to intimate in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
that it is a Modification belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Spirit, and not to Body.
For seeing clearly in the Idea which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50053:86"/>
I have of Extension, that all its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications
reduce themselves to Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
and Motion, or certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of Distance, I conclude that
Pleasure and Pain and the rest of
those Sensations which I feel in my
self by interiour Sentiment, are not
Modifications belonging to my
Corporeal Substance, but to some
other, which I call my Spirit. And
for this reason it is that I call Pain
an uneasie Thought. But then for
the reconciling this with my saying
that it anticipates and prevents all
Thought, I need only suggest to
you that when I call Pain an unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
Thought, I take Thought in its
utmost Latitude, for all that we
are any way conscious of to our
selves, as my most admired Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
does in his Principles of
Philosophy <hi>P.</hi> 2. where he says,
<hi>Cogitationis nomine intelligo illa omnia
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50053:86"/>
quae nobis consciis in nobis fiunt, quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
eorum in nobis Conscientia est. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
ita non modo intelligere, velle, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginare,
sed etiam sentire idem est
hic quod cogitare;</hi> i. e. <hi>By the Name
of Thought I understand all those things
which we are conscious to be done in our
selves, so far forth as there is in us
a Conscientiousness of them. And thus
not only to understand, to will, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
but even to feel is the same here
as to think.</hi> But when I say that
Pain anticipates all Thought, by
Thought I mean all rational, discur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and reflecting Thought, which
'tis most certain and evident by all
Experience that Pain does prevent,
and as certain that Grief does sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
follow and proceed from it.</p>
               <p>But to return from these Digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
(for I call all things so that
have not an immediate Connection
with Religion) to that which is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50053:87"/>
the principal Subject of our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence,
and ought to be the
Subject of all our Thoughts, the
Love of <hi>GOD.</hi> Our Saviour places
it in the Head of all Morality, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us that it is the <hi>first and great
Commandment.</hi> And his Apostle
St. <hi>Paul</hi> places it in the Rear of it,
telling us that <hi>the End of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
is Charity.</hi> So then from
both these put together the Result
will be that the Love of <hi>GOD</hi> is
both the first and the last, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and the End, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the Top-work, the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and the Accomplishment of all
Moral Perfection. And no doubt
but the first Devoir which in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Conception we can suppose
to result from the Being of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Creature will be to love
the Author of it, and if he who is
the Author of our Being be also the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50053:87"/>
Author of all the Good, Comfort,
Pleasure and Happiness of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nay even of our very Power
and Force of loving, than as we
begin with him so we must end
with him too, and make him the
Term and Object of our whole
Love, uniting our selves to him
with all that we are (as when Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
touch one another according to
their whole Supersicies) with all
our Heart, Soul and Mind. But
of this already, and perhaps further
hereafter. At present I consider
that since our Being is in it self a
Good, and the Foundation and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of all the Good which we
do or shall ever enjoy, it can be no
sooner received than it brings along
with it an Obligation of loving our
Creator, whose we are, and to
whom we are to offer up our Hearts
as a flaming Sacrifice as soon as we
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50053:88"/>
enter upon Being, which we are to
pay to him as our first Homage,
and as an early Pledge and Earnest
of all the Duty that we owe him.
And that which does the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
us to this is, that if we do not
thus early pay it to our Creator, we
shall pay it somewhere else where it
is not due. For no sooner does a
Creature begin to be, but he begins
to love, the intellectual Pulse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences
its Movement which the
first Inspiration of Life as well as
the natural, and the Desire of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
immediately succeeds the
Capacity of it. Assoon as we <hi>are</hi>
we desire to be happy, and assoon
as we desire to be happy we must
seek for this Happiness in some
Object or other. If therefore we
seek it not in <hi>GOD,</hi> we must seek
it in the Creature. But if we seeek
it out of <hi>GOD,</hi> we seek it where
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50053:88"/>
it is not, and we err and transgress
in our Search, <hi>GOD</hi> only being our
true Good. We are therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to seek Union with <hi>GOD</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon
as we desire to be happy, that
is, assoon as we desire at all, that
is, assoon as we are. Our Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
therefore to love <hi>GOD</hi> bears
Date from the first Moment of
our Existence, and is therefore the
first Duty that we owe him, as
thus immediately resulting from
our having a Being. And thus is
the Love of <hi>GOD</hi> the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
and has the Precedency
in the Scale of Morality.</p>
               <p>The other Character that our
Saviour gives of it is, that 'tis also
the Great Commandment. And
the Scripture speaks of its Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
adding one more than we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to Bodies, telling us of its
Breadth and Length, and Depth
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50053:89"/>
and Height; but not how broad,
nor how long, nor how deep, nor
how high. And indeed with what
Line could the Apostle measure
such an immense Vastness? How
could he Paint Light and Flame,
or put that into Words which
passes not only all Description, but
even all Knowledg, and indeed every
thing but Sense and Experience.
Well might our Saviour call it
the Great Commandment. It is
great in the Matter of it, being of
the most weighty and concerning
importance to the final Happiness
of Man. Great in the Obligation
of it which is absolutely indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,
it being not possible that
<hi>GOD</hi> should Create any one Spirit
without obliging him to Love him,
or that he should ever discharge
him from that Obligation. Great
in the Equity and Reason of it, it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50053:89"/>
being highly reasonable that we
should Love <hi>GOD</hi> who is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
amiable, so altogether love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Great in the Power and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of it, as being the most Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Prolifick Principle, the
Root and Seed of all Excellency
and Perfection, such as draws on
with it the Observation of all the
Commandments, and is therefore
the shortest Line, the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
way to <hi>GOD</hi> and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of him. The Love of
GOD is indeed the general seisin,
the universal ingredient of all a
good Man's Actions; 'Tis that
precious Tincture, that Chymical
Spirit that runs through all, and
that Noble Divine Elixir which
gives Worth and Value to all, and
converts even our meanest and most
indifferent actions into Religion
and Devotion. Great lastly, in the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50053:90"/>
Pleasure and Duration of it. As
Love is the most pleasant Passion,
so the Love of GOD is the most
pleasing Love. A Love that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it self, a Fire that is its own
Fuel. He that Loves GOD as
he ought, as he cannot, so he need
not Love any thing else, so great
delight and entertainment will he
find in the Love of GOD. Which
will also go along with him into
the other Life, and be the Life of
that Life. Then all the instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and ministerial Virtues shall
expire and be of no further Use.
<hi>Whether they be Prophecies they shall
fail,</hi> &amp;c. Even the Fear of GOD
which is now so highly magnified
as the Beginning of Wisdom, shall
then cease, for perfect Love shall
cast it out. Faith shall vanish,
Hope shall be swallowed up, and
Prayer it self shall be silent, only
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50053:90"/>
Love and Praise shall endure, and
vie with each other to all Eternity.
Thus much of the Love of GOD
in general, concerning which all I
have said seems little when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it with the Greatness of the
Subject, and your most exalted and
seraphick Strains upon it. I intend
in my next to add something to the
Reason of our loving GOD so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
as I state it in my Sermon. In
the mean time I deliver up this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Subject to a better Hand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
you to communicate what
further thoughts you have upon it,
and to believe him that writes this
to be in all Sincerity</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Am glad we are come to so
good an issue in the matter of
our Debate, and shall therefore
immediately apply my self to that
most necessary and delightful
Theme, which is the noblest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of our Thoughts, the
best improvement of our Minds
at present, and will be the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible
Spring of our Joy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
the Love of GOD. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but admire the sottishness of
those dull <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who make
it their Business to hunt after Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
as vain and unsatisfactory as
their admirers are Childish and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50053:91"/>
and in the mean time turn
their Backs on this vast Reposito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of solid and substantial Joy. A
Joy whose perpetual Current always
affords a fresh Delight, and yet every
Drop of it so entertaining, that
we might live upon it to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!
Whilst our Souls are inebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with its Pleasures, our very Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
partake of its Sweetness: For
it excites a grateful and easie Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the animal Spirits, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
such an agreeble Movement of
the Passions as comprehends all
that Delight, abstracted from the
Uneasiness which other Objects
are apt to occasion. Our Passions
(although they have both their
Use and Pleasure, yet) as we usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
feel them are blended with so
much Pain, that 'tis hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
whether the good or evil they
do us be the greater, and a Man
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50053:92"/>
sometimes over-pays for his Mirth,
by that Sting of Sorrow which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it. However, I am not for
a <hi>Stoical Apathy,</hi> I would not have
my Hands and Feet cut off lest they
should sometimes incommode me.
The Fault is not in our Passions
considered in themselves, but in
our voluntary Misapplication and
unsuitable Management of them.
And if Love which is the leading
and Master Passion were but once
wisely regulated, our Passions
would be so far from rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
and disquieting us, that on
the contrary they would mightily
facilitate the great Work we have
to do, give Wings to this Earthly
Body that presses down the Soul,
and in a good Measure remove those
Impediments that hinder her from
mounting to the Original and End
of her Being What is it that makes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50053:92"/>
our Joys tumultuous and flitting,
our Fears tormenting, our Hopes
disquieting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of our Desire? If we love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
we shall both fear and hope,
grieve and Rejoyce without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and in a wrong Measure, we
shall lash out into a thousand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies,
and be as unhappy as
we are unwise and unreasonable.
Whereas if we tune our Love to
the right Key, we need not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of Discord among the
rest of our Passions, all their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will be natural and regular, and
all Concert in a becoming Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
The Divine Nature is a Field
in which our grateful Passions may
freely take their Range. If we
make <hi>GOD</hi> the Object of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
our Hopes will neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude,
nor our Joys forsake us;
there is no Serpent lurks in this
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50053:93"/>
Grass, all is calm and placid, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and entertaining. And yet,
unwise that we are! How hard is
it to drive us to our Felicity, how
difficult to convince us of our
Happiness? How many Evasions
do we find to with-hold our Love
from him who requires it, not for
his <hi>own</hi> but <hi>our</hi> Advantage! When
shall we be, I need not say so just
to <hi>GOD,</hi> but so kind to our selves,
as totally to withdraw every strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
Desire from the Creature,
the very best of which is not able
to satisfie the Longings, and fill the
Capacities of the Mind. The
Boundlessness of Desire is a plain
Indication to me that it was never
made for the Creature; for what
is there in the whole Compass of
Nature that can satisfie Desire?
What but he who made it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish
and content it? I need not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50053:93"/>
bring Arguments for the Proof of
this, every one has Experience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to confirm it. For after all
our Researches after that which is
good for the Sons of Men, where
is the happy Person who has not
been defeated in his Hopes, or fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
in his Enjoyments?
Though he has obtained his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
has he satisfied his Desire?
For how amiable soever created
Good may appear at a Distance, a
closer Inspection and intimate
Knowledge, declares it to be vain
and empty, and a very improper
Quarry for the Soul of Man.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Soul of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
has the most plausible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to our Love, as being the most
Godlike of all the Creatures, but
since 'tis as indigent as our own, how
can it supply our Wants, or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
be the proper Object of our
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50053:94"/>
Desires? And if you will forgive a
Remark which perhaps is not so
solid as the Subject requires, I am
apt to think that that Bashfulness
and Unwillingness we feel in our
selves to declare Love though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so pure and so refined from base
and low Designs, and which shews
it self in most, but especially in the
best and most generous Tempers,
proceeds from hence: The Soul
blushes to declare her Indigence,
and to go out of her self to seek for
Happiness in that which <hi>is not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
be the proper Object of her
Desires. 'Tis true, a Sister Soul
may give somewhat better Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to our Love than other
Creatures can, but she is not able
to fill and content it. She must
seek her own Felicity abroad, and
if she cannot be her own Good,
there is little Reason to expect she
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50053:94"/>
should be ours. And being I have
heard some Object against your
Account of the first and great
Commandment, <hi>that it is prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to the second,</hi> and because I am of
a quite contrary Opinion, and
think nothing does more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
secure and improve it, I will
therefore offer to your Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Correction such Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as I have had about it.</p>
               <p>It were I confess a strong Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
against your Way of stating
the Love of <hi>GOD,</hi> if it were in any
Measure injurious to the right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
and due Performance of
the Love we owe to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
For since the Precepts of
the Gospel are an exact and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
System of Wisdom and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
every one of whose Parts
are so duly proportioned to the
other, that the Result of all is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50053:95"/>
Harmony and Order, I must
needs conclude, that when such a
Sense is put upon one Precept as
causes it to clash and interfere with
another, it can't be the genuine
Meaning of it. And if I can't make
over the whole of my Desire to
<hi>GOD,</hi> without defaulking from
that Portion of Love he has as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
my Neighbour, I must of
Necessity set the Signification of
that Precept to a lower Pitch, and
find out some other Medium to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
the first and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.
But there's no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
for this: So far is your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Love of <hi>GOD</hi> from
being prejudicial to the Love of our
Neighbour that (if I think right)
'tis the only solid and sure Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it can rest upon. For if I
may lawfully bestow any Share of
my Desire on my Neighbour, why
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50053:95"/>
not on the rest of <hi>GOD</hi>'s Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that are useful and beneficial
to me, provided my Love be not
inordinate, but contain it self
within those Bounds that Reason
and Religion have prescribed? For
those who contend for a Love of
Desire towards our Neighbour,
won't deny but that that Desire
may be inordinate, and in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unlawful; and therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to them, it is not the <hi>bare</hi>
desiring, but the <hi>Excess</hi> and <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi>
of that Desire that makes it
peccant. But does not Reason
plead as much for the Lawfulness
of desiring one Creature as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
And what Arguments can be
fetched from thence for the Love
of our Neighbour, that will not
be as concluding for the Love of
other Creatures in their Degree
and Proportion? If it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50053:96"/>
that we have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to love our Neighbour, but
none to love other Creatures, this
seems to me a begging of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
for the Matter in Debate is,
<hi>Whether that Command ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of Love of Desire or Love of
Benevolence.</hi> But if we once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our Desire to stray after the
Creature, we open a Bank to all
that Mischief, Malice and Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness
that is in the World.
And indeed, what can be so destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the Love of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as these Desires? For the
Creature being finite and empty
too, and therefore unable to satisfie
the Desire of a rational Soul,
how is it possible but that a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Lovers who all desire the
same thing, which is very far from
being able to satisfie one, much
less all of them, should cross each
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50053:96"/>
other in these Desires and Pursuits,
and consequently destroy that
Peace and mutual Benevolence
which ought to be cherished
among rational Beings, and to
which the Precepts of the Gospel
so strictly engage us? But the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature is an inexhaustible O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
of Felicity, in which every one
of us may satisfie his most inlarged
Desires, without the least Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its Fulness! We need not
grudg nor envy each other's Portion,
for here is enough for us all. And
therefore the Soul that centres all
her Love on <hi>GOD,</hi> has no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to those Sins that obstruct
her Benevolence to her Neighbour.
She does not <hi>make Gold her Hope,
nor the fine Gold her Confidence,</hi> and
therefore can very readily part with
it to supply her Brother's Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
She does not place her Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50053:97"/>
in the Pomps and Pleasures of
this Mortal Life, and therefore
does neither envy him who posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
them, nor seeks by injurious
Practises to deprive him of them.
And as she has no <hi>Pleasure,</hi> no <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting,</hi>
no <hi>Ambition,</hi> but to partake
of the Divine Nature, so the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of that Good on which
she feeds assimilates her into its
own Likeness, and inspires her
with such a generous and diffusive
Benignity, that she is willing to
spend and be spent for the good of
others, and in Imitation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Philanthropy,</hi> expands her self
in Acts of Kindness and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
as uncircumscribedly and
universally as the Capacity of her
Nature will permit.</p>
               <p>What has been said I hope is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to authorize me without
Suspicion of Injustice, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50053:97"/>
my Heart from my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and fix it <hi>entirely</hi> on him who
has Merit enough to deserve, and
Kindness enough to embrace and
requite the highest and most ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Degree of Love I can possibly
bestow on him. But it may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be considered, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
commands us to love our
Neighbour <hi>as our selves,</hi> and to
love one another <hi>as he has loved us.</hi>
Now our Love to our selves is a
Love of Benevolence, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
such a Love to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
does fully discharge the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of that Command. Nor
does it appear that our Saviour loved
with a love of Desire, as he was
<hi>GOD</hi> he <hi>could</hi> not, and as he was
Man he <hi>need</hi> not, for a Love of
Benevolence will answer all the
End of his coming into the World.
The Scripture 'tis true, mentions
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50053:98"/>
some happy Favourites who had a
greater Interest in his Love than
others. We read that <hi>IESUS
loved</hi> Lazarus, and of <hi>the Disciple
whom IESUS loved,</hi> but there is
no Necessity to understand this of
a Love of Desire, and whatever
other Reason may be assigned for
this particular Kindness, I am apt
to think the main Design of it was
for our Example, that as our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Lord has left us a Pattern of
every Virtue, so he might especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recommend to us that most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and comprehensive one <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
which next to the Love of
<hi>GOD</hi> has the Precedency of all the
rest. I am therefore very far from
designing any Prejudice to Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
by what I have offered here, I
rather intend to assert and advance
it. For he who permits his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to run after his Friend, will in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50053:98"/>
the End neither please himself nor
advantage his Friendship. How
often do we force the Almighty to
deprive us of these dear Idols that
have usurped our Hearts? That so
he may convince us how improper
it is to permit our Souls to cleave
to any Creature, which, allowing
it to be able to entertain us at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
can give no Security for
the future. And therefore he who
would secure his Felicity, and have
the Current of his Delight perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
must not suffer his Love to fix
on any object but that which is <hi>the
same Yesterday, to Day, and for ever.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the Defects which we find
in Friendship, owe their Original
to this misplaced Desire. 'Tis this,
that knowing the Narrowness of
Humane Nature makes us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to monopolize a worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to our selves, whereby we do
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50053:99"/>
him a great Injury by contracting
and limiting his Benevolence. This
is it that hoodwinks our Souls,
and makes us blind to our Friend's
Imperfections; for where-ever
Love sixes it either finds or fancies
Excellency and Perfection: To
discover a Defect embitters its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
wakes it out of its pleasant
Dream, and is an uneasie Monitor
that it ought not to rest here,
since what is defective is so far not
good, and consequently not lovely.
But he who will not see his
Friend's Infirmities is not like to
inform him of them, and so fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
the great Design of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which is to discover and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the most minute Irregularity,
and to purifie and perfect the Mind
with the greatest Accuracy. What
is it but Desire that creates those
Jealousies and Disquiets which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50053:99"/>
sometimes creep into this refined
Affection? For pure Benevolence
delighting in <hi>doing</hi> good, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no Regard to the <hi>receiving</hi> it,
would not be disgusted at the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which is shewn to a third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but rather rejoyce at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of its Friend's Virtue. From
Desire proceeds that unbecoming
Excess of Grief which is apt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
to transport us when <hi>GOD</hi>
translates our Friend from our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
into his own. A generous
and regular Friendship after it has
paid that Tribute of Tears which
Nature and the Worth of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
requires, will rather prompt
us to sympathize with and rejoyce
in his Happiness, than to regret
and complain of our own Loss.
There is yet another Indecency that
would be prevented were our Love
only benevolent; and that is, that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50053:100"/>
strong Antipathy which usually
succeeds Affection whenever it
comes to a Rupture, as 'tis odds
but it may, considering the great
Weakness of Humane Nature, and
how seldom a Man is in every Stage
of his Life consistent with himself,
for a rightly constituted Friendship
will incline us by all the Arts of
Sweetness and Endearment to win
upon the Offender, who has so
much the greater <hi>need</hi> of our Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence,
by how much he does the
less <hi>deserve</hi> it. Our Kindness when
he no longer returns it is the more
excellent and generous, because
more free: And though it cann't
be called Friendship when the
Bond is broke on one side, yet
there may be a most refined and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
Benevolence on the other.</p>
               <p>After all, methinks Benevolence
is the most great and noble Kind
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50053:100"/>
of Love, and I wonder what should
make us so fond of Desire, and so
unwilling to withdraw it from the
Creature, since so placed it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Reproach to us, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
upbraids us with our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Indigence. To need and
desire nothing out of himself is the
Prerogative and Perfection of the
Divine Nature: And though a
Creature need not blush to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
after <hi>GOD</hi>'s Fulness, and to
thirst for this <hi>Fountain of Living
Water,</hi> yet methinks it should, to
long after <hi>broken Cisterns,</hi> Creatures
as dry and empty as it self; did we
therefore consult either our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
or our Interest, we should
without Reluctancy banish the
Creature from our Hearts, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
all other Desires but that
which has all the Pleasure and
Advantage of Love, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50053:101"/>
of its Pain and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And thus Sir, I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this and my last, to point
out, though very imperfectly,
some of the Prerogatives of Divine
Love. And I hope 'twill appear
from the Utility as well as from
the Reasonableness of the thing,
that we ought to fix the whole of
our Love on our Maker. And in
Truth, if we think it reasonable to
love GOD at all, I know not how
we can with Safety permit our
Hearts to love any thing else. For
though we may fancy that the
Love of the Creature is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory,
but subordinate to the
Love of GOD, yet Love being
the most rapid of all Motions, if
once our Desire be set a moving,
in vain do we think to stop and
circumscribe it; and therefore as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50053:101"/>
it is unjust, so it is unsafe to give
it the least Tendency towards any
Object but him who is the only
proper and adequate one.</p>
               <p>I am exceedingly pleas'd with <hi>M.
Malbranch</hi>'s Account of the Reasons
why we have no Idea of our Souls,
and wish I could read that ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Author in his own Language,
or that he spake mine. However
I have some Queries to make about
the Matter, but must refer it to
another Opportunity. You tell
me I must not expect a Definition
of Pleasure, all I desire is only such
an Account as we have of some
other things, which strictly speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are not capable of a Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that Notion which I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
of Pleasure is, That it is
<hi>that grateful Relish or Sensation, which
every Faculty enjoys, in the regular
Application of it self, to such Objects
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50053:102"/>
as are agreeable to its Nature.</hi> Or
if you please, <hi>Pleasure</hi> I take to be,
<hi>the Gratification of Natural Appetites

                  <salute>Madam,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Am no less pleased than your
self that my great Argument
for the intire Love of GOD taken
from his being the only true Cause
of our good, is so well discharged
of that Difficulty which you urged
against it, because (as I told you in
my first) I think it the only mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
one to which it stands exposed,
and because it has received from
your skilful Hand the utmost Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
it was capable of. So that
now I cannot but conclude the
Bottom I go upon to be very sound,
not expecting to be attacked by a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50053:103"/>
stronger Objection, or by one bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
managed. The same occurred
to my own Thoughts while I was
composing my Discourse, but I
thought it would be time enough
to consider it when it came to be
objected, and I have since met
with a little flying Touch of it
in a modern Philosopher of very
considerable Note, Monsieur <hi>Regis</hi>
a <hi>Cartesian,</hi> who in the 16<hi>th.</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> contends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this very Ground that GOD is
not the Moral Good of Man,
GOD (says he) is not the Moral
Good of Man neither because he
produces those things which are
agreeable to him, nor because he
causes those Pleasures which he
feels. Not the first, because GOD
would then be the moral good of
all other Creatures as well as Man,
because he does as much produce
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50053:103"/>
what in agreeable to them as what
is so to Man. Not the second,
because GOD would then be no
less the moral evil of Man than his
moral good, because he does no
less produce the Pain which he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
than the Pleasure which he
enjoys. From which without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a Word more, as if this had
been a most clear and incontestable
Demonstration, he positively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
that GOD is not the moral
good of Man. Not only that he is
not so for this Reason as the Cause
of our Pleasure (as your Objection
runs) but that he is not so at all.
For he concludes that if he be so,
it must be upon one or other of the
forementioned Accounts, which
since he is not, therefore he will not
allow him to be so at all. A strange
Paradox by the way, but what
Force there is in the Proof of it may
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50053:104"/>
be determined from the Measures
premised.</p>
               <p>The other Difficulty against the
intire Love of GOD taken from
its Inconsistency with the Love
of our Neighbour (which you
say you have heard some urge
against my Account of the first and
great Commandment) is indeed in
one respect more pressing than the
former, though easier to be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
because it is directly levelled,
not against the Reason only of the
Proposition, but the Truth of it.
But I wonder to hear of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
as pertinent as it is, since I
thought I had already laid in a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Caution against it in the
Discourse it self. For 'tis most
certain that the most intire Love
of GOD enjoyn'd in the first
Commandment does by no means
exclude the Love of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50053:104"/>
injoyned in the second, in
case these two Loves be of two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Kinds, the former suppose,
Love of Desire, and the latter
Love of Benevolence, there being
no manner of Repugnancy between
the desiring none but GOD, and
the wishing well to Men, and 'tis
only the joyning these two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Ideas under one common
Name <hi>(Love)</hi> that makes it seem
as if there were. To love none
but GOD, and yet to love others
besides GOD, do indeed seem to
be contradictory Propositions, but
'tis all because of the Equivocation
of the Word <hi>(Love)</hi> which when
applied to GOD in the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
signifies desiring him
as a good, and when applied to
Men in the second signifies not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
them as a Good, but desiring
good to them. And cannot I thus
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50053:105"/>
love GOD only, and my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
too, and so fulfil both Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?
Cannot I desire but one
thing only in the World, and yet
at the same time wish well to every
thing else? 'Tis plain that I may,
and that the Intireness of my Love
to GOD does no way prejudice my
Love to my Neighbour, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the latter Love to be of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Kind from the former.
Those therefore that will have one
of these to be exclusive of the other,
ought first to prove that the Word
<hi>(Love)</hi> used in both commands is
taken according to the same Sense
in both, that by Love of our
Neighbour is meant Love of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
as well as by the Love of
GOD, without which their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is precarious, and instead of
proving, they do but beg the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
And I should be glad to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50053:105"/>
see any of our Objectors prove what
hitherto they are pleased to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
that by Love of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
is intended Love of Desire.</p>
               <p>If they on the other hand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
what Proof I have that the
Love of our Neighbour here is not
Love of Desire, I answer, first
that according to all the Laws of
Dispute I may reasonably take leave
to suppose that it is not, till my
Objectors prove that it is. Since
my Account of the first Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
does not overthrow the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
but only upon Supposition
that Love of our Neighbour there
signifies Love of Desire, they that
lay that to my Charge ought in all
Logick and Conscience to prove
that it has that Signification, till
which time I may fairly suppose
that it has not, and that the rather
because they themselves cannot
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50053:106"/>
pretend that Desire is the only
thing that is called by the Name
of Love, but must needs allow that
there is also a Love of Benevolence,
and that these two have very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Idea's. But not to infist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Privilege I do not need: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
again that all those Arguments
whereby I prove that GOD only
ought to be loved with Love of
Desire, do also implicity prove that
that is not the Love wherewith we
are to love our Neighbour, and
consequently that that is not the
Love intended in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
but only Love of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.
For since there are but
these two Sorts of Love, and since
(which is the very Foundation of
the Objection) the intire Love of
GOD is not consistent with the
Love of our Neighbour, as Love
signifies Desire, if I prove that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50053:106"/>
GOD only ought to be loved with
Love of Desire (as I think I have
done) then it must follow either
that our Neighbour ought not to
be loved at all, which is manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
absurd, or that Love of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is the <hi>Love</hi> that must fall to
his share, and that which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is enjoyned in the second
Commandment. And I wonder
how it should enter into so many
Men's Heads, as it does, to imagin
that any other <hi>Love</hi> than this was
here intended. For though it were
otherwise never so lawful and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
to love our Neighbour
with <hi>Love</hi> of Desire, and he other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
never so capable of it, yet is
it imaginable that this should be
made the matter of a <hi>Command,</hi> and
required of us as a Duty! Is it
once to be thought that God who
is an infinite Good, infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50053:107"/>
infinitely deserving of our
highest Affections, nay of our
whole Love; and withall infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to satisfie and reward it,
should Command us to Love or
Desire a Creature, and a Creature
as vain and infirm and insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
as much a Shadow as our
selves, and that immediately after
he had in such Emphatick Terms
required us to fix our Love upon
himself? Is it I say to be thought,
that GOD when he had laid it
upon us as a Duty to repose our
selves upon his own Stable Centre,
should immediately after require
us to lean upon that which cannot
sustain its own weight? That
when he had commanded us to
come and quench our mighty Thirst
at his own ever springing Fountain
(with whom as the Psalmist speaks
<hi>is the Well of Life</hi>) he should in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50053:107"/>
the very next Breath send us away
to a Cistern, and that too a broken
one? That he should first call us
to himself, and then as if he alone
were not able to suffice for us, and
to satisfie those inlarged Appetites
which he had given us, should call
in the Creatures to bear part of the
Expence, and send us from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to them? Are these Thoughts
worthy of GOD? But besides,
let me Appeal to any of those who
contend for Love of Desire as the
Love of the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Do they ever feel any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
of Conscience for having
been wanting in Love of Desire
towards their Neighbour; or does
their Conscience ever upbraid them
for having thereby fail'd in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
towards the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment;
or do they ever think it
necessary to Repent for having been
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50053:108"/>
defective in this kind of Love?
Our Conscience indeed does often
upbraid to us our Desire of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
(as you very well remark
from our Bashfulness and Unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
to own our selves to be in
Love) but never that I know of,
does it Reproach us for our Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency
towards them, or prompt
us to Repent of it. And indeed
it would be a strange kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for a Man to fall upon
his Knees, and Confess to GOD
as a Sin, that he had withdrawn
all his Desires from his Creatures
and fix'd them wholly upon him;
that he did not desire them as his
good, though at the same time he
wish'd them, and was ready to do
them all the good he could. I dread
to speak the Language of such a
Penitent, when I consider what an
absurd Command he Fathers upon
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50053:108"/>
God. For can we imagin that
GOD will charge that person as
guilty of the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
who intirely loves him, and
bears a hearty good-will to his
Fellow Creatures, merely because
he does not also desire them as his
good? Is it not enough to wish
and do well to them? For tell me
Madam, what you think of this
supposition: I will suppose a Man
to place his whole Affection upon
GOD, and so to love him with
all his Heart, Soul, Mind and
Strength, as to withdraw his Love
from all the Creatures, and not in
the least to desire any of them as
his goods, only to desire good to
them all, to do them good as far
as he has opportunity, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to unite them to the true
good. I further suppose him to
persevere in this Disposition of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50053:109"/>
Mind to the very last, and then ask
whether you can think that such a
Person has any thing to answer at
the Bar of GOD's Justice for the
Breach of the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or whether you think God
will damn and eternally separate
such an one from his Presence, as
defective in his Measures of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
merely for not making Creatures
his good, and the Object of his
Desire? But I need not put such a
Question to you, who I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
at the first Proposal of it
will be so far from judging such a
Person to be a just Object of God's
Displeasure, that you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
he has all that is necessary to
recommend him to his highest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and to qualifie him to partake
of his Sovereign Happiness. But
'tis a Question very proper to be put
to my Adversaries, who must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50053:109"/>
say that God will damn a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this Character, or (which
therefore appears to be certainly
the right) that Love of Desire is
not the Love required of us in the
second Commandment, but only
Love of Benevolence, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
has does by that alone suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
satisfie the Intention and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of that Law.</p>
               <p>Besides, does not the Command
sufficiently explain it self? For (as
you very judiciously remark) our
Saviour commands us to love our
Neighbour as our selves, which
by the Way seems to me not only
an absolute Measure, but a relative
Character, put in on purpose to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
it from the Love of
God. But now, as you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume;
our Love of our selves is not
Love of Desire, but Love of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.
Most undoubtedly so,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50053:110"/>
for whoever reflects upon the Love
of himself will presently perceive
that 'tis not a desiring of himself as
his good, but a desiring of some
good to himself, as appears from that
vulgar Expression, <hi>Charity begins at
home,</hi> and from the Vice of Self-love,
by which we mean a craving
and seeking after more than comes
to a Man's Share without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Regard to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or a greedy Pursuance of ones
own private Interest in Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that of the Publick. Your
other Remark is no less important,
that our Saviour does also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
us to love one another as he
hath loved us, that is, say you, not
with Love of Desire, but that of
Benevolence. For as God he could
not love us with Love of Desire,
and as Man he need not, since
Love of Benevolence would answer
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50053:110"/>
all the Ends of his coming into the
World, to which I add that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
need he as Man because as such
he was personally united to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
good, with which Union I
cannot conceive how the Desire of
any Creature should be consistent.
For as God himself cannot desire
any thing out of himself because of
his own Fulness, so neither can he
that enjoys God desire any thing
out of him because of the Fulness
of <hi>GOD.</hi> The Enjoyment of <hi>GOD</hi>
does certainly put a final Period to
all Desire, and utterly quench the
most flaming Thirst of a Creature,
and how then can he whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
is satisfied desire any further, or
if he does, how then is it satisfied?
For which reason by the way I
think it necessary to conclude that
the blessed in Heaven finding all
possible good in the Enjoyment of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50053:111"/>
                  <hi>GOD</hi> cannot desire any thing out
of him, but that all Love of the
Creature does utterly cease, and is
for ever silenced in that Region of
Happiness, and that <hi>GOD</hi> is all in
all to those that enjoy him. But
now we cannot suppose any of the
blessed Spirits so united to <hi>GOD</hi> in
Heaven, as our Saviour was while
upon Earth, who therefore must
be supposed to love Mankind with
Love of Benevolence only (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
capable of no other) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to require the same kind
of Love from Men to one another.
But there needs no Argument from
without to prove this to be his
meaning. The Text you refer to
(<hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 34.) sufficiently speaks
its own Sense. <hi>A new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I give unto you, that ye love one
another. As I have loved you that ye
also love one another.</hi> Wherein 'tis
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50053:111"/>
plain that our Saviour refers to that
signal Instance of his Benevolence
in his undertaking the Work of
our Redemption, and in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
requires the same sort of Love
from his Disciples, that if Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were, they should be ready to
lay down their Lives for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their Brethren, as he had
done for them, which is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sense of the Words, and made
to be so by the best Expositors that
I know of upon the Place.</p>
               <p>But besides, does not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
always express our Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Neighbour as a Love of
Benevolence only? <hi>Love</hi> (says the
Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 10.) <hi>worketh no
ill to his Neighbour,</hi> that is, does
not hurt or injure him, but do him
all good. Which Character
shews it to be truly meant of Love
of Benevolence. I say truly. And
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50053:112"/>
that 'tis meant of that <hi>only,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it self intirely commensurate
to the full Extent of Charity, is
evident from the Words that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<hi>therefore Love is the fulfilling of
the Law.</hi> Of what Law? Not
to be sure of the first Table. For
our Love to our Neighbour though
never so perfect, cannot satisfie our
Obligation to <hi>GOD.</hi> It must be
therefore of the second Table,
which being thus fulfilled by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
can require no other
Love than that. This is Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
Again, when the same
Apostle reckons up the Fruits of
Charity, does he make any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Desire, does he not describe
them all by the Expressions of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence?
He says, <hi>it suffers long
and is kind, that it envies not, vaunts
not it self, is not puffed up, does not
behave it self unseemly, seeks not her
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50053:112"/>
own, is not easily provoked, thinks no
evil, rejoyces not in Iniquity, but in
the Truth, that it bears all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
all things, hopes all things, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
all things,</hi> but it seems the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
had forgot to put in Desire, or
else he thought it no Part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Charity. And I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that I am of the latter Opinion.</p>
               <p>And as the Scripture always
speaks of Brotherly Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in Terms importing Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
so whenever it speaks of the
opposite Vice does it not always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
it by contrary Characters?
Does it ever describe it by want of
Desire? No, but by want of good
Will, by Anger, Wrath, Envy,
Bitterness, Malice and such like
Terms. And by what Measure
of Love it is that Christ will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in his Judgment of the
World, whether by Love of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50053:113"/>
or by Love of Desire I
shall leave to be determined by
what he says himself concerning
that matter in the 25th Chapter of
St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> From all which put
together I think nothing can be
more clear and certain than that the
Love intended and required in the
second great Commandment of the
Law, is not Love of Desire, but
only Love of Benevolence. And
I cannot imagine what (besides
the Equivocation of the Word
<hi>Love</hi>) should make the World
run so generally upon a contrary
Notion, unless it be that Clause in
the Commandment: <hi>And the second
is like unto it,</hi> whence perhaps it
has been concluded that because the
first is meant of Love of Desire,
therefore the second must be so
too. But he must be either much
prejudiced, or very dull-sighted
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50053:113"/>
that does not see that <hi>by like unto it</hi>
is only meant of equal Authority
and Obligation in Opposition to
the Pharisaic Partiality towards
the Precepts of the Law. Well
then the Result of the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
is this, since that most
intire Love of <hi>GOD</hi> I stand for in
the first Commandment does not
at all interfere with the Love of our
Neighbour in the second supposing
that by Love there we are not to
understand Love of Desire, but
only Love of Benevolence, and
since as I have shewn Love of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
is the Love there solely
intended, I may now with Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
conclude that the Account I
have given of the first Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as high as it is, is no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to the second, the thing
that is generally laid to my Charge.
But you go further, undertaking
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50053:114"/>
to show that my Account of
the Love of GOD is so far
from being prejudicial to that of
our Neighbour, that it is the
only true solid Foundation it can
rest upon. I thoroughly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
what you say upon this
Part, but shall not offer to add
any thing to it, because indeed
you have said all. I promised
in my last that in my next I
would add something to the
Reason of our loving <hi>GOD</hi> so
intirely, but having fallen upon
a Vein of other Thoughts, and
those of no slight Importance,
must beg you to let me be in
your Debt for this untill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Opportunity, as also for
what you further desire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Pleasure. In the mean
time I leave you to that of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50053:114"/>
your own Meditations, more of
which upon this great Subject
will be highly grateful to</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOU have so clearly removed
the Objection made against
the intire Love of GOD, on account
of its being prejudicial to the Love
of our Neighbour, that I hope we
shall hear no more of that matter.
And truly when our Objectors
have once felt (as they will for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sooner or later) the Disquiet
and <hi>Uneasiness,</hi> we may well refer
them to their own Experience for
a full Conviction of the <hi>Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness</hi>
of such Desires. As far as I can
perceive the Objection is founded
upon Supposition, <hi>That all Human
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50053:115"/>
Love is a Love of Desire;</hi> a Love that
arises from and terminates in that
insatiable Desire we have of our
own Happiness: Which methinks
is a very great Reproach to Humane
Nature, which as bad as it is, is
not uncapable of a pure and disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed
Benevolence. Had they
duly attended to what you have
writ in you <hi>Theory of Love, Part 1.
Sect.</hi> 5. They would have discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Falseness of their Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But though all other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
should fail, my own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
would assure me that there
is such a thing as unmixed Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
for there are some Persons
in the World to whom I could
perform the highest Services,
without any the least Intuition of
Reward, or Prospect of bettering
my own Being.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:50053:116"/>
And now, to proceed in our
most excellent Subject, though I
am very sensible how much I depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
it by my unkilful Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet that I may give occasion
to your better Meditations, and
because of the just Deference I pay
you, I am contented in Compliance
with your Desire, rather to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my Ignorance than be wanting
in my Respect. I will therefore
first declare what I think may be
added to the Unreasonableness of
loving the Creature; and secondly
what to the Reasonableness of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
the first and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
in the strictest Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
all along subjoyning such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
as offer themselves, and
seem not to me altogether forreign
to the Subject.</p>
               <p>For the first, I think it very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
to love the Creature,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50053:116"/>
because it can never answer the End
of Love. We desire only in order
to Happiness, nothing being desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any further than as it promotes
that End; but the Love of the
Creature is more apt to hinder
than advance our Happiness which
is the End of loving, and therefore
in all reason Creatures ought not
to be thought desirable. It may
perhaps be objected that this is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical
Nonsence, for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is so necessary in order to our
good, that whilst we are in the
World we are so far from being
happy, that we cannot so much as
subsist without it. I do not deny
this, provided the Creature be used
only as an <hi>Occasion</hi> of our good,
and with that Indifferency that is
due to it. But if we rest in it as
our End, and desire it as the true
<hi>Cause</hi> of our Pleasure, it is so far
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50053:117"/>
from being our good, that it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
becomes our evil, in that it
deludes our Expectations, shrinks
under us when we have laid the
Weight of our Souls upon it, and
causes us to fall into Air and Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness.
That the Creature cannot
make us happy is evident from all
those Topicks that declare its Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
its Uncertainty, and Inability
to fill the Capacities of the Soul.
For let a Man grasp as much of the
Creature as possibly he can, he will
still find an Emptiness in his Soul,
something that is still wanting to
compleat his Bliss, which is the
Reason why we are always upon
the Hunt after Variety of Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
like a Boy at the Foot of
a Hill, who fancies if he were at
the Top he should touch the Sky,
but when he comes there, finds it
as much out of his Reach as ever.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50053:117"/>
So true is that Conclusion of the
wise King, who had both the fullest
Enjoyment of temporal things, and
the best Capacity to judge of them
of any we know of, that <hi>all is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Vexation of Spirit.</hi> And
therefore unless Reason require us
to place our Felicity in that which
will certainly be our Vexation, it
cannot be reasonable to love the
Creature; and consequently if
Love be not an unreasonable Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and if it be fit to love at all,
'tis highly reasonable to love <hi>GOD,</hi>
and him <hi>only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if abstracted Reasons can't
perswade us to the intire Love of
GOD, let it further be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that this is the best way to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to us that which we are so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fond of, even the Enjoyment of
the Creature. It is most certain
that the Divine Benignity does nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50053:118"/>
grudge, nor envy, nor arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily
deny us any thing that has a
true Tendency towards our Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and therefore when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
us of those occasional goods
that minister to our Ease and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
'tis only that he may more
fully secure our Interest in our true
and only good, by removing those
things that stood between us and
it, which eclipsed our View,
withdrew our Affections, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
us in the Enjoyment of it.
And therefore to fix our Love
warmly and entirely on GOD, is
the most likely Way to be sure of
possessing all that is good in other
things. For the Crosses and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments
that we meet with
are mainly designed to divert us
from our vain Pursuit after the
Shadow of good, and to direct us
towards the Substance; to show
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50053:118"/>
us experimentally since we will not
sufficiently attend to what Reason
suggests, the Emptiness and Unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactoriness
of all created good,
that so we may more directly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
and inseparably cleave to the
uncreated.</p>
               <p>I may add, that if we have any
Generosity in us, any Sense of the
Dignity of our Nature, we cannot
but acknowledge that 'tis little and
low, and unbecoming the Soul of
Man to place the least Degree of its
Happiness in any Creature whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
Since the Soul is capable of
enjoying the first and sovereign
good, and since he freely offers
himself to her Embraces, 'tis as inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to her Honour as to her Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to stoop to a Creature, and to
degrade her self to such mean En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:50053:119"/>
The next thing to be done is to
add somewhat to the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of interpreting the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
in the strictest Notion.
That our Saviour's meaning was
that we should love the Lord our
GOD with all the Force and
Energy of our Souls exclusively of
all other Loves, may be presumed
from the great Aptitude there is in
such a Love to promote the Design
of Religion in general, and of the
Christian Religion in particular,
which is, to retrieve the original
Rectitude and Perfection of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, or rather to improve
it; to new draw and perfect in our
Souls that beautiful Image of our
Maker, which by our Sins and
Errors we have defaced; in a
word, to makes us as Godlike as
is consistent with the Capacity of
a Creature; and I know not any
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50053:119"/>
thing that does so effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to this as the intire Love of
GOD. The End of Love is to
unite its self to its Object, every
Motion it makes is in order to that
End, and since Heterogeneous
Substances can never cordially
unite, since without Similitude of
Disposition there can be no Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
therefore Love does ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
after Likeness; it would
if it were possible have an Identity
of Essence, and, as far as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things will admit, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with the beloved Object.
Hence nothing is so excellent at Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
as Love, nothing does so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
assimilate, which by the way,
is one reason why we ought not to
love the World, because of the
Danger of being conformed to it.
If then we love GOD intirely we
shall with all the Powers of our
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50053:120"/>
Soul endeavour to be like him,
and according to the Degree of our
Love, so will be the Nearness of
our Resemblance. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make GOD like our selves, if
therefore we desire a Union we
must <hi>be conformed to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Love,</hi> as the wise Man long
since observ'd, <hi>surpasses all things
for Illumination.</hi> And wherefore
does it so, but because it fixes the
Eyes of our Mind upon its Object,
makes them keen and piercing; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
our Thoughts to dwell upon its
Beauties, for they will always be
busied about what we love? And
as Love is very sagacious in finding
out every little Punctilio that will
recommend it to its beloved, so it
is most restless and unwearied
in the Practice of all Endearments,
It will regulate all its Operations
by his Models, imitate all his imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50053:120"/>
Perfections, that so it may
most powerfully recommend it
self, by that which is the great
Band of Affection, Similitude of
Nature. Since therefore the Love
of <hi>GOD</hi> has such an Aptness to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the great Design of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, 'tis but reasonable
to think that our Lord upon this
very Account did so highly magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
and so strictly enforce it.
And indeed, since Love does so
powerfully influence all our Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
since all our Endeavours, all
our Operations and Varieties of
Acting tend to nothing else but the
Accomplishment of some Desire,
'tis but fit and decorous that all our
Desires should fix on him, whose
we are, and for whose Glory we
were created.</p>
               <p>To the Reasonableness of the
Love of GOD, we may further
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50053:121"/>
add the Necessity of it, and that
upon a double Account. First,
because this is the only Vital
Principle of Holiness, the only ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Means of securing our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and consequently of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
us for the Enjoyment of
GOD. There is no way of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our selves to GOD but by
keeping his Commandments, for
then, and not otherwise, do <hi>we
dwell in him and be in us.</hi> Since
therefore Obedience is necessary in
order to Happiness, that which is
the only true Principle of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
must be of equal Necessity.
And that without Love there can
be no true Obedience, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Obedience is found 'tis a certain
<hi>Criterion</hi> of Love, is plainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from our Saviour's discoursing
in the 14. and 15. Chapters of St.
<hi>Iohn;</hi> so that to derive universal
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50053:121"/>
Obedience from the Love of GOD,
or to argue from that Obedience to
the intire Love of GOD, is as
sound a Way of Argumentation as
to prove any other Effect by its
Cause, or Cause by the Effect. It
were easie to show how every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Duty is necessarily conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to the Love of GOD, how
it is founded upon, and does natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
spring from it. But I shall
not here enter into the Detail, I
will only take notice of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of our Thoughts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
on them depends our Words
and Actions, and derive the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of the intire Love of GOD,
from the Impossibility of governing
our Thoughts as we ought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. Now this is most certain,
that what we love will be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in our Minds; there is no
better Diagnostick to discover our
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50053:122"/>
Love than by observing what is the
most frequent Subject of our
Thoughts. For Thought seems
to me to be nothing else but the
Determination of the Soul to some
certain Object which she desires
either to contemplate or enjoy, a
forming in her self the Images and
Representations of what she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in, or contriving how she
may obtain it, and remove what
stands betwixt her and it: And
therefore where-ever the Weight
of our Desire rests, the Stream of
our Thoughts will follow; tis to
no Purpose to drive them away,
for though we may for a while put
a Force on them, they will insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
steal back again. So that if
we mean to <hi>keep our Hearts with all
Diligence</hi> (the only way to secure
our outward Demeanour) we must
above all things take care to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50053:122"/>
our Desire, since it is by this
that we fall into Destruction. If
therefore our Hearts be too busie
about any thing in this World, I
know no other Way to cure that
Disorder but by rectifying our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire:
Let us cease to love it, and
we shall easily restrain our Hearts
from being inordinately busied
about it.</p>
               <p>It is not so much the Force of
Temptations, alas! All that the
World and the Devil can offer to
bribe our Hearts is paultry and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable;
it is not so much
the unavoidable Infirmity of our
Nature, which has not such an
Aversion to <hi>GOD</hi> as we pretend;
but it is the Defect of our Love,
our wilful misplacing that Divine
Affection, our voluntary hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
after the Creature that sets us
at Distance from the Creator.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:50053:123"/>
For let any one who has been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
acquainted with the Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his own Heart tell me,
whether he does not find that all
the strong Gusts of Temptation
blow from the Quarter? Whilst
he duly contemplates the divine
Perfections, looks on GOD as
his true and only good and desires
him accordingly, is not his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
prompt and ready, does not
his Mind move with Alacrity and
unwearied Vigor, and are not all
its Motions regular and pleasing?
But no sooner does his Desire step
into a By-path, and he suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to doat on the Creature, but
all is unhinged and falls into Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
the Wheels of his Chariot
move slowly, his Thoughts wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
his Devotion languishes, his
Passions grow unruly, his Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
corrupt, and his good Actions
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50053:123"/>
become lame and broken. Let us
not therefore complain of our List<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness
in the Worship of <hi>GOD,</hi>
our Coldness and Wandrings in his
Service, how much Labour it
costs us to raise up our Hearts to
Heaven, and put them in a right
Tune, but rather let us complain
of our want of Love, for that is
the true Cause of all this Unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness,
all our Sins and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
our moral Mistakes and
Imperfections proceed from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but this; let us once
banish our Idols from our Hearts
whatever they are, and we shall
quickly find that all will be well
again. For in vain do we search
for Rules to regulate our Manners,
and prescribe Remedies to cure our
Infirmities, which do but baffle our
Industry and reproach our Skill,
our Prescriptions will do us but
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50053:124"/>
little Service till we have reformed
our Love, the Misapplication of
which is the true Source of all our
Disorder, the corrupt Root of all
our Faults. If therefore we would
come up to our holy Religion, if
we would be those wise and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Creatures that <hi>GOD</hi> designs
we should, let us above all things
fix our Love on its proper Object,
put it in a regular Motion, and
then do but allow it Scope, and
faithfully pursue its Tendencies,
and we need not be afraid of doing
amiss; we should run the Race
that is set before us with Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Vigor, in a direct Line,
and with an unwearied Constancy.
For when Love is arrived at its
<hi>Zenith,</hi> when GOD is <hi>all in all,</hi>
then and not till then, shall we be
consummate; and the greater Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
we make in this Love whilst
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50053:124"/>
we stay on Earth, the nearer Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
do we make to Perfection.
Could we love <hi>GOD</hi> as intirely as he
loves himself, we should then be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as our heavenly Father is perfect.</p>
               <p>One way whereby the Love of
<hi>GOD</hi> mightily facilitates our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and secures the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of it is this, it reduces our
Duty to a very narrow Compass.
For it is not the Difficulty but the
Multiplicity of our Tasks which is
the Cause that some of them are
neglected. We cannot say of any
particular Duty that it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and yet through the Shortness
of our Views, and Narrowness of
our Powers, it frequently happens
that some of our Devoirs are unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
But though a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
attend to many things at once,
yet sure he can to this one, to <hi>love
the Lord his GOD with all his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50053:125"/>
Heart,</hi> &amp;c. that is, to move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him with all the Force of his
Nature. And though I cannot say
this will secure him from all pitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Infirmities, yet I dare venture
to affirm it will from all imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Transgressions, and keep him
asfree from Sin as is consistent with
the Imperfection of this present
State: And certainly to be fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against the Venom, and secured
from the Shame of Sin, is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
Blessing. Repentance
is indeed an excellent Atidote to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the Poyson, but 'tis much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not to take it. For though I
were sure to be delivered from the
evil Consequences of Sin, I would
not commit it merely on account of
its natural Turpitude and conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant
Evil. 'Tis so exceeding ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in its own Nature, and such a
Reproach to ours, that though I
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50053:125"/>
know <hi>GOD</hi> (so great is his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
will pardon me upon my true
Repentance, yet I know not how to
forgive my self. Even that very
Goodness which frees us from the
punishment, encreases the Shame
of Sin, and makes it so much the
more abominable in that it is an
Offence against so great a Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Expostulation in
my Mind is very emphatick: How
can I do this great Evil and sin
against <hi>GOD?</hi> He does not say
how can I expose my self to the
Hazzard of Discovery, the Pain of
Repentance, and all the evil Effects
and Punishments of Sin? No,
that which was most grievous to
him, and is so to all ingenious
Tempers, was the Opposition that
is in Sin to the Nature of <hi>GOD,</hi>
the Affront that it offers to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and Goodness. In his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50053:126"/>
Sin in its self was the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Evil, the only thing to
be avoided and fled from, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
of all Punishments this is
most deplorable, to be given up to
our own Hearts Lust, and suffered
to follow our own Imaginations.
But to return from this Digression.</p>
               <p>What was observed above is by
the way a sufficient Apology for the
Strictness of the Divine Law.
For since 'tis GOD only that does
us good, and he only that is our
Good; since all our Happiness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in a Union with and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him; and since without
Holiness there can be no Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with <hi>GOD,</hi> and that without
Obedience to his Commands we
can never partake of his Nature;
therefore Holiness is of absolute
Necessity because it is impossible
to be happy without being holy.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50053:126"/>
To suppose it is to suppose the
greatest Absurdity, and to imagine,
either that GOD is not our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or that 'tis possible to enjoy
him without being like him. We
have therefore no reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the strictest Precepts of
our Religion. For when we are
commanded to <hi>cleanse our selves from
all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, to
perfect Holiness, to deny and mortifie</hi>
that Part of us which is the Scene
of Temptation, the <hi>corruptible Body
which presses down the Soul, to be holy
in all manner of Conversation,</hi> and in
a word to be <hi>perfect as our Heavenly
Father is perfect;</hi> we are but in
other Words commanded to be as
happy as ever we can, no difficult
Task one would think, we may
rather wonder why it should be
enjoyned us, since Nature and the
Reason of things dictate and press
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50053:127"/>
it on us. But though we all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
pursue after Happiness,
though we all constantly desire it,
yet we are too apt to mistake the
means of attaining it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
GOD has thought fit out of
his unspeakable Goodness to send
his Son into the World, to shew
us by Precept and Example the true
way to Felicity, and explicitly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that which we all blindly
pursue. He does not exact of us
any Duty, but what if we had a just
View of things we would chuse
our selves; and only engages us by
all that Deference that is due to his
Wisdom, by all that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
we owe to his Authority, to
seek for Happiness there only where
we are sure to find it; to make use
of such Methods as will infallibly
secure us from Delusion and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment;
and therefore we can
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50053:127"/>
never answer it either to Reason or
good Nature if we be refractory to
such exuberant Kindness and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discention.</p>
               <p>But secondly, the intire Love of
GOD is necessary, because unless
we love GOD only, we do in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
not love him at all, the Desire
of <hi>GOD,</hi> and Desire of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being in their own Nature
incompatible, and by allowing our
selves to love the one, we do by
consequence forsake the other.
For besides what you have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
very excellently observed to this
purpose in the Discourse it self, it
may further be considered, that
Love being the same to the Soul
that Motion is to Bodies, as Bodies
cannot have two Centers, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Terms of Motion, so neither
can the Soul have a twofold Desire.
We may as reasonably expect that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50053:128"/>
a Stone should go up Hill and
down Hill at the same time as
that the Soul should <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
GOD and any <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
To love is in <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> to make
the thing <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> our End: We
move towards good in order to
make that good our own, and to
embrace and acquiesce in it. Now
he that loves the Creature does it
because he expects some Degrees
of Happiness (at least) from it,
and so far makes it his End, and
consequently does not center upon
<hi>GOD</hi> as his compleat and only
Felicity, for if he did, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to with-hold any Degree of
his Love from him. Again, if as
you said in your last, he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
<hi>GOD</hi> cannot Desire any thing
out of him, because of the infinite
Fulness of GOD, then certainly he
that desires any thing besides GOD,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50053:128"/>
whatever he pretend, or however
he deceive himself, does not truly
love GOD, for if he did, that
would quench all Desire of the
Creature. He that has discovered
the Fountain will not seek for
troubled and failing Streams to
quench his Thirst: He can never
be content to step aside to catch at
the Shadow who is in Pursuit and
View of the Substance. The Soul
that loves GOD has no occasion to
love other things, because it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
needs nor expects Felicity from
them whenever it moves towards
the Creature it must necessarily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Creator, and it can never
truly turn to him without a Dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction
of all besides him.</p>
               <p>Perhaps this may be thought a
skrewing up things to too great a
Heigth, a winding up our Nature
to a Pitch it is not able to reach;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50053:129"/>
and though it may be fit and desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet it is not at present practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to love GOD with such an
intense and abstracted Affection.
But I consider, that since we are
so apt to tumble down the Hill,
so inclinable to take up with the
least and lowest Measures; since
'tis impossible we should love too
much, and very great Danger of
our loving too little; and that our
Practice does constantly come
short of our Theory, our Copy sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
reach the Original; it cannot
be amiss to represent our Duty in
the strictest Measures, to excite our
Endeavours to do as well as we can,
since we cannot expect to compass
what we ought, or pay to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majesty what is due to his
transcendent Excellencies and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Love to us: And since our
just Debt cannot be discharged, is
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50053:129"/>
it not fit to raise our Composition
as high as our Stock will bear?
Besides, the Design of all this is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to secure and improve our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and is it not an odd thing
for a Man to complain of enjoying
too much, and of being over hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py?
His Desire of Happiness is
ever flaming, he may indeed be,
and often is mistaken in his Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to particular Objects, can
it then be thought a Discourtesie to
direct him to that never-failing
Spring, that stable Center which
cannot disappoint him? And
though perhaps he may think it at
first an uneasie thing to restrain his
Desires from their usual Haunts,
and to put them in a new and quite
contrary Motion, yet if the Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of the thing cannot, at least
let his Kindness to himself perswade
him to make the Experiment, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50053:130"/>
I doubt not but that in a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time he will be fully convinced
that the intire Love of GOD is as
practicable and pleasurable as 'tis
rational and perfective.</p>
               <p>And indeed, nothing does so
much greaten and inlarge the Mind
as the Love of <hi>GOD;</hi> for when it
has so vast a good before it, it must
needs stretch it self to receive the
Fullest Draught that ever it can,
and to be covetous and ambitious
of the supreme Good are very lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Qualities. Farther yet, the
Love of <hi>GOD</hi> will inspire the Soul
with the most generous Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
A noble Mind though it
love never so heartily, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
Love again unless it can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to some Merit to recommend
it. And though Merit is a thing
that Creatures can have no Title to
in respect of their Creator, yet some
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50053:130"/>
faint Resemblance of it they may
aspire to. Though they cannot
strictly deserve, yet they may do
that which through his gracious
Acceptance will entitle them to his
Favour, which though it be not
Merit, yet through his Condiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is equivalent to it. And
therefore an ardent Lover of <hi>GOD</hi>
will consider how incongruous it is
to present him with a mean and
narrow Soul, a Heart grovling on
the Earth, cleaving to little dirty
Creatures. He will discern that
nothing but what is great and best
is fit for <hi>GOD</hi>'s Service, and will
strive even to out-do himself that
he may procure an Oblation tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
fit for such a Majesty. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
when we can say with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
our Hearts are fixed,</hi> when they
are <hi>intirely</hi> fixed on GOD, we have
very great reason to <hi>sing and give
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50053:131"/>
Praise,</hi> for then we are truly and
very happy, but never till then.</p>
               <p>And now Sir, you have all that
at present occurs to my Mind on
this noble Argument, and when
you have added what you promise,
I think there will not remain much
more to be said upon this Subject,
unless you will please to assign the
Cause why we are so backward to
a Love that is both so reasonable in
it self, and so pleasant and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to us. It may indeed seem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
strange to a considerate
Person, why any one who has the
Use of Reason, should not love
<hi>GOD,</hi> or why he should love any
thing besides him. For does not
the Will as naturally and necessarily
seek after good and cleave to it, as
the hungry Appetite does to its
Food, or the thirsty Hart to the
refreshing Streams? And does not
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50053:131"/>
                  <hi>GOD</hi> comprehend all possible
Good, is he not the very Fountain
and sole Author of it? Is he not
Goodness it self, that communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Goodness which gave Being to
all things, in whom all things are,
and consequently whatsoever is
good in them must in a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Manner subsist in him, as
you have fully made out in a just
Discourse upon the Subject.
And admitting that he were not
the efficient Cause of all our good,
of all our pleasing Sensations; yet,
according to the Principles of all
Mankind (for they who deny
GOD and his Goodness do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be ranked in that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
all the good that we do or
can enjoy, is, if not that way, yet
some way or other derived from
him. Whither then can the Will
possibly move but towards him?
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50053:132"/>
Where can it quench its insatiable
Thirst but in this inexhaustible
Ocean of Delight? And having
once tasted of this true and only sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
good, is it possible that it
should desire or relish any thing
besides him? It is indeed strange,
very strange that it should! And
no body could imagine it if Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
did not daily declare it.
From whence then does this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
arise? What's the reason
that we do not all seek for good
there, and there only, where we
all acknowledge it does in the
most eminent manner reside?
Why the Mischief is, that though
we habitually know this, yet we
do not actually consider it, or at
least not so thoroughly as to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
us to this Choice. 'Tis our
Misfortune that we live an animal
before we live a rational Life; the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50053:132"/>
good we enjoy is mostly transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to us through Bodily Mediums,
and contracts such a Tincture of
the Conveyance through which it
passes, that forgetting the true
Cause and Sourse of all our good,
we take up with those occasional
goods that are more visible, and
present to our animal Nature.
Besides, the Mistakes of our Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
do too much confirm us in
this Error. We suck in false Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Tendencies betimes,
and are taught, not to thirst after
GOD as our only good, but to
close with those visible Objects
that surround us, to rest and stay
in them. These we learn to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
and call our goods, to value
our selves upon, and be pleased in
the Enjoyment of them. And as
we grow up we see the generality
of the World pursuing the same
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50053:133"/>
Method, and think it our Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to strike in with the vulgar
Herd. Probably we may have
been taught to call on <hi>GOD,</hi> to
acknowledge him the giver of all
good things in a formal Address,
and when we have done so we fancy
we have paid our Tribute, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
our Duty, and therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
no further into the meaning
of it, but put on our Religion as
we do our Cloaths in Conformity
to the Fashion, nay perhaps do not
so much study, or make so many
Inquiries about that as we do about
the other. Thus are we insensibly
betrayed into a wrong Motion,
and blindly follow on in it, till at
length we become so glew'd to the
Creature, that 'tis almost as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to wean us from it, as it is to
change the I eopard's Spots, or
whiten the Negro's Skin: And
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50053:133"/>
finding the Propension so early and
so strong, we imagine that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
not Custom is the Author of
it, which certainly is a very gross
Mistake. 'Tis voluntary Error,
superinduced Habits, and evil Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
that sets us in Opposition to
GOD, it is not through any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Aversion that we turn from
him. For what can Nature desire
but a Supply of all her Wants,
and a Union with the Fonntain of
all Felicity? And she is not so
blind in other things as to mistake
a Stone for Bread, and Poyson for
Food. Nor would she go retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade
in this her great and primary
Motion, if we did not clap a false
Byass on her, and force her into a
By-path. Custom as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
well observed is no small
matter: It is the most difficult
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50053:134"/>
thing imaginable to recall our
Thoughts and withdraw the
Stream of our Affections from
that Channel in which they were
used to flow. Which is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proof of the great Necessity
that lies upon us betimes to cut
off all Desire from the Creature,
to shut up all the Avenues of our
Souls from created good, even
from those dearest Idols that
bear the nearest Resemblance to
our Maker, to whom our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
is due, though they
ought not to usurp our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</p>

               <p>HAving been so happy in my
last as to give you no less
Satisfaction concerning the second
Difficulty arising from the seeming
Inconsistency of the intire Love of
<hi>GOD</hi> with the Love of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
than concerning the first,
suggested from the Causality of
GOD in reference to Pain as well
as Pleasure, I shall now resume
that Thred of my Discourse,
which in the last save one I begun.
but by Occasion of the Objection
crossing my Way was forced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
and proceed to add to what
both you and my self have already
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50053:135"/>
offered, such further Improvement
as I think necessary in order to the
fuller Establishment of the intire
Love of GOD. The Truth and
Reasonableness of which Notion
the more I think of it, seems to
me so very evident, that as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
with-hold my Assent from it
my self, so were it not a matter of
Practice wherein our Passions and
Interests are concerned, as well as
Theory that imploys our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
I should strangely
wonder at all rational and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Persons that can. But this in
great measure silences my Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For this is the great Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that all Truths of a moral
Nature lie under in Comparison of
those that are physical or mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
that though the former be
in themselves no less certain than
the latter, and demonstrated with
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50053:136"/>
equal Evidence, yet they will not
equally convince, nor find a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
Reception in the Minds of
Men, because they meet with their
Passions and Lusts, and have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the will and affections to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with even after they have gained
upon their Understandings; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the other being abstract and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Truths, and such where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are wholly disinteressed,
stand or fall by their own Light,
and never fail to be received accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Degree of Evidence
which they bring with them.
Were I to deal only with the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Part of Man, I should think
that half of what has been said
would be enough to convince that,
but considering the Nature of the
Truth I advance, and what a
strong Interest is made against it
in the affectionate Part of humane
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50053:136"/>
Nature, I cannot expect to find
the generality of Men overforward
to receive it. But then on the
other side neither shall I for the
same Reason think their Backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
any Objection, or measure the
Truth of the Proposition by the
Number of its Adherents. For
when all is done, Men will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no further than they like,
and were the Notion never so self-evident,
or my Arguments for it
never so convincing and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative,
the mere Opposition that
it carries to the Passions and lower
Interests of Men, would I doubt
not be enough to make it a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.
For what, to have our Hearts
that have been for may Years,
even from the first Pulses of them,
cleaving and fixing and adhering to
the World, taking Root in it, and
incorporating with it by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50053:137"/>
little Strings and Fibres,
pluckt up and torn away from it all
at once, and our Hands that had
taken such fast hold of it, at one
Blow forced from its sweet Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
To be at once intirely divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from all sensible Objects, to
have all our Idols demolished, and
our high Places taken down, to
be divided from the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to have all the Ties bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
which by a numerous Union
linked us to it, to be forced to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
a mystical Death, a spiritual
Crucifixion, to be crucified to the
World, and to have the World
crucified to us, in one Word, to
die to the Body and World where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we live, and withdraw our
Love from the Objects of Sense
that we may place it all upon a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and intellectual good, who
can expect that these things should
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50053:137"/>
down with the generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
or that a Doctrine that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
such a strong Tide of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
should find many Disciples
in a sensual and unmortified World?
The other Precepts of Morality
cross only some particular Interests
of Man, and fight only against
some of his straggling Passions,
but this engages with the whole
Body of Concupiscence, and at
once encounters the whole Interest
of Prejudice, all the Force that is
or can be raised in humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Which when I consider,
however convinced of the Truth
of what I contend for in the Recess
of my Mind, I cannot hope by the
clearest and strongest reasoning to
reconcile the generality of the
World to a Notion so opposite to
the Passions, Customs and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
of it. Only there may be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50053:138"/>
here and there some liberal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Spirits who have in great
measure purged themselves from
the Prejudices of Sense, disingaged
their Hearts from the Love of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Objects, and so far entered
into the Methods of true Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
as to be capable of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of having their Minds
wrought upon by the Light and
Force of Reason. And if we have
not yet said enough between us to
convince such as these, I would
desire them further to consider.</p>
               <p>That the natural Tendency of
the Will being from the Author
of our Natures must needs be
right, it being impossible that
GOD should put a false Bias upon
the Soul, and that therefore 'tis the
Perfection and Duty of every rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Creature to conform those
Determinations of his Will that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50053:138"/>
are free to that which is natural,
or in other Words to take Care that
the Love of his Nature and the
Love of his Choice conspire in one,
that they both agree in the same
Motion, and concenter upon the
same Object. Thus far I think I
advance, nothing but what is clear
and unquestionable. We are
therefore only concerned to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what is the natural Inclination
of the Will, or, what that Object
is to which it naturally tends and
stands inclined. To this the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Answer is easie, and such as
all Men will acquiesce in, who
will be ready to confess that the
natural Motion of the Will is to
good in general. And that this is
the true natural Term of its Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is plain because the Wills of all
Men how different soever in their
other particular Determinations
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50053:139"/>
agree in this, and because we have
no manner of Freedom in this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Command over it, but are
altogether passive in it, which
shews it to be properly a natural
Motion. I lay down this therefore
as an evident and undeniable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that the natural Motion
of the Will is to good in general.
But now how can the Will be
moved towards good in general but
by being moved towards all good?
For to be moved towards good as
good is to be moved towards all
good. And how can the Will be
moved towards all good but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moved towards a universal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
who in himself is and contains
all good? For as the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cannot represent to it self uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Ideas, but by being united
to a Being who in the Simplicity
of his Nature includes all Being,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50053:139"/>
so neither can the Will be moved
to good in general but by being
moved towards a universal Being
who by reason of the Infinity of his
Nature comprehends all good, that
is, towards GOD, who is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the true Term of the natural
Motion of the Soul.</p>
               <p>And that he is so will be further
evident if we consider the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Cause by which this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Motion is produced. This
Cause. I here suppose, and have
elsewhere shewn to be GOD, and
indeed who else should be the
Cause of what is natural in us but
he who is the Cause of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Let us see now how this
Cause acts. GOD cannot act but
by his Will, that's most certain.
But now the Will of GOD is not,
as in us, an Expression that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
from without himself, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50053:140"/>
which accordingly carries him out
from himself, but an inward self-centring
Principle, that both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
from, and terminates in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
For as GOD is to himself
his own good, his own Center and
Beatifick Object, so the Love of
GOD can be no other than the
Love of himself. Whence it will
follow, that as GOD must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be his own End, and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he wills or acts he must will
and act for himself (as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
represented it in the Discourse
of Divine Love) so also that the
Love which is in us must be the
Effect of that very Love which
<hi>GOD</hi> has for himself, there being
no other Principle in the Nature of
<hi>GOD</hi> whereby he is supposed to
act. Whence it will further fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that the natural Tendency of
our Love must necessarily be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50053:140"/>
the same Object upon which
the Love of <hi>GOD</hi> is turned. For
since Love in all created Spirits is
not produced but by the Will of
<hi>GOD,</hi> which it self is no other
than the Love which he bears him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
it is impossible that <hi>GOD</hi>
should give a Love to any Spirit
which does not naturally tend whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his own Love does. And
since it is evident that the Term of
his own Love is himself, it is as
evident that the same is also the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Term of ours, that as our
Love comes from him, so it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
tends to him, and that as he
is the efficient, so he is also the
true final Cause of the Will of
Man; which I take to be nothing
else but that continual Impression
whereby the Author of Nature
moves him towards himself.
Which by the way may serve to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50053:141"/>
furnish us with the true Reason of
a very considerable Maxim which
has hitherto been entertained
without any, as being thought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a first Principle than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
I mean, that the VVill of
Man cannot will Evil as evil.
VVhich though a Truth witnessed
by constant Experience, and such
as all Men readily consent to, and
acquiesce in, I despair of ever see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rationally accounted for upon
any other Supposition than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
But according to this the
Account is clear and easie. For
here the VVill it self being suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be nothing else but that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Impression whereby <hi>GOD,</hi>
moves us continually towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
it is plain that we cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
will or love Evil as evil, as
having no Motion from GOD to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, but to the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:50053:141"/>
to himself who is the universal
good. And as we may demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
a <hi>Priori</hi> from this Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereby <hi>GOD</hi> moves us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
himself, that we cannot love
Evil as evil, so from the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
we have that we cannot love
Evil as evil, we may argue, as <hi>a
Posteriori,</hi> that our VVills are by
their original Motion carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
GOD, and that he is the
true and sole Object of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Tendency.</p>
               <p>VVhich is also further proved
by all those Arguments which I
have already, and may more at
large produce, for our seeing all
things in GOD as our universal
Idea. For since the VVill of Man
is moved only towards what the
Spirit perceives, as is universally
granted, and by Experience found
to be true, and since as it has been
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50053:142"/>
sufficiciently proved, we perceive
all things in <hi>GOD,</hi> who presents
to Spirits no other Idea than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who indeed is all, it plainly
and necessarily follows that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Motion of our VVills is and
must be towards GOD and him
only; who having made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the sole Term and Object of
our natural Love ought also to be
made by us the sole Object of that
which is free, since as was laid
down in the Beginning, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
of our VVill that are
free ought to be conformable to
that which is natural.</p>
               <p>The whole Sum and Force of
this reasoning lies in this Syllogism.
That which is the sole Object of
our natural Love ought to be the
sole Object of that which is free.
But the sole Object of our natural
Love is GOD, therefore GOD
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50053:142"/>
ought to be the sole Object of that
which is free. The first of these
Propositions is evident from that
moral Rectitude which must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be supposed in the natural
Motions of our Love, as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Author of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to which therefore the free
Motions of it ought to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
The second Proposition is
that which I have professedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and I think sufficiently.
Wherefore I look upon the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as demonstrated, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>GOD</hi> ought to be the sole Object
of our free Love, which being
the only Love that falls under
Command, and the only one that
is in our Power, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that GOD requires all the
Love which he can possibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
and all the Love which we
can possibly give, even our whole
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50053:143"/>
Heart, Soul and Mind, which we
are not therefore to divide betwixt
him and the Creature, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
to him only, and religiously
to present as a Burnt-offering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to be consumed at his divine
Altar. And thus the whole Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Wills falls under the
Right and Title of GOD, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the just proprietary and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Object of them in their lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
Capacity and utmost Latitude.
There are but two Sorts of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in our Souls, as in our Bodies,
natural and free, and both these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
of right to GOD, who has
taken the greatest Care to secure
them to himself. He prevents
that which is natural, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
that which is free. The
first he makes his own by natural
Instinct, the last by Commands,
by Benefits and Obligations, by
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50053:143"/>
his own Example, by bestowing
upon us the Power to love, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
this Love towards himself,
and by all the Reason in the
World. We are therefore to cast
both these Loves into one and the
same Chanel, and make them both
flow in one full Current towards
GOD. We are to make <hi>GOD</hi>
the only Object of our Love of
Choice, as he has made himself the
only object of our natural Love,
and so joyning this double Motion
together to employ the whole Force
of our Nature upon him, and love
him with all our Power from
whom we have all the Power that
we have to love.</p>
               <p>And how happy is that Man
that can do so, that can thus order
and regulate the Master and Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Passion of his Nature, that
can thus love the Lord his <hi>GOD</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:50053:144"/>
with all his Heart, Soul and Mind!
How to be envied is that Man
who can thus disingage his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the Creature, who can
thus recollect, fix, and settle his
whole Love upon <hi>GOD!</hi> It may
seem that he is not so, and if we
will hearken to the fallacious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of our Senses and Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they will tell us that this is to
enter into a dry, barren, disconso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
and withering Condition, and
will represent it as a State of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Privation, as a dismal Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
But if it be a Solitude, 'tis
such an one as that of <hi>Moses</hi> upon
the holy Mount when he withdrew
from the People to enjoy the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
of God, as that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
when he tells his Disciples that
they should all desert and leave him
alone, and yet that he was not
alone because his Father was with
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50053:144"/>
him. Happy Solitude, when the
Creatures retire from us, and leave
us to the more full and free En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of God, and thrice happy
he that enjoys this divine Retreat,
that can force the Creatures to
withdraw, command their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and wholly empty his Heart
of their Love that it may be the
more free for the Reception and
Enjoyment of him who is able to
fill the largest Room he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for him there! How ravishing
and lasting are his Delights, how
solid and profound is his Peace,
how full and overflowing are his
Joys, how bright and lucid are the
Regions of his Soul, how intire
and undisturbed are his Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
what a settled Calm posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
his Breast, what a Unity of
Thought, what a Singleness and
Simplicity of Desire, and what a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50053:145"/>
firm stable Rest does his Soul find
when she thus reposes her full
Weight upon <hi>GOD!</hi> How loose
and disingaged is he from the
World, and how unconcerned
does he pass along through the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Scenes and Revolutions of it,
how unmoved and unaltered in all
the several Changes and Chances of
this mortal Life! While others
are tormented with Fears, and
Cares, and Jealousies, unsatisfied
Desires, and unprosperous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
while they are breaking
their own and one anothers Rests
for that which when they have it
will not suffer them to sleep, while
they are tortured with their Lusts,
and with those VVars which are
occasion'd by them, while they
are quarrelling and contending
about the things of the VVorld,
hunting about after Bubbles and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50053:145"/>
Shadows, beating up and down
after Preferments, at once climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up and falling down from the
Heighths of Honour, pursuing
hard in the Chase of Pleasure, all
the way along complaining of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments,
and yet (strange
Inchantment) still laying in a
Stock for more: In one VVord,
while they are thus suffering the
various Punishments of an irregular
and misplaced Affection, so that
the whole VVorld seems to be like
a great troubled Sea, working and
foaming and raging, till all below
be Storm and Tempest, his Breast
in the mean while like the higher
Regions of the Air enjoys a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Calm, a divine Serenity, and
being wholly unhinged and dislodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Creature, and intirely
bottomed upon another Center,
upon the infinite Fulness and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50053:146"/>
of <hi>GOD,</hi> he has no more
Part in any worldly Commotions
than the Inhabitants of the Air
have in an earthly Earthquake, nor
is any further concerned in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
of those below him, but
only to wonder at their Folly, and
to pity their Misery.</p>
               <p>Then as to his moral State,
must not the Life of such an one
needs be as innocent and virtuous as
'tis pleasant and happy? 'Tis the
Love of the Creature that is the
general Temptation to Sin, and
what St. <hi>Iames</hi> observes of VVars
and Fightings, is as true of all
other immoral Miscarriages and
Disorders, that they proceed from
our Lusts. And how pure and
Chaste then must his Soul be that
is thoroughly purged of all created
Loves, and in whom the Love of
<hi>GOD</hi> reigns absolute and unrival'd,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50053:146"/>
without any Mixture or Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How secure must he needs
be from Sin, when he has not that
in him which may betray him to it!
The Tempter may come, but he
will find nothing in him to take
hold of, the VVorld may spread
round about him a poisonous
Breath, but it will not hurt him,
the very Cleanness of his Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will guard him from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
He has but one Love at
all in his Heart, and that is for
<hi>GOD,</hi> and how can he that loves
nothing but GOD be tempted to
transgress against him, when he
has nothing to separate him from
him, and all that is necessary, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
all that is possible to unite
him to him! VVhat is there that
should tempt such a Man to Sin,
and what Temptation is there that
he has not to incite him to all
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50053:147"/>
Goodness, and what a wonderful
Progress must he needs make in it?
VVhither will not the intire Love
of <hi>GOD</hi> carry him, and to what
Degrees of Christian Perfection will
he not aspire under the Conduct
of so divine, so omnipotent a
Principle! If Obedience be the
Fruit of Love, then what an intire
Obedience may we expect from so
intire a Love, and how fruitful
will this Love of <hi>GOD</hi> be when
there are no Suckers to draw off
the Nourishment from it, when
there is no other Love to check and
hinder its Growth! The Man that
harbours Creatures in his Bosom,
and divides his Heart betwixt
GOD and them will be always in
great Danger of being betrayed by
them, and though he should with
great Care and habitual VVatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
preserve for <hi>GOD</hi> a greater
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50053:147"/>
Share in his Affections (which is
the utmost such an one can pretend
to) yet he will have such a VVeight
constantly hanging upon his Soul,
that he will be never able to soar ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high, or arrive at any Excellency
in Religion. But what is there on
the other side that can hinder him
who has emptied his Heart of the
Creatures, and devoted it intirely to
GOD from reaching the highest
Pitch of attainable Goodness? How
orderly then and regular will be his
Thoughts, how refined and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Affections, how obedient
and compliant his Passions, how
pure and sincere his Intentions, how
generous and noble his Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
what a forward Zeal will
he have for <hi>GOD</hi>'s Glory, how
chearful, vigorous and constant
will he be in his Service, with
what Angelick Swiftness will he
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50053:148"/>
perform what GOD requires of
him, or whatever he thinks will be
pleasing to him, and how will he
run the Way of his Commandments
when his Heart is thus set at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty!
At Liberty not only from
this or that particular Incumbrance,
this or that Lust or Passion, but
from the whole Body of Sin, the
intire Weight of Concupiscence.</p>
               <p>But Madam, while I thus set
out the Reason and Advantage of
the intire Love of GOD, I still
make further way for your Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
how comes it to pass that we
are so backward to a Love which is
both so reasonable in it self, and so
pleasant and profitable to us? You
might have inlarged your Question
with another, since Men are back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
not only to pay that intire
Love which they owe to GOD,
but even to acknowledge the Debt,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50053:148"/>
and are not only loath to obey the
Command, but even to understand
it, will use a thousand Arts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to shift off and evade the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
Force of it, and rather than fail
will say, that though GOD in the
most plain and express Terms calls
for our whole Love, yet he means
only a Part of it. Strange and
amazing Partiality and Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!
But of this general Backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to receive the Sense of this plain
Command (as plain as <hi>Thou shalt
have no other Gods but me</hi>) I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
hinted an Account in the
former Part of this Letter, and as
to the Backwardness of putting it in
Practice that has been so excellently
and fully accounted for by your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Hand that there is nothing left
for mine to add upon this Part of
the Subject: And indeed scarce up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other. I shall therefore
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50053:149"/>
conclude all with a very pertinent
Passage out of one of the Prayers of
St. <hi>Austin,</hi> in the 35th Chapter of
his Meditations. <hi>Reple semper</hi> (<hi>quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so</hi>)
<hi>Cor meum inextinguibili dilectione

Amor non crucians sed delectans,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fill always</hi> (<hi>I beseech thee</hi>) <hi>my
Heart with an unquenchable Love of
thee, with a continual Remembrance of
thee, that so as a burning Flame, I
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50053:150"/>
may burn all over in the Sweetness of
thy Love, which may not be quenched
even by many Waters. Make me
sweetest Lord to love thee, and through
the Desire of thee to lay down the
Weight of all carnal Desires, and
the most heavy load of earthly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscences,
which fight against and
weigh down my miserable Soul, so
that running expeditely after thee in
the Odor of thy Ointments, I may
be worthy to arrive to the effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfying Vision of thy Beauty.
For two Loves, one good and another
bad, one sweet and another bitter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
dwell together in the same Breast,
and therefore if any one love any
thing besides thee, thy Love O God
is not in him. O Love of Sweetness,
O Sweetness of Love, that dost not
tormont but delight, Love that for
ever remainest sincere and chast, Love
that does always burn and art never
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50053:150"/>
extinct, sweet Christ, good Iesus,
my God, my Love, kindle me all
over with thy Fire, with the
Love of thee, with thy Sweetness,
with thy Ioy, with thy Pleasure and
Concupiscence, which is holy and
good, chaste and clean, quiet and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
that being all full of the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of thy Love, all on fire with
the Flame of thy Charity, I may
love thee my GOD with my whole
Heart, and with all the Power of
my inward Parts, having thee in my
Heart, in my Mouth, and before my
Eyes, always and every where, that
so there may be no Place in me open to
adulterous Loves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You see Madam, that St. <hi>Austin</hi>
here most expresly prays for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same thing for which I argue,
the most intire Love of <hi>GOD,</hi> and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50053:151"/>
who is there that can justly scruple
to say <hi>Amen</hi> to this Divine Prayer
of his? I for my own Part assent
to it most heartily, and so beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the holy Spirit, the great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penser
of Charity, to shed this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Love of GOD into the Hearts
of you and me, and all good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
that so we may love him as a
GOD, with a Love truly worthy
of him, I leave you to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of these my Thoughts,
and to the Enjoyment of your
own; which whether you will
further communicate upon this

               <head>LETTER XI. To Mr. Norris.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THough I intimated in my last
that I had concluded my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
on this Subject, yet I find
like its divine Object it has no
Bounds. And besides the natural
Vastness of the Argument, your
convincing and pathetick Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
so rouze my Understanding, so
chafe my Affections and enlarge my
Thoughts, that I have once more
resumed this noble, this pleasing,
this perfective Theme, which is the
Solace of my Heart, the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not only of my Leisure, but
of my most busie and best employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50053:152"/>
Hours. For what have we to
do, what is it that deserves to be
the Business of rational Creatures
but to adore and love their Maker?
It were not worth while to live in
the World, were it not to love
GOD and pay our Devoirs to him;
and could the Atheists and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
possibly be true, our greatest
Wisdom wou'd be with all Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to hasten out of it.</p>
               <p>But though the Account you
give of the Love of GOD be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
and entertaining, yet I don't
in the least wonder that you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
this sacred Theory so fully,
and explain it so efficaciously, since
the great Evidence of divine Love
has assured us that he will manifest
himself to them that love him; they
shall see him, whilst the blind
World has no Vision of his Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
they only can declare the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50053:153"/>
of this hidden Manna,
who taste and feed on and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>Nor need you wonder at my
Prolixity which you are pleased to
encourage and commend, because
it is an Evidence that whatever my
Understanding be, my Will is
right, and though I am very sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the one is too defective to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Commendations for its Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet you are pleased to overlook
its Imperfections on account of the
Honesty and Regularity of the
other. Love you know is talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
as its Thoughts are ever busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in contemplating, so is its
Tongue in displaying the Beauties
of its Object; it wou'd have all the
World admire that which it doats
on, and every thing he sees or hears
serves to excite the dear Idea in a
Lovers Mind. This we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50053:153"/>
when the Object is finite, and
perhaps unworthy of our Choice,
and well may the Observation hold
when our Hearts are united to
infinite Perfection, when all the
beauteous things that surround us
are but faint Shadows of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved's
Excellencies, when our Lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest
Praises are no better than De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions,
and the highest Pitch of
Love we can possibly skrew up our
Souls unto, infinitely unworthy of
him, were it possible to offer
more. When therefore in my so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Musings I entertain my self
with these agreeable Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I fancy the whole intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
World is offering up it self a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Sacrifice to GOD, and that
there is no Contention among intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Beings but who shall with
greatest Ardor love, praise, and
serve the glorious Author of their
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50053:154"/>
Happiness! Whatever it is, I am
sure it ought to be so: For who
can forbear to admire Beauty when
plainly represented to his Eye? Or
to be ravished with harmonious
Numbers when they briskly strike
his Ear? Who is so dull as not to
desire what is lovely, and relish
what is good? Why then is he not
affected, nay, why is he not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
when caressed by <hi>all</hi> that is
good, and <hi>all</hi> that is lovely! When
the Fruition of Beauty, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and Goodness in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
are offered to him? Why we
shoud with-hold our Hearts from
GOD, when it is not more our
Duty than our Interest and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to offer them to him, I confess
I cannot yet discern. And though
much has been said to account for
this Absurdity, yet I must needs
own it still employs my Wonder.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50053:154"/>
For why should even our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
oppose the Love of <hi>GOD,</hi>
since it does not deprive them of any
real good, why should they not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
close with it, since its only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
is to satisfie and perfect them?
Our very lower Appetites will find
more true Satisfaction in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>GOD</hi> and Reason, than in
their own irregular and exorbitant
Sway. Sure I am that a Man may
be much happier by withdrawing
his Heart from the Creature than
he can be in cleaving to it. Nay,
(let it look never so much like a
Paradox) 'tis impossible for him to
be in any Degree happy, whilst
misplaced Affections do so far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
as to denominate him an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Lover and wicked Man. So
true is that saying I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
met with, that there is no Joy
but in GOD, and no Sorrow but
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50053:155"/>
in an evil Conscience. But admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Creature were able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
us, what wise Man wou'd
think much to relinquish a lesser
for a greater good, or shew any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
for lower Delights when
courted to the Enjoyment of the
highest? Why then do we relish
any other Pleasure? Since there is
as much Difference betwixt this and
all other Delights, as between the
Quintessence and the <hi>Faeces,</hi> the
kindly Work of Nature, and the
preternatural Operations of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine?
Other Loves, even the very
best, have somewhat of Grossness
in them which offends even whilst
they please, and have always their
Pleasure mixed with Pain; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Divine Love is so connatural to
the true Taste and Relish of the
Soul, that although the Sentiments
it excites are highly ravishing and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50053:155"/>
entertaining, though they fill every
Faculty with a full Tide of Joy,
they are withal so pure and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing
that they are Sweets that
know no Bitter, Joys without Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
Pleasures that have no Sting,
such as I would fain describe, but
that I am not Mistris of Eloquence
enough to express them. But
whatever it be in which a Man
finds the greatest Delight, let him
abstract from it all that is uneasie
and disgusting, let him double and
treble the Joy, let his working Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
exalt it to the utmost Heighth,
and perhaps it may afford him some
faint Idea of this delightful Love,
which yet Experience will convince
him falls as short of it as artificial
Fruits do of the natural and true.
All which does only encrease my
wonder why there are so few Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to this only real Bliss! For
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50053:156"/>
why a Man shou'd reject his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
is a Question we can never
answer, but that he does, is what
we daily see. Well then may it
repent GOD that he has made Man,
since Man has made himself such
an absurd, irrational Creature!
Well may the Divine Goodness
passionately exclaim, <hi>O that they
were wise! O that there were such an
Heart in them,</hi> since 'tis impossible,
even to an Almighty Power to make
him happy who is resolved he will
not be so. And herein methinks
appears the Devil's greatest Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
that he can give such a false
Representation of things, and so
much to our Disadvantage as to put
us upon the violent Pursuit of good
where we can never find it, and to
blind us so that we may not discern
it where it is, and our own most
notorious Folly in being so wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50053:156"/>
imposed on by him. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the Ways of Vice are as toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and uneasie as they are foolish
and absurd; they are not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
but unpleasant too, the
Consideration of which is the
reason why I was so desirous of a
Definition of Pleasure from your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
Pen. For Pleasure as I take
it is the grand Motive to Action,
and after all the Thoughts I have
employed about the matter, I am
not able to conceive how there can
be any such thing as Pleasure in
ought but Virtue, nor consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what Inducement to any other
Course: 'Tis as irrational to look for
Pleasure from eccentrick Actions,
as to expect Harmony from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
unstrung and out of tune.
As therefore the Love of GOD is
the Sum of our Duty, so by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
'tis the Heighth of our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50053:157"/>
the Joy of the whole Man;
and were we not strange unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creatures, it wou'd be the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of our Lives, the End of all
our Actions. I will not therefore
search for Arguments to enforce this
Love, after those incomparable
ones you have so well inculcated,
which are indeed unanswerable, and
not to be opposed by any thing but
that which is as unconquerable as
'tis unaccountable, wilful Folly,
for if we are resolved not to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
the Wonder is the less that
we are averse to admit the Truth of
this Theory. Certain it is, would
we but make the Tryal, our own
Experience would supersede the
Trouble of Dispute. The Fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of so perfect and all-sufficient a
Being, wou'd convince us that he
who is altogether and infinitely love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is worthy of all our Love. For
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50053:157"/>
after all the Arguments we can
urge, after all the Swasives we can
offer, there is none like to that of
the Psalmist, <hi>O taste and see that the
Lord is gracious!</hi> Wou'd we but
open our Souls wide to receive his
Influences, we shou'd need no more
Conviction that 'tis he, and he only
who can replenish and content them,
and therefore 'tis he only who ought
to possess them. And were I wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the World, to Persons not
sensible of their Obligations, I
wou'd desire them only to open
their Eyes, to fix their Thoughts
steddily on the Divine Beauty, and
then tell me if there be any thing
fit to rival him, or if that Creature
be worthy of his Love who can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the least Grain of his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from him, or can discern Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in any thing besides him?
I wou'd intreat them if they will not
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:50053:158"/>
be active in kindling this Divine
Fire, to be passive at lest, not to
skreen themselves from his Beams,
nor put a wilful Bar to exclude
the natural Operations of his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
(for this stubborn Will of
Man, weak as he is, does often
check Omnipotence) and then let
me ask them if they do not feel the
Rays of his Goodness sweetly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
into every Part, clearing
up the Darkness of their Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
warming their benummed
Affections, regulating their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Motions, and melting down
their obstinate, ingrateful, disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
Wills? Do they not feel
these Cords of a Man as himself is
pleased to call them, these silken
Bands of Love, these odoriferous
Perfumes drawing them after him,
uniting them to him by the most
potent Charms? Can they any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50053:158"/>
refrain from crying out, Thou
hast overcome, O Lord thou hast
overcome, ride on triumphantly,
lead my Soul in Triumph as thy
own Captive, thy Love has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
and I am thine intirely and
for ever. And blessed is the Man
that is so overcome! He never lived
till now, nor knew what Pleasure
meant; some Shews of it might
tantalize and abuse him, but now
he is delivered from that Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and has free Access to the
Ocean of Delight, he may now
take full Draughts of Bliss, without
fear of want or Danger of Satiety!
He may—what shall I say? He
may be as happy as his Nature will
permit, and has nothing to hinder
him from being infinitely so,
but that he is finite and a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:50053:159"/>
               <p>And now if our happy Man be
so sensible of his Bliss, that he is
desirous by all means to confirm and
secure it; I know no better way
than by frequently contemplating
the infinite Loveliness and Love of
<hi>GOD.</hi> For as it was this that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
Love, so this must preserve and
continue it, nor is it possible it
should ever go out so long as he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
it with this Fuel. And if for
the greater Security of his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that he may not deceive
himself in a matter of so vast Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
since most Men will take it
very ill to have it said that they are
not Lovers of <hi>GOD,</hi> and yet there
are but few who really are so, if on
this Consideration he be inquisitive
after the genuine Properties of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love, (besides what has already
more loosely been hinted at,) the
great comprehensive and inseparable
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50053:159"/>
Effect of it is universal Obedience,
as I intimated in my last. But to
be more particular; a flaming Love
to <hi>GOD</hi> will create the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference
imaginable towards the
World and all things therein. For
since all those Tyes are broke that
glewed us to it, we are no longer
moved or affected by it. I need
not tell you Sir, that a passionate
Lover is careless to all things but the
Object of his Desire; if that smile,
no matter who frowns on him.
Those Objects which other Persons
pursue with Eagerness, enjoy with
Complacency and lose with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
are unmoving and cold to
him, he is not sensible of their
Charms, nor are the Avenues of his
Soul open to any thing but what he
loves. Other things he beholds at
a distance, they may slightly touch
and pass away, but cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50053:160"/>
But where-ever his Beloved
is interessed his Soul is all on fire,
he does not pursue his Service with
a languid and frozen Application,
but with the Diligence and Zeal
of Love. He will not for the pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Interests that self proposes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive
at the Injuries that are offered
to his better self. He will not see
his Beloved affronted, his Laws
contemned, and his Designs oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and tamely stand by and hold
his Peace; nor does he regard
what himself may suffer, but only
what Service he can reasonably hope
to do; and never is chary of any of
those things we usually call our
own, whether Fortune, or Fame,
or Life it self, but only deliberates
how he may reserve them for the
most opportune Season of expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them freely in his Beloveds Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
There's nothing bitter and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50053:160"/>
uneasie in Love, the greatest La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are Delights, for what so
grateful to a Lover as the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Service, because it eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recommends that Passion which
could surmount it? On which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Love by making Religion
our Business and Interest, our Joy
and Pleasure, takes off that Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
which though really we do
not find we however fancy to be in
it, by viewing it only in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant
Prospect of mere Task and
Duty.</p>
               <p>Again, Love cuts off all narrow
and illiberal Thoughts, gives the
most genteel and generous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the Soul, it extinguishes all
Jealousies and Suspitions, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Cares and desponding Fears;
it has a Salve for every cross Event,
and a Sagacity to read <hi>GOD</hi>'s Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in such Providences as are vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50053:161"/>
resolved into his Displeasure.
Hence it is the Parent of the most
intire Resignation, and exact Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.
A true Lover neither
questions GOD's Revelations nor
disputes his Commands, deliberates
no further than to obtain a good As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
that such and such things
are really his Will and Pleasure.
He does not only submit to his
Dispensations how disagreeable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to Flesh and Blood and his own
Expectation; this a Man must of
necessity do, and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discern wherein the Virtue of a
bare Submission consists, such a
passive Obedience to GOD is like
the new Notion some have got of
passive Obedience to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
a being content to suffer when
we know not how to help it; but
our Divine Amorist has an intire
Complacency in whatever <hi>GOD</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:50053:161"/>
allots, he in a manner goes forth to
meet it, chuses, justifies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces
in it.</p>
               <p>But I must not omit what the
holy Scripture makes a peculiar
Character and special Effect of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love, and that is the Love of
our Neighbour. That it <hi>is so</hi> needs
no Proof, being expresly affirmed
by our Lord himself and his beloved
Disciple, let us inquire a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Reason <hi>why</hi> it is so, which
seems to be this. GOD by the
Prerogative of his Nature, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Beneficence and Love to us,
having a Right to all our Love,
whether it be Love of Desire or
Love of Benevolence, but withal,
being no proper Object of the
latter, by reason of his infinite Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
has therefore thought fit to
devolve all his Right to that Love
on our Neighbour, and to require
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50053:162"/>
as strict a Payment of it to his Proxy,
as if he were capable of receiving it
himself. By this Notion we may
fairly understand St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his 1<hi>st. Epist. Chap.</hi> 4. 20. a
Text which those Expositors that I
have met with give methinks but a
crude Interpretation of. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the Love of <hi>GOD</hi> pressing
us to such an exact Imitation of him
(as I shewed in my last) and GOD
being in nothing more imitable than
in his Charity and Communicative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
our Love to him will require
us to transcribe this most lovely
Pattern, and to do all the good we
can to those whom he is constantly
pursuing with his Benefits.</p>
               <p>It likewise teaches us the true
Measure of Benevolence, which is
to bestow the greatest Share of our
Love on those who are dearest to
GOD and do most resemble him:
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50053:162"/>
I cannot forbear to reckon it an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Affection, and an Effect of
Vitious Self-love, to love any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
merely on account of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to us. All other Motives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
equal, this may be allowed to
weigh down the Scale; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
no Man is the better in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for being akin to me, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an overweaning Opinion
of my self can induce me to think
so. I should therefore chuse to
derive the Reasons why we are in
the first place to regard our Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
rather from Justice, and the
Rules of Oeconomy, than from
Love. For since the Abilities of
Man are finite and determinate, and
he cannot universally extend any
Act of Benevolence but Prayers and
Wishes, 'tis therefore reasonable he
should begin to communicate his
Benefits to those within his own
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50053:163"/>
Verge and District, whose Wants
he is best acquainted with, and can
most conveniently supply; whose
Benefits to him are presumed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
this Return, or else their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
bespeak him the fittest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of their Relief.</p>
               <p>I further observe, that Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Charity are the Tests by
which GOD explores every Man's
Love. By the one he tries the
prosperous, by the other the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.
He therefore who has this
Worlds good, and with-holds his
Assistance from his Brother who
needs it; and he who because he
has not the good things of this
World murmurs and grudges at
their Dispensation, and envies
them that have, cannot be said to
have the Love of <hi>GOD</hi> in
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:50053:163"/>
In the last place, a true Lover of
GOD is always consistent with
himself, one Part of his Life does
not clash and disagree with the
other. He that has many Loves,
has by consequence many Ends;
whence it is that we too often see
many who in the main are good
People, lash out into some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Irregularity, which like a Fly in
a Box of Oyntment, marrs the
Sweetness, and destroys the Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of their Virtue, and brings
a Reproach on Religion it self.
The vulgar and Men of carnal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
partly out of Ignorance, and
partly to lighten as they fancy
their own Crimes, being too prone
to reflect that Dash of secular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
that time-serving or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great
Solicitude for the World, or
perhaps their too great Opinion of
themselves, or Censoriousness on
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50053:164"/>
others, which zealous Pretenders
to Piety are sometimes apt to slip
into, even on that unblemished
Beauty, whose Livery they wear,
which I am sure gives no Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to such unsuitable Mixtures,
however her Votaries happen to
admit them, But when we act by
this one grand Principle, the Love
of <hi>GOD,</hi> our Lives are uniform and
regular wherein the great Beauty
of Piety consists. For I am apt to
think that be Mens Pretences what
they will, that Life only is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
religious which is all of a
Piece; when a Man having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
bottomed on well-cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
and solid Principles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Fear or Favour acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
and steddily according to
them.</p>
               <p>To conclude, this Divine Love
is the Seal of our Adoption, the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50053:164"/>
Earnest of the Spirit in our Hearts,
it being impossible that the Soul
that truly loves GOD should ever
fail of enjoying him. 'Tis the
Antipast of our Happiness here,
and the full Consummation of it
hereafter. Thrice happy Soul
that canst look through the Veil,

            <head>APPENDIX. Two Letters by way of Review.</head>
            <div type="letter">
               <head>To Mr. Norris.</head>
               <p>YOu'll wonder Sir, that I
look back upon a finished
Subject, but because you have in
these Letters answered most of the
Objections that are made against
your printed Discourse, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am very desirous your Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
should appear in its full
Light, though in my first I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
one of the main things you
contend for, <hi>viz. That GOD is
the only efficient Cause of all our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;</hi>
yet since very many object
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50053:166"/>
against this Proposition, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
has offered it self to my
Thoughts, perhaps not altogether
Impertinent, give me leave to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the matter a little furrher.
And methinks the main Stress of
the Objections lies in these two
Points. First, That this Theory
renders a great Part of GOD's
Workmanship vain and useless.
Secondly, That it does not well
comport with his Majesty.</p>
               <p>For the first, That this Theory
renders a great Part of <hi>GOD</hi>'s
Workmanship vain and useless, it
may be thus argued. Allowing
that Sensation is only in the Soul,
that there is nothing in Body but
Magnitude, Figure and Motion,
and that being without Thought it
self it is not able to produce it in
us, and therefore those Sensations,
whether of Pleasure or Pain, which
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50053:166"/>
we feel at the Presence of Bodies,
must be produced by some higher
Cause than they; yet if the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of our Senses have no natural
Efficiency towards the producing
of those Sensations which we feel
at their Presence, if they serve no
further than as positive and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Conditions to determine the
Action of the true and proper
Cause, if they have nothing in their
own Nature to qualifie them to be
instrumental to the Production of
such and such Sensations, but that
if <hi>GOD</hi> should so please (the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the things notwithstanding)
we might as well feel Cold at the
presence of fire as of water, and heat
at the Application of Water or any
other Creature, and since <hi>GOD</hi>
may as well excite Sensations in
our Souls without these positive
Conditions as with them, to what
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50053:167"/>
end do they serve? And then what
becomes of that acknowledged
Truth that <hi>GOD</hi> does nothing in
vain, when such Variety of Objects
as our Senses are exercised about
are wholly unnecessary? Why
therefore may there not be a <hi>sensible
Congruity</hi> between those Powers of
the Soul that are employed in Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and those Objects which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
it? Analogous to that vital
Congruity which your Friend Dr.
<hi>More</hi> (<hi>Immor. of the Soul,</hi> B. 11.
<hi>Chap. 14. S.</hi> 8.) will have to be
between some certain Modifications
of Matter, and the plastick Part of
the Soul, which Notion he illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
by that Pleasure which the
preceptive Part of the Soul (as he
calls it) is affected with by good
Musick or delicious Viands, as I
do this of <hi>sensible</hi> by his of <hi>vital Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity,</hi>
and methinks they are so
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50053:167"/>
symbolical that if the one be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the other may. For as the
Soul forsakes her Body when this
vital Congruity fails, so when
this sensible Congruity is wanting,
as in the Case of Blindness, Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or the Palsie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Soul
has no Sensation of Colours,
Sounds, Heat and the like, so that
although Bodies make the same
Impression that they used to do on
her Body, yet whilst it is under this
Indisposition, she has not that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
of Pleasure or Pain which
used to accompany that Impression,
and therefore though there be no
such thing as Sensation in Bodies,
yet why may there not be a <hi>Congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity</hi>
in them by their Presence to
draw forth such Sensations in the
Soul? Especially since in the next
place, it seems more agreeable to
the Majesty of GOD, and that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:50053:168"/>
Order he has established in the
World, to say that he produces our
Sensations <hi>mediately</hi> by his Servant
Nature, than to affirm that he does
it <hi>immediately</hi> by his own Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Power.</p>
               <p>Nor will this be any Prejudice
to the Drift of your Discourse,
which is to prove that <hi>GOD</hi> only is
to be loved because he only does us
good, for the Creature has as little
Right to our Affections this way
as the other. If a bountiful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
gives me Money to provide my
self Necessaries, my Gratitude sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is not due to the Money but to
the kind Hand that bestowed it, to
whom I am as much obliged as if he
had gone with me and bought them
himself. For there seems no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to conclude that every thing
that does me good, that is, that
produces Pleasure in me, though it
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50053:168"/>
be but the contemptible Pleasure of
a grateful Odor, has on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
a just Title to some Portion
of my Love, since in some Cases
the occasioning a moral and durable
Good does not necessarily challenge
our Love. As for Instance, my
Enemy does me very much good by
his greatest Injuries and most viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Reproaches, because he gives
Opportunity of exercising my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and makes such a Discovery
of my Faults, that thereby I come to
know and amend them. But I
suppose you won't say I am obliged
to him for all this, or that I ought
to desire those Injuries, or admit
him to my Bosom who offers them?
Though perhaps my dearest Friend
could not possibly do me a greater
good. We do not therefore owe
Love to any Object merely on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>what</hi> it produces, but in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50053:169"/>
Proportion to that voluntary Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>whereby</hi> it produceth it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably
to what you say in your
first Letter concerning Pain, that
<hi>GOD</hi> occasions it only indirectly
and by Accident, it is not his ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
and primary Design, he
does not will it from within, or for
it self, but from without, and
therefore for these Reasons is not
the Object of our Aversion. And
so say I, allowing that Bodies did
really better our Condition, that
they did contribute to our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Misery, and did in some
Sense produce our Pleasure or Pain,
yet since they do not <hi>will</hi> it, do
not act voluntarily but mechanical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and all the Power they have of
affecting us proceeds intirely from
the Will and good Pleasure of a
superior Nature, whose Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they are, and without whose
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50053:169"/>
Blessing and Concurrence they
could not act, therefore they are
not proper Objects of our Love or
Fear, which ought wholly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to be referred to him,
who freely acts upon our Souls,
and does us good by these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary
and necessary Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>For certainly that Being only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
our Love, even our <hi>whole</hi>
Love, who has it always in his
Power to better and perfect our
Nature, and who does voluntarily
and freely exert that Power.
Which former Clause I add to cut
off our Love from all rational
Creatures, who may be instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to our good designedly and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but since their Power is not
originally from themselves, neither
are they always in a Capacity of
exerting it, seeing they <hi>may,</hi> and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50053:170"/>
very often <hi>do,</hi> want either Power
or Will to help us, therefore they
are not the proper Objects of our
Love. For that Being only is so
who constantly and chusingly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and perfects our Natures, or
at least is always ready to do so,
and actually does it, when not
prevented and hindered by our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispositions
and wilful Incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>These Sir, are at present my
Thoughts, though hastily hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
up, for I had but a few
Hours to examine and digest
them, and was not willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
any longer in your Debt
for this Letter, having trespassed
too much already. And I am
confident you are such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
Lover of Truth, that
you will on that Account easily
pardon her Boldness in objecting
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50053:170"/>
thus freely against your ingenious

               <head>Mr. Norris's Answer.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Madam,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU are no less happy in this
your <hi>Review</hi> than in your
first <hi>Overture</hi> to pitch upon the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
material Objection to which the
Proposition you attack is liable.
But before I set my self to answer
it, give me leave to suggest to you
that 'tis a Proposition of the most
incontestable and philosophick Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and in the Discourse you
refer to most clearly demonstrated
to be so, that the Bodies that are
about us are not the true Causes of
those Sensations which we feel at
their Presence, but that GOD only
is the Cause of them, who being
the Author of our Beings has the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50053:171"/>
sole Power to act upon our Spirits,
and to give them new Modificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I say <hi>Modifications,</hi> for that
well expresses the general Nature
of Sensation. And it is a new
Modification or different Way of
existing of the Soul that makes this
or that Sensation, which is not
any thing really distinct from the
Soul, but the Soul it self existing
after such a certain Manner.
Wherein it is distinguished from
our <hi>Idea's,</hi> which are representative
to us of something without us,
whereas our Sensations are within
us, and indeed no otherwise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from us than Modalities are
for the thing modified. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
there is a vast Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
knowing by <hi>Sentiment</hi> and
knowing by <hi>Idea.</hi> We know
Numbers, Extension, and Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick
Figures by Idea, but we know
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:50053:172"/>
Pleasure and Pain, Heat and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> by interior Sentiment.
To know Numbers and Figures
there is need of Ideas, for without
an Idea the Soul can have no
Perception of any thing distinct
from it self, as Numbers and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
are. But to know or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Grief there is no need of an
Idea to represent it. A Modality
of the Soul is sufficient, it being
certain that Grief is no other than a
Modification of the Soul, who
when in Grief does not perceive it
as a thing without and distinct
from her self (as when she contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates
a Square or a Triangle) but
as a different Manner of her own
Existence. Sensation then being
a Modification of the Soul, this
single Consideration setting aside
all other Discoursings will furnish
us with a demonstrative Argument
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:50053:172"/>
to prove that not Bodies, but <hi>GOD</hi>
alone is the Cause of our Sensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For who else should either
have Power or Knowledge to new
modifie our Beings, but he who
made them and perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
them? But I shall not enter
upon a further Demonstration of
this Point, since I have abundantly
proved it in my printed Discourse
of the Love of <hi>GOD,</hi> and since you
do as good as allow it in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Objection. This therefore
appearing to be a clear and certain
Truth, give me leave again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind
you of a certain Maxim
that I observed to you in my first
Letter, That <hi>we are to stick to what
we clearly see, notwithstanding any
Objections that may be brought against
it, and not reject what is evident for
the sake of what is obscure.</hi> Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
therefore that there are, or
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:50053:173"/>
might be Objections raised to
shew that <hi>GOD</hi> is not the Cause of
our Sensations which I could not
answer, yet since my Reason as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as I consult her does most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly
assure me that he is, I
ought to rest here, and not suffer
that which I do not perceive, to
hinder me from assenting to that
which I evidently do.</p>
               <p>But to consider your Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I observe in the first place
that having granted that sensation
is only in the soul, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Body but Magnitude, Figure
and Motion, and that being without
Thought it self it is not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it in us, and therefore those
sensations, whether of Pleasure or
Pain which we feel at the Presence
of Bodies, must be produced by
some higher Cause than they (all
which well agrees with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:50053:173"/>
I contend for) you after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
object against their being
only Conditions serving to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Action of the true and
proper Cause, which Objection
seems to come a little unexpectedly
after such a Concession. For if
they are not true and proper Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of our sensations, what else can
they be but Conditions serving to
determine the Agency of him who
is so? Yes, you seem to point out
a middle Way, by supposing that
as they are not so much as proper
Causes, so they are more than mere
Conditions, <hi>viz. That they have a
natural Efficacy towards the Production
of our Sensations.</hi> But if I am not
mightily mistaken this middle Way
will fall in with one of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.
For to have a natural Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
for the Production of a
thing, is the same as to have a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:50053:174"/>
and that again is the same as
to be (at least a partial) Cause. If
therefore the Objects of our Senses
be not true and proper Causes of
our Sensations, then neither have
they any natural Efficacy towards
the Production of them. But if
they have any such natural Efficacy,
then they are true and proper Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which though it be a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which you formally and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
deny, is that however which
your Objection in the true Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and Result of it tends to
prove. And to prove this, That
Bodies have a natural Efficacy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Production of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
or that they are true Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of them (for I take them to be
Propositions of an equivalent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
you argue from a twofold
Topick, first, That the contrary
Theory renders a great Part of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:50053:174"/>
                  <hi>GOD</hi>'s Workmanship vain and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
Secondly, That it does not
well comport with his Majesty.
Now to set you right in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and to acquit our Theory from
both these very threatning Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
we need only fairly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it. The Case then is this.
GOD has united my Soul to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Portion of organized Matter,
which therefore for the particular
Relation it has to me I call my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
This Body of mine is placed
among and surrounded with a vast
Number and Variety of other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
These other Bodies accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Laws of Motion esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in the World strike vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
upon mine, and make diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Impressions upon it according to
the Degree of their Motion, and
the Difference of their Size and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
These Impressions have a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb facs="tcp:50053:175"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:50053:176"/>
Effect upon my Body, some
of them tending to the Good and
Preservation, and some to the Evil
and Dissolution of its Structure
and Mechanism, even as in the
greater World some Motions tend
to the Generation and Perfection,
and others to the Corruption and
Destruction of natural Bodies.
Now though it be not necessary
that my Soul should know what is
done to other Bodies, yet for the
good of the animal Life it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
necessary she should know what
passes in her own, whether such or
such Impressions make for its good
or hurt. Now there are but two
Ways for this, <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Sentiment.</hi>
My Soul must know this either by
considering and examining the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of other Bodies, the inward
Configuration of their Parts, the
Difference of their Bulk and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:50053:176"/>
Figure, the Degree of their
Motion, and withal the Relation
that all these bear to the Configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her own Body, or by having
some different Sentiment raised in
her according to the Difference of
the Impression, or in clearer Terms,
by being differently modified her
self, according as the Modification
of her Body is altered by the Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of other Bodies. The first of
these Ways, besides that it would
employ and ingage the Soul which
was made for the Contemplation
and Love of <hi>GOD</hi> (her true and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good) in things altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of her Application, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
considering the Narrowness of
our Faculties and the frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of such Occasions, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
tedious, painful and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,
but utterly impracticable.
For after all if I were not to take
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:50053:177"/>
away my Hand from the Fire till
I had entered into the Philosophy
of it, examined the Figure and
Motion of its little Particles, and
considered the several Relations they
had to the Configuration of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
I should be burnt before I had
a quarter ended my Speculation.
It is necessary therefore that there
should be a quicker and a shorter
Way of advertizing the Soul of the
several Relations that other Bodies
bear to her own, and of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
or Disconveniency of their
Impressions. Which can be only by a
suitable Sentiment either of Pleasure
or Pain according as the Impression
happens to be. But this is an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
I must in vain expect from
Bodies. They can give me no Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of what even themselves do to
me. They can indeed change the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Parts of my Body, but
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50053:177"/>
they cannot give any Sentiment to
my Mind, or new modifie my Soul.
<hi>GOD</hi> only is able to do this, and
accordingly being willing that I
should know the Relations that
other Bodies bear to mine with as
little Trouble as may be, (it being
not fit that a Soul made for the
Contemplation of an infinite Good,
should be occupied and taken up
with anxious Disquisitions about
Bodies) he leaves it not to my Reason
to explore and sift out the Congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
or Discongruities of other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
with mine (which would not
only be a laborious, but after all a
very fallacious and uncertain Way)
but in Wisdom thinks fit to go an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
way to work, and to give
me due Information of these things
by the short incontestable Proof of
<hi>Sentiment.</hi> And because Pleasure
and Pain are the natural Marks of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50053:178"/>
Physical good and evil, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
the strongest and most quickning
Motives to incline me to seek or
shun the Use of Bodies, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
these are the two general Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he raises in my Soul according
as the Impressions are which are
made upon my Body. Thus for
Instance, when the Motion of the
Fire is moderate and temperate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Body, and serves only to
open and supple its Parts, to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
my Blood, and to cherish and
recreate my Spirits, I feel a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
of Pleasure. But when it
comes to be intemperate so as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the Rupture of any of its
Fibres, I feel a contrary sentiment
of Pain, which admonishes me of
the imminent Evil, and in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
that even Children and Idiots
understand, bids me remove my
self at a greater Distance. And all
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50053:178"/>
this with a great deal of Reason.
For though there be nothing in the
Motions themselves resembling
those sensations which attend them,
and though the Motion which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
Pleasure differ only in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
from that which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
Pain (which by the way is a
plain Argument that those Motions
do not properly cause or produce
those sensations) yet since as far as
they respect the Preservation of
the Machine, and the good of the
Bodily Life or State they differ es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially,
or in their whole Kind,
it is fit they should be attended
with sensations essentially different,
such as Pleasure and Pain, which
therefore <hi>GOD</hi> raises in the soul in
Consequence of those general Laws
of Union which he has established
between it and the Body, touching
it as it ought to be touched in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50053:179"/>
to the Difference of sensible
Objects. The Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of which Conduct we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sufficiently meditate upon or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.</p>
               <p>And now Madam, I can no
sooner suppose you to have gone
over in your Thoughts this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
concerning the Manner of
sensation, than to have formed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
your self a satisfactory solution of
the Difficulties you propose. For
though these sensible Objects are
not the true Causes of those Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which we feel in our Souls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Impressions they make in our
Bodies, but only Conditions deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the Agency of the true
Cause, yet it does by no means fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from hence that therefore they
<hi>serve for nothing,</hi> and are <hi>wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary.</hi>
No, the contrary appears
from the Account before given.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:50053:179"/>
For though these Objects do not
act upon our spirits, or truly and
properly speaking, produce any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
there, yet they do really make
an Impression upon our Bodies, and
according to the different Measure
or Manner of that Impression mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to <hi>GOD</hi> (the true efficient) an
apt and proper Occasion to act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our spirits, and so in this respect
are not merely positive and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Conditions. 'Tis true indeed if
by positive and arbitrary Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
you mean that there is no real
Analogy or necessary Connexion,
abstracting from all Will or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of GOD about it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
such Impressions and such
sensations, so they are mere positive
and arbitrary Conditions. For
most assuredly there is nothing in
those Motions that either answers
the following sensations, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50053:180"/>
and necessarily infers them.
But if by positive and arbitrary
Conditions you mean that there is
no greater Reason why <hi>GOD</hi> in
Consideration of the Welfare of the
Body should give the Soul such a
Sentiment, rather than another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such an Impression, so they are
not mere positive and arbitrary
Conditions. For though that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is followed with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
has no Physical Analogy with
Pleasure, as differing only in Degree
from that which is followed with
Pain (whereas Pleasure and Pain
differ essentially) and so though
<hi>GOD</hi> might if he pleased exchange
sensations, giving me suppose, a
sentiment of Pain, when the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Fire is temperate, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the present Order of
things ought to be followed with a
sentiment of Pleasure, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50053:180"/>
giving me a sentiment of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
when the Motion of the Fire is
intemperate, and so according to
the present Establishment ought to
be followed with a sentiment of
Pain, I say though he might thus
transpose cur sensations for any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Proportion or Connexion that
is between them and their respective
Motions, yet in regard to the good
State of the Body it is not so fit
and reasonable that he should, as
is obvious to conceive. And this
is all the <hi>Sensible Congruity</hi> I can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
you. For in short, if by sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Congruity you mean only, that
considering the Good or Evil that
arrives to the State of the Body from
such an Impression there is an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Aptness or Reason in the
thing why GOD should touch the
Soul with such or such a Sentiment
rather than with its contrary, I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilly
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50053:181"/>
acknowledge that there is such
a sensible Congruity. But if by
sensible Congruity you mean (as you
seem to do) that there is any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
similitude or Proportion between
such an Impression and such a senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as to the things themselves,
or that by virtue of this Analogy
such an Impression has any natural
Efficacy to produce, or (in your
Language) to <hi>draw forth</hi> such a senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in this sense I deny that there
is any such thing as a sensible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity,
that is, I deny that sensible
Objects have any such Congruity
with our sensations as to be able to
contribute any thing by way of a
Physical Efficiency towards the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of them. No not so much
as by way of <hi>Instruments.</hi> For
even Instruments belong to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of efficient Causes, though they
are less principal ones, and 'tis most
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50053:181"/>
certain that GOD has no need of
any, since his Will is efficacious
of it self. If therefore this be
meant by sensible Congruity that
the Objects of our senses have any
real Part or Share in the Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our sensations, though it be
only in an <hi>instrumental</hi> Way, I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
disclaim it as an absurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philosophical
Prejudice, and that
without any Danger of rendring the
Workmanship of <hi>GOD</hi> vain or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary,
that Inconvenience being
sufficiently salved by the first kind
of sensible Congruity, as you may
easily perceive.</p>
               <p>This Madam, I think gives full
Satisfaction to your first Instance.
As to your second, That it seems
more agreeable to the Majesty of
<hi>GOD</hi> to say that he produces our
sensations mediately by his servant
Nature, than to affirm that he does
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50053:182"/>
it immediately by his own Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Power, I reply briefly, First,
That Arguments from the Majesty
of <hi>GOD</hi> signifie no more here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>GOD</hi>'s being the immediate
Author of our sensations than in the
old <hi>Epicurean</hi> Objection against
Providence. And indeed they seem
both to be built upon the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Prejudice and wrong Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
concerning the Nature of
the Deity, as if it were a Trouble
to him to concern himself with his
Creation. If it were not beneath
the Grandeur and Majesty of <hi>GOD</hi>
to create the World <hi>immediately,</hi>
neither is it so to govern it, and if
his greatness will permit him to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and direct the Motions of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
much more will it to act upon
and give sentiments to our Spirits,
though with his own immediate
Hand, which is necessary to hold
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50053:182"/>
and govern the World which it has
made. For, after all, secondly,
we have no reason to think it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the Majesty of <hi>GOD</hi> to do
that himself which can be done by
none but himself. Which as I
have sufficiently shewn to be the
Case in reference to our Sensations,
so I doubt not but that if you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
read over Mr. <hi>Malebranch,
Touchant l' efficace attribuèe aux Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Seconds,</hi> you will find to hold
as true as to all things else. I mean
that GOD is the only true efficient
Cause, and that his <hi>Servant Nature</hi>
is but a mere Chimera.</p>
               <p>As to what you say lastly,
That the Supposition of Bodies ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an immediate Causality in the
Production of our Sensations will
be no Prejudice to the Drift of my
Discourse, <hi>the intire Love of GOD,</hi>
because of the mechanical and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:50053:183"/>
Way of their Operation,
I do not know whether this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
will be so harmless or no.
But this I am sure of that the safest
Way to bar the Creatures from all
Pretensions to my Love, is to deny
that I have any of my Sensations
from them, or that I am beholden
to them for the lest Melioration
or Perfection of my Being. And
besides, if we should once allow
them in a true and Physical Sense
to cause our Sensations, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to think that this may justly
be used as an Argument <hi>a Posterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi>
to prove that they do not do it
so mechanically and involuntarily
as you represent it, but rather
knowingly and designedly, since it
is impossible that any thing but a
<hi>thinking Principle</hi> should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
of any <hi>Thought,</hi> as all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
certainly is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:50053:183"/>
And thus Madam I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to give you the best Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
I can upon this great and
noble, but much neglected Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and shall think my self very
happy and sufficiently rewarded if
by the Pains I have bestowed I may
deserve the Title of</p>
