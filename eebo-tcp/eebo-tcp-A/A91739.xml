            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former part of the
Chapter we have a <hi>Viſion</hi> of
a golden Candleſtick, with
a Bowle and ſeven Lamps
and Pipes, and two Olive
Trees on either ſide of the
Bowle, out of which the Candleſtick was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115567:8"/>
ſupplied with Oyle. The Prophet being
prepared by an humble ſenſe and confeſſion
of his own ignorance to receive fuller in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
concerning it, is by the Angel in
theſe words acquainted with the minde of
God therein. Teaching us by the way not
to deſpond or be diſcouraged by the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of the Scriptures from the ſtudying
of them, but to be humbled under the
ſenſe of our own blindneſs, and to ſtir up
in our ſelves a ſerious deſire after fuller
knowledge of God in them, and to betake
our ſelves unto Chriſt, to reveale the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of God unto us; and then to reſt aſſured
that the Lord will help our infirmities,
and give us an underſtanding to know him,
ſo far as ſhall be neceſſary for our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſalvation. According unto thoſe
gracious promiſes, <hi>The meek he will teach
his way, and ſhew them that fear him his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
Pſal. 25. 9, 14. <hi>If any man will do
his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether
it be of God,</hi> John 7. 17. <hi>Unto him that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
his converſation aright, I will ſhew the
ſalvation of God,</hi> Pſal. 50. 23.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are here to enquire why this
word is ſent unto <hi>Zerubbabel?</hi> We finde
that the Lord ſtirred up <hi>Joſuah</hi> and <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi>
as principal Inſtruments, whom he
would uſe in building the Temple, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115567:8"/>
reſtoring his worſhip; which accordingly
we finde them ſetting about, <hi>Ezra 2. 68,
69. Ezra</hi> 3. 2, 8. The work by the power
and malice of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> was <hi>obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
from the dayes of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to <hi>Darius.</hi> The
Lord by the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachariah</hi>
raiſed up the hearts of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua</hi>
to revive the work, <hi>Ezra</hi> 5. 2.</p>
            <p>And as we finde <hi>Joſua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel</hi>
the <hi>two chief Builders,</hi> ſo we finde <hi>two
chief Enemies</hi> reſiſting theſe two in that
ſervice. <hi>Satan</hi> a ſpiritual enemy reſiſting
the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> office of the <hi>Priest. Tatnai</hi> and
others as <hi>States-men</hi> oppoſing this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
in <hi>civil</hi> reſpects, as injurious to the
King.</p>
            <p>In the former Chapter the Lord in a
Viſion comforted <hi>Joſua,</hi> and rebuked <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi>
In this Viſion he comforteth <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi>
and rebuketh that <hi>mountain of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
which was raiſed againſt him, very fit
and neceſſary it was that both Inſtruments
ſhould be <hi>encouraged,</hi> that both Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
ſhould be <hi>rebuked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We are to enquire how theſe
words are an Anſwer to the Prophets
Queſtion, and an Expoſition of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he ſaw? The Reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Viſion and the Word ſtands
thus. As the <hi>Candleſtick</hi> was ſet up without
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115567:9"/>
               <hi>mans hands,</hi> and <hi>fed with oile</hi> dropping into
it immediately from the <hi>Olive trees</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any humane help thereunto concurring,
ſo the <hi>Lord alone,</hi> notwithſtanding the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of men, and weakneſſe of his
people, would <hi>by his Spirit alone</hi> bring this
work to a conſummation, and magnifie his
power in the weakneſſe of his Inſtruments.
<hi>Zerubbabel</hi> muſt not be diſmayed, becauſe
<hi>mountaines</hi> of oppoſition are in his way,
the Lord being able to <hi>level</hi> and remove
them all, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 20. As he ſaid by
<hi>Haggai, The ſilver is mine, and the gold is
mine, Hag.</hi> 2. 8. If I would that way have
made this Temple glorious, I could as
eaſily do it now as I did before, but I have
another glory and a greater to fill this Houſe
withal. So here, if I would erect this Houſe
<hi>by power,</hi> I could eaſily have done it, being
the <hi>Lord of Hoſts.</hi> But I have another way
to do it by, even <hi>by my Spirit,</hi> It ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be the work of mine alone <hi>Grace,</hi>
and thereunto ſhall my people with all
thankful acclamations aſcribe it, crying
<hi>Grace, grace</hi> unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Spirit</hi> is here oppoſed to an <hi>Arme
of fleſh,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31. 3. to ſignifie that the
Lord alone would bring this work to paſs,
without the help of humane power, as he
ſaid by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, I will ſave them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115567:9"/>
by the Lord their God, and will not ſave them
by Bowe, nor by Sword, nor by Battel, by Horſes
nor by Horſemen,</hi> Hoſ. 1. 7. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> was
conceived not by humane Generation, but
by the <hi>power of the moſt high, Luke</hi> 1. 35.
So the <hi>Temple,</hi> a type of Chriſt, was to
be raiſed by the power of the <hi>Spirit</hi> gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
various intercurrent providences unto
that end.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Spirit did powerfully ſtir up
the hearts of <hi>Zerubbabel, Joſua,</hi> and the
people to the work, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 14. 1. By
preſſing upon their hearts the judgements
which they had ſuffered for their neglect
of this great work, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 9, 10, 11.
2. By comforting them with the aſſurance
of his preſence and aſſiſtance, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.
3. By minding them of their coming out
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was the alone work of the
<hi>Spirit</hi> of God, which <hi>Spirit</hi> did ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
amongſt them, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 5. 4. By
giving them aſſurance of a ſignal bleſſing,
from the day that they ſhould ſet about
this work, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 19. 5. By promiſing
them the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> who was to come, and
to fill that Temple with his glory, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
comforting them againſt their want of
<hi>ſilver and gold,</hi> wherewith they might
ſuppoſe that Houſe ought to be beautified,
as well as the former had been, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 7,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115567:10"/>
8, 9, 21. 6. By aſſuring him that no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſhould ſtand in his way to hinder or
obſtruct the accompliſhment of this work,
<hi>v.</hi> 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſpirit</hi> ordered the Letter of the
enemies for hindring the work unto the
promoting of it againſt their wills, <hi>Ezra</hi>
5. 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Spirit</hi> put it into the minde of
<hi>Darius</hi> to confirme the <hi>decree of Cyrus,</hi> and
to adde <hi>enlargements</hi> thereunto, that they
might <hi>offer ſacrifices, and might pray for
the life of the King and his ſons, Ez 6. 6-12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words obſerve, 1. The general
ſcope and intent of them, an <hi>encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to build the Temple, though they
then wanted power to effect it. 2. The
<hi>meanes</hi> of this encouragement, <hi>A Word of
the Lord.</hi> 3. The <hi>Vehicula</hi> whereby this
word is conveyed, by the <hi>Angel</hi>
to the Prophet, by the <hi>Prophet</hi> to the
Prince, <hi>then HE anſwered and ſpake unto
ME.</hi> 4. The <hi>ſubject</hi> of this encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Zerubbabel.</hi> 5. The <hi>matter</hi> of the
comfort ſet forth, 1. Negatively, <hi>Not by
might nor by power.</hi> 2. Poſitively, <hi>but by
my Spirit, ſaith the Lord.</hi> From the words
thus opened, we may</p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſerve the great care of the Lord
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115567:10"/>
to <hi>heale</hi> and <hi>remove</hi> the diſcouragements of
his ſervants, whereby they might be
weakened in any work unto which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them. If <hi>Satan</hi> reſiſt, he ſhall be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked,</hi>
if <hi>mountains</hi> ſtand in the way, they
ſhall be <hi>levelled;</hi> If royal <hi>Edicts</hi> hinder,
they ſhall be <hi>revoked;</hi> if ſad and deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoughts diſquiet, they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.
God never ſets his ſervants on work,
and then leaveth them to their own fears,
but ever <hi>proportioneth aſſiſtance</hi> and comfort
to the <hi>difficulties</hi> of the ſervice whereunto
he calls. Though his <hi>Authority alone</hi> be
argument enough unto his ſervants to do
what he requireth, yet he dealeth not only
in a way of <hi>Soveraignty</hi> to ſhew his <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
over us, but in a way of <hi>condeſcenſion</hi>
to ſhew his compaſſion unto us. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth
that we are <hi>but duſt,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
attempereth his dealings to our
condition. If he <hi>chaſtiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it is with the <hi>Rod

with the <hi>temptation of a man,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 13.
If he <hi>draw,</hi> it is with the <hi>cords of a man,</hi>
Hoſea 11. 4. So he deales here with <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel</hi>
and <hi>Joſua.</hi> It might ſeeme to

men, <hi>obſtructed</hi> once already by an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Edict for many years together. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the Lord gave <hi>Moſes, Aaron and

unto <hi>Zerubbabel, Haggai and Zechariah</hi> to
ſtrengthen his hands, and to aſſure him,

            </p>
            <p>Thus the Lord hath ever dealt with his
ſervants in difficult imployments, he hath
<hi>anſwered</hi> their objections, <hi>reſolved</hi> their
doubts, <hi>removed</hi> their fears, <hi>magnified</hi> the

11. 12. Rom.</hi> 4. 19. The Lord raiſeth
him above theſe doubts, by his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
and alſufficiency, <hi>Gen. 17. 1. 18. 14.
Jacob</hi> was afraid of his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> the
Lord removes it by a Viſion of Angels,
and his prevalency in wreſtling, <hi>Gen. 32.
1, 28. Moſes</hi> was commanded upon hard
ſervice to bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> we
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115567:11"/>
find him full of Objections, in every one
of which God ſatisfied him before he
diſpatch'd him upon the ſervice.</p>
            <p>They will <hi>not believe me,</hi> Exod. 4. 1. No?
I will make them know thou comeſt from
me by the miracles I will enable thee to
do, <hi>ver. 2—9. I am not Eloquent,</hi> I am ſlow
of ſpeech, unfit to perſwade <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to
part with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ver. 10. This God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
by arguments from his omnipotency,
preſence and continual direction, <hi>ver.</hi>
11, 12.</p>
            <p>There may be a <hi>fitter man</hi> for ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
an imployment, finde ſuch an one, the
fitter the man, the more ſucceſsful the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
<hi>ver.</hi> 13. Here, though the Lord
were angry that he ſhould charge God with
making an unfit choice, (who uſually in
great works hath regard to the lowlineſſe
of his Inſtruments) yet he condeſcendeth
ſo far as to <hi>ſend</hi> Aaron <hi>with him</hi> to be his
mouth to the people, <hi>v. 14—16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now when he is made willing to
go, and hath captivated his reaſon unto
Gods Will, the Lord himſelf removes the
great reaſon, which lay as a diſcouragement
upon him; the fear of thoſe that ſought
his life, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. leaves not any doubt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removed
which might have diſheartned
him in the work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:115567:12"/>
So he dealt with <hi>Gideon,</hi> call'd him to
great ſervice, to deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the
<hi>Midianites,</hi> Judges 6. 13. <hi>Gideon</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
at <hi>Moſes</hi> his fence, <hi>My family is
poore,</hi> and <hi>I the meaneſt in it,</hi> wherewith

<hi>By my Power,</hi> I am with thee, <hi>v.</hi> 16. How
ſhall I know that? Shew me a <hi>ſigne,</hi> v. 17.
The <hi>ſigne</hi> comes, and that puts him into
a <hi>new feare. Timor etiam auxilia reformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat.</hi>
It betrays the ſuccours which God
and Reaſon offer, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. The Lord <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
that fear,</hi> Thou ſhalt <hi>not die,</hi> ver. 23.
but even then ſets him upon a work which
endangered his life, <hi>v. 25—30.</hi> His Father
hath no ſooner ſatisfied the people, and
<hi>ſaved his life,</hi> ver. 31, 32. but a <hi>new feare</hi>
ariſeth, the <hi>Midianites</hi> and <hi>Amalekites</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together againſt <hi>Iſrael. Gideon obeys</hi>
Gods call, but <hi>wants ſignes</hi> to remove doubts,
<hi>ver. 34—40.</hi> He is gratified in them; but
then he is exerciſed with a <hi>great temptation.</hi>
His Army muſt be leſſened from thirty
two thouſand unto but three hundred <hi>men.</hi>
He <hi>obeys, but fears still,</hi> Judg. 7. 10. and
this fear is removed <hi>by a dreame</hi> of one in
the enemies camp, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. And being
ſo many ways confirmed, he ſets on the
work and prevaileth.</p>
            <p>This is very ſuitable to the <hi>goodneſſe</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:115567:12"/>
of God, who knows that we have no

2. We muſt not murmure againſt the

Why ſhould I make my ſelfe beholding

ſo many thouſands with ſpeedy deſtruction,
it was the next way to be ſwallowed up, and

            <p>The Lord hath called you, Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,

That the God, who hath wrought <hi>wonders</hi>

<hi>When our interests and Gods</hi> are folded up

            <p>We have ſeen how the Lord encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

the <hi>means</hi> by which he doth it, is by a <hi>Word,</hi>
This is the <hi>VVord of the Lord unto</hi> Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel.</p>
            <p>Nothing can ſo effectually uphold the
ſpirits of men above difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
which they meet with in

<hi>a ſeaſonable word</hi> ſpoken unto them from
God. The <hi>VVord</hi> of the Lord to <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi>
is confirmation enough againſt all the

it was to <hi>Joſua, I will not fail thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 1. 5, 8. So to <hi>Aſa, when
he heard the words of the Prophet, he
took courage, 2 Chron. 15. 8. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

their confidence is founded on <hi>a word.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 49.</note> And

and <hi>wonders,</hi> &amp; by the ſolemne <hi>Oath</hi> of God.
Now it is <hi>impoſſible for God to lie,</hi> every

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115567:16"/>
to animate any man unto obedience.
A man that hath an ample <hi>commiſſion</hi>

as knowing the power he hath to

<hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 19. Gods <hi>purpoſes</hi> and <hi>promiſes</hi> are
ever ſeconded by his <hi>power.</hi> He will not

Iſa. 46. 11.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath ordered <hi>all duty</hi> to
have <hi>ſome difficulty</hi> in it. And the ſame
word which is the <hi>Rule</hi> of the duty, is alſo
the <hi>comfort</hi> againſt the difficulty. We have
therein the <hi>comfort of his Authority</hi> requiring

the <hi>comfort of his promiſes</hi> quickning us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

a word of promiſe with it, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1.
Heb.</hi> 10. 36. We have the <hi>comfort of

facilitating the duties required, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning
the ſoul to the ſervice, giving

And therefore by <hi>faith and hope</hi> we may

ſerve a while to fence againſt
fear and diſcouragement; but theſe are
but like a <hi>buſh in a ſtorme,</hi> which ſhelters

the diſlocated and divided affections of

            <p>We have ſeen how the Lord encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

            <p>Greatly do the <hi>profane</hi> the Miniſtry of

Chriſt hath put upon them as his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,

who ſo preach, ſo they are the <hi>beſt hearers,</hi>
who ſavour and reliſh nothing ſo well in
a Sermon, as the gracious and powerful

            <p n="2">2. When the Prophet brings no other

It is his duty to heare it, <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi>

So we finde <hi>Shemaiah</hi> a Prophet

            <p>We have ſeen the encouragement in
building Gods Houſe, the meanes of it, a
Divine Word, the <hi>Vehicula</hi> of that word,
Chriſt the great Angel of the Covenant
delivers it to the Prophet, and the Prophet
as his meſſenger to <hi>Zerubbabel.</hi> So then <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel</hi>
is the <hi>ſubject</hi> animated by this word,
and the work whereunto he is animated,
is the <hi>Building</hi> of the Temple.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then Princes and Magiſtrates are to
build the Houſe of God, and to take <hi>care</hi>
of the <hi>Intereſts of Religion,</hi> and to ſee that
his <hi>truth and worſhip</hi> be advanced in their
territories. And although we have <hi>no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi>
hereof in <hi>the New Teſtament,</hi> when
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115567:20"/>
the Empire and the Church were <hi>divided</hi>
from one another, yet in the ſtate of the
<hi>Jews</hi> where they were <hi>conjoyned</hi> together,
we have examples in moſt of the good
Kings, <hi>David, Solomon, Aſa, Jehoſhaphat,
Hezekiah, Joſiah,</hi> how careful they were
to <hi>purge</hi> Gods houſe of pollution, to <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
falſe worſhip, to <hi>pull down</hi> high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to <hi>ſend Prieſts</hi> and Levites to teach the
people, to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> true Religion, to cauſe
the people to enter <hi>into Covenant</hi> with
God, to <hi>build</hi> his Houſe, and <hi>order the
courſes</hi> and ſervices thereof. And in like
manner the Chriſtian Princes, <hi>Conſtantine,
Thoedoſius, Valentinian,</hi> and many others
<hi>called Synods,</hi> and <hi>made Laws</hi> to condemne
and ſuppreſſe Heretical Doctrines, and
<hi>comforted</hi> and encouraged the <hi>Orthodox Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
and Paſtors of the Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are <hi>fathers</hi> of the people, and
therefore muſt take care of the ſouls of
thoſe to whom they have ſo neer a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are <hi>Gods Miniſters</hi> for our <hi>Good,</hi>
Rom. 13. 4. Therefore certainly they muſt
not be careleſs of our chief good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are <hi>to pray</hi> for them, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them we may lead quiet and peaceable
lives in <hi>all godlineſſe and honeſty,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 2.
therefore certainly there lies a care upon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115567:20"/>
them, as well of the godlineſs, as of the
peace of their people.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He is to have the <hi>book of the Law</hi>

keep it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He is to be a <hi>nurſing Father</hi> to the
Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 23. Gods people are
promiſed that they ſhall ſuck the breaſts
of Kings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 16. Therefore certainly
it belongs to their care to ſee that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be provided with the <hi>ſincere milk of the
Word,</hi> Where Religion and the meanes
thereof are <hi>wanting,</hi> to <hi>ſet it up, where it is,</hi>
to <hi>preſerve</hi> it, where it is <hi>corrupted,</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme</hi>
and to reſtore it. It is one thing
ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> for <hi>a Prince</hi> to ſerve God
in his <hi>private capacity</hi> as a man,<note place="margin">Aug. ep. 50.</note> this he
doth by living faithfully: another thing to
ſerve him in his <hi>publick capacity,</hi> as a <hi>Prince,</hi>
this he doth by a <hi>vigorous ſanction of Laws,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
righteous things and forbidding the
contrary.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>twofold building</hi> of the Church:
The one <hi>doctrinal</hi> and perſwaſive by the
Miniſtry of Paſtors, and preaching of the
Word. The other <hi>legal</hi> and coercive by

Unto you, Right Honourable, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>Might and Power is here denyed, <hi>not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

means</hi> unto the finiſhing of the

influence or tendency thereunto. It was
<hi>the ſpirit</hi> of the Lord, that by the Miniſtry
of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of
an <hi>Egyptian bondage.</hi> It was the Spirit of
the Lord that in the <hi>wilderneſſe</hi> preſerved
them by <hi>miracles,</hi> with bread from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and water out of the rock. It was the
Spirit of the Lord that <hi>over-ruled</hi> the heart

was hired to curſe them. It was the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord that <hi>divided the waters
of Jordan,</hi> and demoliſhed the wall of
<hi>Jerico</hi> by the ſound of Rams-horns. It
was the Spirit of the Lord that <hi>ſtirred up
Saviours</hi> for his oppreſſed people, and by
them wrought deliverance for them. It was
the Spirit of the Lord that <hi>brought the Ark</hi>
from the <hi>Philistines</hi> into its place, by the
conduct of kine contrary to their nature. It
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115567:24"/>
was the Spirit of the Lord that <hi>reſcued</hi> the
<hi>Jews from the malice of</hi> Haman, by a chain
of events, which had no cognation one
with another, nor any <hi>natural ſuitableneſs</hi>
to ſuch an end: It was the Spirit of the
Lord, that when they were as <hi>faſt in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
as dry bones in a grave, ſtirred up the
Spirit of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to give them a reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>This divine power may be obſerved
both in the <hi>Head,</hi> and in the <hi>myſtical</hi> body
of the Church. For Chriſt the <hi>Head,</hi>
1. His <hi>Incarnation ſpiritual,</hi> A <hi>ſtone</hi> cut
without hands, a <hi>Tabernacle</hi> pitched by
the Lord, and not by man, faſhioned in
the Virgins womb, by the overſhadowing
of the holy Ghoſt. 2. His <hi>Oeconomie</hi> in
the work of Redemption wholly <hi>ſpiritual,</hi>
borrowing nothing of humane power, by
the eternal ſpirit he offered himſelf to God,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. 3. His <hi>Reſurrection ſpiritual,</hi>
made the chief corner-ſtone after he had
been rejected by men. Thus the foundation
of the building was laid not by <hi>Might nor
by Power, but by the Spirit of God,</hi> Pſal. 118.
22, 23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Church or <hi>Myſtical Body</hi> of Chriſt
hath nothing either in its original or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation

1. The<hi> original </hi>

<hi>A Kingdom not

            <p>It is a <hi>ſpiritual Building,</hi> and therefore
not reared by humane power, a Kingdom
un-attended with worldly ſplendor, and
therefore <hi>cometh not with obſervation,
Luke</hi> 17. 20. The <hi>Enemies</hi> of it for the

the gates of Hell. None but he who is
the <hi>power and wiſdome</hi> of God, hath power
enough to overcome, or wiſdome enough to
defeat the Kingdome of darkneſs. The
<hi>ſpecial end</hi> which God had in erecting
the Church, was, to <hi>glorifie</hi> his power,
wiſdom and grace in the <hi>nothingneſſe</hi> of the
matter, out of which he framed it. The <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

<hi>Gods glory</hi> is more magnified in the <hi>Church</hi>
then in the <hi>world.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is the
<hi>Jewel,</hi> the <hi>world</hi> but the <hi>Ring</hi> wherein it

Creatures</hi> and Tenants to dwell in. The
<hi>Church, Gods own Palace,</hi> wherein he dwells
himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 13. And the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of this glory, is, That it is a <hi>Creation
out of nothing,</hi> no <hi>material aptneſſe,</hi> no <hi>Active
concurrence</hi> of the ſubject unto the heavenly
being, which by <hi>Gods ſpirit</hi> alone is wrought
in it. <hi>We contribute no more to our own converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of, or, from our ſelves,</hi> then <hi>water</hi> doth to
<hi>its own heating,</hi> which naturally reſiſteth
the fire that heats it. We have <hi>no good</hi>

as to be <hi>educed</hi> out of us, all is to be <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced,</hi>

            <p>And therefore we muſt <hi>not deſpair</hi> when
things ſeeme to Humane view <hi>helpleſſe and

who can beyond all our thoughts make
thoſe that dwell in the <hi>dust, to awake and
ſing;</hi> Whereas if we build our hopes on

and <hi>cannot</hi> help us, ſometimes <hi>falſe</hi> and

the more we <hi>derogate from God.</hi> Let us
not therefore be troubled at mountains of
oppoſition, or any difficulties which we
conflict with in the work of God. It is
<hi>his promiſe</hi> to bring all Chriſts Enemies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p>And now to conclude &amp; bring all home to

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115567:26"/>
pleaſed to <hi>carry us back</hi> into doleful confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<hi>into the ſurges</hi> of the Sea again, by the
ſubtle counſels of a <hi>divided party,</hi> who
having <hi>poſſeſſion of the ſword,</hi> and intending
to uſe it to the altering of the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
conſtitution of government, in order
thereunto, <hi>debarred the Peers</hi> of their right,
<hi>plucked out</hi> all <hi>ſuch worthy perſons</hi> from the
other Houſe, who would <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> their
work, <hi>laid the foundation</hi> of their <hi>Utopia</hi> in
the <hi>Blood</hi> of their natural Prince, and
in the <hi>Exile</hi> of his children and family, and
concluded <hi>by Might and Power</hi> to carry all
before them. And <hi>now comes in the Spirit
of the Lord</hi> to ſtop this career of domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And firſt he ſtirred up an <hi>Abimelech</hi>
againſt theſe men of <hi>Shechem,</hi> who liked
not that threeſcore and ten Perſons
ſhould raigne, but rather to <hi>raigne himſelf.</hi>
By this hand a <hi>stop</hi> was put <hi>to their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
till by the <hi>strange conduct of the ſame
providence</hi> his family was pulled down by
the hands of his own Allies. And ſo the
<hi>threeſcore and ten get into the Throne again;</hi>
Theſe confuſions in State ſeconded with
deſperate <hi>confuſion in Religion; Miniſtry</hi> and
<hi>Univerſities,</hi> and all ſupports of truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
learning endangered, and by a <hi>miſcellany</hi>
of all Religions, way made unto none at all.
<hi>The Spirit of the Lord then works again,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:115567:26"/>
mingleth a <hi>perverſe ſpirit</hi> between them and
their military Officers, and <hi>divideth</hi> their
<hi>Counſels,</hi> and maketh uſe of <hi>another vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
to thruſt them out again. The ſame
<hi>divine providence</hi> awakeneth an <hi>Honourable
inſtrument in the North,</hi> to give a check to
this new deſigne. And on a ſudden by the
ſecret power of the Spirit of God, the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Officers,</hi> who had ſo long been the
terror of the Nation, became, no man can
tell why, <hi>like women,</hi> their <hi>hearts diſmayed,</hi>
their <hi>Counſels</hi> confounded, their <hi>Souldiers</hi>
ſcattered, and by that <hi>divine providence,</hi>
whereby they had ſo often juſtified their
irregular actions, were they, in <hi>one</hi> day,
<hi>without Might or Power,</hi> but meerly by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi>
from the hand of God, as it were
annihilated, and made utterly to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
By the ſame <hi>divine impreſſion</hi> are
the hearts of the people of the land in all
places <hi>ſtrangely excited</hi> as one man, to <hi>call</hi>
for the <hi>Reſtoring</hi> of the <hi>ſecluded</hi> Patriots, by
them to make way for a <hi>free Parliament,</hi>
and by them to bring <hi>back from exile in the
Chariots</hi> of <hi>Aminadab,</hi> a willing people,
and upon the <hi>wings of Love,</hi> our <hi>Dear</hi> and
<hi>Dread Soveraigne,</hi> not only to <hi>the Throne
of his Father,</hi> but to the <hi>hearts of his people.</hi>
They who had long known what it was to
<hi>fear</hi> where they did <hi>not love,</hi> were now
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115567:27"/>
ambitious to <hi>love</hi> where they need not ſo to
feare.</p>
            <p>And now that the Lord hath brought
theſe Kingdoms upon the Baſis of their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and fundamental conſtitution, and hath
reſtored into your boſoms, a Prince of the
<hi>greateſt ſuavity</hi> and <hi>meekneſſe of Spirit</hi> (one
of the beſt tempers in the world for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment)
that ever ſwayed theſe Scepters,
whom he hath <hi>trained up like David,</hi> in a
School of affliction to ſit upon a Throne,
and <hi>fitted by a Crown of Thrones</hi> to weare a
Royal Diadem, and by the bitter cup of his
<hi>own ſufferings,</hi> to provide againſt the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
and to heale the wounds of his
poore exhauſted people: what remaineth
but theſe two things?</p>
            <p n="1">1. To fill our hearts and mouths with the
<hi>praiſes</hi> of God for theſe ſo <hi>divinely contrived
mercies,</hi> without the effuſion of one drop of
blood, beyond the view of humane counſel
to have effected; to aſcribe all to the Spirit
and Grace of God, <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, but
unto thy name give the glory?</hi> To bleſſe him for
this firſt fundamental ſtep to ſettlement,
without which we ſhould ever have beene
in danger of flames and blood. To bleſſe
the Lord for inclining the heart of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
to dedicate his Government with ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
a publick Teſtimony againſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115567:27"/>
then which there is nothing which
doth more loudly call upon you to ſecond
the <hi>zeale</hi> of his Majeſty in. To bleſſe the
Lord for that <hi>Christian meekneſſe</hi> of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
in anticipating and <hi>preventing</hi> the
very Petitions of his people for pardon, and
<hi>haſtning</hi> the means of their <hi>ſecurity</hi> therein.
To bleſſe the Lord for his Majeſties <hi>firmneſs</hi>
in, and <hi>zealous</hi> care of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and withſtanding all <hi>temptations</hi>
which would have drawn him from it.
To bleſſe the Lord for his <hi>tender indulgence</hi>
towards men of ſober, peaceable, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
affections, who cannot in every thing
come up to the <hi>judgement</hi> or <hi>practice</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their brethren. To bleſſe the
Lord for his <hi>Christian prudence,</hi> and <hi>heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moderation,</hi> in endeavouring ſuch a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
condeſcenſion amongſt brethen, as
may <hi>bury</hi> all paſt animoſities, <hi>prevent</hi> all
further diſtempers, and <hi>reduce</hi> things unto
an equal and amicable temperament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To conſider <hi>how to uſe theſe mercies</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the glory of God that gave them,
and <hi>to the good of the whole Body,</hi> and not
the particular divided intereſt of any one
Party alone. It is a <hi>diſtinct virtue,</hi> as
the Hiſtorian tells us, to get <hi>Victories</hi> and to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115567:28"/>
               <hi>uſe</hi> them. And ſo likewiſe it is to <hi>receive mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
and to improve them.</p>
            <p>Conſider I beſeech you what it is which
the Lord calls for at your hands in
ſuch a time as this. Whether after ſuch
<hi>Earthquakes</hi> and concuſſions, ſuch <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
and <hi>Temptations,</hi> ſuch little leſſe
then <hi>miraculous viciſſitudes</hi> of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
which we have ſeen, after the
<hi>effuſion</hi> of ſo many thouſand mens blood,
after the expence of ſo many millions of
Treaſure, whether he doth not <hi>juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,</hi>
that now you ſhould be <hi>more zealous</hi>
for his <hi>Glory,</hi> more <hi>tender</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> and
the ſouls of men therein, more <hi>ſevere</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all impiety and profanenſs, more
<hi>careful</hi> of the <hi>power</hi> of godlineſſe, and the
powerful preachers and preaching thereof,
and purity of <hi>Divine Ordinances;</hi> more <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi>
and ſolicitous to cloſe up <hi>breaches,</hi> to
remove offences, and by the moſt <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
proviſions</hi> that may be to <hi>prevent</hi> the
danger of any further diſtempers, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any Parliaments have done before you.
That it may be recorded amongſt the
memorials of this Nation, as once of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi>
like unto this King and this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(who have been ſo obiged with ſuch
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115567:28"/>
a Series of mercies and of wonders)
that there was no King nor Parliament
before them, that turned to the Lord <hi>with
all their heart, and with all their ſoul, and
with all their might, according to all the Law
of God. This ſhall be written for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
to come, and the people that ſhall be
created ſhall praiſe the Lord.</hi>
