         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

indeed, he hath declared, That he cannot give his

as it was concluded, enacted, and agreed upon
by the General Aſſembly of Divines; And upon
that account he was reſolved to ſtand or fall: In

            <p>And accondingly on the fourth of this inſtant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,

with Bows and Arrows, Long Skeines, Croſs-bows,
Darts, and other ſtrange Engines of War, (yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo ſure, but that they are inſtruments for their
own deſtruction) and have made a ſpacious Line
along the River neer Andreſs, with ſeveral Half-Moons,
Flankers, and Sconces; but want great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
exceedingly to plant: however, they are very
active and buſie in making of Lether-Guns of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſorts both great and ſmall; and are raiſing divers
Bulworks and Fortifications at ſundry Paſſes, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and Foords, and are as buſie, as ſo many Rats in
a Barley-mow.</p>
            <p>They talk high, and ſay they will level us with
the Valleys, by ſtoning us from the Rocks; &amp; think
themſelves as ſafe as ſo many Thieves in a Mill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118113:4"/>
flints, to tumble down upon their heads, in caſe they
ſhould attempt to ſtorm.</p>
            <p>Theſe Highlanders have lately made an attempt
upon the Low-Lands, where they fell upon ſome of
our Out-quarters; but the Allarm being given, our
men very opportunely came in, and ſoon expelled
them; killing twenty two, and took thirty four pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
            <p>We could not embrace the purſuit, by reaſon of
the advantagiouſneſs of the grounds for the Enemy,
yet notwithſtanding upon the ſecuring of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
we demanded what their principles were
they fought for; they anſwer'd. For God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their dear
Lord Marqueſs, and their gude King; but ſeemed
to be very paſſionate; and truly I muſt ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confeſs, they are a ſtout (but Heatheniſh) Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>For their Miniſters are as croſſe-grain'd as ever,
and throw ſo many Fire-balls at the Government,
that (if poſſible, and permitted) they will ſet all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in flames; and great is their ſpleen againſt thoſe
of their own Nation, that are ſatisfied in acting by
Commiſſion, under the Authority of England, or
appear any wayes inclinable to an Incorporation
with it.</p>
            <p>So much, for their own Ends, are they enemies to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118113:4"/>
the good of their domineering Hierarchy. If the
yoke of the Lords, Lairds, and Prieſts be once taken
off, then they will be deprived of that wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
which was wont to be maintained betwixt
themſelves, as cruel Taskmaſters, both in Spirituals
and Civils, for inſlaving of the poor people.</p>
            <p>But now (praiſed be God) things work pretty
well; for, the Scales begin to fall off from mens eyes,
to a lothing of former Vanities, inſomuch that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Kirks about Aberdeen are faln off, and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
that Presbytery, which gives a ſtrong Allarm
to the reſt of the Clergy. Its reported, That the

Arms and Ammunition, wherein he aſſures him that

we may probably conjecture, That he hath
ſome notable Deſign in hand, by reaſon of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
and Combination with the adverſe Party;
a cleer demonſtration whereof, is apparently made
evident by the enſuing Summons.</p>
