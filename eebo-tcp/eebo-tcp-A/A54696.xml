            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IF a very long and sad, for many years together, often repeated Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, with the sence of very many National and Universal needless Miseries, which are so certainly to be believed, as all the People of the Nation (the wickedly-gaining Party by it only excepted) may safely make <hi>Affidavit</hi> of it, were able to obtain any thing or prevail with us, not one, but every man should think that it was and would be a duty Incumbent upon every <hi>English-man,</hi> and true Lover of his King and Countrey (for there be too many <hi>Counterfeits</hi> who do not well understand either the one or the other) to abhor and fly as the affrighted <hi>Greek,</hi> and Relator of the Strength and Gigantine Cruelties of the monstrous <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> did with a <hi>Fugite ô Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite,</hi> from the Phantasms of those ungrounded Fears and Jealousies, which usher'd in, and fomented that Subversion of our Religion, Laws, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, especially when it is not yet gone out of memory, how many Dismal and ever to be lamented Effects and Calamities the inflamed and affrighted Vulgar and too hasty and inconsiderate Factious part of the People, in the Years 1641, and 1642. with the Fancies of Popery, and Arbitrary Power and Dangers rushing in upon us, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Plague-Plaister</hi> supposed to have been Attempted to be delivered to their great Champion Mr. <hi>John Pym</hi> to Infect and Destroy him; Horses kept and trained under Ground; the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> in his Coach and six Horses (upon his ordinary occasions) appearing at <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi> in a Warlike manner, with many other dressed up <hi>Bugbears,</hi> not enough to affright old Women and young Children have brought upon us, and that a Bloody and Costly War, Murder of their King and fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Rapine and Spoil of each other; the washing over in Blood, and almost Destruction of Three Kingdoms, and the Ruine of Church and State have been the Products of them. And when all was done, could not assign any other Ground or Cause for it, than Rebellion that <hi>Sin of Witchcraft,</hi> and the Relish and Content which was found in the violation of all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the second Table of the dreadfully, by God himself, pronounced <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue;</hi> and as much as they could of the first, and by yielding up their Discretions to the first Summons of their Fears of Imaginary apparitions of Dangers, have made themselves to be well deserving, or fit for the Reproach or Castigation which St. <hi>Paul</hi> used to a far less intoxicated People, <hi>O ye foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you?</hi>

            <p>Though your Learning, long Conversation, and large acquaintance with history; together with your curious <hi>recherches</hi> and retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection into the Affairs of the World, and Ages past, a great Insight into the <hi>Politiques,</hi> and a strict watch and observation kept upon the Causes, Effects, and Events of <hi>Actions of State,</hi> and as many of the Reasons and Intrigues thereof, as are proper and do usually come to publick View, may sufficiently fortifie you, against those kind of Impressions, which have bespoken and taken up so much room in the Minds of such as are less Cognisant, or do too much accustome themselves to make their Designs to be the only measure of their own Errors in Judgment, which are not seldom built upon guess or contraries; yet lest your great care and vigilance in all the Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, and the Property and just Rights of the


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62455:3"/>
Subjects should raise in you more than ordinary Apprehensions, and carrying you down the Rapid stream of those great mistakings, bereave you of that Happiness which hitherto hath attended the Temper and Tranquillity of your Mind, and make you a Prisoner to those Fears and false Alarms, which your more Sedate Thoughts, will I assure my self tell you are not to be numb'red amongst those <hi>quoe in virum Constantem cadere possint,</hi> which can ever be able to disturb the quiet and repose of a Man, who from the <hi>mountains of Time,</hi> hath looked further than yesterday, and by the Rules of Prudence, Policy, and former Examples, may with more certainty than <hi>Astrology</hi> ever afforded, foresee what is likely to happen.</p>
            <p>I have adventured here inclosed to send you my Thoughts and Sentiments, which I hope will not want your Candid Reception; especially when they shall but bring before you and your judicious Censure the Considerations, that there will be enough surely to satisfie and quiet the most timerous or melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick Persons (who too often trouble themselves with their own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations) that the increase of Popery since the Statutes of the first and 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> and 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of King <hi>James,</hi> in the year 1638. (when Liberty, Pretence of Religion, and Conscience began to run out of their Wits, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stayed until they came to an Open and Horrid Rebellion) hath been so little (although the Popish Party have gained too many great Advantages by that and our many Divisions in Matters of Religion and Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and our late National Debaucheries and Atheism, which do carry too many into the Delusions of Popery) As it may, if a strict accompt were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, probably enough ascertain us that there hath been rather a Decrease than an Increase of it. And that if Commissions, which will be no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Rules and reason of Law and good Government were granted by His Majesty unto Orthodox, Loyal, Discreet, Sober; and Unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed Persons in every County and City of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> to Inquire and Certifie how many Papists there are therein Resident, the Result and Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion will assure His Majesty and His great Council of Parliament, that there is not above Five in every Hundred of the Nation, if so many, that are guilty of direct <hi>Popery,</hi> or Infected with it; and in <hi>Scotland</hi> not many more, unless that small Number should happen something to be increased by the late addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jesuited Masquerade</hi> counterfeit <hi>Protestants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And their increase in Riches or Estate, not like to be much, when they that shall be Convict, and have no Lands or real Estate, are by the Statutes of 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to forfeit and pay 20 <hi>l.</hi> every Month.</p>
            <p>And they that have Lands and real Estate are to pay 2 parts, the whole in the 3 parts to be divided by the Statute of 3 <hi>Jac. ca.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>And if that should not impoverish their Estates, and make them less terrible than the <hi>Anakims,</hi> it would nevertheless be effected by the Maintenance, Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and corroding of their Priests and <hi>Jesuits,</hi> with the multitude of Papal Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Contributions to foreign Colleges, and Religious Houses, <hi>Pensions, Censes, Peter-pence, Procurations, Suits for Provisions, Expeditions of Bulls, Appeals, Rescripts, Dispensations, Licenses, Grants, Relaxations, Writs of</hi> Perinde valent, <hi>Rehabilitations, Abolitions,</hi> and other sorts and natures of <hi>Breves</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> enumerated in the Statute of 25 <hi>H. 8. ca.</hi> 21. And there said to be Infinite, with their many times costly <hi>Masses, Indulgencies, Releases,</hi> and <hi>Purgatory</hi> favours, by which the common kind of Papists are sure in their Contributions and Taxes charged upon them by their well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining Superiours, or Conductors, the wrong way to have themselves and their Families kept and continued poor and low enough, without the least of danger of Surfeits or overmuch Satieties, especially when they are to live after the excessive Rates of Houshold Provisions, and Expences for Food

and Raiment, now more than formerly exacted, to the shame and disgrade of the Protestant Religion, by a mighty and insupportable excess of Pride, Usury, Brocage, and Cheating to maintain it.</p>
            <p>Neither are their Numbers or Increase (considering their strict Observations of <hi>Lent,</hi> very many Publick Penances, <hi>Vigils,</hi> and Fasts, and Private Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sications) like to be as dreadful as that of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> to the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or of the <hi>Moors</hi> that had 800 years together Conquered and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred <hi>Spain,</hi> when the numerous Posterity of them were in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Man, Banished and sent home again into <hi>Affrick</hi> upon so severe and short a warning, as they were constrained to abandon and leave behind them all their Lands and Possessions, and carry only such moveables as a rigorous and short prefixion could allow them.</p>
            <p>Or to cause them to be Transplanted, as many of the <hi>Irish</hi> were, by <hi>Cromwell</hi> in his Hypocritical, Zealous, and unmerciful Policy from their other more comfortable Provinces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as <hi>Ulster, Lyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> Pale, into <hi>Connaught</hi> the worser part of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And that there is no foundation to support those <hi>Panick</hi> Fears which have so greatly and more then needs tormented the Minds of too many of the either over-credulously fearful, or over-medling part of the People, and being only more supposed than demonstrated to be a Grievance, and lying heavy upon some kind of Spirits, will be as necessary to be taken out of their Minds, and as well becoming a State <hi>Policy,</hi> and the Care of the Soveraign, as it was of our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, who in the turbulent Commotions of his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons and their Adherents, and the Distresses which were put upon him, found it to be no <hi>Mountebank</hi>'s Medicine to Cure and asswage the Distempers of the all-discerning and giddy Multitude, by granting out his Commissions into every County, to inquire of their Grievances or causes of discontents; so as not to excuse or Patronize any one Sort or Sect whatsoever, in their maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Unchristian and Damnable Doctrine of <hi>Killing</hi> or <hi>Deposing</hi> Princes for <hi>Male-Administration</hi> of Justice, or those that dissent from our truly Loyal and Religious Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be a thing capable of wonder, and fit to be put as a Question to the more Intelligent, How it should happen that Fears and Jealousies should so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the Minds of such as endeavour to affright themselves, and others with the Attempts and Dangerous Doctrines of the <hi>Popish</hi> Party, and the same persons nevertheless to be so calm and silent in the fast-rooted, unrepented, and offered in publick to be justified groundless, ungodly, and disloyal Opinions of too many of those that would be called <hi>Protestants,</hi> and accompted Zealots in the Practice and Promotion of it, That <hi>a King is accomptable to the People for breach of Trust, may be deposed,</hi> and is but <hi>Co-ordinate with both his Houses of Parliament;</hi> and as not content with that which can never be proved to be due unto them, would mount a great deal higher, and pretend that there is a <hi>Soveraignty</hi> in the People; and that the <hi>King is but an Artificial Man, set up or appointed by them;</hi> And suffer a Seditious Book, called, <hi>The Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Humane Laws</hi> to be publickly Sold, and never complained of, when it doth all it can to prove, That <hi>every man, how simple or illiterate soever he be, is to be a Judge, whether the Law or a Command of his Prince or Superior be good or bad, and direct or apply his Obedience unto it accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if they had never heard or read of the folly and dire Effects of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and Sedition in that of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, That <hi>Allegiance was only due to the Crown, and not unto the Person of the Prince;</hi> being exploded by two Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the Promoters


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62455:4"/>
Condemned of Treason, and his Inforced resignation of his Crown to his Son King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, by the Faction of his <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Mortimer,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second by an over-power of the Army of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and his Party, occasioned by affrighting him into a seeming vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Surrender, disallowed and detested by Succeeding Ages.</p>
            <p>Or may we not rather commend and imitate the better temper of the Subjects of this Kingdom before the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year of the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> when in the beginning of her Happy and ever to be praised Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they never started at her Indulgence to the <hi>Popish</hi> Party, or took it ill that she kept an Embassador at <hi>Rome,</hi> and was offered to have the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> and Reformation established by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Authority, if she would but acknowledge his Supremacy, gave Aid to <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> a distressed Popish Prince towards the Recovery of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and so much assisted <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Papist and Mother to our King <hi>James</hi> (who if she had survived her, was by Inheritance to have been Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> against the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Congregational</hi> Rebellious Party in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as they called her <hi>the Whore of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and publickly Preached that she was an Atheist, and of no Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or can we do less than deem the <hi>English</hi> Nation in the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> to be happy in their enjoyment of so great a Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to be free from any Suspitions of the Increase of Popery, when he was wrongfully accused by <hi>Elphiston,</hi> to have written a little before his coming to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> a seeming friendly Letter to the Pope, and that the Pope had after he came into <hi>England,</hi> sent a Cardinal to Seduce him into the Snares of that Religion; wherein (although upon reason of State he had given his Royal Protection unto <hi>Preston</hi> and <hi>Warrington,</hi> two Secular Priests, against the Practices of some <hi>Jesuits,</hi> which <hi>Abbot</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> a professed enemy to Popery, did allow as a thing not evilly done) his afterwards Learned Books and Writings against that Church, might have abundantly manifested the folly of such who should but have imagined that he had any Inclination or good Will unto it.</p>
            <p>For it cannot be unknown to you, that until the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year, and the after succeeding years of the Reign of that peaceable and wise Prince, when his Son-in-Law <hi>Frederick</hi> Prince Elector, and Count <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> had as unhappily as rashly and unjustly, taken upon him to be Elected King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and that by the designed Marriage of His late Majesty with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> he endeavoured all he could to allay and quench the Fire which the Wars about that and the <hi>Palatinate</hi> had kindled in <hi>Germany,</hi> and had put too many of our <hi>English</hi> into an humour and fit of Zeal, to desire the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of the Protestant Religion by the Sword, no such Fears or Jealousies had gained a Possession in the Minds of some unquiet People, who were in Duty as well as Reason to have acquiesced in the Constancy and Care of that Religious King, for the preservation of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Nor escape your Observation, that the benefits of the Marriage with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> being not well understood, and the misapprehension of a Toleration of Popery to ensue thereupon, multiplying the supposed Dangers.</p>
            <p>Having induced the House of Commons in Parliament in the Nineteenth year of his Reign, to Petition that peaceable Prince, that the time was come that <hi>Janus</hi> Temple must be opened, and the Voice of <hi>Bellona,</hi> not of the <hi>Turtle</hi> must be heard, and therefore <hi>they thought it their Duty not only to provide for the present supply of the War, but to take Care for the securing of their Peace at home,</hi> which <hi>the dangerous Increase and Insolency of Popish Recusants, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, visibly, and sensibly did lead them unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62455:4"/>
And yet in the same Petition did acknowledge, That <hi>they did not assume to themselves any Power to determine of any part thereof, nor intended to incroach, or intrude upon the sacred bounds of his Royal Authority, to whom, and to whom only they acknowledged it did belong to resolve of Peace and War, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the most Noble Prince his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto which he did Answer, That <hi>his Son in Law's unjust Usurpation of the</hi>

                  <hi>Rushworth</hi>'s Collection.</note> 
               <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Bohemia, from the Emperor, had given the Pope and all that Party too fair a ground, and opened them too wide a gate, for curbing and oppressing of many Thousands of the Protestant Religion in divers parts of Christendom; that the Palatines accepting of the Crown of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>had no reference to the Cause of Religion, and therefore would not have the Parliament to couple the War of the Palatinate with the Cause of Religion, and that the beginning of that miserable War which had set all Christendom on fire was not for Religion, but only caused by his Son-in-Law's hasty resolution following evil Counsel, to take to himself the Crown of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>and in the last year of his Reign in a Speech to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wished that it might be written in marble, and remain to Posterity, as a mark upon him when he should swerve from his Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly he must be much an Infidel, and a great Master in the <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticks,</hi> and School of <hi>Opinionastrete;</hi> that will not believe King <hi>Charles</hi> the First his Son to have been a great Assertor of it, when in the fourth year of his Reign, in a Speech to the Parliament, he declared, That <hi>he was, and ever should be, as careful of Religion, and as forward as they could desire, and would use all means for the maintenance and propagation of that Religion wherein he had lived, and did resolve to die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Head of his Army, and very great Distresses afterwards profess by the taking of the blessed Sacrament, <hi>to maintain it, and took so great a Care of it,</hi> as a <hi>Popish</hi> Book could not peep into <hi>England,</hi> but he speedily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed some of his Chaplains, or some other Learned Man of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to Print and Publish an Answer unto it, made many of his Coins of Silver to Proclaim his resolution to Defend the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, Laws, Privileges of Parliament, and the Liberties of the People, and died a <hi>Martyr,</hi> because he would not deliver up his Subjects to a perpetual slavery of a never to be shaken off Arbitrary Power.</p>
            <p>And His Majesty that now is, being the Son and Heir of his Constancy in the Protestant Religion, hath been so much of that fixed and unalterable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution as the Love of a Mother, and all those Obligations that a filial Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience had put upon him, could not disswade him from enforcing the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> his younger Brother out of her Tuition, and Intention to breed him up in the Popish Religion, and the <hi>Syren</hi> Charms of <hi>Militiere</hi> in his Book purposely Dedicated unto him to make him averse to that Religion whose <hi>Pseudo-Professors</hi> had murdered his Father, and been the Cause of those very many Miseries, Affronts, Ill Usages, Wants, and Reproaches which he and his Royal Brothers endured in the Twelve years longsome time of his Distresses, could never perswade him to accept of a strong and powerful Aid of Catholick Princes for his Re-establishment in his Kingdoms, nor incline him to do that to save Three Kingdoms, which his Grandfather by the Mother-side, the <hi>Great</hi> Henry <hi>of France,</hi> by reconciling himself to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> did to save only one, when his Sufferings outwent and far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted any which his Grandfather had endured.</p>
            <p>But if any would have our Laws the severest of which was Enacted in the Conspiracy, and feared evil Consequences of the Gun-Powder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to be put so much in execution, as to forfeit and take away <hi>two parts of three;</hi> the whole in <hi>three parts</hi> to be equally divided of the real Estates of those who have Lands, and Subject those that have no Lands to


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62455:5"/>
great Forfeitures and Penalties, and incapacitate all, to bear any Office in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>They are to consider that it will be as hard as unequal for their King and Common Parent, as well as ours to allow a Liberty and Connivance to those that are of worse Principles, or at least as dangerous as the Papists, fought and were active in our last Wars and Miseries against His Majesty, and His Royal Father, and all that were their Loyal and Obedient Subjects, and deny it to those that fought, were Sequestred, Plundered, and Suffered for them; that all the Protestants in the World are not in <hi>England,</hi> and that amongst those in <hi>England,</hi> there are too many (the more is the pity) who have so rent and divided themselves from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and do so much and so often vary in their Judgments, Practice, and Opinions, as they appear rather to be no Protestants, or very little embracing the Profession and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thereof; that our Incomparable and Prudent Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have maintained and supported so much as she did the Protestant Religion, as well <hi>Lutheran</hi> as <hi>Calvinist,</hi> in the Parts beyond the Seas, and that of the purer and better reformed Religion of the <hi>English</hi> Church at home by her Aids, Embassies, Leagues, and Intercessions, if she had not requited the Catholick Princes with the like Indulgence and usage to any of her Subjects that were of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, and that neither the Rebellions of the Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmorland,</hi> for the advance of Popery, many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Attempts to take away her Life, and Plots to Dethrone her, could ever perswade her, or her Learned Successor, notwithstanding the Horrid design of the <hi>Gunpowder</hi> Treason, against him and his Posterity, and the wiser as they should be and better part of his Subjects Assembled in Parliament, to be more than prudentially rigorous to that Party, whose Friends in other Countries might retalliate any Severity used to theirs; And although she made some fierce and smart Laws to affright those that called themselves Catholicks, for principles inconsistent with the Safety of her Soveraignty, and its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which in all these Acts of Parliament appeared to be more against the Emissaries from <hi>Rome,</hi> which came to Seduce and lead them into such dangerous Errors, than to forbid any thing that was Innocent in the private Devotions, religious and practical part of it; that Great Queen and King well understanding that they could not by any Rules of State, Justice, or Modesty, of which Princes when there is not so great Inequality, as to give them an absolute Dominion over one another, are usually very tender, require any Ease or Liberties for Protestants living under other Princes, and their Laws, when they can neither promise or perform Mutualities or Reciprocations.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Learned King <hi>James</hi> when the House of <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> had Petitioned him <hi>to give some stop to the growth of Popery, one Cause whereof they assigned to be the Interposition of Foreign Princes Embassadors and Agents in favour of Papists;</hi> Answered, That <hi>they might rest secure, that he would never be weary to do all he could for the Propagation of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion, and Suppression of Popery, but the manner and form they were to remit to his Care and Providence, who could best consider of times and seasons; but his Care of Religion must be such as on the one part he must not by the hot Persecution of our Recusants at home, irritate Foreign Princes of a contrary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and teach them a way to plague the Protestants in their Dominions, with whom he daily interceeded, and at that time principally for ease to them of our Profession that live under them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Reign, in a Speech which he made in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, declared to the Lords and Commons, That <hi>it was true that at times,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rushworth</hi>'s Historical Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections.</note> 
               <hi>for Reasons best known to himself, he did not so fully put Laws in Execution


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62455:5"/>
against Recusants; but did wink and connive at some things which might have hindred more weighty Affairs. But he did never in all his Treaties agree to any thing, to the overthrow and dissolution of those Laws, but had in all a chief care of the preservation of that truth which he ever professed; for as it was a good Horseman's part not always to use his Spurs, and keep strait the Reins; but sometime to suffer the Reins to be more remiss: So it was the part of a Wise King, and his Age and Experience in Government had informed him sometimes to quicken the Laws with Executions, and at other times upon just Occasions to be more remiss: But as God shall Judge him, he never thought or meant, nor ever in any word expressed any thing that savoured of it, and prayed them to root out Jealousies, which were the greatest Weeds in their Garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For certainly to Consiseate two parts of three of a Papist's Lands, or disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the next Heir, if bred up in that Religion, can never amount to the avail of Protestants in <hi>Transilvania, Hungary, Bohemia, Silesia, Moravia, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Upper or Lower <hi>Austria, Piedmont, Flanders, Brabant,</hi> and the rest of the Belgick Provinces, nor under those which were United and Confederate, the <hi>Hause-</hi>Towns, <hi>Bearne,</hi> and some other of the Cantons of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and the bad enough already used Multitudes of <hi>Huguenots</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can the Persecution or destroying of the greater part of the Protestants beyond the Seas, to gratifie the humerous pretences, and causeless fears of the more Imprudent, and lesser part of the Protestants of <hi>England,</hi> be by any rule of right reason adjudged to be for the Protestant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
            <p>And upon the like advice and reason may our fears of any Invasion upon our Properties and just Rights disappear, and vanish as soon as they shall with any eye of Judgment be but looked upon; nor will ever be able to endure the touchstone of Truth, when our Liberties are so Impregnable, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by very many of our good Laws and Liberties, and by our <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and <hi>Charters de Foresta,</hi> more than Thirty times confirmed by Acts of Parliament for those great Charters were never singly or by themselves so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times confirmed by Acts of Parliament.</p>

of us and our Generations.</hi> But may do better to give some respite to those their needless Affrights, and pausing a while sit down and consider,</p>
            <p>What greater assurance his now Majesty, could give to his Subjects, or they desire, than what he declar'd in his Speech to the House of Commons in <hi>March, 1661? Gentlemen, I hear and am very solicitous, I thank you for it, since I presume it proceeds</hi> from a good Root of Piety and Devotion; <hi>But I must tell you, I have the worst luck in the world, if after all the reproaches of being a Papist when I was Abroad, I am suspected of being a Presbyterian now I am come Home; I know you will not take it unkindly, if I tell you that I am as Zealous for the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as any of you can be, and am as much in love with the Book of Common-Prayer as you can wish, and have prejudice enough to those that do not love it; And do as much desire to see an Uniformity setled as any amongst you; I pray you trust me in that Affair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1664. tells them, <hi>I do assure you upon my word, and I pray you believe me, That I have no other Thoughts or Design in my heart, but to make you all Happy in the Support of the Religion and Laws established.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the same year, when they brought him a Bill for the Repeal of the Act of Parliament to exclude the Bishops out of the House of Peers; He said, <hi>I thank you with all my heart, indeed as much as I can do for any thing, for the Repeal of that Act: It was an unhappy Act in an unhappy Time, passed with many unhappy Circumstances, and attended with miserable Events; and therefore I do again thank you for Repealing of it, you have thereby restored Parliaments to their Primitive Institutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his Speech unto both Houses in <hi>Anno</hi> 1672. said, <hi>That he would conclude with this assurance, that I will preserve the true Protestant Religion, and the Church as it is now establish'd in this Kingdom, and in the whole course of the Dissenters, I do not intend that it shall any ways prejudice the Church; but I will support its Rights and its full Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>January</hi> 1673. said, <hi>If there be any thing else which you think wanting to secure Religion, there is nothing which you shall reasonably propose, but I shall be ready to receive it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>April</hi> 1675. said, <hi>The Principal end of his calling the Parliament now, is to know what you think may be yet wanting to the security of Religion, and to give my Self the satisfaction of having done the utmost of my Endeavours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>February</hi> 1679. said to both Houses of his Parliament, <hi>I declare my Self very plainly unto you, that I am prepar'd to give you all the Satisfaction and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in the great Concern of the Protestant Religion, as it is establish'd in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>that shall reasonably be ask'd, or can consist with Christian Prudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 March 1678. <hi>I do give you this assurance, that I will with my Life defend both the Protestant Religion, and the Laws of this Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>January 1673. If there be any thing you think wanting to secure Property, there is nothing which you shall reasonably propose, but I shall be ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Febr. 15. 1676. said to His Two Houses of Parliament, <hi>I do declare my Self freely, that I am ready to gratifie you in a further Security of your Liberty and Property</hi> (if you can think you want it) <hi>by as many good Laws as you shall propose, and as can consist with the Safety of the Government, without which, there will neither be Liberty nor Property left unto any Man.

            </p>
            <p>And remember that there was a Time not long ago, when the Phanatick Party, who at this Time are too great a part of <hi>England,</hi> and some of the

               <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were not in the heretofore justly stiled the Long and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious part of a Parliament so much afraid of Arbitrary Government as now they do seem to be.</p>
            <p>When in that Long and Unhappy misnamed Parliament they procured to be Voted down as many as they could of their Soveraign's Rights, Methods, and means of Government in an Ancient and well Established <hi>Monarchy,</hi> overturned <hi>Peerage, Episcopacy, Tenures,</hi> and many other of our Fundamental Laws, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Laws of God and this Nation, and as if they feared that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, raising of Armies, and Chacing and Fighting against their Pious and Religious King, who never gave them any Cause for it (if any Cause at all can ever be assigned, or able to justifie Rebellion) should not be Sin enough, made all the hast they could to add Sacriledge unto it, and placed in themselves an Arbitrary and boundless Authority over him, unto whom they had Sworn an Allegiance due to Superiority, trampled upon all their fellow Subjects, Plundered, Sequestred, and did all they could to Perjure the Loyal part of them, destroyed the Privileges of Parliament, suffered some of their own Members to be pulled out of the House of Commons, and Imprisoned by Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Red-Coats (one whereof was by his own Confession an <hi>Irish Popish</hi> Priest) and by the Assistance of their over-pow'ring Army, voted down, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and shut up the House of Peers, as useless and dangerous, inforced themselves into a Republick and the Nation, who by the Laws of God and the King, and their Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, were bound as well as themselves to the contrary, to Ingage never more to admit of a King and House of Lords, and in some of their Answers to their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who urged and taxed them with some of their Promises concerning His late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, said that they hoped they would not make their <hi>Promises</hi> to be <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</hi> And in their Declaration Printed and Published to give Satisfaction to all the World, that would believe them of the Reasons of their Actions; and turning themselves into a Common-wealth, endeavoured to assert that in all <hi>Promises</hi> a Tacite Condition and Proviso was ever to be understood as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed unto them, <hi>So always that they did not prejudice or inconvenience the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty promising.</hi>

But tamely suffered <hi>Oliver Cromwel, their Man of Sin</hi> and greatest of Hypocrites to put a trick upon them, and teach them the Truth and Doctrine of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talliation by dissolving the Reliques of the over-long Parliament, pulling out the remaining Members with Soldiers and Musquettiers, and shutting up the Doors of that <hi>House of Commons,</hi> and could for the Preservation of their ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Estates, like <hi>Isachar,</hi> bow down unto the burden, and be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to believe it to be no violation of the Privileges of Parliament, no Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power or Introduction to it, nor any Destruction of the Liberties of

            <p>And too many of the gaining and <hi>Phanatick</hi> Party, who might have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen the dismal Apprehensions of an approaching Arbitrary Power, had in the days of <hi>Oliver</hi> and his Son Mr. <hi>Richard</hi> so little a dread, or were not so much afraid of it (when they had reason to have been a great deal more) as they being no small Gainers by it rejoyced in it, thought themselves happily placed in the blessed Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and Conducted into it by the hand of Heaven, and Singing a <hi>Magnificat</hi> to <hi>Oliver,</hi> and a <hi>Requiem</hi> to themselves, and their chosen Posterity, could be at no rest until <hi>they</hi> had obtained Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of many Counties and Cities, subscribed by the most considerable Men of their Rebellious and Sacrilegious Party, and caused them to be Printed and delivered unto his Counterfeit <hi>Highness,</hi> with Solemn Addresses upon their Knees, and other actions of Veneration, by some of their most active Accomplices; wherein they stiled <hi>Oliver, Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua;</hi> made up his Praises with almost Blasphemy, and prayed for the continuance of his Care for their Protection, and as they called it the Publick Good; and were after his Death as busie with the like Adoration; several solemn Declarations, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses and Thanksgivings to his Son <hi>Richard</hi>'s ridiculous parcel of <hi>Highness.</hi>

            <p>And to take Arms against their own Happiness, and betray their own good Laws, Liberties, Privileges and Customs to Usurpers, which were so unparallel'd, as the Devil with a pair of Spectacles cannot upon the most malicious and exactest search, find any Nation under Heaven so happy and blessed as <hi>England</hi> hath been, in the security of their Liberties, Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Privileges, since the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the First, thorough the Reigns of all our Succeeding Kings; who upon the least appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or complaints of Grievances, either as to particulars or generals, <hi>rarò contingentibus;</hi> or but feared or likely to happen, never denied good Laws and Remedies to their People, as all our Law-Books, Year-Books, Reports of Cases, Adjudged Parliament Rolls, and Books of Statutes will abundantly testifie; may with shame and horror of so foul and grand ingratitude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to their remembrance, that they that were the Disciples of the late Wars and Usurpations, and gainers by the Ruin and Misery of this, and two other Kingdoms, by their Arts and Power of cheating and haring their fellow Subjects out of their Loyalty, Religion, Estates, Laws, and Liberties.</p>

            <p>When they who would make every body as much afraid as they themselves, do seem to fear an Inclination in His Majesty to an Arbitrary Power, which he never did, or is willing to exercise, can almost every day joyn with others in Complaints of the no few of the Subordinate Magistrates, usurping it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the mind and direction of the King and his Laws over their fellow Subjects, by their Irregular courses; Condemning, and many times Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Jury, Trial, legal Hearing, or Proceedings.</p>
            <p>And easily discern an yearly Custom of an illegally over-strained Power in the Lord <hi>Maiors</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> Electing and Drinking unto many or more than needs, in the Choice of two to be Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi> for the ensuing year; and imposing and taking great Fines of the Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, unto whom he needed not to have Drank, whereby to gain some Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Pounds yearly for the Fines of such as were unwilling or unfit to bear the Charge or Expence of those Offices, and Imprison and Constrain them to pay them; which are seldom less than 4 or 500 <hi>l.</hi> upon every such Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser. As if some fatal and successive Annual, or fit of Thirst, or kind Drinking, was at a certain Time of every year to fall upon the Lord Maiors of that City to Drink more often, and unto more than he should do. And they that shall happen to be so imposed upon, are sure to be out of hopes of getting themselves discharged of Imprisonment, for not paying the Fine by Writs of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> and Bail; which if the King should do every year in the Choice of Three presented unto him to serve as Sheriffs in all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Places of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> (no other City or Place therein making use of such a kind and loving Device to raise Moneys) the <hi>Habeas Corpora</hi> Bells would Ring in all the Courts of Justice in <hi>Westminster-Hall;</hi> and His Majesty would be troubled with the noise thereof.</p>

            <p>And we may often hear and observe in the <hi>Guilds, Fraternities,</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Trade, and their Mysteries in the City of <hi>London,</hi> an almost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded over absolute Power in their <hi>By-Laws,</hi> which should be perused (as it is more than a little probable they are not, or but very seldom or cursorily) by the Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> Lord <note place="margin">19 <hi>H.</hi> 7. ca. 7.</note> Treasurer, and the two Lord Chief Justices, and allowed by them or any three of them, to be according to the Law; together with their giving of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Oaths, imposing of Taxes, Quarteridges, or Fines and Assessements as they please upon the Poorer sort of the Companies of Trades, supernumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Livery Men in their Companies, in making them to be twice as many as they were wont to be, and inforcing them to Pay 20 or 25 <hi>l.</hi> a Man, and be at the Charge of a reverend Gown faced with Furrs of <hi>Foynes</hi> or <hi>Budge;</hi> and Imprison Men for not obeying them and their grinding superfluous Orders.</p>
            <p>The Exactions and Arbitrary Power of the Church-Officers in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and its overgrown Suburb Parishes, in the Renting of Pews and Seats in the Churches; making Strangers pay great and double Fees for Tolling the Passing Bell, and Ringing of a Peal, when there was no such Matters; taking great Fees for Burying of the Dead in the Church or Chancel; near an Husband, Wife, Father or Mother, Brother or Sister, where before they have lain there a quarter of a year, or a little time, they are sure to be taken up again, and flung into a Common Vault, to lodge amongst those that were Buried far cheaper, conniving at, or permitting the Parish Clerks, Sextons, or Grave-makers to sell the broken and sometimes pillaged Coffins of the Dead to be made fewel for fire or Bake-houses, cozening the Living and Dead, feasting and fatning themselves upon every small Consultation and Parish meeting, for the good as they call it, or little Business of the Parish; as for the putting out a Bastard or Foundling, or poor Parish Child to a Beggar to beg with, and trouble the Streets withal at a low weekly rate, and take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to themselves of reckoning by a greater, which have been the cause of such short Memories in Parish Politicks and Governments, as the Accompt of a Legacy of Three hundred Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> as they may be now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, in Houses and Tenements in a <hi>London</hi> Suburb Parish, for as many hundred years ago, for the Building of the Church yet standing upon its old Ruins, is so vanished as it is not at all to be found, and a royal Charity of One hundred and Twenty pounds given in the year 1625. by King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi> in a Time of Pestilence, could never be heard of, and the <hi>Church wardens</hi> or Collectors of a near <hi>London</hi> Parish have been so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watched for the good of the Parish, and thereby rendred so sleepy or <hi>Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> as they could not good People as they would be thought to be, tell which way One Thousand or Two Thousand pounds have escaped out of the Accompt, and the fault must be charged more upon the want of Honesty than Arithmetick. And may be found as greatly mistaken in their no seldom Parish Annual Legacies, Communion Charities, or otherwise; and in their Taxes or yearly Collections for the Poor, which in some out-Parishes near <hi>London,</hi> have amounted unto Two thousand pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and many times several Hundred pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> in lesser Parishes; and yet the Poor pester the Streets, and complain of their Parish-starving Weekly Allowances, when Houses of Forty pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> therein, are by a constant yearly Tax burdened with Sixteen shillings <hi>per Annum,</hi> to be quarterly paid towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

            <p>And do think that they have as great an Authority under colour of Publick good, not at all, or but little intended, to grind and do what they please, and with as much Extravagancy in many of their illegal orders and doings within the small compass of their little Dominions, as if all the rest of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish were only of the Tribe of <hi>Issachar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And every City, Borough, and Corporation in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> will not think themselves furnished with Arbitrary Power, sufficient by their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, unless by their <hi>By-Laws</hi> and subordinate Rules of Government, they can have some out leaps and incursions, and inforce their Inhabitants to an obedience of their many times unjustifiable Orders, Fines, and Assessements.</p>
            <p>The Companies of Trade in <hi>London,</hi> whose Charters and Incorporations were granted for the better ordering and governing of an honest and regular way of Trading, with a conscionable and reasonable gain; not to spoil and falsifie the Manufactures of the Kingdom, and enhaunce the Price thereof, are not to suffer Tricks to be plaid with it to deceive and abuse the People.</p>
            <p>The Drapers cannot produce a Charter, or an Allowance from God or Man, to cause their Cloth to be stretched or Tenter'd, to make 16 yards 20; and when a new created Trade called a Cloth-drawer shall have hid, and cunningly dearn'd up the holes or cracks in it by a device of Hot-pressing it so slick and smooth it, as it shall feel and look rather like Silk than Cloth, sell it for 20, 25 or 30 s. <hi>per</hi> yard; which if it were not so misused and made to be almost old before the Taylor can have shapt it into a Shute of Apparel, would be worth but 16 or 18 s. <hi>per</hi> yard.</p>
            <p>And it is more than an Arbitrary lawless Power for a Goldsmith to melt down as much heavy Money as he can come at into silver Plate; and sell To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco and Powder-Boxes, Staff handles, Pomels of Swords, Cup-handles, and most of the smaller pieces of Plate in the Kingdom, of drossy Silver, not half the value of Sterling, and prove them to be toucht or markt for Sterling, when it will not be worth half the Money they do sell it for; fill Rings by an Imperceptible hole with powder of Copper, and make the Buyer pay for pure Gold, when it is for a great part no such matter. Insomuch as a great

part of the Plate of the Nation is now so much abased, as it is not half the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it should be.</p>
            <p>It is a more than Arbitrary and illegal Power in the Vintners, who besides the great Adulteration of the Wines beyond the Seas before they come hither, will have the assistance of the Wine-Coopers to unwholsom them with Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick in the Sack, and many other unhealthful mixtures in their other Wines, and by that, and the Vintner and his Drawer's Deputy-Conjurations, can to please the humour of the Customers, fit him out of half a dozen small Vessels or Bottles, and laugh as they say in their sleeves, (and perhaps the Drawer may get a Sixpence into the Bargain) for drawing it so specially to think how neatly they are cozened; howsoever the rate must be what they shall set, tho' the King and his Privy Council do often put a price upon their Wines; yet if the more honest Drinkers will not pay the Vintner's own exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Rate, for that which is good they must take the bad enough to poison a Dog. And if some fall Sick upon it, as many have lately done and dye, by no great quantity moderately drank of it, that shall never disturb the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the Vintner, who thinks it for the Publick good, that he in a short time hath from a poor Tavern-Boy made himself worth 20000 <hi>l.</hi> or 30000 <hi>l.</hi> and his Wife the Mistress of a Pearl Neck-lace (not Counterfeit, as his Wines were) of a great value.</p>
            <p>And makes no doubt but although he Repent and come into the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of the Almighty at a late, or but the eleventh hour, he shall not go without his Peny, and if he purchase an Hospital, or some other charitable Uses, and leave it in trust with as honest an one as himself, it will do the business.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Brewers</hi> cannot believe their Trade can subsist without the aid of an unjustifiable Arbitrary Power, who though they be allowed by the King, and excused for the Excise of three Barrels of Beer in every score, and steals as much as they can notwithstanding of the duty of the Excise from the King and his Officers; and the Housekeeper pays the Excise for all that he takes of him. Yet from his Beer (though Mault, Coal, and Hops be never so cheap) or Ale, the best must be taken off, and the remainder being only water half boiled flung upon the strengthless grains is sent and served to the House-keeper for 6 <hi>s.</hi> Beer with the Excise laid upon it, and made to be a Drink not fit to give Beasts, quickly stinking and souring, and by the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>London</hi> Physitians is a great, if not an only cause of the <hi>Epidemick</hi> and now more than formerly Infection or Disease called the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> not so much as heretofore taken notice of in the Bills of Mortality, and that Beer though always over-hopped and imbittered, to supply the want of Mault, the People are constrained to be content with; and if they will have it better, are to pay Eight shillings a Barrel besides the Excise, for that which should be but Six.</p>
            <p>All which, or a great part of it, might by the Justice and Laws of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be redressed, if the Vintners, who by a late Trick of glass Bottles, now used in most Taverns, bespoken and made to be but or not so much as a Pint and an half, instead of a Quart; and their elder Brethren the Brewers were but put in mind as they ought to be of the Statute entituled <hi>Assisa panis &amp; Cervisiae,</hi> made in the 51 year of the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third. And another Statute made by that King in the same year called the Statute of the <hi>Pillory</hi> and <hi>Tumbrell,</hi> both yet in force and unrepealed, whereby the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Vintners, Brewers, and Bakers, are to be presented and amerced; and for every default, the Baker is to be adjudged to the <hi>Pillory;</hi> and the Brewer and Vintner to the <hi>Tumbrell,</hi> which was as it were in a <hi>Ducking-Stool</hi> (now sometimes used over cleaner waters, and applied to notorious Scolding and

unquiet Women) hanging over some muddy and unwholesome water, being the Punishment of the <hi>Fossa</hi> or stinking Pits, appropriate by the Grants of divers of our Kings to the Lords or Owners of great Mannors or Liberties, having <hi>Assisas panis &amp; Cervisiae.</hi>

            <p>Which ill doings of the Brewers in their unconscionable and unchristian-like Arbitrary Power, exercised as far as it can be stretched upon their fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, are imitated by the Alehouse keepers, the Inferior and Retailing Masters of the <hi>Tap;</hi> who would never have it be said or proved, that they come short of their <hi>Founders</hi> great Abilities in the Arts or Knaveries of the <hi>Drink</hi> Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or any of their Subtilties or Exactions.

            <p>The Woodmongers or Colliers can leap over all our Laws as they list; and by Confederacy keep back the Collier <hi>New Castle</hi> Fleet, and make them tarry in the lower part of the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and send up to <hi>London</hi> some stragling Cole-Ships to scarce and enhaunce the price of Coles; insomuch, as until His Majesty after many Complaints, and a tired Patience, had taken away their Charter, they would at every extraordinary Frost or winterly weather, never fail to raise the rates of Sea Coles in the space of a few Days, or less than a Week, unto 5, 10, or 20 <hi>s.</hi> at a time, and sometimes as high as 3 or 4 <hi>l.</hi> a Chaldron, to the great Affliction and Impoverishment of the poorer sort of People; when they might as they have done since the taking away of their Charter, have afforded a Chaldron of Coles with gain enough under 20 <hi>s.</hi> a Chaldron.</p>
            <p>Neither need we to have any Jury or Inquest impannelled in the search of an Arbitrary Power, daily made use of in the City of <hi>London</hi> and Suburbs thereof by the People over one another, the mighty over the weak, and the rich over the poor. And the Usurer and man of Money, when he takes as much above the legal Interest, for the loan of his Money, as the necessities of the distressed Borrowers can perswade him unto, and upon the Severity of an Execution, or a forfeited Mortgage of Lands double or treble in value to the Money lent, looks as <hi>Nebuchadonozer,</hi> overlook'd his <hi>Babylon,</hi> walks about like a <hi>Mogul,</hi> or some unlimited Monarch of the <hi>East,</hi> and as pittiless to the Supplication of the lamenting supplicant Borrower, and the tears of his Wife and Children, as the Hunger-bitten Woolf is with the Lamb under his bloody Paws and Fangs; In company of whom do march, the insinuating Imp of the Devil called the <hi>Tallyman,</hi> with his closer and more Consumptive secretly biting Usury, lending Eighteen Shillings to Market-Men and Women <hi>Heglers,</hi> &amp;c. Such as cry necessary Food in the Streets, instead of 20 <hi>s.</hi> upon the <hi>Tally</hi> and their own Security, at the interest and rate of 12 <hi>d.</hi> duely paid every Week, although continued at that pace a year together, being a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning piece of Usury, far exceeding that of the <hi>Jews;</hi> who in the Reign of our


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62455:15"/>
King <hi>Richard</hi> the First, were by the Common People Massacred, and the <hi>Caursini</hi> the Pope's Brokers banish'd by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, for much gentler Usuries followed by that of the lesser <hi>Pinching</hi> Money-<hi>Improvers,</hi> who will lend 10 <hi>l.</hi> for no longer than a Month, and at that or every Months end, call fiercely to have it paid in, to beget the former or a greater Brocage.</p>
            <p>When all the Trades of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> and their largely overbuilt Suburbs, can by an unreasonable and Arbitrary Power to maintain their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting Pride and Luxury, impose and put what price they please upon their Work and Commodities, and not a few do upon every occasion or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their interest and advantage break and run over our <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and other the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom. And when they trust their Customers, without which there would be little or no Trade, do when such Buyers dream nothing of it, clap an hard interest into the price; and if need be, in writing over their Books again, make where it may be undiscernable an addition unto it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mercers</hi> can order their Silks and Stuffs to be made slight and little lasting, and half yard broad, when it should be a greater measure; and every Month of <hi>May</hi> or Summer Season put a Nick-name, or some <hi>Cabali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siical</hi> or <hi>Utopian</hi> devised word upon it to make the Buyers give the more; and be fond of it.</p>
            <p>And since our times of Mad-mens contriving Reformations, and opening the passage to all manner of Tricks of Trade and Deceits; there is in every Week a meeting of most of the bigger sort of Retailing Trades in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> where they do agree their Prices for some good part of time afterwards, and bind one another in Bonds not to sell under; and in the mean time take more than ordinary Care to give the Manufacture-men but half the Wages which they gave them Weekly before, whereby to ingage them to make it slight and leave the more room or liberty for the Seller to lye and swear the Commodity to an higher price. Which makes the <hi>Stationers</hi> sell not only their Paper at an higher rate than formerly; but so ill made, as either it will not bear Ink, or must be as stiff, hard and uneasie to write upon, as if it were a board, and requires a Pen of Iron or Steel, rather than the usual Pens to write upon it; and the Parchments so ill dressed, as makes that which shall be written upon either that or Paper, to be so little permanent and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as all our Memorials so written, are not likely to last or endure legible 10 or 20 years after in the largest expectation. The <hi>London</hi> Mealman will not think himself in any way of hopes of gaining, or to be a Master of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, if he do not bespeak or calculate a Famine by an ill Weather, or some mischance like to happen to Corn and Grain for the ensuing year, and will therefore hasten to take advantage of it by raising it 2 <hi>d</hi> or 4 <hi>d</hi> in a Peck, and not keep any proportion betwixt the rise of the Market, and that which he takes of as many as he can perswade to give it; and having once raised his price, holds it as long as he can at the same pitch, though the Markets were long before fallen, and in the course of his Trade tricks, notwithstanding min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth Chalk, Bean and Rye Flower amongst that which he sels to his deluded Customers for pure Wheaten.</p>

Impowered and obliged to Assesse the price of Victuals, and the gain of Victuallers; and to Punish such as do not sell at reasonable prices, with respect had to what is sold in places adjoining; should not permit the <hi>Clerks</hi> of the Markets to suffer unwholsome Food

nor Butter made and mixed with Curds, which will taint or stink in two or three days to be sold there; nor a Trade to be set up of buying Barrels of Salt Butter, carrying it home and washing it, and mingling it with other Butter, bring it again the next Market-Day dished up, and sold for sweet But ter at double the price. And it would be well if the Lord Maior of <hi>London</hi> and his Brethren would take more Care than they do to purge that City of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power in the manage of Trade, when there is nothing to be bought either for Food or Raiment, but is adulterated, sophisticated, or cheated in the price or substance, not a liquid thing without undue mixtures, nor of any other nature without deceit in the quantity or quality thereof; so as not so much a Pins, Needles, and Thread can escape it; though there be a City <hi>Argus,</hi> or Man imployed in the keeping of the Knife at <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> to Cut all such ill-Tanned Leather as shall be brought thither to be sold; and is to make Shoes and Boots for most part of the adjacent Counties, as well as <hi>London:</hi> Matters are so handled betwixt the dim-sighted Knife, the Tanner and the Currier, that by the Tanner's not allowing a due proportion of Bark, or time of his Leather lying in the Tan-pit, the Leather of the Shoes and Boots is not half Tanned, and keeps out wet or water little better than brown Paper, which must not be a little prejudicial to the health of the <hi>English</hi> Nation; who use not to walk with <hi>Sandals</hi> on their Feet in Countries almost fryed or toasted with the Sun, but in moist and foggy Airs, where Rheums, Coughs, and Colds are and may be very obnoxious to their health.</p>
            <p>And when these and other Trades have in no better a manner gained great Estates, and enrich'd and perswaded themselves that their special Pleas; That it was their Trade. Secondly, That they must live. Thirdly, Their Master or Father did so before them. And Fourthly, That if they did not do it, others would do it; will protect and carry them thorough the dangers of the next life, will use so little Charity in this, as they can themselves by a <hi>lawless</hi> Power, in the way either of their Malice or Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, cause others to be Arrested and Imprisoned for some Months or Years to the ruin of the suffering party, by Illegally demised Fictitious Writs for many Thousand pounds, when there was not so many Thousand Shillings or Groats, and sometimes nothing at all due unto them. And against all Law and right Reason, make their Friends, if any will be so ventrous as to be Bail for them, to be Charged with all other Debts, to which they were not Bail; if the Creditors do in the same Term declare against them.</p>
            <p>And at the same time make heavy Complaints against the King, or any of his Servants or Officers of his Court, when they shall be but for some Days or Weeks restrained of their Liberty by the Command or Warrant of the King or his Council, for Contempts or Misdemeanors well deserving to be Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and in all their Discourses make Hue and Cry against Arbitrary Power, and a Design of introducing it by the King and his Council; when they might see and understand that there is no such matter.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Which if Right be done unto him, should not be gainsaid by his borrowing of the <hi>Banker</hi>'s Money, when they had sent it into his <hi>Exchequer</hi> at an high and unreasonable Interest, and making use of it to furnish out his Navy, in or against the approaching Spring, when the Ingrateful <hi>Dutch,</hi> having heaped their Abuses and Injuries upon him and the Nation, were as Confident as the <hi>Philistins</hi> were in the Case of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> when there was not a Spear or Sword in <hi>Israel;</hi> That he could have no means or Money by the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness and discords of some <hi>Opiniatrées</hi> and <hi>State-Reformers,</hi> to furnish out his Fleet to prevent their designs of persisting in their disgracing and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering over him; the Trade of the Nation abroad, and affronting and mastering of him at home.</p>
            <p>And in the doing thereof he was <hi>Necessitate Necessitatum,</hi> driven by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable and extreme Necessity, more than that which perswaded <hi>David</hi> to take the <hi>Shew bread</hi> from off the <hi>Altar</hi> to preserve the Publick in himself, and himself in the Publick; from a fatal and otherwise utter ruine, and loss of the Soveraignty of our <hi>Brittish</hi> Seas, and the Guard and Benefits thereof just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Claimed and Vindicated by his Royal Progenitors and Predecessors, and at no time before in so much danger of loosing.</p>
            <p>For his after-Actions and Cares of Repayment may Evidence that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended neither any wrong or Injustice to the <hi>Bankers,</hi> or the Owners of it; in that he not only made a Provision to pay them the Interest until he could be able to pay them the Principal; but did all he could, if his daily and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Occasions had not prevented him to pay the Principal, which he long ere this had accomplished, had not the War by the Haughtiness, Malice and Insolence of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> often and very much decryed by the <hi>Sweeds</hi> and

other Nations who were the Mediators for Peace at <hi>Cologne,</hi> emboldened by our home Divisions, and want of Supplies, lengthened it self beyond all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. And hath notwithstanding in the Interim by his Protections Royal, and many other Cares taken, done as much as he could to keep the <hi>Bankers</hi> from Arrests, Imprisonments, and other Ruines impendant often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening and falling upon Men indebted.</p>
            <p>Although if Reports and the Laments of some that were concerned be not much mistaken, a great part of that Money was belonging to many of his own Servants; who by his Bounty and Places of Profit under him, had easily gained it; and many of those who so heavily complained of that detention of their Moneys had for their own advantages, intrusted it to the <hi>Bankers,</hi> who by an Imaginary Credit far exceeding their own Estates, furnishing one man with another man's Money, and paying out that which was but the same day or a little before come in, had inticed a great part of the Money of the Nation into their hands. And some, if not many of the Owners, did well enough understand that they did not only furnish them and their Credits, upon all Emergent occasions of Profit or Accommodation, by that kind of alluring much of the Money of the Nation into their Custody; but his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty also at an high and intollerable Usury, which if a strict enquiry were made by His Majesty, or Order of Parliament of the particular Owners of the Money brought into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> by the <hi>Bankers,</hi> and from thence borrowed and made use of by his Majesty upon his Publick and most urgent Affairs, would plainly appear.</p>
            <p>And it will be as manifest, that he afterwards gave no respite to his Royal Cares and Intentions of Repaying it with the Legal or as much Interest as the <hi>Bankers</hi> were to pay for it. And finding that the <hi>Fee Farm</hi> Rents amounting unto <hi>Seventy thousand pounds</hi> per annum, sold at <hi>Sixteen</hi> years Purchase, which nothing but a grand Necessity could enforce him to Alien; for that many of them being the <hi>Tenths,</hi> were by two several Acts of Parliament an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> for the maintenance thereof, and were as so many Ties and Obligations, which made the Owners of these Lands to be dependant upon the Crown, would not reach to a Satisfaction of his other Debts and Expences; which having been longer due, were more importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate than those of the <hi>Bankers,</hi> did lately in a Speech to the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament, make it his earnest Request that they would take the Necessity and speedy Payment of the <hi>Bankers</hi> into their Considerations.</p>
            <p>And when nothing of help could be obtain'd for that purpose, did by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents under his great Seal, with great difficulty and hardship, order a part of his burdened Revenue to be assigned for the due and orderly pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Interest until the Principal Moneys should be justly satisfied and paid. So as his doings therein, or making use of that Money, if impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and judiciously weighed in the Ballance of Truth and Judgment is not to be called a seizure, or forcible taking of the <hi>Bankers</hi> Money, or to be ranked either as to the necessity, or the thing it self, or the number of the persons concerned with what King <hi>Edward</hi> the First, a Wise and Prudent Prince did do, when he in the 22 year of his Reign seized into his hands <note place="margin">

            <p>Concerning all which matters, fears, and jealousies, I can be confident your Sentiments and mine will so little disagree, as your Judgment of the Ages past, and observations of the rise and progress of our late Troubles and Miseries which brought the greatest Shame and Scandal to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion, profest in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that ever it had or could have laid upon it; and cast an unhappy Reflection upon those that were in the parts beyond the Seas; will not refuse me your Company in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Truth so experimented, that the fruit of all those Artifices, rather than any just cause of any such fears or apprehensions have yielded no better Effects than the Ruine and Confusion of the former Glory and Honour of our Nation, by setting up a Rebellious part of the People, the Offspring, as to some of their Levelling Principles, of <hi>Wat Tiler,</hi> and <hi>Jack Cade</hi> to undo and Rule over the better sort of the People, and the Poor to Plunder and rob the Rich.</p>
            <p>And that therefore they which have been the cause of so many Mischiefs and Evils which their and our <hi>Seri Nepotes</hi> will have reason enough bitterly to bewail, and without God's great Mercy will scarcely live to see eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, ought better to consult their Conscience; the Precepts and Examples of Wisdom, <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> Interest of the Kingdom, and Honour of the King and Nation, and abandoning their former Follies, and false Lights which led them and their partakers into so great Sins, and made them to be the Causes of so many National Miseries, not run themselves and others into the fear of one or two incertain Evils; but an Hundred which will be most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and can never be recalled.</p>
            <p>And I cannot but assure my self, that you will be ready to conclude with me, that there is no Rational or just Cause of Fear that we can have by any Infection contracted from the now Laws and manner of Government of <hi>France,</hi> under His most Christian Majesty. (For until their Civil and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine Wars and Ill Usage of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh their Kings, in their greatest Distresses, that Nation had Liberties more than at present they have, or are likely to enjoy.) And that our League with the <hi>French</hi> may as little Prejudice us and our Laws and Liberties as it did those of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> when they were in the strictest Alliance or Confederacy with them.</p>
            <p>For no man can be so transported out of himself, as to believe that a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood or a League for Civil and other Respects, can work any Prejudice to the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of the Subjects of either Prince or State, not granted away or Contracted for by such Leagues, when every days Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience declares the contrary; for otherwise the <hi>Poles,</hi> whose King is Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and their Laws so very much obliging him, as he cannot alter the Freedom and Constitutions of the Peoples Liberties would be in danger of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Extravagancies of Power to be brought in upon them, when their Kings have made any Leagues with the <hi>Turks</hi> or Grand Seignior, and

the <hi>Sweedish</hi> Nation in fear of their Elective King's introducing the vast and unruly Power of the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> whose Subjects being under a mighty awe, Ignorance and enforced Obedience; have no more to answer when any State-Affairs are enquired of them, than that <hi>God and the Great Duke do only know it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Insomuch as the Provocation of the <hi>Dutch</hi> being so great, and the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Honour of the King, Trade of the Nation, Safety of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Soveraignty of the Sea so necessary, as a War with them could not be avoided.</p>
            <p>There was no other either visible or possible means to manage it with Prudence or Success, than by the making of the League with <hi>France,</hi> who had pretences of his own to joyn with ours.

            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, although that he sometimes declared, That he held the Crown as won in Battel by Conquest of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, and at other times by his better Title from the House of <hi>York,</hi> and his Marriage with the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Daughter of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and avaritiously took all the ways possible for the enriching of his Treasury had divers great Aids and Subsidies granted unto him by Parliament.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, notwithstanding that he had after many great Subsidies and Aids, both as to the Money and manner of Collecting it; granted unto him his Heirs and Successors by several Parliaments; and the first Fruits and Tenths of all Ecclesiastical Promotions and Benefices, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the then established Religion of the Kingdom, seized and took into his Possession the great yearly Revenue of 600 Abbies, Priories, and Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, most of the Hospitals and Colleges which had been given to Religious Uses with Anathema's; with as many other dreadful Curses and Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as the Minds of Men could imagine to fall upon the Violaters thereof,

            <p>But the Lords and Commons in Parliament did in the 35<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Reign assent to an Act of Parliament for the remitting unto him all such Sums of Money as he had borrowed of them or any other, by way of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press or Loan by his Privy Seals, sithence the First day of <hi>January</hi> in the 33<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Reign, and <hi>if he had paid to any Person any some of Money which he had borrowed by Sale of Land or otherwise, the same Person, his Heirs, Executors, or Administrators, should repay it again to the King; and if any Person had sold his Privy Seal to another, the Seller should repay the Money to the Buyer thereof.</hi> And for a further Supply, did in the last year of his Reign grant unto him one Subsidy with two Fifteenths and Tenths by the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, and one Subsidy by the Clergy.</p>

            <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> being a profess'd Catholick, renversed the Protestant Religion, put many to Death, Banished and Persecuted all the Eminent Professors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Married <hi>Philip</hi> the Second King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and thereby endangering if she had any Issue by him, to have brought <hi>England</hi> under the Laws and Yoke of his <hi>Spanish</hi> Dominions, with the Bloody and Cruel <hi>Inquisition</hi> to boot; began to restore the Lands of the Abbies and Monasteries, and intended to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish all her right therein; Lost <hi>Calice,</hi> which had been in the <hi>English</hi> Possession ever since the Conquering of it from the <hi>French</hi> by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, though for his Cruelties and ill obtaining of the Crown, he merited not the Title of a King after his stabbing King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, whereof he died in the Life-time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and after his Death procuring himself to be made <hi>Protector</hi> of the Kingdom during the Minority of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth, his Nephew; whose Guards when he had made to be dismissed, and enticed him and his Brother into the Tower of <hi>London</hi> upon a <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi>'s Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle.</note> counterfeit pretence of Safety and Honour, he procur'd to be Murthered.

she made her Subjects as happy as her self in the Councils, Love, Duty, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance of her Parliament and assistance of her People for their own as well as her Preservation and Good; who although they were by her limitted not <note place="margin">Journals of the four last Parliaments of Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> Collected by <hi>Heywood Townsend,</hi> a Member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> to meddle with Church or State Government, forbid and sharply reproved for medling with the Successors, had some of their several Members, as Mr. <hi>Peter Wentworth</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Bromley</hi> Prohibited to sit in the House of Commons, and afterwards Committed Prisoners to the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> sent for Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> their Speaker, and charged him to deliver her Message to the House; which he did not omit to do: That <hi>It was in her Power, to Call, Prorogue, Adjourn, Dissolve or Determine Parliaments, and to Assent</hi> or <hi>Dissent:</hi> And in one of the said Parliaments refused her consent to 48 Bills which had passed in both Houses; informed the House of Commons, That she misliked <hi>their Irreverence towards her Privy Councellors, Members of that House who were not to be accompted as Common Knights and Burgesses that are Councellors, but during the Parliament; whereas the others were standing Councellors, and for their Wisdom and great Service were call'd to the Council of State;</hi> Blamed some <hi>that seem'd to make their Necessities more than they were, forgetting the urgent Necessities of the Time and Dangers;</hi> would not have <hi>her People feared with Reports;</hi> and speaking to them that she heard that upon the last Attempt of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> some had abandoned their Towns, fled higher into the Countrey, and left all Naked; said, <hi>I swear unto you By God, if I knew those Persons, or any that shall do so hereafter, I will make them know and feel what it is to be so fearful in so urgent a Cause.</hi> And when the Commons had Petition'd unto her against some grievances of her <hi>Purveyances,</hi> and Court of <hi>Exchequer;</hi> answer'd, That <hi>she had given some Order to the Lord Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> for the redress of the <hi>Purveyances;</hi> That <hi>she had as much Skill and Power to rule and govern her own House, as any of her Subjects whatsoever to rule and govern theirs, without the help of their Neighbours; and would shortly take further order therein, by the advice of her Judges and Learned Council.</hi> Commanded the <hi>Speaker</hi> of the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> That if any Bills should be there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited <hi>touching the Succession, Matters of State, or Causes Ecclesiastical, he should not receive them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which several Speeches, Directions, and Messages of her Majesty, with many others in all the time of her Parliaments, and long and happy Reign, were well esteemed of; whose Birth-Day for now almost Fourscore years last past in <hi>London,</hi> and many other Places of <hi>England,</hi> hath upon every 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>November,</hi> by Legacies of Annual Commemorative Sermons and Ringing of Bells, been Celebrated, and was so happy in the Duty Allegiance and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of her Parliaments.</p>
            <p>As a Prudent very Eminent &amp; Learned Member of the House of Commons said, That before he would speak or give any consent to a Case that should debase her Soveraignty or Abridge it, <hi>I would wish my Tongue cut out of my Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 43. of her Reign, A Bill being brought into the House of Commons for Explanation of the Common Law, concerning the Queens Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and certain Monopolies; Mr. <hi>Spicer</hi> a Burgess of <hi>Warwick</hi> said, That <hi>that Bill might touch the Prerogative Royal, which was as he had Learned, so transcendent as the eye of the Subject may not aspire thereunto;</hi> and <hi>therefore be it far from him that the State and Prerogative of the Prince should be Tyedly him, or any other Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> after Lord Chancellor said, That <hi>for the Prerogative Royal of the Prince, for his part he ever allowed it, and is such as he hoped should never be discussed.</hi> And said Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> pointing to the Bill, <hi>This is no stranger in this place, but a stranger in this Vestment. The Use hath been ever by Petition to humble our selves to her Majesty, and by Petition to desire


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62455:23"/>
to have the Grievances redressed, especially when the remedy touchethiher in Right or Prerogative. I say, and I say again, That we ought not to deal or meddle with, or judge of her Majesties Prerogative, I wish every man therefore to be careful of this point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lawrence Hyde</hi> said, <hi>I do owe a Duty to God, and Loyalty to my Prince; I made it, and I think I understand it; far be it from this heart of mine to write any thing in Prejudice or Derogation of her Majesties Prerogative Royal, and the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Serjeant Harris</hi> moved, <hi>That the Queen might be Petitioned by the House in all Humility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Francis Moore,</hi> afterwards <hi>Serjeant Francis Moore</hi> said, <hi>He did know the Queens Prerogative was a thing curious to be dealt with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Wroth</hi> a Member of that House did in his own particular offer 100 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to the Wars.</p>
            <p>Upon a Debate of Monopolies, the Queen understanding that a List of such as she had granted had been brought into the House; sent for their <hi>Speaker,</hi> and declared unto him, That <hi>for any Patents granted by her whereby any of her Subjects might be oppressed, she would take present order for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation thereof; her Kingly Prerogative was tender, and therefore desired them not to speak or doubt of her Reformation; but that some should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, others suspended, and none put in Execution, but such as by a Trial at Law should appear to be for the good of the People;</hi> which being reported by him to the House, filled them with unspeakable Joy.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wingfield</hi> wept, and said, <hi>His heart was not able to conceive, or his tongue express the Jov that he had in that Message.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thereupon Mr. <hi>Secretary Cevill</hi> said, That <hi>there was no reason that all should be revoked; for the Queen meant not to be swept out of her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And gave them a Caution for the future, <hi>to believe that whatsoever is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a publick Exposition, cannot be good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Parliaments in her long and glorious Reign, were so unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give any disturbance to her Great and Renowned Actions for the defence and good of her Self and her People, and all the Protestant Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Christendom;</p>
            <p>As in the First year of her Reign, a Parliament granted her Two shillings eight pence in the Pound of Goods; and Four shillings of Lands, to be paid in several Payments.</p>
            <p>In her Sixth year, one Subsidy was granted by the Clergy, and another by the Laiety together with two Fifteenths and Tenths; in the Thirteenth year of her Reign towards the Charges of Suppressing the Northern Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, a Subsidy of Six shillings in the pound, by the Clergy, and by the Temporalty two Fifteens, and a Subsidy of Two shillings and eight pence in the Pound; in her Six and twentieth year, had granted her by the Clergy two whole Subsidies, and by the Laiety three, besides Six Fifteenths and Tenths; with a Proviso, that that great Contribution should not be drawn into Example; in her Fortieth year, had granted by the Clergy three en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Subsidies, and as many by the Laiety, with Six Fifteens and Tenths; and in the 42<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of her Reign, to furnish Money for the <hi>Irish</hi> Wars, had Commissions granted to confirm the Crown Lands of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> defective Titles.</p>
            <p>And all little enough, when in the same year Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the House of Commons declared unto them, That <hi>the Moneys lent unto <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap> yet unpaid, her Jewels and much of her Lands sold, and she had spared Money out of her own Purse and her Apparel, for her Peoples sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:62455:23"/>
And yet when in the Eighth year of her Reign the Parliament had offered unto her four Subsidies, <hi>upon Condition that she would declare her Successor;</hi> she magnanimously refused it, and remitted the fourth Subsidy, saying, <hi>It was all one whether the Money was in her own, or in her Subjects Coffers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our King <hi>James</hi> being born and bred in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where their Laws are mingled with some Neighbour <hi>English</hi> Customs, drawn out of our <hi>Glanvil,</hi> brought thither by their King <hi>James</hi> the First, who lived some time here in <hi>England,</hi> and afterwards so much Compounded and over-born by the Civil Law: brought out of <hi>France</hi> long after by King <hi>James</hi> the Fifth, which with some part of their Common Law, makes them to be so overmuch Civil and Canon, and a Miscellany of them as they are very much different from ours, had so great an affection to the Civil Laws; and those of his own Countrey, before he had understood the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ours; that shortly after his coming to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> he earnestly recommended to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> not only an Union of both the Kingdoms, and the Subjects thereof; but of their Laws also: And so much savoured the Civil Laws, as he complained in a Speech to the Parliament of the Contempt of them, allowed or was much taken with the Comedy of <hi>Ignoramus</hi> and <hi>Dulman;</hi> which was purposely framed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Professors of our Common Laws to a Derision of the People, and render them guilty of an Ignorance of good Letters and Learning (which all of them, witness our great <hi>Selden,</hi> and some other of his Coaevals, could not justly be charged with) and suffered it to be Acted before him at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> with great Applause, and to be afterwards Printed and Published without any murmur or jealousie of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, (that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to introduce an Arbitrary Power) who manifested no unwillingness to give him Subsidies and Aids in Foreign as well as Domestick Affairs, when he had occasion to require them.</p>
            <p>All which the Cares and doings of our Ancestors for the Publick and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good joined with their Duty and Allegiance to their Soveraign Kings and Princes, may afford us convincing Reasons and Arguments, out of concluding Premisses that the Weal and Woe of Kings and their People, are like those of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Twins, partaking each with other, and that the Fear of God, Honour of the King, Self-Preservation, and Oaths and Duty of Allegiance; will be more than enough to enjoyn every good Christian and Subject, where the welfare of the King and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick are concerned to be as willing to help the King as he would himself.</p>
            <p>And it cannot be deemed to be either unadvisedly or ill done by our <hi>English</hi> Fore-fathers or Predecessors in the House of Commons in Parliament, in the Seventh year of the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second; when being required of the King to give their Advice concerning a Peace to be made with the King of <hi>France,</hi> And the Chancellor then said, That <hi>the King of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rot' Parl. 7 R. 2. m. 5. &amp; 19.</note> 
               <hi>himself could well do it; yet for good will he would not, without their Knowledge or Consent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it could not be Concluded without a Personal Interview of the King of <hi>France,</hi> which for his Honour required great Charges, whereof he Charged them of their Allegiance, to consult and give him Answer; unto which they answering, That <hi>it becomed not them to Intermeddle their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>referred the whole Order thereof unto the King and his Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And being urged again to answer whether they desired Peace or War? for one of them they must choose; They answered, <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62455:24"/>
But when they understood that the King of <hi>France</hi> desired that the King should hold <hi>Guyen</hi> of him by Homage and Service; they knew not what to say, only they hoped that the King meant not to hold of the <hi>French Calice,</hi> and other Territories gotten of them by the Sword; whereunto when the King replied, That <hi>otherwise Peace could not be granted;</hi> and therefore <hi>willed them to Choose; They in the end rather desired Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Peace not ensuing or being to be had, and the King by his Chancellor the next year after in Parliament, informing them how that the King was Invironed with the <hi>French, Spanish, Flemmings,</hi> and the <hi>Scots who were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate, and had made great Preparations to destroy him and his People, which</hi>

            <p>And will it not now be high time to believe what the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament declared in their Petition to King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> for our Religion, Laws, and Liberties in the fourth year of his Reign, That <hi>Jealousies and Distractions are apparent signs of God's displeasure, and of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Mischiefs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the Distempers and Fermentation thereof more and more increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, may recall to our remembrance,</p>
            <p>How little those Fears and Jealousies did profit Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> or his Adoring the <hi>Soveraignity,</hi> as he once called it, of Parliament; when he was afterwards pull'd out of the House of Commons, made a Prisoner, and driven to an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Detestation of their <hi>Arbitrary Power?</hi>

            <p>Or of how little avail they were to the restless spirit of Levelling <hi>John Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> when he was after as much out of love with the <hi>Republicans</hi> or <hi>Cromwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> as he was once with them; and wrote his Book, entituled (if my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory fail me not) <hi>Of the Oppressed Men in Chains:</hi> And after his Cashiering out of the Army, Imprisonment, Bafflings, and Trials at Law, lugged and carried about with him Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s Comment upon <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and other <hi>English</hi> Law-Books to no purpose.</p>
            <p>The Fears and Jealousies which had gotten Possession in the head of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Andrews,</hi> Lord Maior of <hi>London</hi> in those wickedly pernitious Times could not rescue him from the Title of <hi>Anti-Christ</hi> bestowed upon him by some of his own Party.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> before he took upon him the Title of <hi>Protector</hi> of his herd of Villains, Regicides, Murtherers and Felons, was fairly threatned or attempted to be Indicted for High Treason by Cornet <hi>Day,</hi> against the foolish Fancies of their <hi>Wat Tiler, Jack Cade, John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> or <hi>Massianello</hi> rowling, confounding, and never-resting Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Or how much did those Fears and Jealousies benefit the City of <hi>London,</hi> or advance their Trade or Riches; when in the late Rebellion they forfeited all their Charters, and the Liberties which they had in more than 600 years last past obtained of their Indulgent Soveraigns; Perjured themselves, ruined much of their Estates by being (some Good and Loyal Citizens excepted, who could not be without great Sufferings) Instrumental in the Ruine of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nobility and Gentry, their Debtors and Customers betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Plunders and Sequestrations of honester Men than themselves, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with others the Palaces and Lands of the King, Queen, Prince, Bishops, Nobility, and Delinquents, as they stiled them; for fighting against His late Majesty, when they fought for him.</p>
            <p>Bought at cheap Rates his Pictures, and sold the Ornaments of his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, Plate, Copes, and Vestments, not sparing the Coats of his Guard of Halberdiers, pull'd down his Statue at the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> with the basest and vilest Declaration put in the place of it, <hi>Exit Tyrannus Regum ultimus;</hi> took away or spoiled the Statues of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and all the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings of the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy; which the love which they ought to bear to Monarchy, might e're this time have perswaded them to have supplied.

And in the interim whilst they were so distracted with their Fears, as all the Care they took was to lugg and carry away their Goods into the Fields or Churches; in the latter whereof the one helped to burn the other, and leave their own or their Landlord's Houses to the mercy of the Fire; which doing what it pleased, and raging so impetuously, made the whole City and its Lines of Communication, and the Circum ambient Air to be like an Oven over-heated, as the numberless Sign Posts with their Signs fell on fire, and leapt in sheets as it were from one Street to another, where it never had stopped until it had destroyed and Burnt all <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> with at least 60000 Houses therein, if His Majesty, and his Servants and Nobility indefatigably Night and Day labouring amongst the remaining sad-hearted People that tarried, had not upon the <hi>Wednesday</hi> Night, or <hi>Thursday</hi> Morning next following, put the Fire (by blowing up some Houses) to a stand; and taught and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the then witless over-affrighted Citizens to subdue that mighty Arbitrary Element.</p>

            <p>Unto which our Disasters both in Church and State have been great Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>Kindle Coles;</hi> which have made not only many that have some Learning, and are <hi>ex meliori luto,</hi> better born and bred; but the Mechanick and Illiterate part of the People, to take themselves to be a kind of <hi>State-Menders,</hi> and to make their small Capacities the rule and measure of their foolish Prognosticks, and are as like to hit the <hi>white</hi> or <hi>mark,</hi> as he that stands without the Doors of an House a mile off it; and undertakes of himself without the help or Information of the Inhabitants to know what is every day and night, hour or minute thereof done within the House; or as some <hi>Mountebank</hi> Physitian, who without the Aid or Sight of the Patient, or any Inquiry into the Symptoms.

            <p>Whilst they ought rather to be so careful of themselves and their Posterities, as to abominate those foolish ways of censuring Authority; and to take heed that God do not Punish us for our unthankfulness, and abusing his so many and all sorts of Mercies under a Prince.</p>

Who besides all his other Royal Cares and Concessions, added unto those of his famous great Ancestors and Predecessors, Kings and Queens of this Realm, for the Preservation of his Peoples Liberties and Properties; did no longer ago than in the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Reign, for the better securing of the Liberties of his Subjects in their Persons, and prevention of Imprisonments, by sending them in Custody to some of the Islands; consented unto an Act of Parliament under great Severities, Forfeitures and Penalties to be inflicted upon such as should Imprison or Detain any Man after an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> brought, as well in the Vacations as Terms.</p>
            <p>And so far extended it, as upon the Committing of any Man Prisoner by himself or the Lords of his Privy Council, Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> or other great Officers of his Houshold, they are allowed to be Bailed by the King's Justices of his Superiour Courts of Justice; although when they themselves shall, as they do often, Commit or Imprison any man by their Delegated and Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power from the King, only they are not at all obliged to discharge any such Offenders upon Writs of <hi>Habeas Corpus.</hi>

            <p>And by that and those multitudes of former Provisions which our Kings and their Laws have made for the good and safety of their People from all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions of Arbitrary Power, should not forget that there is not so much as an Imaginary fear or danger that any Subject of <hi>England</hi> can be injured by any Arbitrary Power or otherwise; for which a present and sudden Remedy may not be quickly had or provided; and that it is now a received Maxim in our Common Law, That <hi>the King can do no wrong,</hi> and that, <hi>id potest quod de Jure potest.</hi> So that there are very few, unless such as would have the King to be as liable (which our Laws did always forbid) to Coertions, Arrests, or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, as the most ordinary or meanest of his Subjects are or ought to be, or can be so ignorant in the course or Proceedings of our Laws; but may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, That if he should cause any to beat or do any Injury or Trespass to any of his Subjects, the Parties or Agents are by his and our own Laws to be responsible for it.</p>
