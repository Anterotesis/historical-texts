            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough by Our manie Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and Declarations, some whereof are printed, and others were made by word of mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Our high Commissioner the Lord Marquesse of Hamiltoun, during the time of his late imployment in Scotland; it doth fully appear to all men, whose mindes are not dista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with Justice and Government, what Our religious care, Princely clemencie, and unparalleled patience have been for the setling of the late troubles in that Our ancient and native Kingdome of Scotland, and for the composing of that State, so much of late discomposed and disjointed by the sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practices of divers impatient of all lawes and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Yet for the further and full satisfaction of all our true
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17348:3"/>
hearted and loyall subjects in all Our Kingdomes, and for the manifestation of Our Justice and Pietie in Our late pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to all abroad, especially to those who with Us ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Religion Reformed: We have thought good by way of an Historicall Deduction to set downe the true pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of all this businesse, that the world may, as it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one view and aspect, behold Our gracious and clement comportment towards Our subjects of that Kingdome, and the depraved and froward deportment of many of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Us their liege Lord and Soveraigne: Not doubting, but that whosoever shall goe along by the threed of this Our unquestionable Narration, will rest fully satisfied in these three points.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> First, That the first contrivers, and since pursuers of their late wicked Covenant, or pretended holy League (a name which all good men did abhorre in them of France) though following the patterne of all other seditions, they did and doe pretend Religion, yet nothing was or is lesse intended by them; but that they having received from Us full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all their desires, expressed in any of their Petitions, Remonstrances, or Declarations, yet their persisting in their tumultuous and rebellious courses, doth demonstrate to the world their wearinesse of being governed by Us and Our Lawes, by Our Councell and other officers put in authoritie by and under Us, and an itching humour of having that Our Kingdome governed by a Table of their owne devising, consisting of persons of their own chusing: A plot of which they are very fond, being an abortion of their owne braine, but which indeed is such a monstrous birth, as the like hath not yet beene born or bred in any Kingdome Jewish, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, or Pagan.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, That Our promises expressed in Our severall Proclamations and Declarations to Our people, were not (as the wicked contrivers of that Covenant have ever gone about to make Our subjects beleeve) onely verball, but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and reall, and such as Wee doe professe to the whole world in the word of a just and true Prince, We doe resolve
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17348:3"/>
to make good to all Our subjects of that Our Kingdome: As holding it beneath the greatnesse and goodnesse of a just King, that the unjust actions of his subjects should occasion in their Soveraigne the least suspicion of breach of promises made by him to them, especially when the performance of them shall conduce to the settling of Religion and Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, That these men who give themselves out to be the onely Reformers of Religion, have taken such a course to undermine and blow up the Religion Reformed, by the scandall of Rebellion and Disobedience, which, so farre as in them lyeth, they have gone about to cast upon it, that if the Conclave of Rome, the severall Colleges or Congregations perpetually sitting at Rome for contriving and effecting the meanes of reducing to the Roman obedience all those King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Provinces which have justly departed from them, nay, and if with both these all the Jesuites and others the most specially combined and sworn enemies to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, were all assembled in one place, and had all their wits and devices concentrated into one conclusion and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; they could hardly have fallen upon such a way, as these pretended Reformers have fallen upon, for turning all men out of the pathes of the Reformed Religion, or have set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon such courses, which can bespeake no other event, but the undoubted overthrow of it, at least in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, unlesse God himselfe from heaven (which We hope) shall have all their Cobweb contextures in derision: For by their particular proceedings, truely set downe in this Our Narration, it will plainely appeare, that their Maximes are the same with the Jesuites, their Preachers Sermons have been delivered in the very phrase and stile of <hi>Becanus, Scippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and <hi>Eudaemon Johannes,</hi> their poore Arguments, which they have delivered in their seditious Pamphlets printed or written, are taken almost <hi>verbatim</hi> out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> as appeareth to Us by Our Royall Father his Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie Preface to all Christian Kings and Princes, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie for the Oath of Allegeance, and in the Bookes writ by others in defence of them both; in all which these arguments
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17348:4"/>
are fully answered: And that the meanes which they have used to induce a credit of their conclusions with their Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, are purely and meerly Jesuiticall fables, false reports, false prophesies, pretended inspirations and divinations of the weaker sexe; as if now <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine reconciled for the ruine of Christ, and his true Religion and Worship.</p>
            <p>Now, if these three particulars by this historicall Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall undoubtedly appeare to the unprejudicate Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whether Our Subjects or Forreiners, then We shall lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doubt to gaine from them their assent to these Our two just desires.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, That these proceedings of some of Our subjects (whom, though they would be accounted the purest Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, yet by their wicked Protestations, you will finde to be the most froward and perverse Protesters that ever did contest with their Soveraigne and his Lawes) may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an undeserved scandall upon that Religion which We professe: For since their conclusions are quite contrary to the Confessions of the severall reformed Churches, in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Articles both of the Church and of the civill Magistrate, as appeareth by the Helvetian, French, Belgick, Polonian, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentine, Palatine, Genevian, Our English and Irish, nay, and their owne Scotish positive Confession, printed amongst the Acts of Parliament of that Our Kingdome; and besides, the Augustane and all other particular Protestant Confessions of the Lutherans: And all the weapons wherewith they now fight against these Protestant conclusions, are stollen or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, not onely out of the Romane (for many of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists fight with Us against them) but out of the most rigid Jesuites Magazins, why should they not in this quarrell be accounted not as Our friends, but as Our foes; not Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, but the most rigid of Papists, Jesuites? and so being without in this point, not bring any scandal upon Us who are within; especially considering that though these men have gone about to wound the Reformed Religion through Our sides, and by opposing Us whom God hath honoured with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17348:4"/>
this speciall favour (for no lesse We accompt it) of being the chief Prince whom he hath made choice of for the Protector and Defender of it: Though, We say, these men have done what they can to weaken this our Religion, by striking at the authoritie of the principall prop and stay of it upon earth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God; yet We, by the grace of God, are fully resolved to wipe away that aspersion, and remove that scandall from Our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and Religion, by Our constant not onely adherence to it, but maintenance and defence of it, with the uttermost of that power which God hath put in Our hands, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all those scandals which these men by their wicked practices and worse positions have laid upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, We hope that all men will do Us so much right, as to beleeve, that whatsoever course We shall hereafter take for the Asserting of the Reformed Religion, and repressing the insolencies of such of Our subjects as doe oppose it and Us in the just and undoubted right of Our Regalitie, while they pretend Religion, shall not be thought to be by way of a warre, but by way of a Prince the Father of his Country his chastising his unruly children, which is never in anger, but in love, and for their good. And if by their stubbornnesse they shall force Us to a severitie unpleasing to Us, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome to them, We call Him by whom We reigne to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and heaven and earth and all the world to record, that they with their owne hands doe unsheath Our just sword, which Wee cannot but use as the Minister of God, unlesse We will betray that trust which the King of Kings hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in Us for the maintenance of Religion and Justice amongst all His people whom He hath committed to Our charge: And if God will have it so, that for their resisting Him and Us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His Anointed servant and their Soveraigne, He will have some of their bad bloud shed, We shall ever make accompt that that bloud is let out of Our owne veines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor shall We draw any drop of it in any other case, then a faithfull Physician will and must doe for the preservation of the whole body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:17348:5"/>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat Religion is onely pretended and used by them as a cloak to palliate their intended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, is demonstrative by this, That the seeds of this Sedition were sowen by the plotters of their Covenant, made under the pretence of Religion, long before any of the grievances or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended innovations in Religion complained of by them, were ever heard of amongst them.</p>
            <p>For the truth is, that some yeares after Our comming to the Crowne, by the advice both of some of Our principall Councellors and Officers of State there, as also by the advice of Our learnedest Advocates and Counsellers at law, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the example of many of Our Royall Progenitors of happie memorie, Kings and Queens of that Our Kingdome, We did make a legall revocation of such things as had beene passed away in prejudice of the Crowne, especially by some of Our late Royall Progenitors in their minorities; a course warranted by the lawes and many yeares practice of that Our Kingdome: With this course, some of the principall contrivers of this their present Covenant found themselves much aggrieved, and much of their estates brought within the compasse and danger of Our lawes, which made them presently begin to grumble and repine, and privately, as much as they durst, and as in them lay, to worke under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in Our subjects mindes a distaste of Our government: Which Wee made accompt Wee had quickly rectified, by shewing to all Our subjects interessed in that Revocation, Our gracious clemencie in waiving all the advantages which Our lawes gave Us in many of their estates: So that after We had made it apparent to Our subjects, how obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious many of them and their estates were unto Us and Our lawes, We likewise did make as apparent unto them, Our singular grace and goodnesse by remitting not onely the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, but even the equitie of Our lawes; insomuch that none of all Our subjects could then, or can now say that they were damnified in their persons or estates by that our Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17348:5"/>
or any thing which ensued upon it: Yet for all this, the principall present malecontents did then begin to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade with such as they thought they might be boldest with, a disaffection to Our government: And not seeing how they could easily obtrude upon them, the old and usuall pretence of discontent, <hi>viz.</hi> Religion, by a strained and farre-fetched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference they did not sticke to lay the envie of the procuring that harmelesse Revocation, by which no man suffered, upon the present Prelates, who in this were as innocent as the thing it selfe was: Onely because they hoped that the very name of Church-men or Religious persons, should in the point of faction have that operation with their followers, which they conceived the Church or Religion it selfe might have had, if they could have seene how to have perswaded them, that by this Revocation either of them had beene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> A second symptome of their discontent appeared not long after this, upon this occasion: Wee having daily heard the grievous complaints of many of Our subjects of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of all sorts, especially of the Gentrie and their Farmers, who paid their tythes to the Nobilitie, or such others whom they in that Kingdome call Lords of the Erection, or Laicke Patrons, here in England we call Impropriators, how that in the leading or gathering of their tythes, these Lords and Laicke Patrons did use and practise the uttermost of that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritie which the law alloweth them, how they would not gather their tythes when the owners of the corne desired them, but when it pleased themselves; by which meanes the owners, by the unseasonablenesse of the weather, were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times damnified to the losse of their whole stocke, or most part of it (the law of that Kingdome being in that point so strict, as no owner may carrie away his nine parts, or any part of them, untill the proprietarie of the tythes have set out his tenth part:) As likewise understanding at the same time, the deplorable estate of the Ministers of that Our Kingdome in the point of maintenance, how that they received no tythes in their parishes, but some poore pittance, either by way of a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17348:6"/>
stipendiarie benevolence, or else some mean allowance from these Lords of Erections or Laick Patrons, unworthie of the Ministers of the Gospel, and which exposed them to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of contempt and a base dependance upon their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons: Wee, at the instance and humble petition not of a few, but of the whole Clergie, and with them, of the whole payers of tythes of that Kingdome, begun to take three things into Our serious consideration.</p>
            <p>First, the wretched estate of the Clergie for want of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: Next, the hard usage and great oppression of all the Laitie that payed tythes, from the owners of them: Thirdly, a very important point of State, <hi>vizt.</hi> That it was not fit, that such a considerable part of Our subjects, as all the Ministers who have power over the consciences of the rest, and all the payers of tythes who are the farre greatest part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, should have their dependance upon the Nobilitie or other Laicke Patrons, the one for their livelihood and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, the other not onely for feare of having their cornes lost or endangered for not carrying them in due season, which was by the law in the power of these owners of the tythes, which power they were sure they would exercise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them if they should at any time displease them, or not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to them upon all occasions good or bad; But likewise because these Lords, owners of the tythes and also of Abbey lands, were likewise for the most part superiours to those who payed them, but were so altogether to those who held the Abbey lands of them by way of vassalidge, and so by their verie tenures were to performe all service and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to these Lords, their superiours, whensoever they should require it of them.</p>
            <p>Which important considerations moved Us, by the advice of the learnedest Lawyers there, to grant out a Commission under Our great Seale for that Kingdome, not to a few, but to divers hundreds, and those of the prime of all estates and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, (out of which number the Lords of the Erections and Laicke Patrons were not omitted) for relieving, if they should see cause, both the Ministers and owners of Corne, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17348:6"/>
also for taking into their consideration the point of superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie and dependance. These Commissioners, after their sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in great frequencie some yeares, and after full hearing of all parties interessed, and mature deliberation, did set a rate of the value of the tythes, ordered that the owners of the grounds should severally purchase them at so manie yeares purchase, as was then agreed upon by all both buyers and sellers, taking the same course for the rating of superiorities in regard of the Abbey lands, which was likewise accorded unto by all parties; and ordered that every Ministers means should be augmented, in such a certaine proportion set down and accorded unto, as the Incumbent should not be inforced any more to be a slave to his Patron.</p>
            <p>With the conclusions and determinations of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, called the Commission of Surrenders of Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Tythes, the owners of lands and the Ministers were indeed so really satisfied, that the former with all thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse acknowledged Us for their deliverer from an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bondage, under which they and their Ancestors ever since the reformation of Religion had grievously groaned; The latter with infinite expressions of joy and gratitude did cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate Us as the very father and founder of their severall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: We gave Our Royall assent to all agreed upon in that Commission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being glad that Our subjects were relieved, the maintenance of Our Clergie improved, and both Our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and Laitie freed from a dangerous dependance upon sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and for that freedome obliged to a thankfull, heartie, and loyall dependance upon Us, to whom alone by all lawes of God and men it is due. The Nobilitie and other Lay Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons seemed herewith likewise fully to rest satisfied; and so indeed they were in point of profit, for, according to the rates of purchasing in that Our Kingdome, for their tythes they were satisfied to the uttermost farthing: But they fretted pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately amongst themselves, for being robbed, as they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, of the clientele and dependance of the Clergie and Laitie, and of that power, command, and superioritie over them, which by that tye of tythes they had enjoyed: Yet, not being
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17348:7"/>
able to make Religion it selfe a faire pretence for this their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content (for who could imagine that everie man his gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his owne tythes, or the augmentation of Ministers maintenance, could be an affronting or weakening of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?) they had recourse to their former fetch, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bewraying much heart-burning, gave it out, that this Commission (which indeed was obtained by the humble importunitie both of Clergie and Laitie) was procured onely by the Bishops, who meant no good to Religion; and so from an unnecessarie jealousie of their persons and power, they begun to pretend and suborne a necessarie jealousie of Religion it selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> A third bewraying of their factious humour, appeared clearely at Our last being in that Our Kingdome, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Our departure from thence: For some sixe yeeres agoe, having a great desire to visite that Our native King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and being willing to cheere and comfort Our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects there with Our presence, and honour them with Our personall Coronation, all which they did most humbly and heartily sollicite Us for by their earnest and affectionate sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications; We undertooke a journey to them, and according to Our expectation were most joyfully received by them: But immediatly before, and at the sitting down of Our Parliament there, Wee quickly found that the very same persons who since were the contrivers of, and still continue the sticklers for their now pretended Covenant, begun to have secret meetings, and in their private consultations did vent their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of Our innocent Revocation, and Our most beneficiall Commission of Surrenders: But knowing that these two could gaine them no partie, then they begun to suggest great feares, that many and dangerous innovations of Religion were to be attempted in this present Parliament: Not that they themselves thought so, but because they knew that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that, or nothing would soyle with suspicious jealousie, or interrupt and relaxe the present joy and contentment which did overflowe in Our subjects hearts, and appeared in their heartie expressions for Our presence amongst them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:17348:7"/>But We readily confuted all these suspicious surmises; for, except an Act which gave Us power to appoint such vestures for Churchmen which We should hold to be most decent, nothing concerning Religion was either propounded or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in that Parliament, but that which everie King doth usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in that, and all other Christian Kingdomes, passe at their first Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> An Act of ratification of all other Acts heretofore made, and then standing in force concerning the Religion presently professed and established, and concerning the Church her liberties and priviledges: Which Act being an Act of course, though it passed by most voices, yet was it disassented from, to Our great admiration, by the voices of many of those who are now the principall pillars of their Covenant; which made all men then begin to suspect, that sure there was some great distemper of heat at the heart, when it boyled so over at their lips, by their unnecessarie and unprofitable denying of assent to the lawes, concerning the Religion and Church, already established; This first Act pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing more for forme and the honour of Religion, then for any use or necessitie of it, all the former Lawes still standing in force and vigour without the need of any new ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>At this time many of Our subjects of greatest qualitie were suitors to Us for new Titles of Honour, Gentlemen to bee Lords, Lords to bee Earles: Impossible it was for Us to satisfie all suitors in that kinde, without the prostitution of Honour to a just and open contempt; and therefore being put upon a choice and selection, We held it fitter in the point both of honour and justice, to passe by such as both privately in their secret meetings, and openly in the Parliament house, had shewed their disrepects to Us and Our just proceedings, then those who had carried themselves not only loyally and dutifully, but affectionately and heartily to Us and Our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Upon this occasion many of those who were then pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by, and are now principall Covenanters, seeing others advanced to degrees of honour above themselves, begun then presently to mutter, but not to mutinie untill We were gone from thence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:17348:8"/>But scarsly were We well returned into England, when the discontent of these men resolved it selfe into a plaine sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For then they had the impudence to give it out, that voyces were bought and packed in the late Parliament; nay, that the voyces were not truely numbred, but that some Acts were past without pluralitie of suffrages: A calumnie so foule and blacke, as that they themselves did know it to be most false: For had there beene the least suspicion of truth in it, they might have made tryall thereof, by surveying their owne papers, and the papers of many hundreds present, who took notes of the number of voyces which were given, either by assenting to, or disassenting from the severall Acts read and proposed; by which papers if they had found but the weakest ground for this their strong, but false report, We have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to thinke that either their mercie or modestie was such, that they would have forborne the calling of the Clerke of Our Register in question for it; it being as our Chancellors office to aske the voyces, so Our Clerke of Registers office to take them and record them, and according to his owne and his Clerkes notes who assist him, to pronounce the Act pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or stopt: In which it is impossible he should deale but with sinceritie, for else the notes taken by most of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, being a present and powerfull conviction of his false dealing, must presently transmit him to highest Censure and punishment.</p>
            <p>But knowing that in a publike and judiciall way they must needs faile in their proofe of this calumnie, they betook themselves to the secret and seditious way of malecontents: For first they used clancularie surmises, then they sent about from hand to hand a clandestine infamous Libell, and by it they impoysoned the hearts of many of Our good subjects with a suspicion of obliquitie in Our proceedings at the late Parliament: This infamous Libell comming to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Our Privie Councell there, first they of themselves, then afterwards, having made Us acquainted with it, by Our commandement entred into an inquirie both of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and abetters of that seditious Libell; Who found that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17348:8"/>
the author upon whom it was shifted and fathered, was one <hi>Hagge,</hi> then, and still fugitive, but that the abetters, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancers, and dispersers of it were many, and some of them of greatest qualitie, and now principall Covenanters: Wee, out of our innate and usuall clemencie, were graciously pleased (that the feare and example might reach to all, but the punishment onely to one of them) to passe by many, who undoubtedly had beene concluded and involved by Our Lawes in the same sentence, if Wee had proceeded against them, and to single out one of that ranke, who was most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Us and Our Crowne, and therefore both for his ingratitude and crime, had no reason to expect any thing from Us but the justice of Our lawes.</p>
            <p>This one was the Lord <hi>Balmerino,</hi> his Father was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Secretary of State for that Our Kingdome, to Our Father of happy memory, to whom he was beholden both for the honour of his Baronie, and for his whole fortune and estate which he got in his service: But he was since Our Royall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his comming to the Crowne of England, arraigned for, and attainted of high Treason in Scotland, found guilty of it by his Peeres, and accordingly received sentence to be hanged drawne and quartered, his bloud tainted, his whole estate forfeited to the Crowne: Yet such was the gracious clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Our Royall Father, that He, onely for a little time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued this condemned and forfeited Lord in prison, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward confined him, but to a large circuit, and then restored not onely the bloud of himselfe and his children, but also their honour and whole estate: Now this present Lord <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merino,</hi> being so extraordinarily obliged to Our Royall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Our Crowne, for the life of his father, his owne honour and whole fortunes, and so being one from whom We, the sonne of that Royall and Gracious Father to him and his whole family, had no reason to expect perfidiousnesse and ingratitude, he could not have the least shew of reason to expect any favour from Us, but the favour of a faire and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall tryall, which We granted him: At that tryall and arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was by his Peeres found guilty of abetting and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17348:9"/>
that infamous Libell made against Us, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly was to receive sentence of death for it; which Our chiefe Justice respited onely untill Our pleasure might bee knowne: Then indeed they who afterwards proved the contrivers of the late Covenant, and their adherents, begun to complaine of the hard measure which was offered to this Lord, and to lay false and wicked aspersions upon his Peeres who found him guilty; but finding that all the proceedings were usuall and legall, they could not but have acquit the Judge if hee should have condemned him, nor could they have found the least blemish in Our justice, if Wee should have given warrant both for his sentence and execution, whose life was now legally devolved into Our hands; and therefore this convicted Lord betook himselfe onely to Our mercie, which We shewed to him in that height as Wee are confident it is hardly to be patterned by any president.</p>
            <p>For notwithstanding the head of this family which was first raised by Our Father, and then being falne, yet raised by Him againe, and now relapsed, was once againe brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Our axe, as it had beene before brought under the axe of Our Royall Father: We, desirous to shew Our selfe the true heire of none of Our blessed Fathers vertues, more then of his mercie and clemencie, were contented upon his deep prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations of loyaltie for the time to come, to grant him under Our great Seale for that Our Kingdome, not onely a Pardon of that crime of which he stood convicted, but also his full libertie and inlargement: Which gracious Pardon of Ours, when it was delivered to him by Our Councell, who sent for him being then prisoner in the Castle of Edinburgh, he did before that Table receive on his knees, with the highest magnifying of Our mercie, with the humblest acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of those infinite obligations by which he and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily stood for ever engaged in the service of Us and Our Crowne, with the deepest protestations of all loyall, quiet, and peaceable deportment of himselfe ever hereafter, and of bending all his endeavours to attend upon all Our Royall courses and commandements, so that Our Councell remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17348:9"/>
unto Us, that Wee had bestowed Our mercie and grace upon a man, of whom there could not be the least su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion of his aversenesse from Our service at any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, but of whom they might safely promise all forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and alacritie in all Our just courses, whensoever it should please Us to use him: And now this same pardoned Lord <hi>Balmerino,</hi> being one of the chiefe contrivers, and most malicious prosecutors of this wicked Covenant made against Us and Our authoritie, how he can be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere it to God, Us, and Our Crowne, his owne conscience, or to the world, even in the point of honour and reputation, it must be left to the world to judge.</p>
            <p>By this now which hath been said, We suppose it is plain that before either the Service Book, or Book of Canons, so tragically now exclaimed against, were thought on, the seeds of sedition and discontent were sowne by the contrivers of the late Covenant, first upon the occasion of our Revocation, next upon occasion of Our Commission of Surrenders, and lastly upon the occasion of Our denying Honours to some of them at Our last being in that Kingdome, which caused first their traducing of Our proceedings in our last Parliament held there, and then produced that infamous Libell.</p>
            <p>And now by this time sedition was growne so ripe, and readie to seed, that it wanted nothing to thrust it out, and make it shoot forth into an open Rebellion, but some faire and specious pretence: They could not yet compasse the cloake of Religion, whereby to siele the eyes, and muffle the face of the multitude, for by none of all the three former oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions could they so much as pretend that Religion was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered or impeached: But so soon as they got but the least hint of any thing, which they thought might admit a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construction that way, they lost no time, but took Occasion by the forelock, knowing that either that, or nothing would first facilitate, and then perfect their designes: Now the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion they tooke of fetching Religion within the reach of their pretences, was this.</p>
            <p>Our Father of blessed memorie immediately after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17348:10"/>
into England, comparing the decencie and uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Gods worship here, especially in the Liturgie of the Church, with that diversitie, nay deformitie which was used in Scotland, where no set or publike forme of prayer was used, but Preachers or Readers and ignorant Schoolmasters prayed in the Church, sometimes so ignorantly as it was a shame to all Religion to have the Majestie of God so barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously spoken unto, sometimes so seditiously that their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were plaine Libels, girding at Soveraigntie and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; or Lyes, being stuffed with all the false reports in the Kingdome: He did immediately, as became a Religious Prince, bethinke himselfe seriously how His first reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that Kingdome might begin at the publike worship of God, which Hee most truely conceived could never be happily effected, untill such time as there should be an unitie and uniformitie in the publike Prayers, Liturgie, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church, established throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Concerning this His Royall and Religious designe, divers consultations, for many yeares, were had with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and others of the Clergie of most eminent note in that Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But these deliberations (as it happeneth manie times in businesse of so pious and ponderous importance) received some opposition, and manie intermissions, untill the yeare 1616. in a Generall Assemblie (which is answerable to the Convocation of the Clergie here in England) held at Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene in August, Our Royall Father by His Letters, and the vehement instance of His Commissioners then and there present, easily made apparent to that whole Assembly, not onely the conveniencie, but indeed the necessitie of a publike Liturgie to be settled throughout the whole Land: Which moved that Assemblie to passe an Act, whereby they autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised some of the present Bishops, and divers others, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile and frame a publike forme of Liturgie, or Booke of Common Prayer, which should first be presented to Our Royall Father, and after His approbation should be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally received throughout the Kingdome. This Booke in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17348:10"/>
pursuance of that Act of Assembly, being by those who were deputed for that purpose framed, was by the Lord Archbishop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> that now liveth, sent up to Our Royall Father, who not onely carefully and punctually perused everie particular passage of it himselfe, but had it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so considerately advised with, and revised by some of that Kingdome here in England, in whose judgement He repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed singular trust and confidence; and after all His owne and their observations, additions, expunctions, mutations, accommodations, He sent it backe to those from whom He had received it, to be commended to that whole Church, being a Service Booke in substance, frame, and composure, much about one with this verie Service Booke which We of late commended to them, and which undoubtedly then had been received in that Church, if it had not pleased Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, that while these things were in doing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could receive their much wished and desired pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod and consummation, to the invaluable losse, as of the whole Church of God, so particularly of that Church of Scotland, to translate Our blessed Father from His temporall Kingdomes to that which is eternall.</p>
            <p>Wee, by the grace of God, succeeding to Our royall Father, were desirous to make it knowne to the world, that Wee did not hold it a greater honour to succeed Him in His Crownes, then to be His Successour in His Princely vertues, and especially in that in which He was most eminent, His singular pietie and religious care of the publique service of God; which finding here in this Kingdome of England, by His singular wisedome and vigilancie, setled even to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration if not envie of all other Churches, We resolved by the grace of God to pursue that His Pious and Princely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, for setling a publike Liturgie in that Our Kingdome of Scotland, it having beene so happily atchieved, facilitated, and almost perfected by Him: To which purpose We cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the same Service Booke, transmitted by Him to that Church, to be remitted and sent backe to Us, that after Our perusall and alterations, if any should be found, either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17348:11"/>
or convenient, it might likewise receive Our Royall authoritie and approbation: We having received that Book, and after many serious consultations had with divers of Our Bishops and Clergie of that Kingdome then here present with Us, and after Our advices by Our Letters and Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the rest at home, and after many humble advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and remonstrances made from them to Us of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of some alterations, which they did conceive would remove divers difficulties, which otherwise they feared this Booke would encounter with; We were contented that the Service Booke should come out as now it is printed, being fully liked by them, and signed with their hands, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used, approved, and published by Our Royall command and authoritie.</p>
            <p>In the perusall and approbation whereof, We tooke speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care, that the small alterations of it in which it differeth from the English Service Booke should be such, as We had reason to thinke would best comply with the mindes and dispositions of Our subjects of that Kingdome: For We sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that they might have taken some offence, if We should have tendered them the English Service Booke <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> and that some factious spirits would have endevoured to have misconstrued it as a badge of dependance of that Church upon this of England, which Wee had put upon them to the prejudice of their Lawes and Liberties; We held it fitter that a new Booke should be composed by their own Bishops, in substance not differing from this of England, that so the Roman party might not upbraid Us with any weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or materiall differences in Our Liturgies, and yet in some few insensible alterations differing from it, that it might true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and justly be reputed a Book of that Churches owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, and established by Our Royall Authority, as King of Scotland: And thus conceiving Wee had discharged the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a religious King towards God, and of a gracious Prince in accommodating this Booke so, that Our subjects of that Kingdome should have no cause to have the least suspicion of any intended dependancie of that Church upon this, Wee
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17348:11"/>
sent home the Book to the Lords of Our Privie Councell: After their receipt &amp; consideration of it, We, by their advice, and they, by Our Authoritie, commanded by publike Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation that the said Book should be publikely read and received in all the Churches of that Our Kingdome, and should begin to be practised upon Easter next, 1637.</p>
            <p>Disobedience to this Our Proclamation Wee had little reason to expect, because this Service-book was no new thing unto them: For it not differing from the English Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-book in any materiall point, and We supposing that the English Liturgie neither was nor could bee displeasing to them, did likewise conceive that this Book should be as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle disliked by them: Now the reasons inducing Us to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of their not misliking the English Liturgie, were these.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, many of Our subjects of that Kingdome of all sorts daily resorting to Our Court and the Citie of London, did much frequent our Chappell, many other Churches in or about the Citie, and many Churches, during their stay here at the severall places of our residence, and many other Churches within this Kingdome upon their way, both hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and homeward; in all which Churches they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves during the time of divine Service with that reverence as others of Our subjects of this Kingdome did, without any dislike of it, or quarrelling against it. Now these who resorted hither, being for quantitie and number very considerable, and for qualitie (for the most part) of the very best, gave Us more then a probable assurance, that at home they would never accompt that absolutely in it selfe unlawfull and Antichristian (as many of them have since professed,) unto which they had here of their owne accord by their practise yeelded obedience: For neither municipall Law, nor variation of time or place, nor any other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, can allow Us to practise that which we hold in it selfe to be simply unlawfull, Antichristian, and against the Word of God.</p>
            <p>

not onely without dislike, but with frequent Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Our Councel, Nobility, Bishops, &amp; other Clergie of all sorts, Judges, Gentrie, Burgesses, women of all ranks: The Bishops or some of them never gave Orders (which they did frequently) but they used the English Service-book, &amp; in some Cathedrall Churches of that kingdom, as also in the new Colledge of the University of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> for some yeeres of late it was publikely read without any distaste, much lesse disturbance; for divers yeeres it was used in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny families, and at Our last being in that Kingdome it was read publikely in all Churches to which Wee resorted, in which great numbers of all sorts of people were present: All which gave Us good reason to conceive, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of this Book by Our authoritie, could not in any true sense be called or accounted an innovation, all sorts of people, and very many of those of all ranks who now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh most bitterly against it, having been so accustomed to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and acquainted with it, and that without any dislike of it or complaint against it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Wee confesse that one of the chiefest reasons moving Us to beleeve, that that Service-book (being in substance all one with this of England) could not be held by them to containe any thing tending to Idolatrie, Poperie, or Superstition (as since they have pretended) was this; We did foresee that all objections bending that way must needs strike at the English Service-book aswell as at that (and indeed all of them which they have preached or published against that book do so;) but We did then and do still take it as granted, that no man, who hath his wits about him, can charge the least suspicion of these things objected, upon the English Service-book: For since it is well knowne to the whole Christian world, that the Composers &amp; Framers of the English Service-book were those very famous Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops &amp; others, who in Queen <hi>Mary</hi> her dayes delivered up their living bodies to the fire, or escaping the fire indured ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, &amp; only because they would not yeeld to Poperie and Superstition: How these men now, whom in their owne judgement they hold to bee ranked amongst the most glorious Martyrs of the Church, for resisting even to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion, can with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science or honestie be charged by these men with compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a Book stuffed full with Idolatrie, Poperie, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, it requireth more then an ordinarie understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to apprehend: And besides, it will be made good, that more of the Bishops and learned Clergie of England, both for number and weight, have opposed Superstition and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, then can be found in all the reformed Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, who all of them have lived in the practise of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Liturgie, and defended the same; which they would never have done if they had supposed it to containe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie or Superstition.</p>
            <p>These now were the grounds which inclined Us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Service-book, authorized by Us for that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, was not like to receive any publike or considerable opposition, though We did never expect it should misse to meet with that misfortune which attendeth all other Books of this kind, and which hath waited upon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Service-book here, <hi>viz.</hi> to be disliked and defamed by some whose judgements either being weak are not capable of satisfaction, or being distempered with the humours of singularitie, are resolved never to receive, or at least never to seeme to receive any satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And yet, even those men too, especially they of the first sort, men of weaker judgement, before, and at the time of the publishing of this Book, were not cast without the compasse of Our care and clemencie: For Wee did with that Book send home certaine instructions and directions to our Bishops of that Kingdome signed with Our owne hand, amongst which this was one: That notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding We had now established this Book by Our authoritie, yet they should proceed with all moderation, and dispense with such for the practise of some things contained in the Book, as they should finde either not well perswaded of them, or willing to be informed concerning them, or did hope that time and reason might gaine to a better beleefe of them: Nay yet more, to foresee what probable opposition this Book might be like to receive, Wee caused Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell by Proclamation to publish a set day for the reading of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17348:13"/>
it in all Churches, which was the Easter day following, 1637: All which time, though no symptoms of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable opposition did appeare, yet upon good conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and for the further trial of mens minds, the first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it was delayed untill the xxiii. of July next ensuing, to the end that the Lords of the Session, and others who had any Law-businesse, might see the successe of it before the rising of the Session, which alwayes endeth on the first of August, and that so upon their returne to their severall Countries they might report the receiving of this Book at Edinburgh; it being ordered, that on that Sunday the Book should be read onely in the Churches of Edinburgh, and those which were next adjacent: And because it should not be read that day neither unexpectedly, warning was first printed, and then published in all these severall Pulpits the Sunday immediatly before, that the next Sunday the new Service-book was to be read: After all which premoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made only to try how the people stood affected, &amp; no feare of tumult appearing; Nay, the Service-book, which was to be read, having beene in publike Sermons commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by many Preachers, without any apparent disgust of the Book, or disgrace offered to the Preachers persons; Nay, having beene commended in Sermons by some of their now principall Covenanting Ministers, who since have beene the greatest railers against it, by none more then one <hi>Rollock</hi> a Minister of Edinburgh, who, both in a Sermon preached by him at a Synod held at Edinburgh before the Bishop of that Diocesse, and in his Sermon on the Sunday of intimation of the reading of the Service-book the next Sunday, did highly magnifie the said Book: And so the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of this Book being thus prepared and sweetned with these gracious considerations of time, &amp; expectation of the discovery of mens affections, which, for any thing appeared to the contrarie, were very calme &amp; composed, who could have imagined that the first reading of it should have been attended with such a barbarous tumult and insurrection, as was raised in the Churches and streets of Edinburgh the Sunday following? the true relation of which tumult, as it was sent up to Us, doth here follow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:17348:13"/>On the twentie-third day of July, 1637. being Sunday, according to the publike warning given the Sunday before, the Service Book was begun to bee read in Edinburgh in Saint <hi>Gyles</hi> Church, commonly called the great Church; where were present (as usually they are) many of Our Councell, both the Arch-bishops and divers other Bishops, the Lords of the Session, the Magistrates of Edinburgh, and a very great auditorie of all sorts of people. Amongst this great multitude there appeared no signe of trouble: But, no sooner was the Book opened by the Deane of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, but a number of the meaner sort, who used to keep places for the better sort, most of them women, with clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of their hands, cursings, and out-cries, raised such a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous hubbub in that sacred place, that not any one could either heare or be heard: The Bishop of Edinburgh, who was to preach, stept into the Pulpit, which is immediatly above the place where the Deane was to read, intending to appease the tumult, by putting them in minde that the place, in which they then were, was holy ground, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating them to desist from that fearefull and horrible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of it: But hee was entertained with as much irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence as the Deane, and with more violence; in so much, that if a stoole, aimed to be throwne at him, had not by the providence of God beene diverted by the hand of one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the life of that Reverend Bishop, in that holy place, and in the Pulpit, had beene indangered, if not lost: The Arch-bishop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> Lord Chancellour, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers offering to appease the multitude, were entertained with such bitter curses and imprecations, as they not being able to prevaile with the people, the Provost, Bailiffs, and divers others of the Councell of that Citie were forced to come downe from the Gallery in which they do usually sit, and with much adoe, in a very great tumult and confusion, thrust out of the Church these disorderly people, making fast the Church doores: After all which, the Deane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly read Service, assisted by Our Councellors, Bishops, and many other persons of qualitie there present: Yet the out cries rapping at the Church doores, throwing of stones at the Church windowes by the tumultuous multitude
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17348:14"/>
without, was so great as the Bailiffes of the Citie were once more put to forsake their places, and use their best indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the appeasing the rage and furie of those who were without. Service being ended, the Bishop preached, after which the Congregation was dismissed: The Bishop of Edinburgh retiring himselfe to a lodging distant not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paces from the Church, was so invironed with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the meaner sort of people, cursing and crouding him, that he was neere being trode to death; and in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie had beene so, if hee had not recovered the staires of his lodging, which he no sooner began to go up, but he was so pulled by the sleeve of his gowne by some of that rude rout, that hee had like to have tumbled backward downe the staires, to the indangering of his life, yet with much adoe getting up the staires he found the doore, at which he should have entred, shut against him, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to a stand, he had certainely beene oppressed with the preasse and violence of that rabble, if the Earle of Weems from his next lodging, seeing the Bishops life in danger, had not sent his servants to rescue him, who got the Bishop almost breathlesse into his lodging. The same mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Service Book was read in the next Church to Saint <hi>Gyles</hi> Church, not without noise and tumult, yet the furie was not so great as in the other Church: In the Gray Friers Church the Elect Bishop of Argyle (being Colleague to Master <hi>Ramsey</hi> who refused to read it) begun to read the Book, but he was so cursed and exclaimed against, and threatned to be pulled downe, that after the reading of the Confession and Absolution, he was forced to give over. In the Colledge Church, <hi>Rollock,</hi> one of the Preachers there, who the Sunday before, at the intimation of the reading of it, had so much commended the Book, and had undertaken this day to read it, though hee had the Book ready to be carried to the Church with him, yet, very wisely, resolved to halt a little, untill he might know how it was entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at Saint <hi>Gyles</hi> Church, that so his conscience might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the carriage of the multitude, whose rudenesse being reported to him, he (notwithstanding his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Book, and his faithfull promise to read it,)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17348:14"/>
thought it the safer course to leave himselfe to the censure of all men for his levitie and breach of promise, then offend the multitude, whose favour is the onely aire in which he taketh delight to breath and live: And thus that morning passed.</p>
            <p>Betweene the two Sermons, such of Our Councell as were in the Towne, assembled at the Lord Chancellour his lodging, where the Lord Provost and Bailiffs of Edinburgh being called, undertooke to doe their uttermost endevours for the quiet and peaceable reading of the Service Booke in the afternoon; which accordingly they did, and so the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Booke in Saint <hi>Gyles</hi> and some other Churches, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone was read, without any such tumult or insurrection as it encountred with in the morning; yet the furious multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who stayed in the streets, and little regarded the service of God in the Churches, intermitted nothing of their mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the Lord Privie Seale Earle of Roxborough retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning home to his lodging, and having with him in his Coach the Bishop of Edinburgh, was neare suffering the death of the first Martyr St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> his Coach and Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for having the Bishop in it, being so pelted with stones, and hooted at with execrations, and pressed upon by the eager and mad multitude, that if the Lord Privie Seale his Footmen had not with their swords kept them off, they in the Coach had been brought in danger of their lives, having after long and continuall bickerings much adoe to recover their lodgings.</p>
            <p>And now We desire all men to consider what blessing and successe from heaven may be expected upon this grand and important reformation of Religion, as they call it, the begetter and beginner whereof was the horrible profanation of the Lords owne day, and that in the Lords owne Houses and Temples, and all this attended with the contempt and treading under foot the sacred Authoritie and Lawes of Us the Lords Anointed, as also with the violation of the persons of the Lords Priests and Prophets, his Bishops and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and all these practised by a base multitude, disavowed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17348:15"/>
and disclaimed at that time by all Magistrates and persons put in authoritie, and all others of any ranke or qualitie, who branded that multitude with the names of the scum and froth of the people, and offered themselves, to the uttermost of their diligence and assistance, for the finding of them out, and bringing them to highest and condigne punishment, as shall presently appeare by the demeanour of the Magistrates when they were called before Our Councell for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>For the next day, being the 24. of July 1637. Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell assembled, and sent forth a Proclamation in detestation of the uproare and tumult the day before, and discharged all concourses of people and tumultuous meetings in Edinburgh under paine of death; at which time the Magistrates of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh being then present at Our Councell Table, professed their utter abhorring, and detesting of the last tumult, and apprehended some suspected to be most forward in it, and thereupon were commanded and ordered by an Act of Our Councell of the 26. of July, to assemble the Councell of the Citie the next morning by eight of the clocke, and then and there to resolve what course they thought fittest to be held for the finding out of the movers of, and chiefe actors in the late seditious uproare, and immediately after to report their diligence and resolutions herein: Which report they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly made to Our Councell, not onely with a detestation of that tumult, and promises of their best diligence for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the authors and abettors of it, but also with large proffers of their best assistance for the quiet and peaceable establishing and reading of the Service Booke in all their Churches.</p>
            <p>But the Ministers of that Citie being loath to undertake the reading of it, without some securitie given for the safetie of their persons, the Lords of Our Councell by their Act of the 28. of July 1637. ordered the Provost, Bailiffes, and Councell of Edinburgh to advise amongst themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning some obligatorie Act to be made by them, for a reall
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17348:15"/>
performance of what they had undertaken, and should fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther undertake for the peaceable exercise of the Service Book, which they accorded unto, and promised, that since the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Readers in their severall Churches, had refused to read the Booke, if in the meane time the Ministers themselves would read it, they would take order for their safetie, and when new Readers should be provided, they would take order both for their securitie and settled maintenance and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance: In pursuance whereof, an obligatorie Act was drawne up by Our Advocate, and read before Our Councell to the Magistrates of Edinburgh the sixt of August 1637. to which they humbly consented, and on the tenth of the same moneth, the said Act of indemnitie being exhibited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Our Councell, was allowed by them, and accordingly passed and entred in Our Councell booke as an Act of Councell: And so now this late tumult in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance being settled, and not onely fathered upon the scumme and dregges of the people, but cryed downe by all men either of place or qualitie, and by none more then by the Magistrates and Ministers of Edinburgh, Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell not fearing any new outrage, proceeded to these two things.</p>
            <p>First, to the exemplarie punishing of such of the heads of the late tumult as they should discover: And next, to the settling of the practice of the Service Booke, and appointing a new day for renewing the exercise of it; to which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Magistrates and Ministers of Edinburgh agreed: And this their forwardnesse the Magistrates of that Citie were not onely contented to expresse before Our Councell, both by their verball promises and protestations, as also their obligatorie Act remaining upon record, and registred in Our bookes of Councell, but likewise by two particular Letters sent by them into England unto the Lord Archbishop of Canterburie, in which they desired him to recommend unto Us, their care of, and fidelitie to Our service, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for them to Us their zeale and forwardnesse, for settling the peaceable practice of the Service Booke: Which Letters
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17348:16"/>
We here have caused to be inserted, that the Reader may see what names of simplicitie and ignorance they bestow upon that multitude, which made the first opposition, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all take notice of the names of the Magistrates subscribers to these Letters; for some of them (which hardly could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from reasonable men) will be found to be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if not leaders in the next succeeding sedition, and so of the rest which have followed since: The Letters be these.</p>

            <p>WEe confesse that these large undertakings of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, moved Us to remit much of Our intended rigor against the offenders in the first uproare, hoping that their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of Our clemencie, would have produced ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects quite contrarie to those which We have found: And now We shall desire the Reader to observe, that this first tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult was owned by none, condemned and cryed down by all, the authors of it, and actors in it called by all sorts, by no better names then Rogues, and the base Multitude: What will you then think, if that within verie few daies you shall see the verie same liberall bestowers of these names entring upon the same Stage, repeating and acting over againe the parts of that madd Multitude; Onely the Stage you shall see a little better hanged, and the Scenes better set out, and the Play ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

a more specious name of Pietie and Religion? For soon after, these base and unruly people, who were so much out in their first act of Rebellion, (as Actors at the first are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly perfect) were in the Pulpits, even for that their first and foule act so much of late hissed at and decryed, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards magnified for the most heroicall Sparkes that ever God inspired and raised up in this last age of the world; and though they were but Asses, yet they were cryed up for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their mouthes opened immediately by God, as the mouth of <hi>Balaams</hi> Asse was, to the upbraiding of all the rest of the Land, who held their peace when they should have cryed and brayed as they did: Their happy mouthes and hands, which God was pleased to honour that day with the beginning of their new blessed Reformation, and occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their celestiall Covenant (as they called it) were so highly extolled by their Preachers, that they assured their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors that their memorials should be eternall, whom before they had called the scumme of the people, and the base Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and that all succeeding generations should call them blessed. These high flowne speeches, and many others of the like extravagant straine, both in the Pulpits and out of them, immediately after the first tumult, and ever since, have beene bestowed, and that not sparingly, upon that multitude, which not long before they called base and rascall: But no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for many of the better sort having succeeded that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the same madnesse, they must needs now give them new, high, and Heroicall titles, such as they would have given to themselves now acting their parts; for now their owne actions come next upon the Stage to bee viewed and judged.</p>
            <p>All businesses now for a time seemed to be hushed and calmed, by reason of the long vacation, which in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome beginneth alwayes on <hi>Lammas</hi> day, and the Harvest, which drew all sorts of people from Edinburgh, except the Citizens; so that little or nothing was done betweene the last of July and first of October, save that some Ministers pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned the Lords of Our Councell for suspending the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17348:19"/>
whereby they were charged to receive the Service Book, and that they of Edinburgh begun a little by the instigation of their two silenced Ministers to relent of their former for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse for receiving the said Booke, and to repent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of their too eager condemning the raisers of the first insurrection, and presented to Our Councell on the 26. of September a Petition, humbly desiring not to bee pressed with the Service Booke notwithstanding all their former undertakings, but to be continued in the same case with all the rest of the Kingdome, untill Our pleasure were further knowne; which Petition, as they alledged, they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to present, by the example and encouragement of all ranks from all parts of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But so soone as Harvest was done, the conflux of all sorts of Our subjects, Nobilitie, Gentrie, Ministers, and Burgesses from all parts of that Kingdome, came to be so great at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and after such a tumultuous maner, as that, a present Insurrection was justly feared; which forced Our Councell, assembled then at Edinburgh upon the day before appointed by them, <hi>viz.</hi> the xvij. of October, 1637. to make three Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first, to give notice that on that day nothing should bee treated of at the Councell Table concerning Church businesse, untill the Lords might see the times, and meetings of his Majesties subjects more quiet and peaceable; and therefore commanded all who were come thither about any such businesse, peaceably to repaire to their owne homes within foure and twentie houres, under the paines expressed in the said Proclamation: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A second, for removing the Session (which is here in England called the Terme) from Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh to Lithcow, for feare of present danger, if this great concourse of people should not some way be diverted and divided, especially considering that those of Edinburgh were now apparently perverted, and become very evill affected to Our and Our Councels courses of peace and quietnesse: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third, for bringing in and burning a certaine seditious Booke newly dispersed amongst our subjects there, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to sedition and the disgrace of Our Ecclesiasticall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

            <p>On the eighteenth of October 1637. the Bishop of Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and Sir <hi>VVilliam Elfinston</hi> Lord chiefe Justice of that Our Kingdome, being appointed by the Lords of Our Councell to examine witnesses in a cause depending before them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17348:20"/>
               <hi>Francis Stuart</hi> sonne to the late Earle of Bothwell, and divers others, the Bishop was peaceably passing along the street towards the Councell-house where the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were to be taken: But suddenly an inraged multitude surrounded him, and followed him with fearfull cursings and exclamations close to the Councell-house doore, where hee was againe incountred afresh with a new troupe, who watched, and lay in wait for his comming thither, and whose furie exceeded words; for in all probabilitie the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop had beene pulled in peeces by them, if by divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he had not beene defended by the said <hi>Francis Stuart,</hi> who with much adoe got the Bishop within the doores of the Councell-house, where Our Lord chiefe Justice staied for him: But when hee was there, that place of highest Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence within that Our Kingdome, was no Sanctuarie for him; for they continued demanding his person, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him with death: The report hereof, and the danger of their Lords life, was brought by some of the Bishops ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants presently to the Earle of Traquair Our Lord Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and the Earle of Wigton, one of the Lords of Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, who were then at a lodging not farre from thence: They came presently with their followers to the reliefe of the Bishop, but verie hardly for the croud of the mutiners could approach the Councell-house where hee was; at last, when with much adoe they got entrance, they found themselves in no better case then the Bishop was, for the peoples furie meeting with no proportionable resistance, increased the more: The Lords thus beset in Our Councell-house, sent privately to the Lord Provost, Bailiffes, and Councell of Edinburgh, who were then assembled in their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell-house, requiring them to come to their rescue, and to take some present order for their safetie: They, by one Sir <hi>Thomas Thompson,</hi> who indeed was an eye witnesse of the truth of it, returned this answer; That they were in the same, if not a worse case themselves, if the Lords without did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently pacifie the inraged multitude; that the whole streets were pestred with disorderly people; that their Councell-house
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17348:21"/>
was beset without, and thronged within, with their owne threatning Citizens, who had vowed to kill all within their house, unlesse they did presently subscribe to a paper presented to them, which for feare of their lives they were forced to doe: Which paper contained these three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that they should joyne with them in opposition to the Service Book, and in petitioning Us for that purpose: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that by their authoritie they should presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store unto their Pulpits and places Master <hi>Ramsey</hi> and <hi>Rollock,</hi> their two silenced Ministers: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store unto his place one <hi>Henderson</hi> a silenced Reader: No doubt three most important grounds for such a fearfull sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: No better answer being returned, the Lord Treasurer and the Earle of Wigton, with their followers, resolved to go up to the Towne Councell-house, and to use the uttermost of their authoritie, or (if that found no respect) their best perswasions for settling the present sedition: When they came thither, they found the Magistrates verie much discomposed, &amp; greatly perplexed, as much doubting whether they should ever escape from the place with their lives; yet they presently entred into consultation with them about what was fittest to be done in such an exigent; and finding now that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like divulging of that paper which the Magistrates and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Citie had subscribed, and that the open proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it throughout all their turbulent troupes, and at the Crosse, had a little asswaged their furious rage, the Lords begun to advise with the Magistrates what was best to bee done for the safetie of the Bishop of Galloway, whom they had left besieged in the Councell-house: It was thought fit by all, that the Lords should returne to Our Councell-house, and containe themselves therein, till the Magistrates might try what they could do for calming the commotion in the streets: But no sooner had the Lords presented themselves to the streets, but they were received with such violence as they were forced to retire, untill such time as two of the Bailiffes with their Serjeants and Officers, and such others as they got to attend them, accompanying the Lords, and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17348:21"/>
to the multitude what had beene yeelded to in the paper exhibited to them, a little way was made at first; But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently when they entred upon the great street, the barbarous multitude run most inragedly upon them: Their out-cries were horrible and confused, but were (as much as in such a confusion could be distinguished,) <hi>God defend all those who will defend Gods cause, and God confound the Service Book, and all the maintainers of it.</hi> The Lords being in present and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, assured the people that they would represent their grievances to Us; for when they perceived that the people refused to obey any commandement which was laid upon them in Our name, and that they sleighted their requiring of them to retire unto their owne houses, and to behave themselves as quiet and good subjects; under paine of Our highest displeasure, they were glad then to betake themselves to intreaties and plausible perswasions; but all in vaine: For the people still increased their furie, and that to such a height, as that the Lord Treasurer was throwne downe, his hat, cloak, and white staffe pulled from him, so that if by the strength of some about him, he had not beene presently pulled up againe upon his feet, he had undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been trode to death, and in that posture without hat or cloak, like a notorious malefactour, was he carried by the croud to Our Councell-house doore, where the Bishop of Galloway and others of Our Councell were imprisoned, in great feare, and expecting the Lords returne for their reliefe: Not long after the Provost and Bailiffes came thither to them, told them they had used their uttermost power and perswasions with the best, ablest, and of the prime esteeme of all their Citizens for the appeasing of the present tumult, and securing their Lordships persons, but could finde no concurrence nor obedience: Whereupon the Lords resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to send for some of the Noblemen, and Gentrie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who were now frequently assembled for assisting the petition against the Service Book, to try what help they would or could contribute for quieting the inraged people, and what assistance they might expect from them in freeing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17348:22"/>
them from the present danger: They, being sent for, came to the Lords and declared unto them how much they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied with the present mutinie, offered their persons and power for securing them from all violence; which the Lords in Our Councell-house accepting of, with much adoe (being guarded by them whom the people would not offend) the Lord Treasurer got to Our Palace at Haly-rud-house, and the Bishop of Galloway to his lodging: But the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost was againe set upon as he was entring his owne house, and was so pressed upon by the multitude, that they crouded with him into his owne yard, railing upon him and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stones at his windowes, untill some of his servants dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging a Peece which had nothing but powder in it, they retired for feare: In this tumult none were more forward and inexorable, then two who were Bailiffes the yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and who had subscribed the two Letters to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canterburie.</p>
            <p>This mornings storme being a little blowne over, Our Councell in the afternoone met at Our Palace at Haly-rud-house, and commanded a Proclamation presently to bee made at the Crosse of Edinburgh; the tenour whereof here followeth.</p>

            <p>TO this Proclamation so little obedience was yeelded, and they of Edinburgh so farre from conceiving that they had any way misdemeaned themselves by that horrible insurrection, as that the next Councell day they had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to send their Commissioners publikely to Our Councell Table, and there to require that their Ministers and Reader might be restored to them, and that they might have assurance for the performance of what was promised to them by their Magistrates at this last Rebellion, and before the pacification of it.</p>
            <p>From this Relation joyned to the Narration of the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection in the Churches, it is easie to judge whether this their intended glorious Reformation, which, according to their religious intentions and ardent prayers, they say, God, even to a miracle, hath so graciously prospered in their hands, be like to proceed from God, the first act whereof was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the Church, with contempt of God and profanation of the house where his honour dwelleth, and the violation of those persons who serve at his Altar; and the second Act whereof, was presented on the streets of the capitall Citie of the Kingdome, with the contempt of the highest Authoritie under God, <hi>viz.</hi> Us and Our lawes, and offering violence to the persons of Our Councellors and chiefe Officers of State, not forbearing the verie houses and places where Our Councell for that Kingdome, and Our Magistrates of that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17348:23"/>
Citie doe usually sit, and were then sitting; which places have alwayes been accounted sacred, and have duely challenged all respect and reverence.</p>
            <p>And now it is verie observable by what degrees this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion hath risen, as if it had been before-hand well studied and contrived, everie rank entring upon the Stage in their due turns, in which they served and answered one another: The first tumult was begun by the basest sort of that Citie, whom the Authors of this second insurrection did then, even for that first tumult, condemne by the name of Rascalls and scum of the people: This second uproare, farre more seditious and dangerous then the former, was made by the best sort of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, excepting onely the Magistrates and some few others, yet disavowed and disliked (at least in shew) by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, Gentrie, and the Magistrates of the Citie; but these last Mutiners were not so cryed downe by them as the former, nor did they put such vile names of Rebels and Rascals upon them, nor did they shew any signification of their desire to have them questioned or punished for that tumult, because now the qualitie of these last mutiners persons gave some good countenance to the designes which they themselves had in hand: For these Noblemen, Gentrie, and Magistrates being themselves to performe the third Act of that Tragedie, at the first whereof they had hissed, and seemed to dislike the second, held it not fit to be too severe in condemning of that which it seemes they meant shortly after to act themselves, and in a more dangerous way: For first, their Protestation against Our Proclamation, and then their Covenant against Us and Our Authoritie, were next to come upon the Stage; which though they were of the same plot and piece with the two other former insurrections, yet because they were to be better acted, and the Actors men of greater eminencie, they hoped their parts should not finde such foule names as the former had found: As if the things being the same, the names of Protestation or Covenant could alter the nature of insurrection and Rebellion; like those of that bloudie League in France, who hoped that the verie name of the HOLIE
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17348:23"/>
LEAGUE would cause in the world a mistake of their meaning, and palliate their most wicked and unnaturall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, for rooting out their lawfull Soveraigne and the true Religion. And now this highest and worst part commeth next to be related.</p>

                  <p>UNto your Lordships humbly shews; VVe Noblemen, Barons, Ministers, Burgesses, and Commons; That whereas we were in humble and quiet manner attending a gracious answer of our former supplications against the Service Book imposed upon us, and readie to shew the great inconveniences which upon the introduction thereof must ensue, we are, without any knowne desert, farre by our expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, surprised and charged by publike Proclamation to depart out of the town within twentie foure houres thereafter, under paine of Rebellion; by which peremptorie and unusuall charge, our feares of a more severe and strict course of proceeding are augmented, and course of our suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation interrupted: wherefore we are constrained, out of the deep griefe of our hearts, humbly to remonstrate, that whereas the Arch-bishops and Bishops of this Realme, being intrusted by his Majestie with the government of the affaires of the Church of Scotland, have drawne up and set forth, and caused to be drawne up and set forth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned upon the subjects two Books; In the one whereof, called the Book of Common prayer, not onely are sowne the seeds of divers Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions, Idolatrie, and false doctrine, contrarie to the true Religion established within this Realme by divers Acts of Parliament; But also the Service Booke of England is abused, especially in the matter of Communion, by additions, subtractions, interchanging of words and sentences, falsifying of titles, and misplacing of Collects, to the disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Reformation, as the Romish Masse is, in the more substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall points, made up therein, as we offer to instruct in time and place convenient, quite contrarie unto and for reversing the gracious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>And yet these blessed Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were the very same men who compiled the English Service Book, which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters have printed and preached to be stuffed full of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi>

book called Canons and Constitutions for the government of the Church of Scotland, they have ordained, That whosoever shall affirme that the forme of worship inserted in the Booke of Common Prayer and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Sacraments, whereof heretofore and now we most just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complaine, doth containe any thing repugnant to the Scriptures, or are corrupt, superstitious, or unlawfull in the service and worship of God, shall be excommunicated, and not be restored but by the Bishop of the place, or Archbishop of the Province, after his repentance and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke revocation of this his wicked errour; Besides one hundred Canons moe, many of them tending to the reviving and fostering of abolished superstitions and errours, and to the overthrow of our Church Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline established by Acts of Parliament, opening a doore for what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther invention of Religion they please to make, and stopping the way which Law before did allow unto us for suppressing of errour and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition; And ordaining, That where in any of the Canons there is no penalty expresly set down, the punishment shall be arbitrary as the Bishop shall think fittest: All which Canons were never seen nor allowed in any Generall Assembly, but are imposed contrary to order of law, appointed in this Realm for establishing Constitutions Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall; unto which two books, the foresaid Prelates have under trust procured his Majesties Royall hand and Letters Patents, for pressing the same upon his loyall subjects, and are the Contrivers and Devisers of the same, as doth clearly appear by the Frontispice of the Book of Common Prayer, and have begun to urge the acceptance of the same, not onely by injunctions given in Provinciall Assemblies, but also by open Proclamation and charge of Horning, whereby we are driven in such straites as we must either by Processe of Excommunication and Horning suffer the ruine of our estates and fortunes, or else by breach of our Covenant with God, and forsaking the way of true Religion, fall under the wrath of God, which unto us is more grievous then death. VVherefore we being perswaded that these their proceedings are contrary to our gracious Soveraign hispious intention, who out of his zeale and Princely care of the preservation of true Religion established in this his ancient Kingdome, hath ratified the same in his Highnesse Parliament <hi>1633</hi>

in Doctrine, Sacraments, and Discipline, move discontent between the King and his subjects, and discord between subject and subject, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to severall Acts of Parliament: VVe out of bound duty to God, our King and native Countrey, complain of the foresaid Prelates, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly craving, that this matter may be put to tryall, and these our parties taken order with according to the lawes of the Realm; And that they be not suffered to sit any more as Judges, untill the cause be tryed and decided according to Justice. And if this shall seeme to bee to you a matter of higher importance then you will condescend unto, before his Majesty bee acquainted therewith, Then wee humbly supplicate that this our grievance and complaint may be fully represented to his Majestie, That from the influence of his Gracious Soveraigntie and Justice these wrongs may bee redressed, and wee have the happinesse to injoy the Religion, as it hath beene reformed in this Land.</p>

            <p>IN this Petition it is worthy the observing, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the mangling of the English Service Booke, and of the abuses offered unto it, and the wronging of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the blessed Reformers of Religion here in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereas in their Sermons and ordinarie discourse, they doe usually inveigh against the Service Booke here, for being stuffed with Superstition and Poperie, and that the first Reformers of this Church never departed fully from Rome: And in this last Petition they begin to make their grievances swell, adding their dislike of the Booke of Canons to their former distaste of the Service Book; the occasion of Our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorising of which Booke of Canons, was this.</p>
            <p>As Wee were desirous to settle one uniforme forme of publike Prayer and Divine Service throughout that Our Kingdom, and for that purpose authorized the Service Book, so We conceived that it was not only expedient, but necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that there should be one uniforme forme of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment throughout the same, and because there was no booke extant containing any rules of such governement, so that neither the Clergie nor Laity had any certaine rule either
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17348:25"/>
of the ones power, or of the others practise and obedience, and considering that the Acts of their generall Assemblies were but written, and not printed, and so large and volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, as it is impossible that so many copies of them should be transcribed, as that they may come to the use and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many, and so Apocryphall, as that few or none of themselves can tell which of them are authenticall, and so unsafely and uncertainely kept, that they do not know whither to addresse themselves for finding of them, Wee could not imagine but that it should have beene acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and received with all thankfulnesse, that We had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced their numerous Acts, and those not knowne to them, to such a paucitie of Canons, and those published, that none could be insnared through ignorance, nor complaine that they were over-charged with the multiplicitie of them: For it may be averred with unquestionable certaintie, that not one in that Our Kingdome did either live under the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Acts of the generall Assemblies, or did know what they were, or where certainely to have them: And yet these men have interpreted Our furthering their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and facilitating and conveniencing their obedience for one of the most grievous burthens was ever laid upon them: But no wonder it is, if when mens minds are once out of taste with government nothing tending to order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisheth well with them.</p>
            <p>Their petition was sent up to Us by Our Councell: But Wee seeing no signe of repentance for, or disavowing of their late tumults, untill some order might be taken for the finding out and punishment of the authors of them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to delay the answering of their petition, but in the meane time commanded Our Councell to signifie to all Our good subjects Our aversnesse from Poperie, and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of Superstition, the contrarie suggestions whereof We found the heads of this Rebellion had used for abusing of Our loyall subjects, and so accordingly Our Councell caused a Proclamation to be made at Lithgow, which was this.</p>

But since that time, his Majestie finding (farre contrarie to his expectation) that such disorderly, tumultuous and barbarous insolenceis have beene committed within the Citie of Edinburgh upon the eighteenth of October last, to the great contempt of his Majesties Royall authoritie, by abusing his Majesties Councellors and Officers of State, with others bearing charge and authoritie under his Majestie within the said Citie: His Majestie in a just resentment of that foule indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, (wherein his Majesties Honour did so much suffer) hath beene mooved to delay the signification of his Majesties gracious intention, in giving to his subjects such satisfactorie answers to their Petitions as in equitie might have been expected from so just and religious a Prince; But yet his Majestie being unwilling that his Loyall and faithfull subjects should be possessed with ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and uncessarie doubts and feares, His Majestie is pleased out of his goodnesse to declare, like as by these presents hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, That as he abhorreth all Superstition of Poperie, so he will be most carefull that nothing be allowed within his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Dominions, but that which shall tend to the advancement of the true Religion, as it is presently professed within his most ancient Kingdome of Scotland: And that nothing is or was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be done therein against the laudable lawes of this his Majesties native Kingdome.

            <p>AT this time We sent into Scotland the Earle of Roxburgh Lord privie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seale, with certaine instructions to Our Councell for ordering these disordered affaires; according to which they appointed the Councell to sit at Dalkeith,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17348:26"/>
being not above foure miles from Edinburgh, that so they might the more easily know what passed in that place, now become the seat of the Rebellion; and they removed the Session or Terme from Lithgow to Sterlin, a place of 24. miles distance from Edinburgh, that so the huge disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly multitudes there assembled, might be dispersed, by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of the attendance of such as had any Law-businesse: At the same time the Earle of Traquair Lord Treasurer of that Kingdome, whom Wee had sent for hither, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back with directions from Us: He, with Our Lord privie Seale &amp; other principall Councellers, repaired to Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, where by Our commandement they caused a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to be made for the dispersing of the huge and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous multitudes there assembled, and the assuring of Our subjects of Our sinceritie towards the Religion established in that Our Kingdom: And there first, the Nobilitie, Gentrie, Ministers, and Burgesses did the same thing which they themselves called the uproare of Rascalls at the first reading of the Service Book in the Churches of Edinburgh, and which they condemned, but in milder tearmes, by the name of an unjustifiable act, in that great sedition at Edinburgh on the eighteenth of October 1637: For by them, first at Sterlin, then at Lithgow, and last at Edinburgh, was made the first avowed affront to Us, Our authoritie and Lawes: For at Sterlin Our Proclamation being made, the Earle of Hume and the Lord Lindsey, assisted with many others of all ranks, made a Protestation against the same; which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation was afterward repeated at Lithgow, and last at Edinburgh, where, when upon the Crosse, Our Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made by Our Officers with sound of Trumpets, and assisted with Our Heralds with Our coats of Armes upon their backs, it was received, while it was in reading, with jeering and laughing, and after it was ended with a Protestation against it, made by many Earles, Lords, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and Burgesses, and the conflux of all other sorts of people, who were all of them so malapert as not to suffer Our Heralds and Officers to come off the Crosse, but forced them to stay and heare their Protestation against Our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, as if both had been made by the same authoritie:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17348:27"/>
And if this now were not a higher act of Rebellion then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the first tumult raised in the Churches, against which they so much declamed, or the second insurrection at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, which they so much disclamed, Wee leave it to the world to judge: The copies both of Our Proclamation and their Protestation We have here inserted, that themselves, as well as others, may see that We wrong not the truth.</p>

a great deale of patience, and hope also, grounded on sundry promises, were expecting an answere to these our humble desires, and having learned that upon some directions of His Majesties anent our supplications and complaint unto your Lordships of the Secret Councell, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships admits to the consulting and judging anent our supplications, and His Majesties answere thereunto, the Archbishops and Bishops our direct parties, contrarie to our Declinator first propounded at Dalkeith, and now renewed at Sterling; and <note n="*" place="margin">

Secondly, VVe protest that the said Archbishops and Bishops, our Parties complained upon, cannot be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or esteemed lawfull Judges to fit in any Judicatorie in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Civill or Ecclesiasticall, upon any of the supplicants, untill after lawfull tryall judicially they purge themselves of such crimes as we have already laid to their charge, offering to prove the same whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever His Sacred Majestie shall please to give us audience. Thirdly, VVe protest that no Act nor Proclamation to follow thereupon, past, or to be past in Councell or out of Councell, in presence of the Archbishops and Bishops, whom we have already declined to be our Judges, shall any wayes be prejudiciall to us the supplicants, our persons, estates, lawfull meetings, proceedings, or pursuits. Fourthly, VVe protest that neither we nor any whose heart the Lord moveth to joine with us in these our supplications against the foresaid Innovations, shall incurre any danger, in life, lands, or any Politicall or Ecclesiasticall paines, for not observing such Acts, Bookes, Canons, Rites, Judicatories, Proclamations, introduced without or against the Acts of Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, or Acts of Parliament, the Statutes of this Kingdome; But

Sixthly, we protest that these our requests, proceeding from conscience and a due respect to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties honour, doe tend to no other end, but to the preservation of the true reformed Religion, the lawes and liberties of this His Majesties most ancient Kingdome, and satisfaction of our most humble desires contained in our supplication and complaint, according to his Majesties accustomed goodnesse and justice, from which we doe certainely expect that His Sacred Majestie will provide and grant such remedie to our just petitions and complaints, as may be expected from so gracious a King toward most loyall and dutifull subjects, calling for redresse of so pressing grievances, and praying to God that his Majestie may long and prosperously reigne over us.</p>

            <p>AGainst which Protestation We shall now say nothing, because it is contained &amp; repeated in another larger Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of theirs, which shall be inserted hereafter, and there it shall receive a full answer: Onely We desire the Reader to observe these two things in it; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, the iniquitie and injustice of their demanding some of our Bishops to be removed from our Councell, nay, and (which We think never was heard before) their protesting against all Acts to be done and passed in our Councell at which any of them shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, alledging, that this their Protestation against them, and Declinator of them, maketh them to be parties, and so they cannot be Judges; and withall they require them first to be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17348:29"/>
removed, and then promise they will make proofe of such crimes against them as shall declare the justice of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall; which is all one as to intreat them first to condemn a man, and then to trie him: And if a Protestation against their sitting in Councell, and a Declinator of Our Councells authoritie (neither of them admitted by our Councell) shall make some Councellours to be parties, and invalidate all Acts of Councell so long as these Councellours whom they have fancied to be parties sit there; how their last pretended ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assembly, against which there were so many Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made both by the Bishops and others, and which by all these Protesters was declined as Judge, because the members of it had all made themselves parties, can be counted a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full generall Assembly, or the members of it lawfull Judges, We leave it to themselves to reconcile: And if they should say, that these Protestations and Declinators against the Assembly were repelled by the Assembly, who was the sole Judge of them, let them remember, that their Protestation against the Bishops, and their Declinator against Our Councels authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if they should not eject them, were both of them, likewise repelled and rejected by Our Councell, who was the onely true Judge of them, their last pretended Assembly being no true but onely a pretended Judge of the others, after the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly was dissolved by Our authoritie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And secondly, We shall desire the Reader to observe, that their demands in this Protestation are very farre short of those which are made by them in their succeeding Protestations, which swell with farre more bold and insolent demands then this doth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this be bold and insolent enough: But it is an usuall course with the heads of all Rebellions, to draw in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by whose power they intend to make good their wicked plots, with small things at the first, concealing from them the depth of their intentions, untill they have engaged them so farre, as they can make them beleeve that there is no safety in retreating, when their crimes are past hope of pardon.</p>
            <p>And now after this their first Protestation, begun the most unnaturall, causlesse, and horrible Rebellion that this or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps any other age in the world hath been acquainted with:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17348:30"/>
For now these Protesters begin to invest themselves with the supreme Ensignes and Markes of Majestie and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, by erecting publike Tables of advice and Councell, for ordering the affaires of the Kingdome, without Our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and in contempt of Us and Our Councell establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by Us there, and by entring into a Covenant and most wicked Band and combination against all that shall oppose them, not excepting Our owne Person, directly against the law of God, the law of Nations, and the municipall lawes of that Our Kingdome: So that after this their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, they perfected that which they had before begun confusedly, and as it were in a ruder draught: For then, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Our expresse commandement and authoritie expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Our last Proclamations, and repeated unto them by Our Councell, they did erect a great number of Tables (as they called them) in Edinburgh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Foure principall, One of the Nobilitie, another of the Gentrie, a third of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughes, a fourth of Ministers; and the Gentrie had manie subordinate Tables, according to their severall Shires: These severall Tables did consult of what they thought fit to bee propounded at the generall Table, which consisteth of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Commissioners chosen from the other foure Tables; and what they of the generall Table resolved on, was to be put in practice with a blinde and Jesuiticall obedience: A rare and unheard forme of Government in a Kingdome whose Government ever was Monarchicall, and which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves still say continueth to be so: Sure these meetings by wise men have been accounted rather Stables of unruly hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, broken loose and pulling downe all they can reach, then Tables for the consultations of wise and rationall men. Now the first dung which from these Stables was throwne upon the face of Authoritie and Government, was that lewd Covenant, and seditious Band annexed unto it, which We here subjoine, because We are confident that by the verie recitall and perusall of it, every religious and wise man may run and read that sentence of condemnation which it carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in its owne front.</p>

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee All, and every one of us underwritten, Protest, That, after long and due examination of our owne Consciences, in matters of true and false Religion, are now throughly resolved of the Truth, by the Word and Spirit of God, and therefore we beleeve with our hearts, confesse with our mouths, subscribe with our hands, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly affirme before God and the whole World; that this only is the true Christian Faith and Religion, pleasing God, and bringing Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to man, which now is by the mercy of God revealed to the world, by the preaching of the blessed Evangel.</p>
                        <p>And received, beleeved, and defended, by many and sundry notable Kirks and Realmes, but chiefly by the <hi>Kirk of Scotland, the Kings Majestie, and three Estates of this Realm,</hi> as Gods eternall Truth, and onely ground of our Salvation: as more particularly is expressed in the Confession of our Faith, stablished, and publikely confirmed by sundry Acts of Parliaments, and now of a long time hath been openly professed by the Kings Majestie, and whole body of this Realme, both in Burgh and Land. To the which Confession and forme of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wee willingly agree in our consciences in all points, as unto Gods undoubted Truth and Verity, grounded onely upon his written Word. And therefore, Wee abhorre and detest all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Religion, and Doctrine: But chiefly, all kinde of Papistrie, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17348:32"/>
and particular heads, even as they are now damned and confuted by the <hi>Word of God, and Kirk of Scotland:</hi> but in speciall we detest and refuse the usurped authoritie of that Roman Antichrist, upon the Scriptures of God, upon the Kirk, the civill Magistrate, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men. All his tyrannous lawes made upon indifferent things against our Christian libertie. His erroneous Doctrine, against the sufficiencie of the written VVord, the perfection of the Law, the office of Christ and his blessed Evangel. His corrupted Doctrine concerning originall sinne, our naturall inabilitie and rebellion to Gods Law, our justification by faith onely, our imperfect sanctification and obedience to the Law, the nature, number, and use of the holy Sacraments. His five bastard Sacraments, with all his Rites, Ceremonies, and false Doctrine, added to the ministration of the true Sacraments without the VVord of God. His cruell judgement against Infants, departing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sacrament: his absolute necessitie of Baptisme: his blasphemous opinion of Transubstantiation, or reall presence of Christs body in the Elements, and receiving of the same by the wicked, or bodies of men. His dispensations with solemn oaths, perjuries, and degrees of Marriage for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the VVord: his crueltie against the innocent divorced: his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellish Masse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his blasphemous Priesthood: his profane Sacrifice for the sins of the dead and the quick: his Canonization of men, calling upon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or Saints departed, worshipping of Imagerie, Relicks, and Crosses, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating of Kirks, Altars, Daies, Vowes to creatures; his Purgatorie, praiers for the dead, praying or speaking in a strange language, with his Processions and blasphemous Letanie, and multitude of Advocates or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators: his manifold Orders, Auricular Confession: his desperate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine repentance; his generall and doubtsome faith; his satisfactions of men for their sins: his justification by works, <hi>opus operatum,</hi> works of supererogation, Merits, Pardons, Peregrinations, and Stations: his holy VVater, baptising of Bels, conjuring of Spirits, crossing, saning, anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, conjuring, hallowing of Gods good creatures, with the superstitious opinion joined therewith: his worldly Monarchy, and wicked Hierarchie: his three solemne vowes, with all his shavelings of sundry sorts, his erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and bloudie decrees made at <hi>Trent,</hi> with all the subscribers and approvers of that cruell and bloudie Band, conjured against the Kirk of God: and finally, we detest all his vain Allegories, Rites, Signs, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, brought in the Kirk, without or against the VVord of God, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17348:32"/>
Doctrine of this true reformed Kirk; to the which we joyne our selves willingly, in Doctrine, Faith, Religion, Discipline, and use of the Holy Sacraments, as lively members of the same, in Christ our Head: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising, and swearing by the <hi>Great Name of the Lord our GOD,</hi> that we shall continue in the obedience of the Doctrine and Discipline of this Kirk, and shall defend the same according to our vocation and power, all the dayes of our lives, under the paines contained in the Law, and danger both of body and soule in the day of Gods fearfull Judgement: and seeing that many are stirred up by Satan and that Romane Antichrist to promise, sweare, subscribe, and for a time use the Holy Sacraments in the Kirk deceitfully, against their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, minding thereby, first, under the externall cloake of Religion, to corrupt and subvert secretly Gods true Religion within the Kirk, and afterward, when time may serve, to become open enemies and persecuters of the same, under vaine hope of the Popes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, devised against the Word of God, to his greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and their double condemnation in the day of the <hi>LORD JESUS.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We therefore, willing to take away all suspition of hypocrisie, and of such double dealing with God and his Kirk, Protest, and call <hi>The Searcher of all hearts</hi> for witnesse, that our minds and hearts do fully agree with this our <hi>Confession, Promise, Oath</hi> and <hi>Subscription;</hi> so that we are not moved for any worldly respect, but are perswaded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Consciences through the knowledge and love of Gods true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, printed in our hearts by the holy Spirit, as we shall answer to Him in the day when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed. And because we perceive that the quietnesse and stability of our Religion and Kirk doth depend upon the safety and good behaviour of the Kings Majestie, as upon a comfortable instrument of Gods mercy granted to this Countrey for the maintaining of His Kirk, and ministration of Justice amongst us, wee protest and promise with our hearts under the same Oath, Hand-writ, and paines, that wee shall defend His Person and Authority, with our goods, bodies, and lives, in the defence of Christ his Evangel, Liberties of our Countrey, ministration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and punishment of iniquity, against all enemies within this Realme, or without, as we desire our God to be a strong and mercifull Defender to us in the day of our death, and comming of our Lord <hi>Jesus

Band to bee made and subscribed by his Majesties subjects of all ranks, for two causes: One was, for defending the true Religion, as it was then reformed, and is expressed in the Confession of Faith above written, and a former large Confession established by sundrie acts of lawfull Generall Assemblies, and of Parlament, unto which it hath relation, set downe in publicke Cathechismes, and which had beene for many yeeres with a blessing from heaven, preached, and professed in this Kirk and Kingdome, as Gods undoubted truth, grounded onely upon his written Word: The other cause was, for maintaining the Kings Majestie his Person and Estate; the true Worship of God, and the Kings authoritie being so straightly joyned, as that they had the same friends and common enemies, and did stand and fall together. And finally, being convinced in our minds, and confessing with our mouthes, that the present and succeeding generations in this Land, are bound to keep the foresaid nationall Oath and subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inviolable, We Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen Burgesses, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and Commons under subscribing, considering divers times before, and especially at this time, the danger of the true reformed Religion, of the Kings honour, and of the publicke peace of the Kingdome, by the manifold innovations and evils generally contained and particularly mentioned in our late supplications, complaints, and protestations, doe hereby professe, and before God, his Angels, and the World solemnely declare, That, with our whole hearts wee agree and resolve all the daies of our life constantly to adhere unto, and to defend the foresaid true Religion, and forbearing the practice of all novations, already introduced in the matters of the worship of God, or approbation of the corruptions of the publick Government of the Kirk, or civill places and power of Kirkmen, till they bee tryed and allowed in free Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and in Parlaments, to labour by all meanes lawfull to recover the purity and libertie of the Gospel, as it was established and professed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foresaid novations: And because, after due examination, wee plainly perceive, and undoubtedly beleeve, that the Innovations and evils contained in our Supplications, Complaints, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations have no warrant of the Word of God, are contrary to the Articles of the foresaid Confessions, to the intention and meaning of the blessed Reformers of Religion in this Land, to the above written Acts of Parlament, and doe sensibly tend to the re-establishing of the Popish Religion and tyranny, and to the subversion and ruine of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17348:35"/>
true Reformed Religion, and of our Liberties, Lawes, and Estates. VVe also declare, that the foresaid Confessions are to bee interpreted and ought to be understood of the foresaid novations and evils, no lesse then if everie one of them had beene expressed in the foresaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions; and that wee are obliged to detest and abhorre them, amongst other particular heads of Papistrie abjured therein. And therefore from the knowledge and conscience of our dutie to God, to our King and Countrey, without any worldly respect or inducement, so farre as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmitie will suffer, wishing a further measure of the grace of God for this effect, VVe promise and sweare, by the <hi>Great Name of the Lord our GOD,</hi> to continue in the Profession and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the foresaid Religion: That we shall defend the same, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist all these contrarie errours and corruptions, according to our vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to the uttermost of that power that God hath put in our hands, all the dayes of our life: And in like manner, with the same heart, we declare before God and Men, That we have no intention nor desire to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing that may turne to the dishonour of God, or to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the Kings Greatnesse and Authoritie: But on the contrarie, we promise and sweare, that wee shall, to the uttermost of our power, with our meanes and lives, stand to the defence of our dread Soveraign, the Kings Majestie, his Person and Authoritie, in the defence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the foresaid true Religion, Liberties and Lawes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; As also to the mutuall defence and assistance, everie one of us of another in the same cause of maintaining the true Religion, and his Majesties Authoritie, with our best counsell, our bodies, meanes, and whole power, against all sorts of persons whatsoever. So that, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall be done to the least of us for that cause, shall be taken as done to us all in generall, and to everie one of us in particular. And that we shall neither directly nor indirectly suffer our selves to be divided or withdrawn by whatsoever suggestion, combination, allurement, or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, from this blessed and loyall Conjunction, nor shall cast in any let, or impediment that may stay or hinder any such resolution, as by common consent shall be found to conduce for so good ends. But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, shall by all lawfull meanes labour to further and promove the same: and if any such dangerous and divisive motion be made to us by VVord or VVrit, wee, and everie one of us, shall either suppresse it, or, if need be, shall incontinent make the same known, that it may bee timously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17348:36"/>
neither do we feare the foule aspersions of rebellion, combination, or what else our adversaries from their craft and malice would put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, seeing what we do is so well warranted, and ariseth from an unfained desire to maintaine the true worship of God, the Majestie of our King, and the peace of the Kingdome, for the common happinesse of our selves, and the posteritie. And because we cannot look for a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from God upon our proceedings, except with our Profession and Subscription we joyne such a life and conversation, as beseemeth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who have renewed their Covenant with God; VVee, therefore faithfully promise, for our selves, our followers, and all others under us, both in publike, in our particular families and personall carriage, to endevour to keep our selves within the bounds of Christian libertie, and to be good examples to others of all Godlinesse, Sobernesse, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and of everie dutie we owe to God and Man. And that this our Union and Conjunction may bee observed without violation, VVee call the living God, the Searcher of our Hearts, to witnesse, who knoweth this to be our sincere Desire, and unfained Resolution, as we shall answer to JESUS CHRIST in the great day, and under the paine of Gods everlasting wrath, and of infamie, and of losse of all honour and respect in this World: Most humblie beseeching the LORD, to strengthen us by his holy Spirit for this end, and to blesse our desires and proceedings with a happie successe, that Religion and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse may flourish in the Land, to the glorie of God, the honour of our King, and peace and comfort of us all.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, by what authoritie they entered into this Covenant, and how they durst presume to exact an Oath from any of Our subjects to it, or any thing else; it being an irrefragable proposition, That no publike Oath can bee administred but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17348:36"/>
by a Magistrate, or by one sufficiently deputed by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to administer it: For it is a badge annexed to Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and Authoritie, to have power of giving and taking an oath; and therefore they cannot satisfie the world by what Authoritie or deputation from Authoritie they did give this oath to, and receive it from Our subjects. They do answer, that though they have no Law for it, yet they have Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; For this Confession of Faith (say they in the title of their Covenant) <hi>was subscribed by Our Father of happie memorie, and his houshold, in the year</hi> 1580. <hi>thereafter by persons of all ranks in the yeare</hi> 1581. <hi>and that by the ordinance of the Lords of the Secret Councel, and Acts of the Generall Assemblie: Subs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed againe, by all sorts of persons in the yeare</hi> 1590. <hi>by a new ordinance of Councell at the desire of the Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, with a generall band for maintenance of true Religion and the Kings person.</hi> Now, was this their Confession of Faith, and Covenant annexed, commanded to bee sworne and subscribed by Us, by any order from Our Councell, or by any Act of Generall Assembly? But they will say, that it being once commanded, that commandement is still in force and vigour. That is indeed a good ground or presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for Us and Our Councell, to command this same oath to be renewed when We shall see cause; but the repetition of it must still be by the same Authoritie by which it was at the first injoyned: Now, the first injunction of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription was made by Our Royall Father, in the yeare 1580. the first renewing of it in 1581. was (as they say themselves) by an ordinance of the Lords of the Secret Councell; the second renewing of it 1590. was by a new ordinance of Councell at the desire of the Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie. By which it is plaine, that the judgement of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assemblie, (which in those daies was at the highest, and was not wont to derogate from their owne power) was, that this oath could not be renewed, nor any band, but by authoritie from Our Royall Father and His Councell. Againe, have they not printed in the frontispice of this their Covenant Our Royall Father his charge to certain Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, and all Ministers within that Realme, for requiring this oath, <hi>with a command to returne to the Ministers of his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17348:37"/>
house, the names and processes of all such as should refuse to take the said oath.</hi> Now, did any of all these precede their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? Was Our authoritie, or the authoritie of Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell so much as asked, much lesse obtained? Were there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Commissioners by Us, or Our Councell appointed to receive this oath in the severall Shires? Nay, as shall appeare afterward in due place, when We, with the advice of Our Councell, by Proclamation did command the renewing of that oath, and designed Commissioners throughout the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Shires of the Kingdome for administring of it, did not those, who call themselves of the Table, refuse to sweare it themselves, and command that none of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome should sweare it by any authoritie from Us? And is not this pulling down of Our authoritie, and setting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Our place? So that if the Reader look upon the title and inscription of their Covenant, he shall finde (as Wee said) that it carrieth the overthrow of it in its owne front.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, say they had power to command the new taking of this oath, (as they had not,) yet what power can be pretended for their interpretation of it? It being a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Maxime, That no lesse authoritie can interpret a Law or Rescript, then that which made it, or those, whom they who made it have constituted Judges to give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and sentence according to the true meaning of it. This oath then being first framed and urged by our Royall Father, with the advice of his Councell, can it be interpreted by any but by Us, and His and Our successours? And have either We or Our Councell given any such interpretation? Nay, can any man, though in authoritie, indued with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or reason, with any conscience or honestie, give not onely so false, but so ridiculous and absurd an interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Confession of faith, as those of the Table have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? For they have declared, <hi>That this Confession is to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, and ought to be understood of all the pretended No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, no lesse then if everie one of them had beene expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the said Confession.</hi> Had they said that they themselves did prohibite these pretended novations, as other points of Poperie in that confession abjured, the words had then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17348:37"/>
some sense, as intimating that they themselves did now think that they did tend to Poperie: But that they should force any man to sweare that the framers of that Confession at the first did so, they being all dead, &amp; so never were asked, nor can bee asked the question; or that they should make men living sweare what was the minde of the dead, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the five Articles of Pearth, the Service Book, the Book of Canons, the high Commission, things of which in their lives they never heard, nor perhaps did ever imagine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of them, (they in that Confession abjuring onely those Romish corruptions, which in their time had infest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church,) is such a profane and foolish interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that one would wonder how any one that either hath the knowledge, or maketh conscience of an oath, can either himselfe take, or desire others to take an oath so false and foolish as this: And therefore, with more wit then honestie, where they met with no scrupulous people, they suffered them to swallow down that wicked glosse which corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the verie text of the Confession: But where multitudes, especially of the Ministers, (who at their admissions had sworn obedience to, and practise of these points which they call innovations,) quarrelled at this their interpretation, they assured them, that it would breed a great division if they should desire but the least alteration of the words in which their Covenant was conceived, but yet that they might verie well sweare all, with a reservation of not abjuring Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, the five Articles of Pearth, or any thing established by Acts of Parliament and Generall Assemblie: With which Protestation and reservation, and not otherwise, many, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Ministers, did sweare their Covenant, as they themselves do well know: which was such a notable peece of Jesuiticall equivocation on their parts, who exacted this oath, and contrarie to the verie letter and grammaticall sense of the oath it selfe, especially in that part of it which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their interpretation of the Confession, as the like hath scarcely beene heard.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, where was it ever heard that men, pretending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:17348:38"/>
for a ground of their proceedings, the president of a former Confession and band annexed, did dare to adde any thing to the text of that Confession and band upon which they meant to build their actions? But these men have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, not onely without authoritie to make an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that Confession, but flatly against Authoritie, to adde to the verie text of the band of maintenance: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the band annexed to the former Confession was made <hi>in defence of Us, Our Authoritie and Person, with their fortunes, bodies and lives, in defence of the Gospel of Christ, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that Our Kingdome, &amp;c.</hi> they have added a mutuall defence of one another; So that the band, which was at the first made against those subjects who went about to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond with forreiners for the subversion of Our Religion and Kingdome, is now made against all persons whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who shall oppose them in their courses. That band which was made in defence of Our person and authoritie, against all treason at home and invasion from abroad, is now principally made against Us, if We shall oppose their courses; and next, against all such of Our loyall subjects as shall adhere to Us in defence of Our person and authoritie: For these words, <hi>against all persons whatsoever,</hi> not excepting Us, shewes their bad meaning too well. Now, whether Our Royall Father in the first band, by defence of His person and authoritie, meant maintenance against Us His successor, Our person and authoritie (for they urge the intention of the first Confession and band as a warrant for this new one of theirs,) or whether the words of the Emperour, or any Monarch, or any other Law-giver, in any of their Lawes or Rescripts, can bee taken in any tolerable construction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Crowne and Dignitie of themselves and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors; Or how these new Covenanters can with the same breath blow both hot and cold, with the same hand both strike and stroake Us, in one sentence swearing to defend Our person and authoritie, and yet in the next swearing to defend one another against all persons whatsoever, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Us, if not principally intending Us, We leave it to the world to consider.</p>

Now Our consent to their Covenant was not onely never granted, but never so much as once asked.</p>
            <p>When they have satisfied these important questions and considerations, which are obvious to all men who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Lawes and Government, then let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke themselves how they will answer, not onely to all Divines abroad who are not Jesuited, but even to their own Universities at home in that Our Kingdome, in the case of conscience, how any Oath, much lesse such an unlawfull Oath as this, can be administred to any Prince his subjects, without his consent or authoritie. There are but two Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities in Scotland which conferre all Degrees, S. <hi>Andrewes</hi> and <hi>Aberdene</hi>; both these, upon the first comming abroad of this their Covenant and Oath, did oppose it, and severally set forth, sent abroad and dispersed in writing, those excellent and unanswerable Reasons against it, which Wee have seene and have, but which the Covenanters did never answer.

There is likewise an Universitie in Glascow, which because it hath but one Colledge, and hath not of late conferred any Degree above that of Master of Arts, is called the Colledge of Glascow.

backward to come into their Covenant, untill they were extremely threatned; and when they came in, they premit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such interpretations and limitations, as were destructive of the verie foundation of it; some of the Regents never came in at all. In the Colledge of Edinburgh, where there are but foure Regents, how two of them, for not subscribing their Covenant, were expelled from their places, is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously knowne.

            <p>But leaving the many unanswerable reasons which may be brought against this their Covenant, Wee shall desire the Reader to observe three things, which appeared at the verie first comming out of it: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, how in it they swelled farre above all that ever was complained of, either in their tumults or petitions: In their tumults they complained onely of the Service Booke; in their petition exhibited to Our Councell and sent up to Us, they complained of the Service Booke and Booke of Canons; more of their grievances then, Wee knew not: Now in this their Covenant, besides these two, they complaine of, and doe abjure, as they make their adherents beleeve, the five Articles of Pearth, which were established by Acts, first of the generall Assembly, and then of Parliament; Then they complaine of the high Commission, which ever since the yeare 1609. hath beene quietly established and in practise amongst them; Then they complaine of Prelats sitting in civill Judicatories; a thing which Wee cannot chuse but wonder at, not only in regard of Our Selfe, whom by this meanes they would robbe of the benefit of the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of any of Our subjects in Our counsels and affaires of State, as if holy Orders did superinduce a dissabilitie for civill Wisedome and Prudence; but especially in regard of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, because by this strange conceit they contradict, more then they are aware of, their owne false and prodigious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: for what incongruitie can they finde in it, for a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

to sit at Our Councell Table, where many causes are heard, in which Religion is concerned; or in Our Session, where many Church-men have trialls for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? when they themselves hold it not onely convenient, but necessarie, and that even <hi>jure divino,</hi> that Noblemen, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Merchants, Taylors, Sadlers, Shoomakers, and others of most mechanicall Trades, shall sit and give sentence in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall Sessions and in Presbyteries, in Causes Ecclesiasticall, and those of the highest nature, even the last and supremest censures of the Church, Excommunication, and depriving of Ministers; nay, that they shall give sentence in the generall Assembly (a Judicatorie which now they hold to be above Our Session, Councell, or Parliament; for they maintaine that the Acts of that Assembly may, in many cases, disannull and derogate from the Acts of the other three) where they doe assume to themselves to determine all questions <hi>de Fide, Cultu &amp; Disciplina,</hi> of Faith, Worship or Discipline, and in which of late they did assume to themselves power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and, according to their weake and poore power, did determine controversies concerning Predestination, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Grace, irresistibilitie of Grace, concurrence of Free-will with Grace, totall or finall falling from Grace, and other such like intricate points, as some men would be loath to live so long untill they could make them understand them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Wee desire the Reader to observe with what affections this their Covenant was received abroad, both by Protestants and Papists, at the very first publishing of it: By Papists it was received with infinite joy, as hoping that now the time was come in which both Wee and Our Successors might be brought to abhorre and detest that Religion, whose professed Zelots had beene the authours of such an unsuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Covenant, which could not consist with Monarchie; which appeared to Us most evidently by the advertisements which then were sent up to Us from some of Our Councell of that Kingdome, that the sudden and frequent arrivall of Priests and Jesuites from Doway and other Seminaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, was so great, in hope of their welcome to Us
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17348:40"/>
because of this seditious Covenant, that unlesse some speedie order were taken for their present discouragement and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backe, the evill might quickly passe remedie; which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Us, notwithstanding these present broiles, to take present order for such proceedings against them, as they were forced to retire. With Protestants abroad, it was received with most offensive scandall and infinite griefe; which appeared unto Us by advertisements from some of Our publique Ministers abroad, who certified Us, that both the Ministers and others of their Consistorie at Charenton, and of other Reformed Churches in France, as also the Professors, Ministers, and Consistorie of Geneva, and of other neighbouring Reformed Churches in those parts, were so scandalized with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Covenant, as that they were afraid of nothing more then this, that it would bring an indeleble scandall upon the Reformed Churches, and alienate the mindes of all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Christendome from ever entertaining a good thought of their Religion. Of what condition then and fearfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence that Covenant is, which bringeth griefe and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to Our friends, joy and triumph to Our enemies, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all eyes that are opened.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, We desire the Reader to consider with what fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and madnesse this Covenant, after it was conceived, was obtruded to all sorts of people: with what threatnings, with what beating, tearing of the clothes, drawing of the bloud, and exposing to thousands of injuries and reproaches, at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh, Saint Andrews, Glascow, Lanarick, and many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more, of those Ministers, who out of religious consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God, and loyall carriage towards Us, did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disswade their Parishioners from entring into it, or could not by their intreaties or threatnings be perswaded to enter into it themselves. No doubt it cannot be a Covenant approved by God, the first bitter and accursed fruits whereof were the many drops of bloud drawne from many of Gods Ministers, which now no doubt doe call for Gods vengeance upon the whole land.</p>
            <p>Now, the fire of this seditious Covenant flaming tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17348:41"/>
all the corners of the Kingdome, and that to such an unexpected height and violence, as it was past both the skill and power of Our Councell to quench it, Our Councell resolved to send up unto Us Sir <hi>John Hammilton</hi> Our Justice Clerke, one of Our Privie Councell, and one of the Lords of Our Session, that he might fully acquaint Us with the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this Rebellion, and the consequences of it. After Our hearing of him many times, and many consultations had with such of Our Councell of Scotland as were then here present, and such of Our Councell here in England as We thought fit to communicate this businesse unto, We resolved to send unto that Our Kingdome the Marquesse of Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun with the full power of an High Commissioner, as in other cases Our Royall Father and We had many times done in important businesse concerning that Kingdome; and in the meane time, we dispatched home the said Sir <hi>John Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> to give notice thereof, both that they might carrie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves quietly untill Our Commissioner his comming, from whom they were to expect Our pleasure, with all favour which might consist with Royall authoritie, as also that they might before Our Commissioners going from hence, have time to make Us fully acquainted with the uttermost of their grievances, that so accordingly Our Commissioner might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Instructions from Us for giving unto them all just sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>And so We, having here taken into Our serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all their Petitions, which We might have justly rejected, because of the insolencie of their demeanour, and their tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous way of presenting them to Our Councell, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to take the mildest course We could for calming of these commotions, and therefore We settled upon a way usually practised by Our Royall Father in that Kingdome since his comming to the Crowne of England, <hi>viz.</hi> to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish an High Commissioner, with full power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to conclude and determine all such things as should be found for the good, quietnesse, and peace of that Kingdome, with as full and ample power as other Commissioners had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17348:41"/>
exercised in any time of Our Royall Father, and especially at Parliaments. And considering that none, in the consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which We held for this businesse, had ever shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe more forward and inclinable to advices and counsels of peace, nor a more zealous Patriot towards his native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, then Our right trustie and well-beloved Cousin and Councellour of both Kingdomes, <hi>James</hi> Marquesse of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltoun, &amp;c. Gentleman of Our Bedchamber, and Master of Our Horse; We made choice of him for Our High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, to that purpose, being perswaded both of his loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie and fidelitie towards Us, as also of the great acceptation of his person with Our subjects there, in regard of his birth and place, but especially of his singular care of, and love to his countrey, which they themselves did know he had so piously and affectionately expressed in all his consultations and counsels here with Us: Him therefore We dispatched from hence with full Instructions, according to which he was to receive his Commission under Our great Seale of that Kingdome at his comming thither, which he received and presented to the Lords of Our Councell, frequently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled at Dalkeith, the sixt of June following; the true te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of which Commission here followeth.

On which day the whole body of Our Councell, with all respectfull and dutifull expressions of joy and thankfulnesse of Our fatherly care of that Our Kingdome in these difficult times, acknowledged and received Our said Commission and Commissioner: And Our said Cousen and Councellor, the Lord Marquesse of Hamiltoun, did with all submissive reverence then and there accept the said Commission, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising the uttermost of his endevours for settling the peace of that Kingdome, so farre as might consist with Our royall Crowne and Dignity, and the Lawes and Liberties of that Our ancient and native Kingdome, as by the Act of Councell
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17348:42"/>
dated at Dalkeith the sixt of June 1638. doth more fully appeare: After which acceptation of our Commission, the said Lord Marquesse had by Our Councell, and all others, whensoever he went abroad, all respects, honour and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to Our Commissioner, performed unto him, Our Chancellor carrying Our great Seale before him, and some other Noblemen of great place and qualitie carrying Our High Commission before him likewise.</p>
            <p>We having now taken this course which We conceived most agreeable both to the customes of that Kingdom, and most acceptable to them, in regard of the choyce of Our Commissioner, had then assured hopes, that the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous distractions of that Kingdome might be happily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed: But these hopes were quickly blasted; for no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had the heads of the Covenant notice of these peaceable courses intended by Us, but they flew out, even before our Commissioners arriving there, into farre greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence then heretofore, increased the frequent meetings of their Tables, subdivided them into severall Committees, increased their provision of Armes, made their Pulpits ring with most seditious Sermons, putting the people in feare, that now there was more danger to be expected from the Lord Marquesse his comming home, and all peaceable treaties, then ever; and at their Tables concluded upon a paper, consisting of ten Propositions or Articles, which they caused immediately before our Commissioners arrivall, with wonderfull expedition, to bee dispersed throughout all the Shires of that Kingdome: which ten Articles, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true copie, We have caused to be here inserted.</p>

their owne Acts, whose direction we crave: And although the Law were interpreted as they alleadge, which is altogether untrue, and contrarie to the grounds and meaning of the Law, yet the bodie of the Kingdome, for whose good the Law was made, may crave the lawfull redresse of the grievances sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by that Law, and our complaints, supplications, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations against the Bishops, depending in processe for clearing the subjects loyaltie, and repairing the wrong complained of, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee otherwise lawfully decided, cannot remedie the present evils, nor prevent the like or worse evils in time comming.</p>

            <p>OUr Commissioner upon his way to that Kingdom, did meet with advertisements of these strange fears, which the ringleaders of the Covenant (who were affraid of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then that our subjects should receive satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from Us by Our Commissioner) had possessed Our people with, &amp; the bad entertainment he was like to receive at his comming thither, acquainted Us therewith, but went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on his journy until he came to Barwick, from whence he sent to his especiall friends and kindred, and to all such Gentlemen of his owne name, and others, as were his Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals and Tenants, and hold their lands from him by service
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17348:44"/>
and attendance on him when he shall require it, hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved answer that all these Obligations were quite dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Covenanters Table at Edinburgh, who had absolutely commanded that none, who had subscribed their Covenant, should go to meet, or give any personall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon Our Commissioner, untill such time as they should have leave from their Table so to do; and so Our Commissioner went from Barwick unattended by these Noblemen, or by any other of his owne kindred or vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, unlesse such as had not subscribed their Covenant, (except some few, whose affection exceeded the command of the Tables); an affront before that time never offered to any person of his qualitie in that Kingdome: Yet hee was verie nobly and honourably received, and conducted to Dalkeith by all Our Councell, most of the Lords of the Session, who are the Judges of the Law, great troups of the Nobilitie and Gentrie, who had not subscribed their Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now, the reasons why their Table had laid this strict charge, of not conducting Our Commissioner, upon all their adherents, were these two, as appeared plainely by the speeches uttered by many of the Covenanters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that they might not seeme to shew the least respect to any, especially to those of greater rank, who were disaffected to their Covenant, as was ordered in the third Article of their ten last mentioned: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that they might make triall of their power with their owne partie, the heads of the Covenant being perswaded, that if they could prevaile with their associates for breaking through the bonds of nature, bloud, consanguinitie, civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, vassalledge and dependance, in pursuance of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they should not much need to feare that any other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations could be able to divert them from obedience to their dictats.</p>
            <p>Our Commissioner, immediately upon his comming to Dalkeith, (where the Councell assembled for safetie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the combustions at Edinburgh increased daily) met with many discouragements and difficulties. First, We had sent some small proportion of Armes, and powder
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17348:44"/>
to be put into Our Castle of Edinburgh, justly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the surprisall of it by the Covenanters, who were there assembled in great multitudes, and had of late made great provision of Armes there. No sooner had the ship (in which these Armes with other goods were) cast Anchor in Leith rode, but the Covenanters sent for the Merchant owner of the goods, commanding him to bring the ship into the Harbour, and discharging him from unloading any thing in the ship, especially Armes, untill hee had leave from them, as hee would answer the contrarie at his perill; of which Our Lord Treasurer being advertised, provided that night a Boat which landed the Armes and powder, and Carts which presently carried them to Our Palace at Dalkeith, some foure miles distant: How for this the Merchant was used by them, and how they did threaten to come by force and carrie away that provision out of Our own house of Dalkeith, is notoriously known. Much about this time Our Commissioner came to Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith, where he was received for his first welcome with the certaine newes of the increase of the peoples rage in Edinburgh, of the Covenanters resolution first to take the Castle, but (upon better advice) of their deserting that purpose, yet falling upon that which was bad enough; for they had begirt the Castle with strong guards, so that no person nor provision could passe to or from it, but by their permission: Besides, they had entred into consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether they should by force take out of Our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Dalkeith that small provision of Armes and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which was lately carried thither: which counsell they were perswaded by some not to follow, because of the residence of Our Commissioner there at that time; but one thing they resolved upon, that during the abode of Our Commissioner and Councell there, though but foure miles distant from Edinburgh, they would take no notice of them, send no Petition to them: and howsoever they allowed some of Our Commissioners particular kinsmen and acquaintance to go thither and visit him, yet they would not depute any to speak with him of the businesse for which hee was sent, or of their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17348:45"/>
complaints and grievances, but resolved not to leave E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh, where they were well enough, so that if hee had any thing to deliver to them, hee might come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for to him and Our Councell they would not come: And that they might have some colourable pretence with the people for this their insolent behaviour and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was cast out and rumoured abroad, that if they went to Dalkeith, there was an intention to blow them up with Gun-powder; not that the Authors of that foule and divelish aspersion entertained the least thought of any such feare, but that they might both have a colour for their unmannerly not addressing themselves thither, as also beget in the minds of their ignorant followers a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er indignation against, and jealousie of Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner and Councell for such a wicked and treacherous plot.</p>
            <p>Now, at this verie time when they made all this stirre about that small provision of Armes for Our Castle, which exceeded not two hundred Muskets, and so many Pikes, with some small quantitie of Powder, the Covenanters had two good Ships come home loaded with Armes and Amunition, which they landed openly and avowedly.</p>
            <p>All these difficulties and new troubles, augmented daily of purpose since their notice of Our Commissioners journey, put him and Our Councell to such a stand, as they knew not well what resolution to take. The Covenanters force and rage increased, which they had not power in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to discharge; they could not discover in them the least inclination to peace; they found they would not so much as addresse themselves towards them, and they did not hold it agreeable with Our honour, or the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of those places which they held under Us, nor yet for their safetie, to go to them; At last this meanes was thought on, no doubt by the advice of those of their Table, who scorned to seeme to yeeld or petition for any such thing themselves.</p>
            <p>The Citizens of Edinburgh sent certain Commissioners to Our High Commissioner with a supplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he would bee pleased to repaire to Our Palace at Haly-rud-house,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17348:45"/>
where they might more conveniently give demonstration of their affection to his Majesties service, in attending his Graces directions. Our Commissioner after he had acquainted and advised Our Councell with this their supplication, by their advice, as willing to take any occasion to enter into the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for which Wee sent him, returned this answer to the Commissioners of Edinburgh, That if they would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to be Masters and Governours of their owne citie, that their citizens would behave themselves as good and dutifull subjects, and take order that the multitudes, now present in their citie, who called themselves Covenanters, should do so too, and that the Guards about Our castle of Edinburgh should be dismissed and discharged, he would within a day or two repaire to Our Palace at Haly-rud-house, otherwise not: For that hee did hold it not agreeable to Our honour, that he Our Commissioner and Councell should reside at Our said palace, which is scituated at the one end of the citie, when Our castle seated at the other end of the same should be blocked up with guards: All which, these Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners undertooke to performe, and by their words desired to approve themselves most loyall subjects, hoping to cleare themselves from many aspersions laid upon them, when his Grace would be pleased to heare and examine their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
            <p>Hereupon Our High Commissioner, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, did remove himselfe from Dalkeith to Our palace at Haly-rud-house, attended by all Our Councell, such of Our Nobilitie, Gentrie, and others, as were affected to Our service, which consisted of a great number: Some two or three miles from Edinburgh he was met with the whole bodie of the Nobilitie and Gentrie of Covenanters, then resident at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, who were all mounted on horse-back, and consisted of divers thousands; and besides, in a nearer distance from Edinburgh, by the Ministers then resident there, who were all on foot, and consisted of manie hundreds; and so all the way to Our palace was filled with swarmes of people of all sorts and sexes, many of whose exclamations and outcries
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17348:46"/>
were very sharpe and bitter, stuffed with cursings of Poperie and Bishops; by which it was apparent that the multitude had been made beleeve that these two were one and the same thing. Our Commissioner when he first met on the way the Lords who call themselves Covenanters, was entreated by them to heare a speech delivered, as he should passe along, by a Minister in the name of the rest: But he, remembring the advertisements which he had received of their most sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Sermons, and knowing by the same advertisements that he who was to deliver this speech was a deprived Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and one of the most seditious in the whole packe, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned answer to the Lords that he would not heare it, justly doubting that it might be stuffed as full of passages against Our authoritie as their Sermons used to be; and so that speech was omitted: Now, whether these great troups of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, both of horse and foot, in a great bodie by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which did not joine at the first with that companie which attended Our Commissioner from Dalkeith, but stayed for him on the way in a farre grosser bodie by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, was assembled to doe honour to Our Commissioner, or for shewing their owne power and strength, by way of comparison with the companie whom they met, which they farre exceeded, Wee will not determine. But thus Our Commissioner was conducted to Our Palace of Holy-rood-house, where he was received by the Lord Provost, Bailiffes, Magistrates and citizens of Edinburgh with outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of being welcome. And this was all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment which at any time he had from the body of the Covenanters, during the time of his abode in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; which whether it were hearty and sincere, or but onely in show, and to shew their owne power, Wee leave it to be judged by the entertainment and respect which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he received from them; which will be found to bee just none at all: For during the time of his continuance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, though he found that they gave civill respects to him as Marquesse of Hamiltoun, yet his being cloathed with Our authoritie and commission did much diminish
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17348:46"/>
them, as shall appeare now in the next place, by those perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall affronts which they ceased not to offer daily to him and Our Councell, in all their proceedings concerning the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse for which he was sent.</p>
            <p>Our Commissioner now being settled at Our palace, with the assistance of Our Councell, hee fell presently upon the maine businesse with the Covenanters, whom hee desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to dismisse their great multitudes; which they did, being indeed necessitated thereunto for the ease of their great charge. The two maine Propositions which hee offered to their consideration, were these: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, what they should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him in Our name for satisfaction to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and accommodating their grievances: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next, what might be expected from them for returning to their former o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, especially in renouncing and delivering up their late Covenant. Both which propositions they did receive with so much sleighting and contempt, as that they avowed, no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from Us should be accepted which contained any particulars; but that they expected, first, a Generall Assembly of the Church, and then a Parliament, that in these two Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories they would represent and discusse their grievances: And no wonder, for in both these they knew that themselves were to be both Judges and parties. For the second, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that they could not returne to their former obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, from which they would never acknowledge that they had departed in the least degree, having done no act but that which became good and dutifull subjects: And for their Covenant, that they would rather renounce their Baptisme then renounce it, or abate one word or syllable of the literall rigour of it; it being more availeable and usefull unto them, then all the Lawes and Acts of Parliament which had beene enacted in that Kingdome since the time of <hi>Fergus</hi> the first King thereof: And that it was a proposition which though they had now heard, they were resolved never to heare a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time: And accordingly, after Our propositions thus made and rejected, they presently filled the people with such misreports of the intentions and ends of Our Commissioners
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17348:47"/>
comming, as they wrought them to a greater height of furie then before, as if now their Religion and Lawes were brought to the stake: For now new Guards were clapt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Our castle of Edinburgh, the Guards and Watches of the citie multiplied, the Preachers Prayers and Sermons grew to be so many Libells, and admonitions that they should take heed of craftie compositions, or yeelding in the least point of their intended reformation; for if they should abate in any one thing, it would be thought that they might be mistaken in all. They presently printed their weake Reasons against their rendring up of their Covenant, nay, they grew to that rage, that on the Saturday having knowledge that Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner (attended with Our Councell) was to heare divine Service and Sermon in Our owne chappell at Our owne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace the day following being Sunday, they sent him word that whosoever should read the English Service in Our chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell should never read more, and that there were a thousand men provided for the disturbance of it; which forced Our Commissioner that night to repaire to Dalkeith, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to heare Sermon but in Our owne chappell, or there, without hearing the English Divine Service, it having beene continually read there by the space of twentie yeares, in the audience of Our Councell, manie of the Nobilitie, Judges, and persons of all qualitie, without any interruption or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: Nay more, they grew to that boldnesse as to write let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to everie one of Our Councell, requiring them to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe their Covenant; which Letter sent to everie one of them severally, but in the same words, here followeth.</p>

for the maintenance of the Religion professed in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Our aversnesse from Poperie, which they of the Covenanters Table having notice of, being above all things afraid that Our people should receive any satisfaction from Us, or rest contented with the grace of Our reasonable prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of favour, did mightily repine at, came to Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner, and wished him for Our honour, his owne safetie, and peace of the publike, not to make any such Declaration, which undoubtedly would be encountred with a Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that in such manner as would be displeasing to him, and make the publishing of that Declaration be found dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviceable unto Us.</p>
            <p>Our Commissioner being perplexed with these unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and dangerous difficulties, resolved by faire proceedings to gaine so much time, untill he might make Us acquainted with them, and receive Our answer and instructions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them: In his Letters of advice he acquainted Us with the danger threatned if he should publish Our Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which though he knew to be full of grace, yet the heads of the Covenant would never suffer the multitude of their members to understand it so: Two things he desired of Us; One, that in case Wee continued in Our resolution of publishing Our Declaration, Wee would be pleased to swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it with this further favour, as to restore to the citie of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh the sitting of Our Councell, Our Session, and all other Courts of Justice, which he conceived would be very acceptable to Our Councellors, Judges, to all Advocates, and all dependents upon the Law, to all Our subjects which had businesse depending in any of these Courts, but most of all to the citie of Edinburgh, which complained much of their being impoverished by absence of these Courts, and that this was like to prove a most probable perswasion for reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them to their former obedience: Next, that We would be pleased to give him leave to take a journy unto Us, though he should returne presently, that he might acquaint Us with the new emergencies of businesses, and such other things as could not be conveniently expressed in Letters, and so accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly

receive instructions from Us for his carriage.</p>
            <p>To which Letters of advice Wee did returne by a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die dispatch this answer; That We would have Our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration no longer delayed, but commanded him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to publish it, because Wee would not (whatsoever the event should be) have Our people barred the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Our Gracious intentions and favours towards them, which We did see the leaders of them studied nothing more then to suppresse; And that at his intreatie, Wee were contented that all the Courts of Justice should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently begin to sit againe at Edinburgh for the reasons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his Letters, and in hope of reclaiming of that Citie, which otherwise by their misdemeanour had no reason to expect any such favour from Us; And withall, after the dispatch of these two, that Wee were contented hee should repaire to Us, as hee desired, whensoever hee should finde it convenient, taking first order with Our Councell for keeping all things in order untill his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>

who interpreted every satisfaction of Our subjects recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Us, to be a dividing and pulling them away from themselves: And therefore they quickly cast about to finde out some meanes, how this Our speciall favour might not be resented by them, which was this: They assured their followers that there were two of the Lords of Our Session, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Spotswood</hi> President of the same, and Sir <hi>John Hay</hi> Our Clerk of Register (answerable to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Rolles here in England) sworne enemies to their Covenant, well affected to Episcopall government, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers and abettors of the pretended Innovations, that unlesse these two were presently removed from Our Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, there could be no good intended to them by the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it back to Edinburgh, and therefore advised them to send some of their number to Our Commissioner to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that these two Our Judges might presently bee remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from that Court; Not that they who put this in their heads, thought that Our Commissioner could yeeld to a request of so high injustice, but because they knew, that hee neither could nor would yeeld unto it, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his deniall they should have meanes to irritate Our people, even to a disgust of that Our Gracious favour, which the day before they had so well relished.</p>
            <p>But yet according to their resolution, some of the principall Covenanters of all sorts sent from their Table, had the boldnesse to repaire to Our Commissioner, and to demand of him that which they were sure no just nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man could grant, <hi>viz.</hi> That they could clearely prove briberie and corruptions frequently to have beene used by these Our two Judges, and therefore intreated him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them presently from their places of Judicatorie, after which they would intend processe, and so legally proceed in the probation of these crimes objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: To which their demand Our Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner returned this just and modest answer, That sure they could not expect that he either could or should condescend to this their desire, which yeelded unto, did overthrow the verie foundation and maine rule of Justice, <hi>viz.</hi> That any man should be punished for any crime before he were
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17348:50"/>
legally convicted of it, and therefore he advised them to follow the constant course of justice, which was this; If they thought these Judges clearely convincible of these horrible crimes, they should intend first processe against them, and then probation of the crimes; of which if they were found guiltie, then they needed not doubt but they should be removed from their places, and receive such fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condigne punishment as the Lawes of the Kingdome had provided for such notorious criminals; assuring them, that We his Master would bee so farre from hindring the course of Justice against any such offenders, as that Wee would hold it a speciall service done to Us, to bring the iniquitie of Our Judges to publike triall and censure, and that he would make Us acquainted with their demands: with which just answer they were resolved to be so unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that they replied unto him, that this his deniall would be attended with a great inconvenience to all Our subjects, for they would in that case of deniall make and publish a Protestation, that whatsoever Act, Decree, or Order, the Lords of Our Session should make in any cause at which these two Judges, or either of them, were present and gave voice, should be null and void in Law; and that none of Our subjects either should bee bound or would yeeld obedience to them: (Was not this a strange usurpation upon Regall power?) To this Our Commissioner only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That everie such Protestation must be made before the Lords of the Session, who had the power of admitting or repelling it, and therefore for that point hee remitted them to these Lords as the competent Judges of it; which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of Our Commissioner they presently laboured to have misconstrued by their partie, telling them that there was no hope of any Justice to be had against any man who was an enemie to them and their Covenant.</p>
            <p>At the day appointed by the Proclamation, the Session sate down, and Our Commissioner in his owne person went to the place, and opened it, with a short speech to the Judges, to this purpose.</p>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17348:50"/>
moved Us thereunto, was the sense of the many incommodities which Our subjects in generall, and the Judges in particular did sustaine by the removing of it; That We had required him to desire and command the Judges to grant all reasonable dispatch to Our subjects in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Justice, that so some time which was lost might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained; That in Our name he required them to be very carefull and circumspect, that in these troublesome times no Order nor Decree might passe from them, which might be prejudiciall to Our Crown or service.</p>

            <p>Our Judges hereupon returned to Our Commissioner their humble and heartie expressions of all thankfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, for this Our singular favour and grace to themselves and all Our subjects, and with great submission intreated him to returne unto Us their humble and heartie acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>And here now We desire the Reader to observe, that the Covenanters neither made any such Protestation against the sitting of the two Judges, as they talked of, nor did ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any processe or probation against them for the crimes objected, though Our Commissioner immediately after his returne from Us, assured them, that We not onely had given them leave, but would thanke them for so doing; which We are confident they would have done if they had conceived these Judges guiltie, and giveth to Us good assurance that this calumnie against these Judges, was onely cast in by some of their ring-leaders, to marre and interrupt that resentment of Our grace and favour, which they perceived wrought verie much upon many of Our subjects of their partie, for bringing backe again Our Courts of Justice to Our citie of Edinburgh.</p>
            <p>The Session thus setled, Our Commissioner resolved to publish by Proclamation the Declaration of Our grace and favour: The principall Covenanters, when they could not disswade him from it, presently went about, and both by themselves and their seditious Preachers, filled their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers mindes with such fearefull expectations of it, that some dayes before it was published<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they filled the streets with multitudes of people, especially neare the Crosse where it
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17348:51"/>
was to be proclaimed, and those in hostile equipage divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into rankes, pulling their swords out of their belts, and with pistolls, being armes prohibited by Our lawes of that Kingdome, giving out, that if this Our Declaration were hearkened unto, it would bring undoubted ruine to their Religion, lawes and liberties, though the people knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what was to be delivered in Our Declaration: Some daies they continued in this posture, which made Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner delay the publishing of it, untill he might heare of more quietnesse and peace in the streets; of which being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised, he caused the Proclamation of Our grace and favour solemnely to be made at the Crosse of Edinburgh: No soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were the trumpets sounded, but there came to the Crosse a mightie confluxe of people, the Covenanters had presently a scaffold erected, on which they mounted with a Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion readie written in their hands, before Our Proclamation was pronounced: Our Proclamation was thus.<q>

Forsameikle as We are not ignorant of the great disorders, which have happened of late within this Our ancient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Scotland, occasioned, as is pretended, upon the introduction of the Service Book, Book of Canons, and High Commission, thereby fearing innovation of Religion and Laws. For satisfaction of which fears, We well hoped, that the two Proclamations of the eleventh of December, and nineteenth of February, had been abundantly sufficient: Neverthelesse, finding that disorders have daily so increased, that a powerfull rather then perswasive way, might have been justly expected from Us; Yet We out of Our innative indulgence to Our people, grieving to see them run themselves so headlong into ruine, are graciously pleased to try, if by a faire way We can reclaime them from their faults, rather then to let them perish in the same. And therefore once for all We have thought fit to declare, and hereby to assure all Our good people, that We neither
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17348:51"/>
were, are, nor by the Grace of God ever shall bee stained with Popish superstition: But by the contrary, are resolved to maintain the true Protestant Christian Religion already profest within this Our ancient Kingdome. And for farther clearing of scruples, We do hereby assure all men, that We will neither now nor hereafter presse the practice of the foresaid Canons and Service Book, nor any thing of that nature, but in such a faire and legall way, as shall satisfie all Our loving subjects, that We neither intend innovation in Religion or Lawes. And to this effect have given order to discharge all Acts of Councel made thereanent. And for the high Commission, We shall so rectifie it with the help of advice of Our privie Councel, that it shall never impugne the Lawes, nor bee a just grievance to Our loyall subjects. And what is farder fitting to be agitate in generall Assemblies and Parliament, for the good and peace of the Kirk, and peaceable government of the same, in establishing of the Religion presently profest, shall likewise be taken into Our Royall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, in a free Assembly and Parliament, which shall be indicted and called with Our best conveniencie. And We hereby take God to witnesse, that Our true meaning and intention is, not to admit of any innovations either in Religion or Laws, but carefully to maintain the purity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion already profest and established, and no wayes to suffer Our Lawes to be infringed. And although We cannot be ignorant, that there may be some dis-affected persons who will strive to possesse the hearts of Our good subjects, that this Our gracious declaration is not to be regarded; Yet We do expect that the behaviour of all Our good and loyall subjects will be such, as may give testimonie of their obedience, and how sensible they are of Our grace and favour, that thus passeth over their misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours, and by their future carriage make appeare, that it was only feare of innovation, that hath caused the disorders which have happened of late within this Our ancient Kingdome. And are confident, that they will not suffer themselves to be seduced and mis-led, to misconstrue Us or Our actions, but rest heartily satisfied with Our pious and reall intentions, for maintenance of the true Religion and Lawes of this Kingdome. Wherefore We require and heartily wish all Our good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple carefully to advert to these dangerous suggestions, and not to permit themselves, blindely under pretext of Religion, to be led in disobedience, and draw on infinitely, to Our grief, their own ruine, which We have, and still shall strive to save them from, so long as We see not royall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie

                        <p>WEe Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons, That whereas wee the Kings Majesties true and loyall Subjects, who have ever esteemed it our greatest happinesse to live under a religious and righteous King, and our greatest glory to testifie our best affections to our gracious Soveraign, have beene in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties absence from this His native Kingdome heavily pressed for a long time past, And especially of late, with diverse innovations, which both in themselves, and in the way wherein they have beene urged, doe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly tend to the prejudice of the Kings honour, and of our Religion, Laws and Liberties, And by which we were brought to such extremitie, that there was no way left betwixt the rock of excommunication, and the high paine of rebellion on the one part, and the desperate danger of forsaking the way of true Religion and the breach of our Covenant
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17348:52"/>
with God on the other, but to represent our case, and present our sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the Lords of secret Councell, that being equally pondered by them, they might either be answered by themselves, or by their recommendation might ascend to his Majesties owne consideration: And therefore in all humble manner we did to this effect supplicate their Lordsh: we were most willing (for the modest following of our sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications) to obey their direction in choosing Commissioners for the great number of supplicants, who flocked together from all quarters of the Kingdome; were carefull to order our selves in all Christian and quiet carriage, and against the tediousnesse of many and long delaies did wait for a long time with very great patience, till at last they were pleased to receive our supplications, complaints and bills: And conceiving them to containe weightier matters then could by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bee determined, they did promise and undertake to represent and recommend the same, according to their more then ordinary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, unto his Majesties Royall consideration, and to report his Majesties answer.</p>
                        <p>While his Majesties good Subjects of all ranks, throughout the whole Kingdome, had their minds wakened, and their hearts filled with the expectation of a gracious and satisfactorie answer, worthy of his Majesties pious and equitable disposition, in the Month of <hi>February</hi> last, incontinent a rumour flyeth through the Countrie, and filleth all eares, That the Lords of his Majesties secret Councell were commanded to make such a Proclamation concerning the Service booke, booke of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and the peaceable meetings of his Majesties good Subjects in time comming, as we were perswaded to have beene procured by the secret working, and malignant mis-information of our adversaries, Seeking for their owne private ends, without respect to his Majesties honour, and welfare of this Kirk and Kingdome, to stop the course of our legall proceedings, and to escape their owne due censure: And therefore intending to make known to the Lords of secret Councell what was noised concerning the Proclamation; how far the whole Kingdome had been by some sinistrous mis-information frustrate of their hopes, and their constant desire to have some course taken by their Lordsh: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; how his Majestie being further informed, might deliver his good subjects from so great grievances and feares, and establish a sure peace in this Countrie for time to come; we found our selves tyed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17348:53"/>
by order of Law to decline those against whom we had made our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, unlesse we would admit our parties to be our Judges: And in case our Declinator should not be accepted, we behoved to protest, that we might have immediate recourse to the King himselfe, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter in the Moneth of <hi>March,</hi> finding that by the foresaid Proclamation the innovations supplicated against were approven, our lawfull proceedings condemned, our most necessary meetings prohibited, there being no other way left unto us, wee were necessitate to renew the nationall Covenant of this Kirk and Kingdome, thereby to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to God, provoked to wrath against us, by the breach of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant within this Land, to cleare our Soveraigns mind from all jealousies and suspicions, arising from our adversaries mis-information of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and carriage; and so to make way for his acceptance of our humble supplications, and grant of their lawfull remedies, to guard this Land in defence of Religion, authoritie and liberty against inward divisions, and externall violences. And that our actions might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to our holy profession, we afterward drew up an humble suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, containing our grievances, and desires of the ordinary remedies thereof, to have beene delivered to the King himselfe: In the meane time wee were directed by those, who were intrusted by his Majesty, to attend his Declaration here in Scotland, which would free us of all feares of innovations of Religion, and prove satisfactorie: And lest for want of true information of our just grievances and desires it should fall out otherwise, wee expressed to them, with the greatest modestie wee could, our desires in some few Articles, and with great patience have attended his Majesties pleasure thereanent: And all this Moneth by-gone being frequently conveened to heare the same delivered by his Majesties Commissioner the right Noble and potent Lord <hi>James</hi> Marquesse of Hamiltoun, &amp;c. we presented a new peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Grace as his Majesties Commissioner, craving most humbly the indiction of a free Assembly and Parliament, as the onely remedies thereof: Like as finding a mis-information, or mistake of our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, as if it had beene an unlawfull combination to bee the maine hinderance of obtaining our desires, in a new supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wee have fully removed that impediment, renewed our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of those supreme judicatories, to bee indicted with diligence, for settling of the Kirke and Kingdome: But being answered only

with delayes after these nine Moneths attendance, and with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation that conteined his Majesties gracious declaration of his pious intentions, not to admit of any innovations in Religion or Law, nor any staine of Popish superstition, But on the contrary to be resolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the true Christian Religion professed in this Kingdome; which we were ever so far from calling in question, as in our supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, complaints, and bills we used the same as one cause of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, one ground of our confidence of a gracious answer, and argument of our adversaries malignant mis-information of so religious a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And now most humbly (with bended knees and bowed hearts) thanke our gracious Soveraigne for the same, Wishing and praying the Lord of heaven, truly and fully to informe his Majestie how far these bookes, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories, and all our other evils and grievances are full of idolatrous superstitions, and Popish errours, How destructive of the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion in this Land, and of the Lawes and Liberties of this Church and Kingdome, and so directly contrary to this his Majesties pious intention and Declaration.</p>
                        <p>Yet seeing that no Proclamation could sufficiently remove the present evils, nor settle our feares, nor secure us from the re-entrie of any evill or Innovation, which it seemed to discharge or prevent the like in time comming, nor satisfie our humble supplications, craving the present indiction of a free Assembly and Parliament, as the only remedies of our evils, and meanes to prevent the like: And seeing this Proclamation doth not so much as make mention, or acknowledge any of our supplications, complaints and grievances, or any just cause thereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept under the name of great increase of disorders, faults, and mis-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours, but only our feares of some future Innovation of Religion or Lawes, occasioned onely (as is pretended) by the introduction of the Service booke, booke of Canons, and High Commission; which feares his Majestie hoped to have beene abundantly and sufficiently satisfied by his two former Proclamations of the ninth of <hi>December,</hi> and ninteenth of <hi>February.</hi> And by this his present Declaration, except his subjects bee blindly (under pretext of Religion) led unto disobedience, Doth mis-ken, passe over, and so in effect denie all our supplications, bills, articles, and desires, especially our complaints against the Prelats our parties. <hi>And,</hi> that <hi>once for all,</hi> in a faire and perswasive way, even after the resaite of our last supplication,

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17348:54"/>
powerfull rather then a perswasive way, a running headlong into ruine, a perishing in our faults, a blind disobedience under pretext of Religion, and doth threaten &amp; denounce, <hi>Now once for all,</hi> If we be not hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied, and give testimony of our obedience after this Declaration, but continue, as by our former proceedings, to draw on our owne ruine, that, albeit unwillingly, he must make use of that power which God hath indued him with, for reclaiming of so disobedient people.</p>
                        <p>THerefore we, in our own name, and in name of all who will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Confession of Faith, and reformation of Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Land, are forced and compelled, out of our bound duty to God, our King, native Country, our selves and our posterity.

            <p>NOw We must appeale to the judgement of the world, whether there was any thing in this Our Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which deserved such an undutifull and rebellious Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, or the seditious clamours, which both at their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publicke meetings, especially in their Pulpits, were made against it.</p>
            <p>This Protestation needeth no answere; for after the first part of it, which is nothing but a repetition of that which they have so often said, there is nothing but a number of falsities heaped up together, as the Reader may easily perceive: For whereas they alledge, <hi>That they have removed the impediment which caused their Covenant to be mistaken, as if it had beene an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull combination</hi>; We suppose that thereby they meane that which they tendered to Our Commissioner, and called it by the name of an explication of their Covenant; which expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was so farre from giving unto Us any satisfaction, that both to Us and all reasonable men it must needs appeare to be a stronger confirmation of their unlawfull combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For whereas they refused to except Us out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those persons against whom their band of mutuall maintenance is intended, it plainely demonstrateth, that in their intentions We are the person chiefly aimed at. In some few lines after this, they professe that they never so much as called in question Our resolution to maintaine the Religion professed in that kingdome, and Our care for not admitting
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17348:56"/>
any Innovations in Religion, or any staine of Popish super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition: Now We doe appeale even to their owne conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether in their private meetings, nay even in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like assemblies and Sermons, they have not endevoured to settle in Our good subjects mindes opinions, feares, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, quite contrarie to these their printed asseverations. In the last part they ground their Protestation upon no grounds but such as these: That they will continue together, because they have obliged themselves by oath so to doe, and because they will and are resolved to adhere constantly to what they have done, and because they offer to cleare themselves before a generall Assembly and Parliament, where they themselves make accompt to be Judges. Now these and such like false and weake grounds it is very unnecessarie to confute, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsall of them being upon the first view, their sufficient conviction. After all these, they end their Protestation with two very unsavourie conclusions: The first is, that if We will not allow of their proceedings, <hi>they themselves will call a Generall Assembly,</hi> which shall be sure to allow of them. A notable piece of hypocrisie and disloyaltie together, to be sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Us for that which they (as they say) both may doe and are resolved to doe without Our leave: The second is, they protest, that, notwithstanding any thing which We doe or shall say to the contrarie, <hi>all their proceedings are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves most necessarie, and orderly meanes, agreeable to the Laws and practise of that Church and Kingdome, to be commended as reall duties of faithfull Christians, loyall subjects, and sensible members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of that Church and Kingdome, and no way to be styled or accounted great disorders, misdemeanours, blinde disobedience, under pretext of Religion, and running headlong into ruine:</hi> All which words are multiplied, onely to make up a verie unmannerly contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the verie words of Our Proclamation.</p>
            <p>Our Commissioner seeing, not that he was not able to give, but that they were resolute not to receive any satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by what was offered, and that the most that they could be brought to, was that which they called an explication of their Covenant, but indeed was none; for they would never
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17348:57"/>
yeeld that these words, whereby in their Covenant they bound themselves in a mutuall defence against all persons whatsoever, should admit this interpretation (<hi>Except the King</hi>:) He told them plainly, that since his Instructions were out, he could proceed no further with them without new conference with, and Instructions from Us; and therefore he resolved a speedie journey to Us, to informe Us of what had passed, and make Us acquainted with that explication of their Covenant which they had given him, though as it had given no satisfaction to himselfe, so he was sure it would give none to Us: In the meane time, he entreated them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves more quietly and peaceably then they had done, untill Our pleasure were further knowne.</p>
            <p>That pretended explication of their Covenant was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by way of Petition, and was this.</p>

But on the contrary, we acknowledging our quietnesse, stability and happinesse to depend upon the safety of the Kings Majestie, as upon Gods Vicegerent set over us for maintenance of Religion, and ministration of Justice, have solemnly sworne, not onely our mutuall concurrence and assistance for the cause of Religion, but also to the uttermost of our power, with our meanes and lives, to stand to the defence of our dread Soveraigne the Kings Majestie, His Person and Authority, in the preservation and defence of the true Religion, Liberties and Lawes of the Kingdome.

               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:17348:58"/>NOw, doth this Petition deserve the name of an explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Covenant? much lesse of such an explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as should give either Us or Our Commissioner any satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? No, for it containeth neither more nor lesse then this, that they doe not meane to shake off their obedience, if We will give way to all their courses, which by this Petition they justifie; so that their meaning is, that they will continue obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient subjects, if We will part from Our Soveraigntie; which is in effect, that they will obey if Wee will suffer them to command. But where it was expected that to these words of their Covenant, whereby they binde themselves to mutuall maintenance, <hi>against all persons whatsoever,</hi> should have beene added, <hi>except the King and his successors,</hi> that was refused, though even that could have given no satisfaction, unlesse We should give way to that which divers Acts of Parliament have made sedition, and punishable with death.</p>
            <p>Upon notice given by Our Commissioner of his intended departure, the debatements at their Table grew very hot and fierie upon this point, Whether they should presently indict a Generall Assembly, and fall upon the violent courses intended by them, or that they should grant some short time for his journey, his stay with Us, his returne to them againe, with Our finall answer and last resolution; and in the meane time promise that they would behave themselves quietly and peaceably, and continue all things <hi>in statu quo</hi> untill his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. This last was agreed unto, though not without much contrarietie of voices, and so some of the principall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters came and acquainted him with this their resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was, That they would expect Our answer, and his returne upon the fifth of August next at the furthest; untill which time they would breake up their great meeting, containe themselves and the people in quietnesse and peace; but if by that day he did either not return, or not bring with him from Us such an answere as they expected, then they would hold themselves free, and goe on to prosecute the courses which they had resolved upon. And so Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17348:58"/>
begun his journey towards Us.</p>
            <p>After Our Commissioner had at Greenwich made Us ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with all their insolencies, We speedily dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him with new Instructions, and commanded him to returne, so that he might be backe in Scotland by the fifth of August, and gave him order for the indicting both of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assembly and a Parliament, but so, that he should first be fully satisfied, by all informations which he could conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently receive, of the constitution of a Generall Assembly, with which perhaps many were not acquainted, none ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beene kept for divers yeares: And therefore it did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire good deliberation, to agree both upon the members of the Assembly (not for their persons but for their qualitie) and of what things were usually treated and handled there.</p>
            <p>No sooner was he returned into Scotland, but he found all things in much worse case, and in a farre greater combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion then he left them: For he found that the heads of the faction (being affraid that he might bring backe with him some satisfactory accommodation, which Our subjects might like well, but they themselves resolved to reject) had in the time of his absence assured their followers, that they might compasse their ends by such means and upon such conditions as themselves desired: Nay, they proceeded so far, as to make the people beleeve what they knew to be most untrue, <hi>viz.</hi> That Our Commissioner was well satisfied with all their proceedings, and especially with their Covenant, in regard of the late explication they had made of it; and were so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent as to use that inducement for an argument, whereby they perswaded many of all sorts, especially of the Ministers, who had formerly stood out against their Covenant, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it, in this short time of his absence from them; And the three Ministers in their answers to the Queries of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of Aberdene, had the boldnesse to print, that Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner rested satisfied with their Covenant, according to their explication of it: With which their notorious calumnie he found himselfe so highly injured, in a point which so much concerned his loyaltie to Us, and the trust reposed in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17348:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him by Us, they he was enforced to call the Lords of Our Councell, divers others of Our Nobilitie, and some of the Lords Covenanters themselves, to give testimonie of his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent asseverations in their hearing, that as he himselfe was no way satisfied with that explication, so he was assured that We neither would nor could receive any satisfaction by it, only that he would present it to Us at their entreatie: And besides the attestation of so many witnesses, he was necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, both for clearing of himselfe to Us, and preventing the further encrease of Covenanters, upon that false and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse surmise, to print a Manifest and Declaration of his own clearnesse and their calumnie.</p>
            <p>It is true that they printed a weake answer to that Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, in which they confesse, that they never heard him say that he was satisfied with that Declaration, but that by some probable reasons (which are there expressed, and indeed are most improbable ones) they were induced to beleeve that he was satisfied with it, although that both to their new Proselytes, and in the Ministers printed answers, they had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively averred, that after he had received that explication he was fully satisfied with their Covenant: Which dealing of theirs gave occasion for many to thinke, that this false asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was put upon him, by those who ever laboured to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle all hopes of reconciliation, onely to raise in Us a distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full jealousie of his service, that so he might be called backe, and the people made beleeve that no relieving of their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances was intended by Us.</p>
            <p>About the same time a great stirre was raised in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome upon a very slender ground, which was this: There had been printed at Antwerpe in severall pieces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the pictures of the severall stories of the Gospels, and Acts of the Apostles, after the manner as they are usually printed in the Romish Church; some Papists, and it may be others, had caused these severall pieces to be bound in their Bibles, at the severall chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of those stories to which they did relate; they found such a Bible printed at Edinburgh, which being printed (as all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are) by Our priviledge, upon a sudden there were made
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17348:59"/>
most tragicall complaints, that pictures and images were brought into their Bibles by Our authoritie, aggravated by the heads of that faction, especially the Ministers, with the imminent dangers of the present introduction of Poperie, Superstition, &amp; Idolatrie, still to make the people averse from all hope of satisfaction; so that some did conceive, that these pictures might bee bound in that Bible by some of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, meerly to irritate the people, and continue them in their distance from returning to Our obedience: but so far with this particular we cannot charge them.</p>
            <p>Now, notwithstanding these new and daily emergent combustions, and their perpetuall working of the people, both in their Pulpits and at their other meetings, to new insolencies and greater heights of rage and furie, Our Commissioner resolved (as well as he could) to passe them over, and to enter into treatie with them for the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive overtures of a Generall Assemblie, because he did see that all these impediments and blocks were laid purposely in his way, that either hee might stumble at them, or bee so scared as to go back; for it was plainely perceived, that whensoever he made any proposition of peace, likely to take or please, they presently cast about how to dash it with some new violence and accident which should make it impossible, as did most evidently appeare in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>Our Commissioner sent some of Our Councell to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with some of the principall Covenanters, concerning some necessarie propositions fit to be resolved upon before the indicting of the Assemblie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both concerning the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of which it was to bee constituted, and concerning the matters to be treated of in it, (two consultations usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly previous to that meeting, for the omission whereof in one Assemblie of later times, they had so grievously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that in a Petition exhibited by the Ministers of their side, it was alleadged for a nullitie of that Assemblie:) This message was received with so much choler and contempt, that they presently blazed it abroad amongst their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for a proposition tending utterly to the ruine of the Lawes and liberties both of Church and Kingdome, that the hearkning to any such overtures was an absolute pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitation
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17348:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of that Assemblie, which they intended should be free and generall, that neither of the members of their Assemblie, nor of the matters to bee handled in it, they would speak so much as one word untill they came upon the place, and were in the Assemblie; that then and there the Assemblie it selfe was to be the sole judge both of the competencie of the members elected, of the regularitie of their election, and of all matters treated of there, whether they were of their cognisance and jurisdiction or not, and likewise gave out, that they did not much care whether Our Commissioner would indict an Assemblie or not: they would indeed like it better if it were indicted by Our authoritie, but if We, requested by them so to do, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it, they both could and would do it of themselves: Then did their Pulpits againe begin to ring with this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous proposition, as they called it, of the utter subversion of the liberties of their Church, by the prelimitation of their Assemblie, as if this conference propounded by Our Commissioner concerning the orderly proceedings in that meeting, had beene such a blow to their Church, as they could not feare a greater from Rome it selfe.</p>
            <p>And to make Our Commissioner beleeve that they were in good earnest, they had a little before caused the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie of Peebles to begin with the election for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners to the Generall Assemblie, being a place not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twentie miles distant from Edinburgh, so that they were sure it must speedily come to his knowledge: To this election all the Gentlemen within the compasse of that Presbyterie resorted, intruded themselves by violence, and in despite of the Ministers would give their voices to the chusing both of the Ministers and one lay-man to be Commissioners for that Presbyterie at the next Assemblie, whensoever, and wheresoever it should bee kept, when as yet no Assemblie was indicted.</p>
            <p>Our Commissioner weighing well these two things; First, that the principall Covenanters, Noblemen, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Ministers, as hee had occasion to speak with them severally, and upon severall occasions, had protested unto him, that their meaning never was quite to abolish Episcopall government, but onely to have it limited and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17348:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
restricted, according to the Lawes of that Church and Kingdome, and that they might bee accomptable to, and censurable by the Generall Assemblie, if they should trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse these limits; adding, that they had farre rather live under that government, then under the tyrannie of the Presbyeries, which they had heard their fathers so much complaine of, and had given them charge to beware of; the like Protestations they having likewise made to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Our Councell, and others: And secondly, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that he now found that they begun to speak more sparingly and reservedly in that point, and would not so much as treat of it before the Assemblie, and that some of them had given out, that they had resolved upon a way to throw off that grievous burthen of the Presbyteries, with the weight whereof their fathers were so much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>viz.</hi> by joyning so many Laick Elders to every Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie as there should be Ministers in it, by which meanes the Laitie should bee able to keep the Presbyterie under, without the help of Bishops. Our Commissioner was now once againe at a stand, not knowing how to proceed, as not being sufficiently warranted by Our instructions to indict a Generall Assemblie or Parliament, unlesse hee should first bee satisfied by advice of them who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the formes of Assemblies, what course was to bee held, both for the members of that Assemblie, and the manner of their election, and for a previous consultation of the principall things to be treated there; all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations the Covenanters did utterly reject: He therefore resolved once againe to make a journey to Us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint Us with these new occurrences, since hee found them daily increasing in their obstinacie, &amp; so changed, as he was not able to make any judgment, either of their reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, or desires, or of what would give them satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And therefore Our Commissioner told them plainely, that he had no authoritie from Us to indict an Assemblie, unlesse some particulars were agreed upon, both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the constitution of the Assemblie, the present settling the peace of the Kingdom, and the righting and restoring to their places such Ministers as had beene displaced without
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17348:61"/>
order of Law, who might againe be displaced, if at the Assemblie they were found to deserve it: The summe of Our demands he delivered to the chiefe Lords Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in these ten Articles, which will be found by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them to be verie just and reasonable.</p>

                        <head>Answers to the particulars propounded by his Majesties Commissioner.</head>
                        <p>HAving seriously considered with our selves, that nothing in this world is so precious, and ought to be so deare unto us as our Religion, that the diseases of the Church after long tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration did threaten no lesse then her utter ruine, and the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the truth of Religion at last, and that a free Generall Assemblie was the ordinarie remedie appointed by divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and blessed by divine providence in other Churches, and after a speciall manner in the Church of Scotland; wee have often, and earnestly supplicated for the same, and have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remove what was objected, or what wee could conceive to be any hinderance to the obtaining of our desire, like as we have now for the same good end resolved to returne this answer to the particulars propounded, to bee performed by us before any Assemblie be indicted.</p>
                        <p>The particulars propounded, are either concerning matters Ecclesiasticall, or Civill: Ecclesiasticall, or Church matters are, The first, concerning Ministers deposed or suspended by the Presbyteries, since the first of Februarie last, without warrant of the Ordinarie, that they bee restored to their owne places. The second, concerning Moderators of Presbyteries deposed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17348:62"/>
since the foresaid day, to bee restored, and all Moderators ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the said Presbyteries without warrant aforesaid, to desist from executing the office of Moderator. The third, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Ministers admitted since the foresaid day, that they desist from exercising the function of the Ministerie in that place, to which they have beene admitted. These three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars do concerne the power, dutie, and particular facts, or faults of Presbyteries, wherein we have no power to judge or determine, whether they have proceeded lawfully or not, farre lesse can we urge or command them to recall what they have determined or done, in the suspending, deposing, or admitting of Ministers, or Moderators; they being properly subject to the superior Assemblies of the Church; and in this case and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, to the Generall Assemblie, where, if they shall not after tryall justifie their proceedings, from the good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of Scripture, reason, and the acts and praclices of the Church, they ought to sustaine their owne deserved censure. And since on the one side, there be many complaints against the Prelats for their usurpation over Presbyteries in the like parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; and on the other side, there be such complaints of the doings and disorders of the Presbyteries, to the offence of the Prelats; we trust that his Majesties Commissioner will not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme this to be any hinderance of the indiction of a Generall Assemblie, but rather a powerfull and principall motive with speed to conveene the same, as the proper Judicatorie wherein to determine such dangerous and universall differences of the Church. Neither do wee heare that any Ministers are depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but onely suspended, during this Interim till a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assemblie, for their erroneous doctrine and flagitious life; So that it were most <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Is it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to God, to thrust men out of their places before they be tried?</hi>
                           </note> offensive to God, disgracefull to Religion, and scandalous to the people, to restore them to their places till they be tried, and censured. And concerning Moderators, none of them (as we understand) are deposed, but some onely changed, which is verie ordinarie in this Church. The fourth, concerning the repairing of Parishioners to their owne Church, and that Elders assist the Ministers in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline of the Church, ought to be cognosced and judged by the particular Presbyteries, to which the Parishioners and Elders are subject, since the cause may bee in the Ministers no lesse
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17348:62"/>
then in the Parishioners and Elders. And in case they finde no redresse there, to assent till they come to a Generall Assemblie, the want whereof maketh disorders to bee multiplied, both in Presbyteries and particular Parishes.</p>
                        <p>To the sixth, That ministers wait upon their owne Churches, and that none of them come to the Assemblie, or place where the same is kept, but such as shall bee chosen Commissioners from Presbyteries, we answer, That none are to come to the place of the Assemblie, <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>And yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, in their last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions they injoyned the severall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners to bring Assessors with them, who were to have no voyce in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie.</hi>
                           </note> but such as are either allowed by Commission to have voice, or otherwise have such interesse as they can justifie to his Majesties Commissioner, and the Assemblie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened.</p>
                        <p>To the seventh, Concerning the appointing of Moderators of Presbyteries to bee Commissioners to the Generall Assemblie, onely constant Moderators, who have ceased long since, were found in the Assemblie <hi>1606.</hi> (which yet was never reputed by the Church to be a lawfull nationall Assemblie) to be necessarie members of the Generall Assemblie. And if both the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who if they be necessarie members need not to bee chosen, and the chosen Commissioners repaire to the Assemblie, the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie it selfe can judge best of the members whereof it ought to consist.</p>
                        <p>To the ninth, That no lay-person whatsoever meddle with the choosing of Commissioners from the Presbyteries, and no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister without his owne Presbyterie, we say, That according to the order of our Church discipline, none but Ministers, and Elders of Churches ought to have voice in choosing Commissioners from Presbyteries, and that no Minister, or Elder should have voice in Election, but in his owne Presbyterie.</p>
                        <p>The rest of the particulars are concerning civill matters: As the fifth concerning the paying of Rents and Stipends to Ministers and Bishops, concerning which we can say no further, but that the lawes are patent for them, as for his Majesties other subjects, and that the General Assemblie ought not to be delaied upon any complaint in that kinde.</p>
                        <p>The eighth, requiring that Bishops, and Ministers be secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their persons, we think so reasonable, that wee will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise everie one of us for our own parts, they shall suffer no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from us, and that we shall hinder others so farre as wee
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17348:63"/>
may; And if any trouble them otherwise, or make them any kinde of molestation in that attendance but by order of Law, the parties are justly punishable according to the degree of their fault as other subjects are.</p>
                        <p>To the tenth, concerning the dissolving of all Convocations and meetings, and the peaceablenesse of the Countrie; These meetings being kept for no other end, but for consulting about lawfull remedies against such pressing grievances as threaten the desolation of this Church and State, cannot be dissolved till the evils be removed. And <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is most true.</hi>
                           </note> we trust, that nothing in these our meetings hath escaped us, which carrieth in it the smallest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of undutifulnesse, or which may seeme to tend to the breach of the common peace: But although our adversaries have herein calumniated us, yet we have alwayes so behaved our selves, as beseemed his Majesties most humble and loyall subjects, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning his Majestie for a legall redresse of our just grievances.</p>
                        <p>To the last, concerning the Covenant; the Commissioner his Grace having many times and most instantly pressed us with that point, we did first by <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard any argument to that purpose which could convince a child.</hi>
                           </note> invincible arguments make manifest, that wee could not, without sinning against God, and our owne consciences, and without doing wrong to this Nationall Church, and all posteritie, rescind or alter the same: And thereafter did at large cleare the same of all unlawfull combination against Authoritie, by our last Supplication and Declaration, which his Majesties Commissioner <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accepted of it, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it could give satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to any.</hi>
                           </note> accepted, as the most readie and powerfull of all other meanes, which could come within the compasse of our thought to give his Majestie satisfaction, The subscription of this our confession of Faith, and Covenant being an act so evidently tending to the<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>It doth most evidently tend to the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God.</hi>
                           </note> glorie of God, the Kings honour, and happinesse of the Kingdome: And having alreadie proved so comfortable to us in the inward of our hearts, It is our ardent and constant desire, and readie wish, that both his Majestie and all his good subjects may be partakers of the same comfort, Like as we finde our selves bound by conscience, and by the Covenant it selfe, to perswade all his Majesties good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to joyne with us for the good of Religion, his Majestes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the quietnesse of the Kingdome: which being modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used by us without pressing, or threatning of the meanest, we hope shall never give his Majestie the least cause of discontent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="121" facs="tcp:17348:63"/>Seeing therefore, according to our power and interesse, wee are most willing to remove all hinderances, that things may bee carried in a peaceable manner, worthy our Profession, and Covenant, doe aime at nothing but the good of the Kingdome, and preservation of the Church, which by consumption, or combustion, is like to be despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately diseased, except remedy some way bee speedily provided; And wee delight to use no other meanes, but such as are legall, and have beene ordinarie in this Church, since the Reformation: Wee are confident that without further delay, for preventing of greater evils and miseries then wee can expresse, our just desires shall be granted. So shall we be encouraged in the peace of our souls, still to pray for his Majestie, all encrease of true honour, and happinesse.</p>

            <p>UPon their refusall, he sent for some of the chiefe Lords Covenanters, and told them of his resolution for a new journey; that he found their wayes such as he could not goe along with them; that he had power to grant them a free Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assembly, but that he could not conceive that to be a free one, in which they should bring in everie man to have a voice whom they had a minde to: If they would let him know what manner of persons should sit there, and what they intended to doe there, he would give his best concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, if he found their intentions to be agreeable to the lawes and customes of that Church and Kingdome; if they reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted these motions, he knew nothing left for him, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back againe to Us, yet he desired them before his journey they would let him know what it was they would have, and that they would expresse what was the uttermost of that which they desired from Us, without which they would not rest satisfied; that with their desires he would make Us acquainted, and that within a few dayes he would either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to them himselfe with Our answer, or otherwise it should be speedily sent unto them.</p>
            <p>Their answer to Our Commissioner was, that they would make their Tables acquainted with his proposition, and he should shortly receive their answer: At their Tables it was much debated, whether he should have any further time allowed him for a new journey, and a speedie returne,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17348:64"/>
or if they should leave him to his owne choice and counsels, and they in the meane time to indict a Generall Assembly, and goe on with the prosecution of their intended resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: At last, not without contrarietie of suffrages in this also, it was by most voices concluded, that to give the people satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, they would yet forbeare the indicting of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly untill the 21. day of September, before which time, if he or some other did not returne with such answer as should content them, then they would hold themselves free to goe on with their designes: And for expressing their desires, or what satisfaction they expected from Us, they would not descend to particulars, onely they looked for a free Generall Assembly, and a Parliament, in which two great Courts their desires should be made knowne; And this being all the answer Our Commissioner could obtaine from them, he told them that he would report it to Us, and intended pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to begin his journey.</p>
            <p>No sooner were they parted from him, but they betooke themselves to their old courses, both of incensing the people, and dashing in Our Commissioner all hope of doing any good in this service: The first they did by scattering a report amongst their followers, that Our Commissioner neither had power from Us, nor any intention in himselfe to give them any satisfaction, but that he onely delayed time, untill all things might be in a ripenesse and readinesse for their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, an evident argument whereof was, that now he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken two journies thither, &amp; yet had never offered any thing, nor were they in better case then before he was sent unto them: A thing which they knew to be most untrue, both because in Our last Declaration We had granted them verie many things concerning their pretended grievances, which We had not granted before, being the same things which at first they onely desired; as likewise because Our Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner had now lately tendered them in writing ten propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon the yeelding to which he would presently indict an Assembly: But that was all one with them, for so they could perswade the people that nothing yet had been offered
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17348:64"/>
at all to content them, they cared not by what reports (true or false) that perswasion were wrought in them: Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, to assure the people that he intended really, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured their content, if possibly it might be effected upon any reasonable termes, contracted his former propositions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these two (which We here insert) and caused many copies of them to be dispersed through the Citie, that so the people might not bee kept from the knowledge of Our favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them.</p>

            <p>THis did so irritate their Leaders, that they presently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon a course that should put Our Commissioner out of hope of ever doing any good in this service; for they presently gave order, even before the beginning of his journy, for the election of the Commissioners to the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly throughout the whole Kingdome, to be made before his returne, or the indicting of an Assembly; which caused him presently to send for the chiefe of the Covenanters, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to tell them, That if they did proceed to the election of any Commissioners for the Assembly before his returne, he would not goe his journey at all; he would not move Us for a Generall Assembly, nor for any thing else; he would leave them to their owne wayes; as a private man he would stay

in the Kingdome and expect the issue of their counsels: Which resolution of his, because it should not be concealed from the people, he caused likewise by many copies of it in writing to be divulged amongst them: This his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion these Lords Covenanters to whom he delivered it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to their Tables, who were very stiffe in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conclusion for the present election of Commissioners; yet because they could not well perceive how to satisfie the people, if they should breake off all treatie upon such a nice point, it was at the last agreed unto, and talked of as a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favour done to Our Commissioner, that the election of the Commissioners to the Assembly should be delayed untill his returne, which We pray the Reader to observe, because it shalbe knowne at his returne, with what a horrible equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation they did elude this their promise.</p>
            <p>Before Our Commissioner begun his journey towards Us, he entred into a serious consultation with Our chiefe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of State and principall Councellors there, what further advice they had to recommend by him unto Us, for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the peace of that Kingdome, since they clearely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that all Our royall and gracious intentions to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were frustrated, by the rebellious and obstinate courses of some few who misse-led the rest; and since he could not possibly draw from the Covenanters their designes, nay, nor their desires, whereby he might learne what they expected for their satisfaction, he desired of them their best counsell, and that he with them might conceive in writing what they supposed would reduce the Kingdome to peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and without which they thought it could not be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but by force and armes, which he was sure We would never use, but in an unavoidable extremitie, and for the preservation of Our Crowne and dignitie. This Our Commissioner did not adventure to communicate with the whole Councell, because he did know that some of Our Councellours were Covenanters in their hearts, though for dangerous ends, they had forborne the subscribing of the Covenant with their hands, and that they would acquaint
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17348:65"/>
the Covenanters with it, with whom they kept private meetings.</p>
            <p>This proposition being much debated amongst these Councellours, they fell upon that way which they conceived would fully satisfie, or else none could; which was this: Since the Covenanters would not expresse their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires in particulars, they thought best to take an exact view of all their petitions, remonstrances, grievances, declarations, protestations either written or printed, which they had since the first beginning of these troubles exhibited to Our selves, Our Commissioner, Our Councell; and to extract out of them the particulars of all their grievances and desires, and to represent them unto Us.</p>
            <p>And besides all these, We being assured by Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner, that the principall motive which the heads of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters had used to Our people for alienating their minds from Us, was that false opinion of Our aversnesse from the Religion Reformed, and of Our inclination to Popery: We resolved, above all that was desired, to take a course which should give Our subjects full and unquestionable satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that point; and therefore propounding unto Our selfe, the example of Our Royall Father, We concluded to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and urge the renewing of that Confession of Faith, which was first framed and afterward renewed in His name, by which meanes Wee made account that We should both benefit Our Subjects and right Our selfe: For perceiving that they had grounded and fathered their spurious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant upon that Confession and Covenant urged by Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Wee resolved, by this Act of Our authoritie to legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate it, that it being commanded by Us, might save Our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who were to sweare it, from incurring the danger of Our Lawes, which have made it very criminall to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Covenant without Our authority: As also, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Our selfe from that false and wicked aspersion, which the heads of their Covenant had most seditiously laid upon Us, <hi>viz.</hi> that Wee had a resolution either to bring in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or at least to tolerate it in Our Kingdomes, which though
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17348:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they themselves did not beleeve, yet they beleeved that this was the most powerfull meanes of alienating the minds of Our people from Us (which they only intended) if they could possibly worke them to that beliefe. And so both Wee and Our Commissioner, who had lately come from them, were perswaded that not onely Our people, but all people in the World, to whose notice it should come, must rest satisfied; that Wee could not possibly be that way inclined, if Wee should command, and by Our authority effect a new sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription and swearing of that confession of Faith, which is more directly opposite to Poperie then any Confession be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides extant in the World. This being added to the former advice of Our Councell, which was to ease them of all those things which they pretended to bee their principall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, Wee well hoped should have settled the peace of that Church and Kingdome. For by granting the removing of those former grievances, without this last superaddition of Our favour, Our Councellours were perswaded that Our subjects for the most part would be satisfied, desert their Leaders, and adhere to Us with their lives and fortunes, as they themselves would doe who signed this their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell with their hands, and sent it up to Us by Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner.</p>
            <p>No sooner was he come to Us at Oatlands, but We were astonished with his relation of their proceedings; and when he presented unto Us, not only the improbability, but also the impossibility that ever the Ring-leaders of that Rebellion would desist, untill they had obtained their wicked ends, and that the onely hope of peace was placed in dividing the people from them, by proffering unto the people such graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous favours, as in all likelyhood they neither could nor would reject; and well weighing the advice given unto Us by Our principall Councellours and Officers of State there, After mature deliberation with such as We were pleased to call unto Us, and especially at the humble and earnest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Our Commissioner, so zealously affected to the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17348:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
peace of Our and his native Countrey, We did resolve to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue that advice of his and Our other Councellours, and did againe make a very exact survey of whatsoever they had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for, from the very first, either of Us, Our Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, or Councell, and resolved to grant them all, and besides all these, to renew the former Confession of Faith and the Band annexed, which We made account would have given them satisfaction above all things, especially in that wherein they had been most wickedly abused, that is, in their opinion of Our inclination to Poperie. The particulars of Our gracious grants unto them you shall finde in Our next Proclamation made after Our Commissioners returne to that Kingdome; whom, within eight dayes after his comming to Us, We dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched back againe, overjoyed with Our gracious grants, as making full accompt, that he should be received this last time as an Angell of God, bringing in his mouth the branch both of piety and peace: But how farre both We and he and Our Councellours, and all Our good, religious, loyall, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able subjects of that Kingdom were deceived herein, the next ensuing narration (which is almost above credit) will suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare.</p>
            <p>For Our Commissioner, returning before the day agreed upon, he found all things in the time of his absence so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and imbroyled by the heads of the Covenanters, who were afraid of nothing so much, as that he should returne with an answer satisfactorie to Our people, that he begun most clearely to perceive, that these men were resolved that nothing should satisfie them; which appeared by their whole proceedings in the time of his absence, and especially in these two particulars: First, whereas they had promised that no election of Commissioners for the Assembly should be made before the 21. day of September, the day agreed upon for his returne, they gave order that the election should be made the 22. day of September, being the next day after that, which they knew was to be passed before he could possibly returne Our answer to them: According to which resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theirs, Commissioners for the Assembly were elected in many Presbyteries upon that day, before any of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17348:67"/>
did, or could come to know Our answer from Our Commissioner, or before the Assembly was indicted, which was not untill some dayes after these elections were past: Now, We desire to know whether ever there were heard a more grosse, absurd, and palpable equivocation then this, and that from men, who would be accounted the greatest opposites in the world to Popish tenets, and to none more then that of equivocation. They promise that no election shall be made untill Our Commissioners returne, and before such a day; and that promise grounded upon Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners resolution before his departure from them, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they would give him that assurance, hee would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake his journey, nor move Us any more in this business; but if they would expect his returne and Our answer by that time, he would doe both. These holy men resolve to expect that time before any election shall be actually made, but give order that it shall be made the next day after, before it could be knowne in most parts of the kingdome whether he were returned, or in any part of the kingdome, or by any person of the kingdome, what answer he had returned from Us: The insinceritie of which proceedings (condemned by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Covenanting Ministers at their meeting at Edinburgh for a most desperate equivocation) We are confident every man will detest, especially in those men who boast themselves to be the onely sincere Professours of these times.</p>
            <p>Besides, Our Commissioner found that these men (who would not so much as hear him speak of any precedent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of any thing concerning the Assembly, nor of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to be agreed upon for the more orderly proceeding in it, but cried out against them as unsufferable prelimitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and prejudgings of the liberties of Christ and his Church) had in the time of his absence at their Tables agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon certaine directions comprehended in eight Articles, which they had dispersed through the whole kingdome, and commanded to be observed by the severall Presbyteries thereof in their elections; the true copie whereof here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

            <p>TO these eight Articles they joyned (by way of informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) a verie impertinent, long and tedious discourse of Ruling Elders, too long and too simple to be here inserted, which was added no doubt onely to perswade the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to admit Lay-men to have voyces in their Presbyteries at the election of the Ministers who were to be Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners for the Assemblie; or in case of their refusall, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the Lay-men to put themselves in possession, and give their voyces in these elections whether the Ministers would or no, as shall appeare afterwards, both by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion which these Lay Elders used in many Presbyteries, where the Ministers refused to admit them, and by some of the Tables more private instructions, by which they were ordered so to do.</p>
            <p>Now, We desire the Reader to consider, whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which Our Commissioner desired for debating of what members the Assemblie was to be constituted, and the matters which were principally to be discussed there (with so much bitternes exclaimed against by them) could in any construction or sense be taken for such a prelimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Assemblie, either in the members, matter, or manner of it, as these eight Articles composed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by their Tables. In the second Article, they set downe to everie Presbyterie, a set forme of a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made to their Commissioners, which was never done before; and at the Assemblie, when the severall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions were read, it was observed that all the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions were the same <hi>verbatim,</hi> except a verie few from some Presbyteries who would not be ruled by the Table; and gave power to their Commissioners to continue no longer in the Assemblie, then Wee or Our Commissioner in Our name should continue it: In the same Article, they will have the Presbyteries in their Commissions to take it <hi>pro confesso,</hi> that the pretended and complained of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17348:69"/>
are, <hi>corruptions and disorders disturbing the peace, and tending to the overthrow of their Religion and Liberties within the reformed Church of that Realme</hi>: If this bee not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge, and take that for granted, which was to be tried by the Assemblie, whether it was so or not, <hi>viz.</hi> whether these things complained of were Innovations and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions introduced in Religion, We must leave it to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge. In the third Article they appoint Lay-men to sit in Presbyteries, which had not beene done for above fortie yeares before; Nay, and these Lay-men to be equall in number with the Ministers, which is contrarie to their owne book of Discipline alledged by them, which did then order that the Ministers should alwayes exceed the number of the Lay Elders; so that before this time they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were equall in number: Nay, that these Lay-men should have voices, not onely in the chusing of their own Lay Elder, but, which is insufferable, should have suffrage in the Election of the three Ministers Commissioners for the Assemblie, which they themselves do know was never heard nor practised in that Church before, in the verie first and strictest times of reformation, nor ever since. In the fourth Article they order a notable trick and device of their owne to bee put in practice, whereby they were ascertained, that no Minister should bee chosen Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner in any Presbyterie where they had any power, but such as did undoubtedly concurre with them in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious courses: for they appointed (and accordingly it was practised) that everie man suspected to bee of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent judgement from them, should presently bee processe and brought under the scandall of erroneous life or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and so made uncapable of being chosen Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner; according to which Article there were verie few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in the Kingdome, who had not subscribed their Covenant, but they were presently suspended by their Presbyterie, where they had voices to do it, or at the least put under processe by some one or other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which could not be prevented; for no man can bee denied an originall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse against any man whom he will implead: But yet this Article left no evasion, if it should happen that such a one
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17348:69"/>
should be chosen Commissioner, for in this case they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the rest who gave not voices should protest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the election, and complaine of it to the Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie, where they were sure enough to processe him there, and lay him aside untill his processe should bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scussed; which they did put in practise upon some Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who did not concurre in judgement with them at the first sitting downe of the Assemblie. The sixth Article is directly against the Constitutions of their Church then in force, and till then practised; the Moderator of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie being constantly one, as being most able to give an accompt to the Assemblie of all Presbyteriall actions. The seventh Article gives order for practising the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned equivocation, and enjoyneth them to make their elections before they received Our answer, and that they repaire to Edinburgh immediately after their election, that all the Commissioners elected may consult before hand upon what was to be said or done at the Assemblie; which is in effect neither more nor lesse, then to receive directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from their Tables how to carrie themselves at the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie, and indeed to preconveene and hold the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie at Edinburgh before their meeting at Glasgow.</p>
            <p>These were their publike instructions which they were not ashamed to avowe and send abroad from their Tables, as it were by publike authoritie, to the severall Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of that Kingdome; And whether they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine prelimitations of the Assemblie, we shall leave it to the Reader to judge: But whether, if We, Our Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, or Councell, had sent any such directions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions to the severall Presbyteries, they would not have exclaimed against them as unsufferable prelimitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Assemblie, and prejudgings of the liberties of the Church of Christ in that Realme, Wee do appeale even to their owne consciences. And yet these publike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions are nothing to the private ones, which they durst not communicate to all their partie, but onely to some one Laick, and one Minister, their speciall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in every Presbyterie, of which you shall heare more afterwards in their due place.</p>

            <p>THis Our Letter being received by Our Councel with all submissive, joyfull, and thankfull acknowledgment, Our Commissioner made them further acquainted with the particulars of Our grace and favour, for the appeasing of the troubles of that Our kingdome, who (upon hearing of the same) were filled with excessive joy, as making full account that now malice it selfe could not finde the least pretence of keeping Our people from being satisfied, all things which ever yet since the beginning of these troubles they had desired, being granted unto them. But so soone as some of Our Councellours, who were not onely Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their heart, but the very heart of their Covenant, had made some of the chiefe covenanting Lords acquainted with the unexpected excesse of Our favours towards Our people, these Lords, making full accompt that their reigne was upon the point of expiration if the people should understand Our
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17348:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
grace and favour, bestirred themselves with might and main to disperse rumours amongst them, That the newes brought home by Our Commissioner, importing Our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, did tend to the utter subversion of their Religion and liberties; That there was a new Covenant to be set on foot by Us, to destroy theirs, and that if they now did not resist, all they had done was quite undone and lost: After which, the principall of them came downe, first, to Our Commissioner, and then to Our Councell, requesting them, or indeed rather requiring them, that they would not subscribe the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of faith, nor require it to be subscribed by others, by any authoritie from Us, threatning in a manner, that if they did, they would repent it, and that a present rupture would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: Our Commissioner and Councell heard them twice fully, but found not the least ground of reason for the delay of the declaration of Our grace and favour towards Our people, as seeing it proceeded onely from an earnest desire in these Lords to have it concealed from them; and therefore resolved, and imparted unto the Lords covenanters their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, that they would publish it that day, being Saturday. The Lords covenanters did then seeme to abate something of their requests, or rather demands, and desired Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner and Councell to delay the publishing of Our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration onely untill the Munday following, before which time, if they could not shew good reasons for the stopping of it, they would be content with the publication thereof: Which motion of theirs wanted not seconding from some of Our Councell there present, who were indeed the first and chiefest of them: But Our Commissioner and Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours well and wisely foreseeing that this delay was desired, first, that these Lords Covenanters might have time to pen and prepare a Protestation against this Our gracious Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, with the contents whereof some of Our Councellors (heartie Covenanters) had made them acquainted; which Protestation could not be provided nor penned in the space of so few houres: secondly, that the Lords covenanters made no question, but that the next day being Sunday, their
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17348:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ministers in all the Pulpits of Edinburgh, by their subornati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, should so conjure up the spirits of Our people against Our gracious Declaration, as they should not be easily and readily laid againe: Thirdly, that they might have time to dispatch messengers &amp; Poasts abroad with copies of their Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in all Burroughs where Our Declaration was to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, before, or as soone as Our Declaration could be sent to those places: for these important considerations, Our Commissioner and Councell did declare unto these Lords, after full hearing of them, that considering the invaliditie of their reasons to the contrarie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Our gracious Declaration should be published that day at the Crosse of Edinburgh: And so accordingly Our Declaration that day was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as here it followeth.</p>

And being informed, that the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the practice of the five articles of Perth Assembly, hath bred great distraction and division in the Church and State, We have beene graciously pleased to take the same into Our consideration; and for the quiet and peace of Church and State, doe not onely dispense with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the saids Articles, but also discharge, like as by these presents We discharge all and whatsoever persons from urging the practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, upon either Laicke or Ecclesiasticall person whatsoever. And We do

hereby free all Our subjects from all censure and paine, whether eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall or secular, for not urging, practising, or obeying the same, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of any thing contained in the acts of Parliament, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assembly to the contrary. And because it hath beene, to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of government, disperst and surmized throughout this Our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that some of Our subjects have exercised such illimited and unwarranted power, and have held themselves eximed from censure and punishment, to which others Our subjects are lyable, We doe by these presents declare, that if any of Our subjects, whether ecclesiasticall or civill, of whatsoever qualitie, title, or degree, have, or shall at any time presume to doe any such act, or assume to themselves any such exemption or power, That they shall, like as by these presents We make and ordaine them to be lyable to the triall and censure of Parliament, generall Assembly, or any other Judicatories competent, according to the nature and qualitie of the offence. And for the free entry of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, that no other oath be administrate unto them then that which is contained in the act of Parliament, And to give Our subjects full assurance, that We never intend to admit of any change or alteration in the true Religion alreadie established and professed in this Our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, And that all Our good people may be fully and clearly satisfied of the realitie of Our intentions towards the maintenance of the truth and integritie of the said Religion, We have thought fit and expedient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joine and authorize, like as We by these presents doe require and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all the Lords of Our privie Councell, Senatours of the Colledge of Justice, Judges, and Magistrates to burgh and land, and all Our o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And for that effect We doe require the Lords of Councell to take such course anent the foresaid confession and generall band, that it may be subscribed and renewed throughout the whole kingdome with all possible diligence. And because We will not leave in Our subjects minds the least scruple or doubt of Our royall intentions and reall resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Wee have given warrant to Our Commissioner to indict a free

And because it is likely that the disorders and distractions which have happened of late, have beene occasioned through the conceived feares of innovation of Religion and Lawes, and not out of any disloyaltie or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection to soveraigntie, We are graciously pleased absolutely to forget what is past, and freely to forgive all by-gones to all such as shall acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esce to this Our gracious pleasure, and carry themselves peaceably as loyall and dutifull subjects, and shall ratifie and approve the same in Our next ensuing Parliament. And that this Assembly may have the better successe, and more happy conclusion, Our will is, that there be a solemne Fast proclaimed and kept by all Our good subjects of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, a foureteene dayes before the beginning of the said Assembly: the causes thereof to be a begging a blessing from God upon that Assembly, and a peaceable end to the distractions of this Church and kingdome, with the aversion of Gods heavie judgement from both.

And now renewed and subscribed again by his Majesties speciall command, by the right noble Marquesse, <hi>James,</hi> Marquesse of Hamiltoun, Earle of Arran and Cambridge, Lord Even and Evendail, his Majesties high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, and Lords of secret Councell undersubscribing.

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee All, and every one of us underwritten, protest, That, after long and due examination of our owne Consciences, in matters of true and false Religion, are now throughly resolved in the Truth, by the Word and Spirit of God, and therefore we beleeve with our hearts, confesse with our mouths, subscribe with our hands, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly affirme before God and the whole World, that this only is the true Christian Faith and Religion, pleasing God, and bringing salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to man, which is now by the mercy of God, revealed to the world by the preaching of the blessed Evangel.</p>
                        <p>And received, beleeved, and defended by many and sundry notable Kirks and Realmes, but chiefly by the Kirk of Scotland, the Kings Majestie, and three Estates of this Realme, as Gods eternall truth and onely ground of our salvation; as more particularly is expressed in the Confession of our Faith, stablished, and publikely confirmed by sundry Acts of Parliaments, and now of a long time hath been openly professed by the Kings Majestie, and whole body of this Realme, both in Burgh and Land. To the which Confession and forme of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wee willingly agree in our consciences in all points, as unto Gods undoubted Truth and Verity, grounded onely upon his written Word: And therefore Wee abhorre and detest all contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie Religion and Doctrine, But chiefly all kinde of Papistrie in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17348:73"/>
and particular heads, even as they are now damned and confuted by the Word of God and Kirke of Scotland: but in speciall, we detest and refuse the usurped authoritie of that Roman Antichrist upon the Scriptures of God, upon the Kirk, the civill Magistrate, and conscience of men: All his tyrannous lawes made upon indifferent things against our Christian liberty; His erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous doctrine against the sufficiency of the written word, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Law, the office of Christ, and his blessed evangel. His corrupted doctrine concerning originall sin, our naturall inability, and rebellion to Gods law, our justification by faith onely, our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect sanctification and obedience to the law, the nature, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and use of the holy Sacraments. His five bastard Sacraments, with all his rites, ceremonies, and false doctrine, added to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the true Sacraments without the word of God. His cruell iudgment against infants departing without the Sacrament. His absolute necessitie of Baptisme. His blasphemous opinion of Transubstantiation, or reall presence of Christs bodie in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and receiving of the same by the wicked, or bodies of men. His dispensations with solemne oathes, perjuries, and degrees of marriage forbidden in the word. His crueltie against the innocent divorced. His divellish Masse. His blasphemous Priesthood. His profane sacrifice for the sinnes of the dead and the quicke. His canonization of men, calling upon Angels or Saints departed, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of imagerie, reliques, and crosses, dedicating of Kirks, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, dayes, vowes to creatures. His purgatory, praiers for the dead, praying or speaking in a strange language, with his processions and blasphemous letanie, and multitude of advocates or mediatours, His manifold orders, auricular confession. His desperate &amp; uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine repentance. His generall and doubt some faith. His satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of men for their sins. His justification by works, <hi>Opus ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum,</hi> works of supererogation, merits, pardons, peregrinations, and stations. His holy water, baptising of bells, conjuring of spirits, crossing, sauing, anointing, conjuring, hallowing of Gods good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with the superstitious opinion joyned therewith. His world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mornarchy, and wicked Hierarchy. His three solemne vowes, with all his shavellings of sundry sorts. His erroneous and bloudy decrees made at Trent, with all the subscribers and approvers of that cruell and bloudy band, conjured against the Kirke of God. And finally, we detest all his vaine allegories, rites, signes, and traditions brought in the Kirk, without, or against the word of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17348:74"/>
God, and doctrine of this true reformed Kirk. To the which wee joyn our selves willingly, in doctrine, faith, Religion, discipline, and use of the holy sacraments, as lively members of the same, in Christ our head: promising and swearing, by the great Name of the Lord our God, that we shall continue in the obedience of the doctrine and discipline of this Kirk, and shall defend the same, according to our vocation and power, all the dayes of our lives, under the paines contained in the law, and danger both of body and soule in the day of Gods fearfull judgement. And seeing that many are stirred up by Satan and that Roman Antichrist, to promise, sweare, subscribe, and for a time use the holy Sacraments in the Kirk deceitfully, against their owne consciences, minding hereby, first, under the externall cloak of Religion, to corrupt and subvert secretly Gods true Religion within the Kirk, and afterward, when time may serve, to become open enemies and persecuters of the same, under vaine hope of the Popes dispensation divised against the word of God, to his greater confusion, and their double condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the day of the Lord Jesus:</p>
                        <p>We therefore, willing to take away all suspition of hypocrisie, and of such double dealing with God and his Kirk, protest, and call the Searcher of all hearts to witnesse, that our minds and hearts do fully agree with this our confession, promise, oath, and subscription: So that we are not moved for any worldly respect, but are perswaded only in our consciences, through the knowledge and love of Gods true Religion, printed in our hearts by the holy Spirit, as we shall answer to him in the day when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed. And because wee perceive, that the quietnesse and stability of our Religion and Kirk doth depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the safety and good behaviour of the Kings Majestie, as upon a comfortable instrument of Gods mercie granted to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, for the maintenance of his Kirk, and ministration of justice amongst us, we protest and promise with our hearts under the same oath, hand-writ, and paines, that we shall defend his person and authority, with our geare, bodies, and lives, in the defence of Christ his Evangel, liberties of our Countrey, ministration of justice, and punishment of iniquity, against all enemies within this Realme, or without, as we desire our God to be a strong and mercifull defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to us in the day of our death, and comming of our Lord Jesus Christ: to whom, with the Father, and the holy Spirit, be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory eternally.

            <p>IT is not for men to judge of other mens hearts, and of their secret desires, but We doe challenge the most rigid Covenanters to name any one particular ever desired by them, in any of their supplications, remonstrances, protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, declarations, written or printed, exhibited to Us, Our Commissioner, or Councell, which is not in this Our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Declaration granted to Our people: For not onely all and every one of their particular grievances any way petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned against by them, are hereby discharged and removed, but even the two generall things, which they made the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beleeve was the summe of all their desires and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>viz.</hi> a free Generall Assembly and a Parliament are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, and in that order upon which they stood so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, first the Assembly, and then the Parliament: And besides all these, their owne Confession of faith, the ground as they pretend, of their Covenant renewed and established.</p>
            <p>Who would not now have expected a happie period to all the distractions of that Kingdome, upon this Our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous assenting to all their owne desires? But the divellish ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie and malice of those factious spirits, who did see that all their designes were utterly defeated, and that their hopes
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17348:81"/>
for compassing of them were now a bleeding and drawing their last breath, if they could not finde some meanes to blindfold Our peoples eyes, and so keepe them from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning and acknowledging Our grace and goodnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: They presently before the houre that this Our Declaration was to be proclaimed, filled Our peoples minds and eares with fearfull expectations of most terrible things to be delivered in this Our Proclamation, and so destructive of the lawes and liberties of that Church and Kingdome, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of their late sworne Covenant, that presently they wrought the people to a detestation of Our Declaration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they knew what it was: They presently erected a large scaffold under the Crosse where Our Proclamation was to be made, upon which were mounted, not one or two from every Table, to protest in the name of the rest, as heretofore they had done, but a great number of Earles, Lords, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and others, with their swords in their hands, and hats on their heads<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not without jeering and laughing during all the time of Our Proclamation; which no sooner was ended, but with a most insolent and rebellious behaviour they assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted one <hi>Johnston</hi> in reading of a most wicked, treasonable, and ignorant Protestation, which within few dayes after they printed and We doe here insert, as being confident that all subjects in the world who shall come to read it, will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre and detest it, if ever they did feele in their owne hearts the least touch or taste of a Princes favour and clemencie, or carry any affection to loyaltie, justice, and government: The very reading of it will bring every good subject and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous honest man so farre out of love with it, as it needeth no further confutation then the very perusall of it: For who can endure to heare Scripture so grossely abused, the holy name of God so solemnely invocated as a witnesse to such notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falshoods; to their rebellious courses and Covenant those attributes of infallibilitie given, which are onely proper to the sacred Scripture; and royall authoritie affronted with such peremptorie asseverations, ignorant and senslesse reasons, the falshood and inconsequence whereof must needs appeare

                        <p>WEe Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons, his Majesties true and loyall subjects, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our continuall supplications, complaints, articles, and informations, presented, first, to the Lords of his Majesties Privie Councell; next, to his sacred Majestie, and last, from time to time to his Majesties Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, our long attendance and great patience this twelve-month by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, in waiting for satisfaction of our most just desires, our zeale to remove all rubs out of the way, which were either mentioned unto us, or could be conceived by us, as hinderances of our pious intentions, aiming at nothing but the good of the Kingdome, and preservation of the Kirk, which by consumption or combustion is likely to expire; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting to use no other meanes but such as are legall, and have beene ordinarie in this Kirk since the reformation, and labouring according to our power and interesse, that all things might be carried in a peaceable manner, worthy of our Profession and Covenant, our Protestation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a hearty thanksgiving for what his Majesty in his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his justice had granted of our just desires; and our Protests and hopes for so much as was not as yet granted. All these made us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently to expect from his Majestes Royall and compassioned disposition towards this his native Kingdome, that a free Generall Assembly and Parliament should have beene indicted, as the ordinary and most proper remedies of our grievances, and did constraine us to renew our petition, earnestly intreating, that his Majesties Commissioner would be pleased to represent unto his Majesty the condition of this Kirk and Kingdome, crying in an extreme exigencie for present helpe, with the lawfulnesse of the remedies prescribed by his Majesties Lawes, required by us, and presented to him in some particular Articles, which his Grace promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to recommend to his Majestie, and to doe his best endeavours for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the same; especially the first Article, that there might be indicted a full and free Generall Assembly, without prelimitation, either
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17348:82"/>
in the constitution and members thereof, in the order and manner of proceeding, or in the matters to be treated: And if there should be any question or doubt about one of these, or such like particulars, that the determination thereof might be remitted to the Assembly it selfe, as the only proper and competent judge. And now, after so many supplications, complaints, articles, and informations; after our necessary protestation, expressing the humble thankfulnesse and continued desires of our hearts; after so long expectation and so much dealing, having with open eares, and attentive minds heard his Majesties Proclamation, it is our desire, purpose, and endevour so to proceed, that we may upon the one part still be thankfull to God and the King, for the least blinke of his Majesties countenance, and the smallest crums of comfort that fall unto us from his Majesties Royall hands; beseeching the Lord yet further to enlarge his Majesties heart, for our full satisfaction and rejoycing, to the honour of God, the good of this Kirk and Kingdome, and his Majesties never dying fame and glory; that his wise government and zeale to the service of God, may be a measure and pattern of desires to all generations here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when they shall be wishing for a religious and righteous King: And on the other part, that Christ our Lord, the King of Kings, through our neglect or luke-warmnesse may want no part of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and Dominion, and that in our Religion, which is more dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us then our lives, we deceive not our selves, with that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not satisfie and make up the breach of this Kirke and Kingdome, or remove our feares, doubts, and suspicions, of the innovations of Religion: This hath made us to observe, and perceive, that his Majesties Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation doth ascribe all the late distractions of this Kirke and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, to our conceived feares of the innovation of Religion and Law, as the cause and occasion thereof, and not to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations themselves, with which we have beene for a long time, and especially of late, heavily pressed and grieved; as if the cause were rather in apprehension and fancie, then in reality and substance. That the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice book and booke of Canons are not so far discharged by this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as they have beene urged by preceding Proclamations; for this Proclamation onely dischargeth the practice of them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinds the Acts made for establishing their practice, but doth not rescind the former Proclamations; namely, that of the <hi>19.</hi> of <hi>February</hi> at Stirling, and that of the fourth of <hi>July</hi> at Edinburgh, which give
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17348:82"/>
an high approbation to these Books, as fit meanes to maintaine Religion, and to beat down all superstition; and withall declares his Majesties purpose, to bring them into this Kirk in a faire and legall way: And thus both our feares that they may be introduced hereafter, must still remaine; and the libertie of the Generall Assembly, by such a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Majesties judgement, is not a little prejudged in the minds of so many as wisely consider and compare the preceding Proclamations with this which we now heare, although others who looking upon one step and not upon the whole progresse, run on rashly, and, neither considering what they are doing, nor with whom they are dealing, may be easily deceived, <hi>Qui pauca videt, citò judicat,</hi> a short sight ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a sudden judgement.</p>
                        <p>That it is declared in this Proclamation, That his Majesty neither intendeth to innovate any thing in Religion or Lawes, or to admit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny change or alteration in the true Religion already established and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed in this Kingdome: and withall, this is interposed, That the articles of Pearth are established by the acts of Parliament and generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and dispensation of the practice only granted, and discharge given, that no person be urged with the practice thereof; and consequently, his Majesties intention for the standing of the Acts of the Assembly and Parliament, appointing the Articles of Pearth, is manifest; which is no small prejudice to the freedome of the Generall Assembly, That while the Proclamation ordaineth all his Majesties subjects to be liable to the triall and censure of the judicatories competent, and that none of them shall use any unlimited and unwarranted power; likewise that no other oath be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred to Ministers at their entrie, then that which is contained in the Act of Parliament; in both these Articles the Bishops are meaned, who are only thereby for the present curbed, against their exorbitancie and enormities in exercing their office: but the office of Bishops is thereby not only presupposed as unquestionable, but also so strongly established, that his Majestie declareth, for the present, his intention, to admit no innovation therein: which is more evident by the indiction of the Parliament, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all Prelats to be present, as having voice and place in Parliament; and by the indiction of the Assembly, warning all Archbishops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops (for so are their divers degrees and offices Ecclesiasticall here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed and supposed) to be present, as having place and voyce in the Assembly, contrary to the caveats, acts of the Kirk, and our declinator: And thus a third and great limitation is put upon the Generall Assembly.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17348:83"/>
The Proclamation, by reason of these many reall limitations, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of the liberty of the Assembly in the very points which have wrought so much woe and disturbance in this Kirk and Kingdome, and wherein the liberty of the Assembly is most usefull and necessary at this time, can neither satifie our grievances and complants, nor remove our feares and doubts, nor cannot (without protestation) be admitted by us his Majesties subjects, who earnestly desire that Truth and Peace may be established; and that for the reasons following.</p>

returne to the generall for the reasons following.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <hi>1.</hi> No means have been left unassayed against our late <hi>Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> so solemnly sworn and subscribed. For first we were prest with the rendring and rescinding of our <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> Next an alteration in some substantiall points was urged. <hi>3.</hi> A Declaration was motioned, which tended to the enervation thereof, and now we find in the same straine, that we are put to a new tryall, and the last mean is used more subtile than the former: That by this new subscription our late <hi>Covenant,</hi> and Confession may be quite absorbed and buried in oblivion, that where it was intended &amp; sworn to be an everlasting <hi>Covenant</hi> never to be forgotten, it shall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more remembred, the one shall be cryed up, and the other drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the noise thereof, And thus the new subscription now urged (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in a different way) shall prove equivalent to the rendring of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> or what of that kind hath before been assayed. Like as the reasons against the rendring of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> doe militate directly against this new motion.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <hi>2.</hi> If we should now enter upon this new Subscription, we would think our selves guilty of mocking God, &amp; taking his Name in vain, for the tears that began to be poured forth at the solemnizing of the <hi>Covenant</hi> are not yet dryed up &amp; wiped away, and the joyfull noise which then began to sound hath not yet ceased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there can be no new necessity from us, and upon our part pretended for a ground of of urging this new subscription, at first intended to be an abjuration of Popery upon us who are known to hate poperie with an unfained hatred, and have all this yeere bygone given large testimonie of our zeale against it. As we are not to multiply miracles on Gods part, so ought we not to multiply solemne oathes and Covenants upon our part, and thus to play with oathes, as children doe with their toyes, without necessitie.</p>

                           <hi>3.</hi> Neither would we in giving way to this new subscription think our selves free of perjurie: for as we were driven by an undeclinable necessitie to enter into a mutuall <hi>Covenant,</hi> so are we bound, not onely by the law of God and nature, but by our solemn oath and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, against all divisive motions to promove and observe the same without violation: and it is most manifest, that having already refused to render, alter, or destroy our <hi>Covenant,</hi> nothing can be more contrarie and adverse to our pious intentions and sincere reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17348:85"/>
than to consent to such a subscription and oath, as both in the intention of the urgers, and in the nature and condition of the matter urged, is the ready way to extinguish, and to drowne in oblivion the Band of our union and conjunction that they be no more remembred. In this case we are called to lay seriously to our hearts, <hi>1,</hi> That we have sworne that we shall neither directly, nor indirectly suffer our selves to be divided and withdrawne from this blessed and loyall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, which consisteth not only in the generall Confession, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in our explanation, &amp; application thereof, but on the contrary, shal by all lawfull means, labour to further and promove the same. <hi>2.</hi> That our union and conjunction may be observed without violation, (and so without mutilation of our application) we call the living LORD to witnesse, as we shall answer to Christ in the great Day, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <hi>4.</hi> This new subscription, in stead of performing our vows, would be a reall testimonie and confession before the World, That we have been transgressours in making rash vows, that we repent our selves of former zeal and forwardnesse against the particulars exprest first in our Supplications, Complaints, and Protestations, and next abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our Covenant, that we in our judgement prefer the generall Confession unto this, which necessarily was now made more speciall; and that we are now under the faire pretext and honest cover of a new oath, recanting and undoing that, which upon so mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have been doing before, This beside all other evils, were to make way and open a door to the re-entry of the particulars abjured, and to repent our selves of our chiefest consolations, and to lie both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and our owne soules.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <hi>5.</hi> It hath been often objected, that our <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> &amp; <hi>Covenant</hi> was unlawfull, because it wanted the warrants of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick authority, and it hath been answered by us, that we were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of the warrant civill and ecclesiasticall which authorized the former <hi>Covenant.</hi> And although we could have wished that his Ma<hi rend="sup">ty</hi> had added both his subscription &amp; authority unto it, yet the lesse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint from authority and the more libertie, the lesse hypocrisie, and more sincerity hath appeared: But by this new subscription urged by authority we both condemn our former subscription as unlawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause alleadged to be done without authority, and precondemn also the like laudable course in the like necessity to be taken by the posterity.</p>

                           <hi>6.</hi> What is the use of merch-stones upon borders of Lands, the like
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17348:85"/>
use hath <hi>Confessions of Faith</hi> in the Kirk, to disterminate and divide betwixt Truth and errour: and the renewing and applying of <hi>Confessions of Faith</hi> to the present errors and corruptions, are not unlike ryding of merches. And therefore to content our selves with the generall, and to return to it, from the particular application of the Confession necessarily made upon the invasion or creeping in of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors within the borders of the Kirk, if it be not a removing of the merch stone from the own place, it is at least the hiding of the merch in the ground that it be not seen, which at this time were very unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for two causes. One is, because Poperie is so pregnant, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful in this land, as we have learned of late. The other, because the Papists who upon the urging of the <hi>Service book</hi> &amp; <hi>Canons,</hi> have presumed of our return to <hi>Rome,</hi> will upon this our subscription a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their dispareing of us, unto their wonted presumption. None of us will deny, but the large <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> registrated in the Acts of Parliament, doth by consequence contain this short confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and abjuration: Yet were it not sufficient against Poperie to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the one without the other: how then shall we think that the more general Confession &amp; abjuration at this time, when the urging of such Popish books hath extorted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us so necessary an application, and doth still call for a testimony, to be compleat enough without it.</p>

We answer, First, the Act of Counsell containing that declaration, is not as yet published by Proclamation. Secondly, if it were so published, it behooved of necessity either be repugnant to His Maiesties declared Iudgement and Command, which is more nor to sweare without warrand from Authority (a fault although uniustly, often obiected unto us) or else we must affirme the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the yeare <hi>1580.</hi> and at this time to be altogether one and the same; and thus must acknowledge, that there is no novation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which were a formall contradiction to that we have sworne. <hi>3.</hi> By approving the Proclamation anent the Oath to be administred to Ministers, according to the Act of Parliament, which is to swear simple obedience to the Diocesan Bishop, and by warning all Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops and Bishops to be present; as having voice and place in the Assemblie: They seem to determine, that in their Iudgment the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, as it was professed <hi>1580.</hi> doth consist with Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, whereas We by our oath have referred the tryall of this or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther question of that kind to the generall Assembly &amp; Parliament.</p>

And, though the present books be discharged by proclamation, yet if we shall by any deed of our owne testifie, that they may consist with our Confession of Faith, within a very short time, either the same books, or some other like unto them, with some small change, may be obtruded upon us, who by Our abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (if we adhere unto it) have freed both our selves, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie of all such corruptions, and have laid a faire foundation for the pure worship of God in all time coming.</p>

                           <hi>16.</hi> Wee represent also to the honourable Lords of privie Councell to be considered, That the Doctrine, Discipline, and Use of Sacraments are sworne, and the contrarie abjured, according to the Word of God, and the meaning of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the books of Discipline, and Acts of Assemblies; And that in the Oath there is no place left to the generalitie of any mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the true Faith and Religion, nor to any private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, or mentall reservation.</p>
                        <p>For these and the like considerations, in our owne name, and in name of all who will adhere to the late Covenant, subscribed by us, and sealed from Heaven, We (from our dutie to God, our King, our native Countrey, our selves, and the posteritie, lest our silence import a satisfaction of our desires, and a stopping of our mouths from necessarie supplication for things yet to bee obtained from his Majesties just and gracious disposition) are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to declare and protest; First, that the cause and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the distractions of the Kirk and Common-wealth, are no wayes to bee imputed unto us, or our needlesse feares, but to the innovations and corruptions of Religion, which against the Acts and order of this Kirk, and the Lawes of the Kingdome, have beene pressed upon us the people of God, and his Majesties loyall subjects; who, although under great thraldom, were living in peace and quietnesse, labouring in all godlinesse and honestie to do our dutie to God and man. Secondly, We protest, that all questions and doubts that arise, concerning the freedome of the Assemblie, whether in the constitution and members thereof, or in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be treated, or in the manner and order of proceeding, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the determination of the Assemblie it selfe, as the onely proper and competent judge; And that it shall be lawfull for us, being authorized with lawfull Commissions, as at other times when the urgent necessitie of the Kirk shall require, so in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igence to assemble our selves at the Diet appointed, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any impediment or prorogation to the contrary: And being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, against all qualifications and predeterminations, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposals to propone, treat, reason, vote, and conclude, according to the Word of God, confession of Faith, and Acts of lawfull Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, in all Ecclesiasticall matters, pertaining to the Assemblie,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17348:88"/>
and tending to the advancement of the Kingdome of Christ, and good of Religion.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, since Archbishops and Bishops have no warrand for their office in this Kirk, since it is contrarie both to reason and to the Acts of the Kirk, that any have place and voice in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, who are not authorized with lawfull Commissions; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both in common equitie, and by the tenour of this Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are made lyable to the triall and censure of the Assemblie, Wee protest, that they bee not present, as having place or voice in the Assemblie, but as <hi>rei</hi> to compeere, for underlying tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and censure upon the generall complaints alreadie made, and the particular accusations to be given in against them; And that the warning given by his Majesties Proclamation, and this our Protestation, be a sufficient citation to them, to compeer before the Assemblie, for their triall and censure, in life, office, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Wee solemnly protest, that We do constantly adhere to our Oath and subscription of the Confession of Faith and Covenant, lately renewed and approven with rare and undeniable evidences from heaven, of the wonderfull workings of his Spirit in the hearts both of Pastors and people, through all the parts of the Kingdome; And that we stand to all parts and clauses there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and particularly to the explanation and application, containing both our abjuration of, and our union against the particular evils and corruptions of the time; a dutie which the Lord at this time especially craveth at our hands.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, We also protest, that none of us who have subscribed, and do adhere to our subscription of the late Covenant, be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or urged, either to procure the subscriptions of others, or to subscribe our selves unto any other Confession or Covenant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any derogation thereunto, especially that mentioned in the Proclamation, without the necessarie explanation and the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof, alreadie sworn by us, for the Reasons above expressed: And because, as we did in our former Protestation appeale from the Lords of his Majesties Councell, so do we now by these renew our solemne appeale, with all solemnities requisite, unto the next free Generall Assemblie and Parliament, as the onely supreme nationall Judicatories competent, to judge of nationall causes and proceedings.</p>

                           <pb n="172" facs="tcp:17348:89"/>Sixthly, We protest, That no subscription, whether by the Lords of Councell or others, of the Confession mentioned in the Proclamation, and enjoyned for the maintenance of Religion, as it is now already, or at this present time established and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed within this Kingdome, without any innovation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Law, be any manner of way prejudiciall to our Covenant, wherein <hi>we have sworne to forbeare the practice of Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alreadie introduced, &amp;c. till they be tried in a free As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie, And to labour by all lawfull meanes, to recover the puritie and libertie of the Gospel as it was established and professed before the foresaid Innovations:</hi> And in like manner, that no subscription foresaid be any derogation to the true and sound meaning of our worthie predecessours, at the time of their subscription in the year <hi>1581.</hi> and afterward. Withall, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and exhorting all men who lay to heart the cause of Religion, against the corruptions of the time &amp; the present estate of things, both to subscribe the Covenant as it hath bin explained, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily applied; and as they love the puritie and libertie of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to hold back their hands from all other Covenants, till the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly now indicted be conveened, and determine the present differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and divisions, and preserve this country from contrarie oathes.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, As his Majesties royall clemencie appeareth in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and forgetting what his Majestie conceiveth to be a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or done amisse in the proceeding of any; so are we very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his Majesties approbation, to the integrity of our hearts and peaceablenesse of our wayes and actions all this time past: And therfore We protest that we still adhere to our former complaints, protestations, lawfull meetings, proceedings, mutuall defences, &amp;c. All which, as they have been in themselves lawfull, so were they to us, pressed with so many grievances in his Majesties absence from this native kingdome, most necessary, and ought to be regarded as good offices, and pertinent duties of faithfull Christians, loyall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and sensible members of this Kirk and Commonwealth, as we trust at all occasions to make manifest to all good men, especially to his sacred Majestie, for whose long and prosperous government, that we may live a peaceable and quiet life in all godlinesse and honestie, We earnestly pray.</p>

            </q>
            <p>ANd now for triall of what Wee have said, the Reader may reflect upon these particulars: Not farre from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, they averre that they did confidently expect from Us a free Generall Assemblie and Parliament to be indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that Our Commissioner promised to recommend <hi>unto Us this their suit for a free Generall Assemblie, without prelimitation either in the constitution and members thereof, in the order and manner of proceeding, or in the matters</hi> to bee treated of; and do insinuate as if Wee had not given order for any such Assemblie in Our Declaration; which everie Reader (looking upon Our Declaration) may see to be most untrue: for in it We give warrant to Our Commissioner to indict a free Generall Assemblie; nor is there there either mention or meaning of any prelimitation, though they themselves did use verie many, some whereof you have heard alreadie, and shall heare of more hereafter. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they quarrell with Our Declaration <hi>for ascribing all the late distractions of this Church and Common-wealth to their conceived feares of the Innovation</hi> of Religion and Lawes, and not to the Innovations themselves: No doubt a great crime, that We will not acknowledge that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Book, which was penned at first by those who laid downe their lives in opposition to Poperie, is an introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17348:90"/>
to Poperie; and We do professe that We did discharge that Book onely to remove their feares and doubts, and ease their pretended grievances: nor can Wee condemne that Book, without condemning the Service Book of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, for the Covenanters arguments strike alike at both. Then immediatly after, <hi>They take it ill that though We have discharged the practice of these pretended Innovations, and voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all Acts made for the establishing of them, yet We have not rescinded Our former Proclamations at Sterling and Edinburgh</hi>; As if nothing could content them, unlesse Wee should disgrace Our owne Proclamations, which did not any way establish or authorize the things complained of: nay more, unlesse We will call back Our own words, which cannot be interpreted to any such sense as they would force upon them, they would make Our people beleeve, that the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the generall Assemblie is prejudged, &amp;, in a suspicious, undutifull and dangerous phrase, tell them, <hi>That they do not consider with whom they are dealing</hi>; as if no trust were to be given to Us: Next, they quarrell with Our discharging of the practice of the Articles of Perth, but not the Articles themselves which are established by acts both of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Generall Assemblie; and yet Wee dare say, that they would hold it for a strange position, if We should use Our Prerogative to the disanulling of any thing established by these two Judicatories; nay, if We and the Parliament joyntly should (as the world goeth now) offer to disanull any act of their Generall Assemblie: so glad they are to quarrell with Our Declaration, that in their eagernesse they destroy their owne grounds. Their next cavill, if it were possible, is as senslesse as the former, whereby they averre, that Our naming of Bishops in Our Proclamation for the indiction of the Assemblie <hi>is a prelimitation of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thereby We take it as granted, that the office of a Bishop is unquestionably an office in that Church and Kingdome</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this they call a great prelimitation put upon the Assemblie; but with what shew of consequence We cannot possibly conceive: for who would not take that undoubtedly for an office in any Church or Kingdome, which is establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lawes and acts of both? and such is the office of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17348:90"/>
a Bishop in that Kingdome: After these fancied prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, they adde sixe reasons why they should not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; which are so ignorant and simple, as it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to draw them into any forme of reasoning or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding: and though they could bee so drawne, yet they were verie needlesse; for to what end should reasons bee brought against the admitting of these prelimitations, when there were no prelimitations offered, and these that are alledged are no prelimitations at all? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these six Reasons, at least so called by them, are to bee passed over with contempt, as having not one word in them worthie the answering.</p>
            <p>Next, they muster up sixteen Reasons against the subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the confession of Faith urged by Our authoritie in that Declaration, of the verie same piece with the former six Reasons, everie way as full of non-sense as they; The first is, that it will make their Covenant bee forgotten: a matter of great consequence indeed, that their unlawfull Acts should be drowned by any Act of lawfull authoritie. For this We think they should thank Us: The second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, that if they should subscribe this confession now, they would think themselves guiltie of mocking God: a notable whimsey, that Acts of authoritie must want obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience if they crosse some peoples foolish thoughts and idle fancies; but in the meane time what a fearfull mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and taking of his name in vaine is it for them to say so, and use that great name for so groundlesse a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion? The third reason is, that they are afraid that this subscription will introduce a division amongst themselves, it being against their Oath, in their late Covenant, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any divisive motions. And truely whatsoever they pretend in all their other reasons, this is the maine, if not the onely reason of the principall Covenanters furious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in all their wayes, and especially in this their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, because they did plainely perceive that if Our people should once see and acknowledge Our Grace and clemencie, or be brought to subscribe to the same thing by Our authoritie, to which they had subscribed before by their perswasion, then they would begin againe to rellish
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17348:91"/>
government, and so fall off, and divide themselves from those who have resolved never to indure it: In the meane time, the Reader shall do well to observe the wonderfull strength of this reason; We must not subscribe, because it will occasion some division amongst us; by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, all hope of peace must be banished out of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for ever: For certainely if they themselves should set downe in writing the utmost of their desires, and Wee should assent unto them, yet undoubtedly some would dislike and not admit of those propositions of peace, which the rest had agreed upon: Are they therefore sworne by their Oath to reject all proffers of peace, because some will dislike them, upon which a division must follow more or lesse? The fourth reason is plaine Poperie, and the maine ground of most of the errours established at the Councell of Trent; If they subscribe now, it will bee thought that they have erred in their former proceedings; but where the reason of this Reason lies, is past ordinarie finding: The fifth reason hath in it a reach beyond the Moone; This sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription is urged by authoritie, but our former subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeded from our owne heads, and therefore is to be preferred, as carrying with it more libertie, more since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and lesse hypocrisie; A reason fit to bee answered by none but such as have lost their Reason: The sixth reason is in the same case; for truely Wee understand it not: The seventh reason supposeth that there is a Papist in the world so foolish and simple as to think, that the same confession of Faith, consisting of the same words and syllables, injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bee sworne without authoritie, if it shall bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bee sworne by authoritie, becommeth a new and different confession of Faith; or if that We everie yeare of Our Reigne should renew and command a subscription to the same confession, that then everie yeare Wee should establish a new Faith; Sure they need not trouble Our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples heads with such foolish feares, for undoubtedly there will bee no such foolish fellowes found amongst the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists: The eighth reason, hath not a shew of any reason: For their ninth reason, We are confident, that if they had knowne as much as now they do, and have expressed in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17348:91"/>
their answer to Our Commissioners last Declaration, they would have left this quite out: for the truth is, that no man can subscribe this confession of faith commanded by Us, and with a safe conscience hold that Episcopacie is abjured by it, for many reasons, amongst which this alledged by them is but one, yet a very true one, <hi>viz.</hi> That an oath must either be refused or taken according to the knowne intention of him that ministred it; and it being well knowne, that We, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawes of all Our Kingdomes, are resolved to maintaine Episcopall government, no man can sweare any oath administred by Us or Our authoritie, which may not consist with that government: And it is as true, that there is nothing in that confession of faith, which being sworne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, abjureth Episcopacie, by whomsoever the oath shall be administred; and therefore it is a very unjust and unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie feare, which seemes to make them sweat at the end of this ninth Reason, <hi>viz.</hi> That this subscription commanded by Us, seemeth to determine, that the confession of faith as it was professed 1580. doth consist with Episcopacie: That this subscription determineth it, is undoubtedly a very simple conceit, but that the confession it selfe made in 1580. may and doth consist with Episcopacie, is unquestionably true; and it is so determined by the Covenanters themselves, who assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many who made that scruple, and would not have come into their Covenant unlesse the Covenanters had first resolved them of it, that they might sweare the same confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and yet not abjure Episcopall government, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the three Ministers in their first answer to the Divines of Aberdene, have positively affirmed, averring, that Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie was not abjured by that confession, nor their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but onely referred to the tryall of an Assembly and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: Now it is most certaine, that when We comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this subscription to that confession, no Assembly (true or pretended) had determined that it was abjured, nor hath any Parliament done so yet; and therefore the Covenanters themselves have determined, that when Wee required this subscription, a man might safely subscribe without abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:17348:92"/>
of Episcopacie: But to let the weaknesse of this ninth reason passe, it is a wonder to observe how these men in their answer to the fourth reason (contained in Our Commissioners last Declaration) are constrained by maine force of argument to denie their own most true proposition, expressed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this ninth reason: For there they affirm it plainly, that a man may swear <hi>secundùm rem juratam,</hi> though he know that that which hee sweares to, is against the meaning and sense of him that gives the oath; Which is such a notable piece of equivocation, and, indeed, of such dishonestie, as is not to be expressed by Us in its proper name; for no patron of equivocation hath yet out-gone it. The tenth reason pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth an undoubted truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that by swearing that confession, none of these pretended innovations is abjured. What then? Is it not sufficient, that by Our authoritie they are discharged, and referred to the tryall of a generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and Parliament? The 11. reason repeateth againe the dark parable of the March-stone which was in the sixth reason; it would breake any mans teeth to cracke it, and it is not to be hoped, that ever any man will find the pith and kernell of it; and therefore let it be as unintelligible as the sixth. The 12. reason is such a one as certainly no rationall man could ever have dreamed of: If we subscribe the confession by the Kings authoritie, then it will be thought that we acquiesce in His Majesties Declaration, and that wee are contented to be pardoned by Him, and that is such a thing as it turnes all our glorie into shame, by confessing our guiltinesse. A strange fancie, that men should account that a shame, which the Scripture calleth giving glorie unto God. But truly it is not farre from blasphemy, when they affirme, that God by the fire of his Spirit from heaven hath accepted their service: If they meane their Covenant, what more can be said of the holy Scriptures? For sure to be indited by the Spirit, and to be approved by the fire of the Spirit from heaven, is much about one; if there be any difference, the odds will seeme to lye upon the acceptation of it from heaven by the fire of the Spirit; for the Spirit descending upon the Apostles in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17348:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fierie tongues, was that which both sealed their calling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and enabled them for it, and for inditing those holy Scriptures which they wrote: And thus, before they are aware, they make themselves patrons of a notable point of Poperie, <hi>viz.</hi> That their Covenant, which sure was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by men, and so but a humane writing, is of equall authoritie with the sacred Scriptures: for if it bee appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from heaven by the fire of the Spirit, it must bee so. But Wee hope that every man will pitie this frenzie, and give no credit to it, untill they make it appeare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Us, when and where God from heaven by the fire of his Spirit did seale and approve this Covenant. The 13. reason is a mad one indeed, for it doth condemne the confession of faith which was first subscribed in 1580. upon which confession they doe solely ground their owne Covenant; for that confession hath no such oath for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of life annexed unto it: The truth is, some thing they would have said against Our Declaration, but they did not well know what: their wits were runne very low, when in an extraordinarie Vow and Covenant with God, they would put in Reformation of life, unto which every man is tied by the ordinary morall precepts, both of Law and Gospel, and by the doctrine of repentance contained in both: For the reason which is in their 14.15. and 16. Reasons, We leave it for them to find that can, We are perswaded they will lose their labour who seek it.</p>
            <p>After their Reasons, they conclude with 7. Protestations, which truly need not to be taken notice of; for being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon so weake and inconsiderable considerations, the Reader is unreasonable, like them, if he should expect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion stronger then the premises. In the preamble to them, take notice onely of their dangerous and fearfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto blasphemy, while they affirm, That the Covenant made by them was sealed from heaven. Their first Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station is utterly invalid, being <hi>Protestatio contra factum</hi>; for it is plaine to the whole World, that the rebellious distractions of that Kingdome proceed from them alone. Their second
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17348:93"/>
Protestation is void most evidently upon the same ground; for they themselves, both by their publique instructions, of which you have heard, and in their private instructions, of which you shall heare, have used many prelimitations in all the particulars against which they protest, but neither We nor any by Our authoritie have used any. The third Protestation begins with a supposition, which they themselves do know to be most false; for both Archbishops and Bishops had, at the time of this their Protestation, both by the Acts of the Church, and by the Acts of Parliament, a settled office in the Church, and have so still by Parliament, nay and by Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly too, unlesse they do pitifully begge that which will never be granted them, That their last Assembly at Glasgow was a lawfull Assembly, after Our Authoritie had dissolved it. And as it beginneth with a false supposition, so it endeth with as false and foolish a position and petition; For it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, <hi>That all these who are to undergoe any tryall at the Assembly, either upon any generall complaint already made, or upon any particular accusation to be given in against them, are to compeere at that Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, not to have voice, but as</hi> rei: upon which ground, none of themselves could have voice there; for they were all liable to tryall and censure upon any particular accusation that was to be given in against them: And then their petition is, <hi>That the warning given to the Bishops by this Our Proclamation, and this their Protestation, should be a sufficient Citation to them to appeare as</hi> rei: That their Protestation should be so; Wee protest it is so foolish a request, as We are confident no man ever heard of the like before; nor could they expect that any man, indued with reason, would yeeld unto it: And that our warning of the Bishops by Proclamation to appeare at the Assembly, as We did all the rest of the members of it, should make them appeare as <hi>rei,</hi> is such a conceit, as We wonder any man could light upon it, unlesse they doe hold, that every one of themselves was to appeare as <hi>reus</hi> too, for all of them were warned by Our Proclamation to appeare at the Assembly as well as the Bishops. In their fourth Protestation We onely admire their <hi>rare and undeniable impudence,</hi> who dare affirme,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17348:93"/>
that their Covenant is <hi>approved from heaven, with rare and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable evidences,</hi> when all the Christians in the world (except themselves and their faction) who have heard of it, doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that no such Covenant or Combination can come from Heaven, but from Hell, from whence cometh all faction and schisme. In their fifth Protestation they doe runne into an act of high treason; for they appeale from Us and Our Councell, which by an Act of Parliament is made high treason, and which they know themselves was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be so in the case of the Ministers, who held an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly at Aberdene, after it was prorogued by Our royall Father, who being cited to compeere before the Lords of the Councell to answer that high contempt, and compeering, declined the authoritie of Our royall Father and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and appealed to a Generall Assembly, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore arraigned of high treason upon that Statute before the Lord chiefe Justice of that Kingdome, and after pleading to it by their Advocates, were found by a Jurie or Assize guilty of high treason; and had received sentence accordingly, if Our royall Father, out of his singular clemencie and gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to their calling, had not reprived them before sentence, and only inflicted upon them perpetuall banishment, which they did undergoe: The Act of Parliament upon which they were arraigned was this.</p>

            <p>Their sixth Protestation is nothing but a repetition of that which they have said so oft, even unto tediousnesse: In their seventh and last, they bewray an unexempled boldnesse, in avowing their confidence of Our approbation to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of their hearts, and peaceablenesse of their waies and actions all this time past, when in their owne consciences they doe know, that We doe hold and detest their waies and actions, as most unpeaceable and seditious.</p>
            <p>And now having taken a short survey of this their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, We doe appeale to any man, who shall compare it with Our Declaration, whether Our gracious Proclamation, against which they protested, did not rather deserve an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hearty acknowledgement of Our many graces and favours towards them, with a joyfull and submissive accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them, then first to be traduced to the people before
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17348:94"/>
it was made, for a Proclamation tending to the utter ruine and subversion of the Religion and Lawes of that Church and Kingdome; and then afterward to bee encountred in publique with such an impudent, insolent, seditious, and senslesse Protestation: And lastly, after all this, to be railed at in their Pulpits, and Our people made to beleeve, that that part of it which required subscription to their owne confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of faith, but lately sworne and subscribed unto by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, was a device of the Devill, and hatched in Hell, as shall appeare by that which followed.</p>
            <p>For the next day, being Sunday, all the Pulpits of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, nay and many places where there were no Pulpits (for they heard Sermons in many Halls, and other profane and common places) did ring with bitter invectives and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations against this Our gracious Declaration, especially against that part of it which they conceived would be most satisfactorie to Our people, and prove a speciall Antidote for expelling that poyson which they had made them swallow, concerning Our declining from the Reformed Religion, and inclining to Poperie, <hi>viz.</hi> the subscription to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith now commanded by Us: For, they branded it so with most hideous and horrible names of the very depth and policie of Sathan, that the common people, who were well perswaded of the pietie of their Preachers, could not chuse but imagine that there was some wickednesse in it, which their Preachers could and did dive into though they did not. One Preacher in his Sermon prayed <hi>God to scatter them in Israel, and to divide them in Jacob</hi> who were the authors of this scattering and divisive counsell. Another Preacher in his Pulpit told his people, that the urging of this subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was an Italian and a devillish device, first to make them renounce God, and perjure themselves, and then afterward there was an intention to destroy their bodies; and so that this subscription imported no lesse then the destruction both of their bodies and soules. These and many more such false feares suggested, first from two of the Preachers of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and from them transmitted to their fellows through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:17348:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Kingdome, did worke so strongly with Our good but simple and seduced people, as that they were wrought unto a perswasion, that this subscription to their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith, commanded by Us, for removing that false opinion which their Leaders had put into their heads of Our inclination to Poperie, was of a farre deeper reach, and of more dangerous consequence, then if We had been inclined to Poperie indeed; still adding, That if they did subscribe it now by Our authoritie, it could receive no acceptation at Gods hands, God rejecting any service done to him by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint (it being very familiar with them at these times to terme obedience to authoritie constraint) but when they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed it voluntarily, or by the perswasion of their Leaders, then it was acceptable to God; and, if they durst have used such a Popish word, no question they would have added, Meritorious: And thus you see, with what undutifulnesse Our gracious Declaration was entertained.</p>
            <p>Yet it was not so received by all: For first, all the Lords of Our Councell (amongst whom were some, who never seemed to be satisfied before) were so fully satisfied, and so much overjoyed with this Our gracious Declaration, that they did condemne and utterly detest this odious Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of the Covenanters; whereupon Our Councels Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thankes and proffer of service was sent Us, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared.</p>
            <p>Next, the greatest part of the Ministers of that Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did rest satisfied with it; as shall be made evident if it come to tryall: But this is most certaine, that the Ministers assembled at Edinburgh that morning at the Gray-Friers Church by the name of the fourth Table, or Table of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters ordinarily resident at Edinburgh all this time, for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon the businesse of the Covenant, being sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the other Tables, and desired by them to send some of their number up to the great Committee of all the Tables, to joyne with them in a Protestation which was to be made that afternoone against Our Declaration, which then they expected would be proclaimed; the Ministers returned this
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17348:95"/>
answer by their whole voices (not above two or three at the most dissenting) That they would not agree to any Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which should be made against Our gracious Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unlesse it should be sent downe unto them, that it might be throughly advised upon; especially considering that they had heard so much of the contents of that Our Declaration, importing the removing of their grievances which occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Covenant, that they could not conceive the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of any Protestation. Which answer being returned to the other Tables, did so trouble them, that they sent a second message to them, intreating them presently to come up to Saint <hi>Gyles</hi> Church, and to sit there, that so being in a place of a neere distance from their great Committee, they might the more easily consult with them. Thither they came, and stayed a great while, but heard nothing from the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, who it seemes were much distracted and puzzled about the penning of their Protestation, and had certaine Ministers with them (especially <hi>Rollock</hi>) at that consultation, who were not deputed by the Table of Ministers to be present at it; and having stayed in that Church untill neere one of the clocke in the afternoone, dissolved themselves, took their leaves one of another, and resolved not to meet untill the next weeke, many of them going home presently towards their owne countrey Churches, where they were to preach the next day, being Sunday; and at their parting they deputed none to joine with the Committee from the other Tables, either to consult about, or to assist at any Protestation which should be made against this Our gracious Declaration: And all this was averred by divers Ministers then present, before divers of the Lords of Our Councell, and other persons of speciall ranke and qualitie, who likewise would have aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it before the last pretended Generall Assembly, if they durst have done it without running the hazzard of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, if not their lives: And yet in that afternoone about three of the clocke, <hi>Rollock,</hi> in the name of the Ministers, did upon a Scaffold joine with the deputies from the three other Tables, in that wicked Protestation, without deputation (as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17348:96"/>
is presumed) from the Table of Ministers, unlesse perhaps he called some few stragling Ministers about the town, of whom it may be he asked the question.</p>
            <p>Besides, many thousands of Our subjects Covenanters were fully satisfied with Our Declaration, though they durst not, as many of them have professed, subscribe this confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith urged by Us, for feare of being troubled by the major part. And it is knowne, that wheresoever Our Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was published, before that the Covenanters from their Tables sent their emissaries to disswade the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and copies of their Protestations against it, it was received with all expressions of joy and thankfull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; insomuch that when it was proclaimed at the market Crosse at Glasgow, it was assisted with all these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, both by the Magistrates and all the inhabitants, by the Principall, the Regents and Professors, by all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of that Citie, though Covenanters, who out of the great sense of the many obligations and favours, which We had laid upon that whole Kingdome, by this Our gracious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, directed their severall letters of thankes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement to Our Commissioner, which are here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</p>

            <p>NOw, besides these, in many places of the Kingdome whither they sent their Protestation to be read, it was refused by divers, who had subscribed their owne Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>The Assembly being indicted, the Covenanters did now goe about to effect all which they had plotted and designed concerning the election of the Commissioners to it, That all, and none but they, might be chosen whom they had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon, and were of the most rigid ranke, whom they were sure would receive no satisfaction, and keep all others (so farre as in them lay) from accepting of any: Their device was this; They perceived that most of the Ministers throughout the Kingdome would gladly embrace peace, if they might see their consciences satisfied in these feares and doubts, upon which they entred into the late Covenant. The Leaders resolved not to trust any such moderate men, considering that all their scruples were removed by Our last Declaration, and the indiction of a free generall Assembly; and therefore they took order by their secret instructions, that none of them should be chosen, though they were Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters: For Ministers <hi>non</hi>-Covenanters, they took order, that if in any place by pluralitie of voices such a one should bee
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17348:97"/>
chosen, then hee should be processed and protested against, (which no man could avoid) and so he should be sure to be set by at the Assembly, and cast from having any voice there. And whereas they might feare, that the rigid Ministers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by them for this Assembly, might want a sufficient number of their fellow-Ministers for their elections in their severall Presbyteries, they tooke an order, That not onely for this time, but for all times to come, there should bee no Minister chosen Commissioner from any Presbyterie to any Assembly, but such as the Laitie should make choice of: For they presently gave order from their Tables, That every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Parish should send to the Presbyterie in their bounds one Lay-man, whom they called a Ruling Elder, who by their appointment should have voice in the Presbytery as wel as the Minister of the Parish; so that when the whole Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie was assembled together, the number of the Lay-men was at the least equall to the number of the Ministers; By which new device, the Laitie gained of the Ministers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly these foure things: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, That never any Minister should bee chosen Commissioner to the Assembly, but whom they would; for they being equall in number in voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the Ministers, and sixe of the Ministers being to be put in the List, and to stand in election, out of which sixe three must be chosen, and all these sixe must be removed in the time of the election, and have no voices themselves in it, it is clear, that the number of the Lay voices in these elections must needs exceed the number of the Ministers voices at least by sixe: Or, if in some Presbyteries (as We heare was done in some few) these sixe Ministers before their removing gave voices to whom they pleased, yet (no man being able to give a voice to himselfe) of necessitie the number of the Lay voices must exceed the number of the Ministers by one. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Laitie gained this, That in all other Presbyteriall meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which are weekly, the Ministers should never have a casting voice, to determine any thing but what they liked; the Lay-men being alwaies at the least equal to them in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this they gained, That whatsoever should be
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17348:98"/>
concluded in a generall Assembly, should ever be concluded likewise in a Parliament, if Our negative voice did not stop it: (and Wee heare that they have not spared to give out, that they will take from Us and Our Successors, that which all Our Predecessours have enjoyed, that is, a negative voice in Parliament, as they have done in Assemblies, for as much as lies in them:) For by their instructions they ordered, That where any Nobleman lived in any Presbyterie, hee should bee chosen lay-Elder there for the Assembly; and all Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are hereditarie members of the Parliament: and where there wanted a Nobleman, they should chuse some speciall Gentleman, who in all probabilitie standeth faire for being chosen one of the Commissioners of the Shire for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which made the Covenanters stand so importunately for that point, <hi>viz.</hi> to have the Assembly held before the Parliament, as making just accompt, that all the lay voices in the Assembly were engaged to give their voices to the same conclusions, when they should sit in Parliament; and so, that the Parliament, for it Acts, should depend upon the generall Assembly, and the generall Assembly (for the Acts passed there) should depend upon them; but neither the one nor the other depend upon Us. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the Laitie gained this, That they exempted themselves for ever hereafter from all fears of the power of the Clergie: for they being resolved (so farre as in them lay) to overthrow Episcopall government, and yet fearing by so doing to be brought againe under the tyrannie of Presbyteriall government, of which they had heard their fathers so grievously complaine, they pitched upon this way of equall number of lay-Elders in every Presbyterie, being assured thereby to curb their Ministers, most of whom had their stipends and rents paid by these lay-Patrons; and so now the Laitie made accompt, that if in their elections to this Assembly they could compasse these conclusions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, they had brought the Church and Churchmen under for ever.</p>
            <p>These conclusions, though effected by the Laitie with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, yet received great resistance by many Ministers in most
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17348:98"/>
Presbyteries, and in some by all: For when these Lay El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders came to sit with them, they either refused to admit them, or desired time to deliberate, how they (who being Covenanters, and had complained of Innovations) could admit of such innovations as those which seemed to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the ruine of the Libertie of the Church, for these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because, that above these fortie yeares no Lay Elder had sat in their Presbyteries, and therefore it was a great Innovation: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because at the beginning of the Reformation, when there was a kinde of necessitie to require the assistance of Lay-men for the government of the Church, (Ministers being then so few and scant,) yet it was provided that they should ever be fewer in number then the Ministers, and that therefore this obtruding of themselves in equall number, was not onely an Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but directly against the book of discipline, upon which they did so much ground their proceedings: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that it was a thing never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eard nor practised before in that Church, that Lay-men had voices in the chusing of the Ministers Commissioners for the Assemblie, and therefore if they would chuse, they desired them to chuse their own Lay Commissioner, but for the Ministers Commissoners to leave it to themselves, who were better able to discerne of their Ministers abilities since they were weekly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant with them, then they whom they had never seene in their Presbyterie before.</p>
            <p>But all this opposition and arguing was fruitlesse: For the Lay Elders, according to their secret instructions from the Covenanters Tables, which afterward shall be related, would not remove, but put themselves in possession of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, and so these Ministers, and none but they, were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen in each Presbyterie whom the Tables at Edinburgh had designed: A thing so odious and distastfull to the Ministers, that in some Presbyteries, the Ministers (chosen Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners) had but eight Ministers voices, and the voices of two and twentie Lay-men, in others not above two Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters voices, in some but one; but in all Presbyteries the Ministers Commissioners were elected by the plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Layvoices. Some of these Ministers, though
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17348:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Covenanters, seeing the libertie of the Church by this meanes utterly lost and betraied, did repaire to the two Covenanting Ministers of Edinburgh, to whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned themselves, wondring that they would give way to the utter defacing of the Church by these Laick intrusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to whom they gave this answer, That they grieved for it as much as themselves, but that the necessitie of the times was such, that they must wink at it, else the Nobilitie, Gentrie, and Burrowes did threaten them with a desertion, upon which a division must follow, which by their Oath and Covenant they were bound by all meanes to prevent. But the aggrieved Ministers were not satisfied with such cold, comfortlesse, and unconscionable answers, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in many Presbyteries to draw up their Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against the Lay Elders to the Assemblie; yet they were so threatned by the Laitie, that most of them fell back and durst not adventure upon it, though others both Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; Non-covenanters had the courage to do it, but with what successe shall be declared when We come to speak of the Assemblie it selfe. Yet this We will confidently averre, That when Our Commissioner came last from that Our Kingdome, three parts of foure of all the Covenanting Ministers did detest the elections made by lay Elders, and would have declared the nullitie of all such elections if they durst have done it; and that these Ministers, (unlesse they have changed their minds since) had rather live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Episcopall government, then under the tyrannie of the Laitie and a few Ministers, from whom they have suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more in a few moneths, then ever they did under all the Bishops in the Kingdome, since Our comming to the Crowne: all which verie many of them have affirmed, both for themselves and others, to Our Commissioner, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Our Councell, and others of good credit and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whom We dare and do trust.</p>
            <p>But the elections being now past according as they had plotted them, or in good forwardnesse so to bee where they were not yet past, the Covenanters next care was, how to hinder the subscription of the confession of Faith commanded by Us, they conceiving it their master-piece
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17348:99"/>
to stop any thing (though never so well liked by themselves) if it were commanded by Our authoritie; as fearing, that if We had obedience given to Us in any one thing, Our people might recover the taste of government: And hearing that Our Commissioner was to repaire to the Colledge of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, there to tender to the Lords of Our Session, who are the supreme Judges of Our Lawes in that Kingdome, the confession of Faith and band annexed, to be sworne by Our authoritie, that very morning they set up <hi>Rollock</hi> to preach, (though it was not his ordinarie course) where many of Our Judges were present before they went to sit: There hee with many false and foolish impertinences did so labour to perswade them, that the swearing of that confession was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and plaine perjurie, that hee shewed himselfe a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and most dishonest man to most that were present, &amp; a weak man to all; and so little he prevailed, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after Sermon, the Judges repairing to their usuall place of sitting, whither Our Commissioner came presently and tendered them the said confession, all of them, except foure who were knowne to be of the false stamp, did sweare to it and subscribe it, the number of the Judges in all being twenty.</p>
            <p>And here We desire the Reader to observe, whether these men shall not be accounted a faction, and not a bodie of a Kingdome, when they shall separate themselves from Us; who are their Soveraigne, from the bodie of Our Councell, who have the supreme government of the Kingdome under Us, and from the bodie of Our Judges, who are the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of Our Lawes, and under Us the supreme Judges of all their estates and fortunes, these two Judicatories, together with Our Judges in criminall causes, being under Us, by the Lawes, constituted the onely Judges of all their actions: For if these Covenanters shall ascribe unto themselves the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, because they are more in number then those who disassent from them, then certainly in all Kingdomes and Republiques, the established government must goe downe; for in them all, they who are ruled and governed are
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17348:100"/>
farre more then the Rulers and Governours.</p>
            <p>They then seeing that their fierce endeavours were fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse with the Lords of the Session, with all speed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched some of their Tables throughout all parts of the Kingdome, to stop the subscription to the confession of faith commanded by Us, with copies of their Protestation to be read in all places, where Our Commissioners should either proclaime Our Declaration, or require subscription to that confession: In many places they prevailed, in many not; Where they prevailed, they used such indirect and violent courses, as they gained an assent from many mens mouths, whose minds were very farre from it. In Glasgow, after that the Lord Lowdan, with divers others, Noblemen, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Ministers, sent (as they pretended) from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at Edinburgh, had caused to bee read that infamous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell (of which you shall heare afterwards) against the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Glasgow in his owne Cathedrall Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of the Magistrates of that Citie; the Lord Lowdan desired the Provost of Glasgow to convocate their Towne Councell, that hee might impart some things unto them; which the Provost refused: But that Lord and his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates, understanding that their ordinarie Church Session sate that afternoone, at which the Magistrates and Ministers were to be present, came suddenly into the place where they did sit, beyond their expectation, where the Lord Lowdan made a speech of great length, concerning the iniquitie and danger of Our Covenant, adjuring them both by perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and threatnings, that they would not subscribe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith required by Us; and therefore his demand was, That he might have the assured promises of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and Ministers, that they would not subscribe it, that so he might report their answer to the Tables from whence he was sent: To which the Provost presently answered, That his Lordship knew well that Our Commissioner had required from them a subscription to Our Covenant, that they had humbly intreated of his Grace some short time to returne their answer; and therefore hee wondred that any
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17348:100"/>
man should thinke it was fit to answer any who was sent from the Tables, before they had made their answer to Our Commissioner; and so refusing to give any answer to these Emissaries from the Tables, they went away unsatisfied.</p>
            <p>The Covenanters, finding that Our commanding of the subscription of the confession of faith; in many places had given satisfaction, and had indeed confuted that lying scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of Our inclination to Poperie, and that many of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters had remitted much of their former rigour, being much taken with Our last gracious Proclamation, the Heads and swayers of the foure Tables, (as if all their designes were come to the last cast) cast about once againe, and laboured hard to worke Our people into the beliefe of this one point, That none of these things promised in Our last gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, no not the Assembly it selfe, were ever intended to bee performed by Us; That Wee onely studied to gaine time, untill Wee were ready for their ruine; and therefore they gave out, that Our Commissioners late comming from Hammilton to Edinburgh was onely to prorogue the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly. They spent daies and nights in penning a Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against it, and writing multitudes of copies to be readie in all places of the Kingdome, before the Proclamations of the prorogation should arrive. They sent for all their partie to flocke to Edinburgh, as if now there were greater danger then ever: All which was carried with notable hypocrisie; for the authors of this report did disperse it, not that they did beleeve it to be true, but because it was conduceable to their ends to have the people beleeve it.</p>
            <p>But knowing that they who do act long parts, must needs sometimes be out, and that the time of the Assembly begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to approach, and Our Commissioners provisions and preparations for his journey to Glasgow, were farre stronger proofes to Our people of Our holding the Assembly, then all which they had surmised to the contrarie, they then betooke themselves to their last shift, which was a miserable and wicked one, and it was this: Since they were perswaded that the Assembly indicted by Us would now hold if they
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17348:101"/>
could not divert it, they resolved to take such courses, as they conceived Our Commissioner neither could nor would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; with which they did conceive they should so irritate him, that he could not chuse but either discharge or prorogue the Assembly. For two things now they feared: First, that they had committed a great errour in petitioning Us for an Assembly, which they conceived was fully in their owne power to indict; and therefore did begin to thinke, that by that act they had weakned their owne power and claime, and supposed, that it had been more agreeable to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, if they had indicted one themselves, being the title which they meant to stand to, as appeareth by their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of a new Assembly, since the dissolution of this. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they were affraid of nothing more then this, that Our Commissioners propounding and passing into acts of Assembly, all the particulars of Our grace and favour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Our last Proclamation, would abundantly satisfie the greatest part of their owne partie, when they should see the grounds of their feares of innovations in Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, which occasioned them to enter into the late Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: But now, if Our Commissioner could be forced any way, either to prorogue or discharge this Assembly indicted by Us, that then they would presently indict one themselves, which they were sure We would not countenance with any Commissioner from Us; by which meanes they were both secured from having their partie weakned by Our propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Assembly Our gracious offers expressed in Our last Declaration, and were certainly perswaded, that they should easily induce Our people to beleeve, that these things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in that Declaration were never intended by Us.</p>
            <p>To compasse therefore their desires of Our Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners either proroguing or discharging the Assembly, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to increase their disorders to such a height, as they hoped hee would never endure them; and to multiply so many affronts upon him, and in him upon Us and Our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as they imagined should be past all sufferance: As first, by their letters directed from their Tables at Edinburgh,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:17348:101"/>
they quarrelled with Our Commissioner, that Our Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Covenant was commanded to bee subscribed in many parts of the Kingdome by the authoritie of Us and Our Councell, with an unbeseeming violence: The copie of their Letter to Our Commissioner, being then at Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, here followeth.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Have received from your Lordsh: and other Noblemen a Letter, containing a complaint against the violence offered to divers of his Majesties subjects, by States-men, Councellours, and others; and that complaint aggravated by your promising and undertaking, for your selfe and all your adherents, that no man should be troubled till the Generall Assembly; and your just expectation that the same course should have beene held on the other side by us.</p>
                  <p>For the former, I know not what States-men, Noblemen or Barons, your Lordsh: meanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for naming none, I know not to whom I shall take my selfe; nor doe I know what violence and threatnings you mean: If you meane his Majesties Commissioners appointed by the King, they requiring his subjects to subscribe the old Confession and Covenant, by his authoritie now renewed, and remonstrating unto them the danger they incurre by law in not obeying his Majesties commandement, I hope that cannot bee called violence but duty, the omission whereof, must needs bee a violation of, and violence offered to his Majesties sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred authority: If other violences and threatnings they have used, as your Lordsh: seemeth to intimate (for their obedience to his Majesties just authority, I am sure, your Lordsh: will not call violence) they must answer for it, and shall whensoever your Lordsh: shall make known the delinquents. But alas my Lords, Tell me now in good earnest whether you have heard they have used such violence in perswading this Covenant, as hath beene used by your adherents in inforcing of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:17348:102"/>
yours? hath the bloud of Gods servants, his holy Ministers, been shed, which bloud I am affraid keepeth the vengeance of God still hanging over this Land? have men beene beaten, turned out of their livings and maintenance, reviled and excommunicated in the Pulpits, and a thousand more outrages acted upon them, for not subscribing this Covenant? have none who have subscribed your Covenant, done it with blind and doubting minds? If they have, I beseech your Lordsh: not to call his Majesties Councellours legall proceedings, irreligious and unjust, untill you have proved the piety and justice of the proceedings of your owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents.</p>
                  <p>For the other, of your undertaking and promising for your parts, that no man should be troubled till the Assembly, and expecting the like from us, truly I am glad I have it under your Lordsh: hands; for I think there are few houres of any one day, since the indicting of the Assemblie, that from all parts of this Kingdome, I am not vexed with complaints of new processing of Ministers, new with-holding of Ministers stipends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>processed, heavie complaints of Ministers of your owne Covenant, that they are threatned, and that sharply and bitterly, for their declaring of their griefe, in being barred of their freedome in the election of their owne Commissioners to the Generall Assembly, and being borne down by the multitude of Lay voyces, and menaced because of their protesting against the same.</p>
                  <p>The complaints of Ministers Non-Covenanters and Lay-Elders Non-Covenanters, chosen by their Sessions to assist at the election of the Commissioners from the Presbyteries, but turned backe, for not having subscribed your Covenant, and reviled with bitter words, for being so pert as to come thither; is this the performance of promising, that no man shall bee troubled till the Assembly? These are, indeed, prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions verie unfit to precede this Assembly, they being so unpeaceable and like to take up much time, in discussing at that great Meeting the ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of these elections. My Lord, the truth is, I shall be as carefull to see any wrong offered by his Majesties Commissioners (in urging his Majesties authority) punished, when I shall know the offences and the offenders, as I am heartily grieved at the proceedings of your Associats: Here I am sure, his Majesties Commissioners have been rather backward then forward, but so have not your Lordsh: adherents been; for they have in verie many places proclaimed your Protestation, where his Majesties

For notwithstanding that your Lordsh: sayes we are made secure by the hopes of obtaining from his Majestie these remedies that can fully settle this Church and State, yet I may say courses are taken to put feares in his Majesties good subjects minds, by perswading of them that no such thing is intended: This does too too manifestly appeare by the watching and guarding his Majesties Castle, and many other courses; but of this I will write nothing, my intention being only to returne answer of what is writ to me: And therefore for your Lordsh: satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I shall acquaint his Majestie with the contents of your letters, who will no doubt give such directions therein, as his good subjects will have no just cause of complaint: Whereas you have been pleased to say, that you have been assured by me, that you should receive no such hard dealing, during the time of my imployment; let mee desire you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this aright, and you will find it none; for neither was that ship stayed from proceeding in their intended voyage, nor any thing taken from them: nor needs your Lordsh: to doubt that his Majestie will doe any thing (except our owne indiscretion provoke him) that may make appear to the world that he makes a difference betwixt us of this Nation and his other subjects.

               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:17348:104"/>WIth his answer they were so far from being satisfied, that to answer this affront (as they did interpret it) for searching a Ship of that Kingdome at sea, they resolved to put a greater affront upon Us, by increasing their Guards about Our Castle of Edinburgh: In Fyfe, they gave order for a Communion throughout their Churches, at which they made every one to sweare that they should not subscribe Our Confession and Covenant, nor any other but their owne, which they swore againe <hi>de novo</hi>; especially to stand to that part of it which concerneth mutuall defence against all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whomsoever. They gave generall order for the Fast to bee kept on the fourth of November, being Sunday, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the day designed in Our Proclamation, which was the Wednesday following, and the seventh of that Moneth.</p>
            <p>Our Commissioner seeing these contempts daily to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and hearing that they had appointed the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bee celebrated at Edinburgh, sent for the Provost and Magistrates, and inquired of them these particulars: First, whether at their Communion (which was to be celebrated the two next Sundaies following) it was intended, that the like oath should bee taken with them, as had been taken in Fyfe: Secondly, whether they intended to keep the Fast-day designed by Us in Our Proclamation, and according as they had lately since been required to doe, by an order sent from Our Councell to them for that purpose: Thirdly, what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they had taken with those, who had the day before revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and abused Doctor <hi>Eliot</hi> while he was preaching in the Pulpit. That he had sent for them, because he had found those few Ministers, by whom they were ruled, to bee unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, and despisers of Authoritie. To the last, they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that they would make a discoverie of the offenders, and see them punished; which they never did: For the first, they thought it most unreasonable that any oath should be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred as it was in Fyfe: For the second, they thought it most reasonable that Our Fast-day should be kept but before they could give a full answer, they must first conferre with their
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:17348:105"/>
Ministers; at their meeting with whom, they found that the Ministers had intended that barbarous oath at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and not to keep Our Fast-day more then other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the countrie had done: yet the Magistrates did with much perswasions over-rule them in both. Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner did resolve with great solemnitie, attended with all Our Councell and Judges, to keep that Fast in the great Church of Edinburgh, on the day appointed by Us, and gave notice thereof to the Magistrates; who returned him thanks, and assurance of welcome; But understanding that they were resolved to discharge the ordinarie Ministers of that Church, from preaching there that day, onely because they were Non-covenanters, and had appointed their places to be supplied with the two onely Covenanting Ministers of their Towne, he sent for the Magistrates againe, telling them, That he could not come to their Church, and countenance so great a disorder as the displacing of the two Preachers of that Church, onely because they were faithfull subjects to Us; nor durst heare these two Preachers designed by them, who in their Pulpits did ordinarily inveigh against Us and Our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: Unlesse therefore hee might either nominate the Preachers, or heare the ordinarie Preachers of that Church, he must not come thither. The Magistrates did what they could to perswade with their Ministers; the one of them was contented with Our Commissioners desire, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was so obstinate, as he would no way hearken to it; and him (being so powerfull with the people) the Magistrates durst not offend: and so Our Commissioner, with Our Councell and Judges, were necessitated to keep Our Fast at another Church hard by Our Palace. Now Wee desire the Reader to observe, how the Heads of the Covenanters were affraid that any shew of obedience should bee yeelded unto Us by Our people in the least point, they having ordered, that in most places of the Kingdome, the day designed by Us for the Fast should not be observed; certainly, onely because it was commanded by Us, as being unwilling that Wee, (whom they had given out to Our people for an Innovator in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:17348:105"/>
Religion, and an Introducer of Poperie) should be thought by them to have any care of so religious an exercise as a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Fast; And how that in Edinburgh, though the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates by their earnest intreatie had procured the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, yet they could not obtaine it without putting a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall affront upon authoritie, by displacing of those Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters who had continued in loyaltie and obedience to Us.</p>
            <p>But these were nothing to their other violences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they would have Our Commissioner take notice that it was impossible their proceedings at the Assemblie should bee pleasing unto Us: For not onely in many of their Pulpits did they preach, That whosoever subscribed Our Covenant, were perjured and villaines, but when some affirmed the contrarie, and reproved the Preachers for such furious speeches after their Sermon was ended, they were cited before their Presbyteries for so doing, and threatned with excommunication: Nay, more then so, there were few Ministers of the Kingdome, not subscribers of their Covenant, whom they did not presently processe and cite before their severall Presbyteries; and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Appeales to the Generall Assemblie then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, yet they would not shew so much patience, but proceeded to present most illegall, and unwarrantable suspending of them, and other censures, as best pleased them; which being complained of to Our Commissioner and Councell, could finde no redresse, although they sent many times to the Covenanters, requiring them to forbeare all such unjust proceedings, and to referre the triall of these oppressed Ministers causes to the Generall Assemblie, which was now at hand.</p>
            <p>None were so insolent as the Presbyterie of Edinburgh; for they presently put verie many of their Ministers under processe: They begun with one Master <hi>David Michell</hi> Minister of Edinburgh; Our Commissioner wrote ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to that Presbyterie, to forbeare proceeding against him untill the Assemblie, to the which hee had appealed, and where his cause might have a full and faire triall; which they not only most unjustly rejected, but were so unmannerly, as they did not vouchsafe to answer his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:17348:106"/>
either by message or otherwise: The next Presbyterie day he wrote to them againe to the same purpose, but with the like successe; for they proceeded without taking notice of his Letter, or returning any answer to it, although in that second Letter he had desired them, either to delay their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings that day, or else to send one or more of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to him, (being then hard by at Our Palace at Holy-rood-house) who might shew him some reason why they could not stay so long as untill the Assemblie, which was now so neere approaching. Our Commissioner wondring at this contempt, by the advice of some of the principall Lords of Our Councell, sent for an Officer of Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and directed him to them with an ordinarie warrant drawne up in an ordinarie forme by the Clerk of Our Councell, requiring them in Our name, under paine of Our high displeasure, and as they would answer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie at their utmost perill, to desist from any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in that cause untill the Generall Assemblie; to which the Defendant had appealed, and which was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin within foureteene dayes: This warrant was delivered unto them by the Officer of Our Councell, in whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience it was read, and when hee required an answer to it, hee received none, but in highest contempt of Our Crowne, Dignitie, and Royall commandement, and against all rules of Justice (the Appellants appeale to the superiour Court of a Generall Assemblie, legally depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) for doctrines preached by him foure yeare since at least, and the witnesses being all Lay-men, who (besides their no extraordinarie memorie for such a time as was laid) were men of such meane and ordinary understanding, as that it was improbable, if not impossible, that they should understand the doctrines wherewith he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and some of them being uncontroverted, and such as are generally received by all Protestant Churches in the world; they presently suspended him, and discharged him from the place of his Ministerie; and afterward, to make their contempt the greater, sent downe three of their number to tell Our Commissioner that they had done so, who offered to shew him reasons for their so doing: But
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17348:106"/>
Our Commissioner told them, That since they were not pleased to shew him their reasons before their sentence as he required, hee would not heare their reasons after their sentence as they desired. But to let passe this and many more their such unjust proceedings, against those Ministers which continued in Our obedience, in all places of the Kingdome, even when the Assemblie was readie to begin, notwithstanding these Ministers legall appeales thereunto, We shall desire the Reader to observe their proceedings in one processe, which We are confident was framed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued with such malice, injustice, falshood, and scandall, not onely to the reformed Religion in particular, but to the Christian Religion in generall, as it cannot be paralleled by any president of injustice in precedent ages, nor (We hope) shall ever be followed in future, and which if it were known amongst Turks, Pagans, or Infidels, would make them abhorre the Christian Religion, if they did think it would either countenance or could consist with such abominable impietie and injustice.</p>
            <p>It is their processe against all and everie one of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops and Bishops of that Kingdome: The Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did indeed first desire Our Commissioner, in his owne name and as hee was Our Commissioner, to grant out processe against the Archbishops and Bishops, and thereby to cyte them to appeare as <hi>rei,</hi> or guiltie persons: To whom he returned this faire answer, That he did not hold it fit to cyte them as guiltie, of whose guiltinesse hee had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions; and besides that he would be loath to do an act which should void, according to their grounds, both the Prelats places and voices in the Assemblie, they having laid it downe for a rule (though it were a false one) that parties cyted can have no suffrage there; yet if either by the Law or practice of that Kingdome, the Kings Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner or Commissioners did use to grant out any such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, hee would not refuse it, being resolved to concurre with them in any course of Justice: but he hoped that they would not make Us his master, or himselfe do any act pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the Bishops, their place and government, before they were heard, and that in the meane time for their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17348:107"/>
he would advise with some of Our Judges and Our Advocate, whether any such processe was awardable, or had usually beene awarded by Our Royall Fathers Commissioners to the Generall Assemblie, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their advice hee would doe that which should bee agreeable to Justice. From this answer of Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, they expected no satisfaction to their desire; for they themselves did know as well as any Judge or Advocate in the Kingdome, that no Commissioner either could award or ever had awarded any such processe as they required: And therefore they moved Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner once againe, that he would require Our Judges or Lords of Our Session, to grant out such processe; with which request, when Our Commissioner made Our Judges acquainted, they returned him that answer which the Covenanters knew verie well they could not chuse but make, <hi>viz.</hi> That they could grant out no processe for the compeerance of any persons before them, but those who were impleaded, and whose causes were triable before them. The truth is, Our Commissioner found by inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the Covenanters knew it perfectly well, that the ordinarie way of processe or cytation to a Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie was to passe it under the hand of the Clerk of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie, whose office is during life, if he be not legally remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, &amp; usually too under the hand of him who was Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator at the last Generall Assemblie; both which were then living and are so still: the name of the Clerk of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie being Master <hi>James Sandelands,</hi> an Advocate and Commissarie of Aberdene, and the Moderator of the last Assemblie, being the now Archbishop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi>: But they who had all this while gone on in disorderly, ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, and unjustifiable wayes, belike thought it an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruitie to keep the beaten path and tract of justice in any thing, and therefore they fell and resolved upon a way so unlike Justice, so repugnant to Religion and common ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, as one would wonder how they hit upon it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither Law nor practise for it, which was this, They caused to be drawn up a most false, odious, and scandalous Libell against the Archbishops and Bishops, with a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17348:107"/>
annexed, to the Presbyterie of Edinburgh, wherein they desired the Libell to bee admitted by them; the copie whereof, as it was exhibited by them to the said Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and afterward publikely read in all the Pulpits thereof, here followeth; which out of Our love to the Christian Religion We wish might never come to the notice of any Pagan, and out of Our love to the Religion reformed, We wish might never come to the notice of any Papist: But it cannot be concealed.</p>

And further, in the last convention of the States holden in the yeares 1625. and 1629. he did not onely keepe silence, but propound and give consent to some things which were prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the liberties of this Church, and he did oppose himselfe to the just desires and grievances which were presented in name of the Church for some of her liberties and priviledges: whereas it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that he shall be bound upon each generall Assemblie to give an account of the discharge of his Commission since the Assembly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, and shall submit himselfe to the censure of the Assembly, and stand to the determinations of it without further Appeale, and shall sue for and obtaine ratification of his carriage from the Assembly, under the paine of infamie and excommunication; but the said Master <hi>David Lindsey,</hi> and his Colleagues <hi>respectivè</hi> abovenamed, have never given an account of the discharge of his or their Commissions, nor sought nor have obtained ratification of his or their doings from the Assembly.</p>
                           <p>Whereas it was provided in the third caution, that he should content himselfe with that portion of the Benefice which should be assigned to him from his Majestie for his livelihood, not hurting or prejudging the rest of the Ministers, or any Minister whatsoever, planted or to be planted within his Benefice, and that this clause was to bee inserted in his provision: besides, when Bishops were charged in the Assembly holden in Octob. Ann. 1578. to quit the corruptions of that State, there was numbred amongst the corruptions, That they received for the maintaining of their ambition and riot, the emoluments of the Church, which might sustaine many Pastors, the Schooles and the Poor; but the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> with his Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> have tooke provision for their Benefices, and the foresaid clause was not inserted, and he and they have prejudged Ministers, Schooles, and the Poor, by taking and enjoying pluralitie of Benefices.</p>
                           <p>Whereas it was provided in the fourth caution that he should not dilapidate nor make a disposition of his Benefice without the consent of his Majestie and the generall Assembly; and for the greater warrant of this, That he should interdict himselfe to the generall Assembly not to dilapidate, nor to give consent to the dilapidation of his Benefice made by others, and that he should be contented that an Inhibition should be raised upon him to that purpose; but the said Master <hi>David

Lindsey,</hi> with his Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> have set, and take setled pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages.</p>
                           <p>Whereas in the fifth caution it is provided that he should be bound to attend his particular Congregation faithfully in all the points of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour; and that he shall be subject to the triall and censure of his owne Presbyterie and provinciall Assembly, as another Minister that bears no Commission: In like manner by divers Acts and constitutions of the generall Assemblies and Presbyteries, non residents are punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by deprivation; Yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> with his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> have been non-resident from his and their charges for many yeares; nor have they performed the duties of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours by preaching, administration of the Sacraments, visiting the sick, &amp;c. but they have deserted their charges by the space now of many yeares; neither have they in this subjected themselves to the triall of the Presbyteries and provinciall Assemblies.</p>
                           <p>That whereas in the sixth caution it was provided, That in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Discipline, collation of benefices, visitation, and all other points of Ecclesiasticall government, he shall neither usurp nor acclaim to himselfe a power or jurisdiction further over the rest of his brethren, under the paine of deprivation: and in case he did usurpe upon the Ecclesiasticall government, if the Synodall Presbyteries, or generall Assemblies did oppose, or make impediment unto him; whatsoever he did in that case should be <hi>ipso facto</hi> null, without a declaratour; yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> with his Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> have usurped a jurisdiction in the administration of Discipline, collation of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, visitation, and other points of Ecclesiasticall government, without a lawfull warrant from the Church, in exercising power to suspend, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive, command, and inhibite excommunication at their pleasure, to fine, confine, imprison, banish Ministers, and other professours without the warrant of the lawes of the Countrey; appointing their Moderators over Presbyteries and Synods, prorogating their Diets, staying their proceedings against Papists, Sorcerers, Adulterers, and other grosse of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, by exacting of contributions to such Commissioners as hee pleased to send to Court for his owne and his Colleagues affaires; by depriving, and ordaining of Ministers, not onely without the consent of the Presbyteries and Synods, but by ordaining of scandalous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified Ministers, and depriving of learned and religious Pastours; by ordaining Ministers after a forme not allowed of in this Church; by silencing Ministers for not reading the Service Book, and Book of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; by interdicting after a Popish manner, the exercises of Morning and Evening prayer in their Churches; by releasing of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Papists; by contradicting and crossing the votes of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries at their pleasure; by their pretended negative vote directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this caution; by enacting decrees of Synods without demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their votes; by changing and falsifying their Acts, when most votes had carried the contrary; by many wayes have they failed in this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are so notorious to the whole Church and to your Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17348:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that wee shall condescend upon the same when we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                           <p>Whereas in the seventh caution it was provided, That in Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and in Provinciall and generall Assemblies, he shall behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in all things, as one of the brethren of the Presbyterie, and be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their censure; yet the foresaid Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> with his foresaid Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> hath not behaved himselfe as a brother at these meetings; he disdaines to sit in Presbyteries, or to bee subject to their censures; he sitteth and over-ruleth in Provinciall Assemblies rather as a Lord then a Moderatour; and in stead of behaving himself as a brother in the generall Assemblie, hath, by threatning and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing, prejudged the liberties of the lawfull Commissioners; when they propounded, reasoned, or concluded matters conducing to the libertie of the Church, he forced them to conclude things contrarie.</p>
                           <p>That whereas it was concluded at Mount Rose, That none of them who should have vote in Parliament should come Commissioners to the generall Assembly, or have vote in it in time to come, unlesse they had authority or Commission from their owne Presbyteries for that purpose; yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> with his foresaid Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> though they had no authoritie by commission from any Presbyteries, have usurped to give votes in the last pretended Assemblies.</p>
                           <p>Whereas in the seventh chapter of the book of Policie, registrated in the register of the Acts of the Assembly, it was concluded, That in all Assemblies a Moderatour should be chosen by common consent of the whole brethren assembled together, and it hath beene so practised since the beginning of the Reformation, till he and his fellowes began to break the Cautions; yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> with his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> have usurped the place of moderation in the last pretended Assemblies, and rather domineered then moderated, to bring in novations; yea further, have directed Mandats from themselves as from the representative Church of Scotland, which name and power is only competent to generall Assemblies; he hath brought in the practice of many Innovations in the Royall Chappell, in the Abbey Church, and his pretended Cathedrall; he hath laboured not onely to hinder the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meetings of generall Assemblies of this Church, by obtaining letters and charge from Authoritie to that purpose, but also hath labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what in him lay, to take away from the Church the priviledge of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding general Assemblies yeerly, belonging to Her by the Word of God, Acts of this Church, and lawes of this kingdome.</p>
                           <p>Whereas it is provided by another caution, That <hi>Crimen ambitus</hi> shall be a sufficient cause of deprivation of him that shall have vote in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> with is foresaid Colleagues <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectivè,</hi> are guilty of the said crime, in seeking of the said offices, and promising and giving good deeds for them.</p>
                           <p>Whereas it was provided by the book of Discipline, and acts of the

Assemblie <hi>Feb. An.</hi> 1569. and <hi>December</hi> 1565. &amp; 1567. that marriage should not be solemnized without asking of banes three severall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath daies before; yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> and his foresaid Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> have given licence to sundry Ministers to solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize marriage without asking three severall Sabbaths before; upon which have followed divers inconveniences; a man hath been married to a woman her husband being alive, and they not divorced; some have been married to persons with whom they have committed adultery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and some have been married without the consent or knowledge of their parents.</p>
                           <p>Whereas by the book of Fasting, authorized by the generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, and prefixed before the Psalmes, no set or yeerly Fasts are allowed, but disallowed, as contrary to the libertie of the Church, and to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the exercise (a Fast;) yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> and his foresaid Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> have appointed yeerly Fasts, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled some godly Professors for not observing the same.</p>
                           <p>Whereas the office of a Deacon is set forth in the book of Discipline, and book of common order before the Psalmes, according to the Word of God, to have no medling with the preaching of the Word, or the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Sacraments, and by the first Confession of faith ratified in the Acts of Parliament, chapter 23. Ministers called unto particular flocks have only power of the Ministration of the Sacraments; yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> with his foresaid Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> have given a power to certain Divines whom they make Deacons (men not admitted to the calling of the ministerie) to administer the Sacrament of Baptisme, under the names and titles of preaching Deacons, and they refuse to admit diverse men to the calling of the Ministerie before they be admitted to that Order.</p>
                           <p>Whereas it is ordained by the booke of Policie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Acts of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie, that no man should receive ordination to the Ministerie without a present admission to a particular flock; yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> with his foresaid Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> have separated the Act of Ordination from the act of Admission.</p>
                           <p>Whereas according to the established order of the Church, and the Acts of the Assemblie, the ordination and admission of Ministers should be publick, in the presence and with the consent of the Congregation; yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> with his foresaid Colleagues <hi>respecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vè,</hi> have given ordination to some men in other places, not in their own Congregation; &amp; violently have thrust upon them scandalous Ministers.</p>
                           <p>Whereas Ministers who teach erroneous and corrupt doctrine should be censured by the book of Discipline, and by the Acts of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie; yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> and his foresaid Colleagues <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectivè,</hi> have taught erroneous and corrupt doctrine themselves, and by their pretended power have preferred to the Ministerie men who have taught erroneous doctrine against the Confession of Faith, and Acts of Parliament quoted in our Covenant; and they cherish and maintaine them who teach Arminianisme and Popery,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:17348:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as conditionall Election; Free will; resistibilitie of effectuall Grace; The universality of Christs death; The merit of it in Heaven and in hell; a finall apostacie of the Saints; The locall descent of Christ into hell; That Christ came into the world <hi>clauso Virginis utero</hi>; auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Papall absolution; That the Pope is not Antichrist; That the Church of Rome is a true Church; That reconciliation with Rome is a thing easie; That the Church of Rome erres not in fundamentals; and that she differs not in fundamentals from the reformed Churches; They call in question the imputation of Christs righteousnesse, and they affirme the formall cause of justifying faith, to consist in our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteousnesse; They affirme that there is a locall and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptive presence of Christ in the Sacrament, and they change the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament into a Sacrifice, and the Table into an Altar, the Ministers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Priests. There are other damnable and hereticall points of Doctrine which they maintaine; of which we shall give particular information in our particular accusation of each one of them <hi>respectivè,</hi> with the proofes thereof, when we shall be required.</p>
                           <p>Whereas by the Acts of the Church, no oaths or subscriptions should be required from those who enter into the Ministerie, but to the Confession of faith, and to the book of Policy; yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey</hi> with his foresaid Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> without a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Church or Parliament, doe exact diverse oathes and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions from them who enter into the Ministerie; namely, That they should both in publick and private prayers commend the Prelats to Gods mercifull protection; That they should be subject to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which were now in the Church, or by the consent of the Church, that is, by their consent (as they affirme) should be established; as to the Service Book, and to the Book of Canons. The heavinesse of this grievance made the most part of his Majesties subjects to complaine in these Articles, that worthy men which have testimonies of their learning from Universities, and are tryed by Presbyteries to be fit for the worke of the Ministerie, and for their gifts and lives were much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by the people; yet these men are kept out because they could not be perswaded to subscribe and swear unto such unlawfull oaths, which have no warrant from the Acts of the Church, nor the laws of the Kingdome; and they were Articles and oaths conceived according to their pleasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and men of little worth, and ready to sweare, were for by-respects thrust upon the people, and admitted to the most eminent places of the Church, and of the Schools in Divinity, which breeds continuall complaints, and moves the people to run from their owne parish Churches, refusing to receive the Sacrament from the hands of Ministers set over them against their hearts, which makes them not to render unto them that honour which is due from the people to their Pastours; and it is a mighty hinderance to the Gospel, to the soules of the people, and to the peace of this Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                           <p>Whereas in the Assembly holden at Edinburgh, in March, ann. 1578.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17348:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it was declared that it was neither agreeable to the word of God, nor to the practice of the Primitive Church, that the Administration of the Word and Sacraments, and the ministration of civill and criminall justice should be confounded, that one person could supply both the charges, but that a Minister should not be both a Minister and a Senator in the Colledge of justice. And in the Assembly holden in October <hi>An.</hi> 1578. it was reckoned amongst the corruptions of the State of Bishops, which they were charged to forgoe, that they should usurp a criminall jurisdiction, that they should not claime unto themselves the titles of Lords, that they should onely be called by their owne names, or bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey,</hi> with his foresaid Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> have assumed to themselves the titles and honours of Lords, they did sit as Senators in the Colledge of justice, as Councellors in the Privie Councell, as Auditors in the Exchequer, and have enjoyed prime Offices of State. The pretended Bishops have usurped the place and precedencie before all Temporall Lords, the pretended Archbishops before all the Noble Earles of the land, and the pretended Primate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the prime Officers of State in the land.</p>
                           <p>Whereas by the Word of God and Acts of the Assembly, namely, <hi>Anno</hi> 1576. 1577. and 1578. no man should be suffered to be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, unlesse hee be tied to a particular flocke and congregation; and not to be tied to a particular flocke it is condemned as a corruption of the state of Bishops which they were charged to forgoe; yet the said Master <hi>David Lindsey,</hi> with his Colleagues <hi>respectivè</hi> foresaid, are Ministers, and will not be tied to particular flockes.</p>
                           <p>Whereas the office of a Bishop (as it is now used within this Realm) was condemned by the booke of policie, and by the Act of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly holden at Dundee, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. whereof these are the words; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the office of a Bishop (as it is now used and commonly taken within this Realme) hath no sure warrant from authoritie, nor good ground out of the Scriptures, but it is brought in by the folly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the inventions of men, to the great hurt of the Church, The whole Assembly of this Church with one voice, after liberty given to all men to reason in the said matter (no man opposing himself to maintain the said pretended office) doe find and declare the said pretended office, used and termed as is abovesaid, unlawfull in it selfe, as having neither ground nor warrant within the Word of God; and we doe ordaine that all such persons which doe, or shall hereafter, enjoy the said office, shall be charged simply to dismisse, quit, and leave the same, as an office unto which they were not called by God; and that they shall leave off all preaching, ministration of the Sacraments, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offices of Pastors, untill such time as they receive admission <hi>de novo</hi> from the generall Assembly, under the paine of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be used against them; and if they be found disobedient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this Act in the least point, after due admonition, the sentence of excommunication shall be executed against them. And for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter execution of the said Act, it is ordained that a Synodall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie

shall be holden in everie Province (in which usurping Bishops are) 18. <hi>August</hi> next to come, in which they shall be cyted and summoned by the Visitors of the said Countries to compeere before their Synodall Assemblies; as namely, The Archbishop of S. Andrewes to compeere at Saint Andrewes, The Bishop of Aberdene in Aberdene, The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Glasgow in Glasgow, the Bishop of Murray in Elgin, to give obedience to the said act, which if they refused to do, that the Synodall Assemblies shall appoint certaine brethren of their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries to give them publike admonitions out of their Pulpits, and to warne them, if they disobey, to compeere before the next Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie to be holden at Edinburgh 20. <hi>Octob.</hi> to heare the sentence of excommunication pronounced against them for their disobedience: and to this act the Bishop of Dumblane that then was, agreed, submitting himself to be ruled by it: it was also condemned by the act of Glasgow <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. which doth ratifie the former act of Dundee, and ordaines the book of policie, which was approved by severall Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to be registrated in the books of the Assemblie, and enjoyned the generall confession of faith to be subscribed by all his Majesties Lieges, Yet hath the said Master <hi>David Lyndsey</hi> with his foresaid Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> not onely incroached upon the liberties of Presbyteries and Synods, but hath also took Consecration to the office of a Diocesan Bishop, without the knowledge or consent of the Church, and against the acts of it, claiming the power of ordination and jurisdiction, as due to him by that unwarrantable office.</p>
                           <p>Besides, the said Master <hi>David Lyndsey</hi> with his foresaid colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> have, against the Lawes of the Church and Kingdome, brought in the Service book, the book of Canons, and the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission Court, and would have changed and overthrowne the whole frame of doctrine of Gods word, the use of the Sacraments, the Discipline, Liberties and Priviledges of this Church and State, if the Lord had not prevented them; The particulars wee shall present to your wisdomes, though it bee knowne to all men, how hee and they have abused his Majesties authoritie against his Royall intentions and Declarations, they having moved discontents betwixt the King and his subjects, by scandalous lies betwixt subject and subject, for which things complaints have been given in to the Councell, which we hold heare to be repeated as a part of our complaint, and to be tried by your wisdomes, and referred to the Assemblie.</p>
                           <p>Besides all these faults, the said Master <hi>David Lyndsey</hi> with his Colleagues <hi>respectivè,</hi> in his life and conversation is slandered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly as guiltie of excessive drinking, whoring, playing at Cards and Dice, swearing, profane speaking, excessive gaming, profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sabbath, contempt of the publike ordinances and private familie-exercises, mocking of the power of preaching, prayer, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conference, and sincere professors; besides, with briberie, simonie, selling of Commissariots places, lies, perjuries, dishonest dealing in civill bargaines, abusing of thir vassals, and of Adulterie, and

complainers did and do referre the same to the next Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie to bee holden at Glasgow 21. <hi>November.</hi> And we ordaine the publishing of this complaint, and of our reference of it to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, to be fully read by all the Pastors of the Presbyterie upon the next Sabbath before noone out of their Pulpits, with a publike warning and cytation to the offendants complained upon; By name, Master <hi>John Spotswood</hi> pretended Archbishop of Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> Master <hi>Patrick Lyndsey</hi> pretended Archbishop of Glasgow, Master <hi>Thomas Sydserfe</hi> pretended Bishop of Galloway, Master <hi>David Lyndsey</hi> pretended Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Edinburgh, Master <hi>Alexander Lyndsey</hi> pretended Bishop of Dunkeld, Master <hi>Adam Bannatine</hi> pretended Bishop of Aberdene, Master <hi>John Gutherie</hi> pretended Bishop of Murray, Master <hi>John Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> pretended Bishop of Rosse, Master <hi>George Greme</hi> pretended Bishop of Orknay, Master <hi>John Abernethie</hi> pretended Bishop of Caithnes, Master <hi>Walter Whitefoord</hi> pretended Bishop of Brichen, Master <hi>James Wedderburne</hi> pretended Bishop of Dunblane, Master <hi>James Fayrley</hi> pretended Bishop of Argyle, Master <hi>Nail Campbel</hi> pretended Bishop of the Isles, to be present at the said Assemblie, to answer to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in generall, and to the particular heads of it, to undergo the triall and censure of it, and to bring with them the books and scroules of the subscriptions and oaths of them who enter into the Ministerie, the books of the High Commission, and the book of the Generall Assemblie, which they either had or have fraudulently put away; and if any Pastor within this Presbyterie refuse to publish this cytati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we require the Reader of the Church to do it.

            <p>NOw though the verie reading of this Libell cannot chuse but work a detestation of it in the heart of everie religious and just man, yet the Reader shall do well to take a more speciall notice of these particular passages of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice and impietie in it: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that the Presbyterie of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh taketh cognisance of the cause, and accordingly makes cytation, not onely of the Bishop of Edinburgh, over whom they can have no jurisdiction, but of all the rest of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17348:113"/>
the Archbishops and Bishops, of which none at all, or certainely if any, verie few, are inhabitants within the bounds of their Presbyterie: And who before this, did ever heare that any Consistorie or Judicatorie, Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or Civill, could make processe against any man, or take cognisance of the cause of any man, who was not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, nor had any charge or estate within the Precincts or bounds of those places, which onely are liable to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of that Court? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next, who did ever heare that men should wittingly and willingly cyte others to answer for the transgression of acts and Lawes which they themselves do know were repealed by posteriour acts and Lawes; and so stood at the time of this cytation, and therefore can no wayes be censurable for them, though it were true that the person cyted had done as it is alledged in the Libell, and such be these acts of Assemblie cyted by them, which were and still are disanulled by divers acts both of Assemblie and Parliament: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, who did ever heare that men should be called in question for yeelding obedience to acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Generall Assemblie, and yet in this Libell the Prelats are charged with giving voices in Parliament, and practising the five Articles of Perth, and divers other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which then were and are now still in force by acts both of Parliament and Assemblie: and if it should be said that these acts were unduly obtained, which is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters onely plea, sure to say so is a greater fault then the other; for what Judge can ever give sentence in any cause, if the asseveration of the partie aggrieved by the sentence, that the Law was unjustly made, may passe for a good plea? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, who ever heard that men should bee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with yeelding obedience to acts commanded by the authoritie of Us and Our Councell, especially in things not repugnant to any established Law of that Church and Kingdome? and yet such are all these pretended Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with the introduction whereof the Prelats are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this Libell: for they were injoyned and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded first by Us, and then by acts of Our Councell, it being farre more agreeable to reason to complaine of the Lords of Our Councell, by whose authoritie they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:17348:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then of those who in dutifull obedience to authoritie did practise them: But indeed it is to bee wondred at, with what face the Covenanters can blame either the one for commanding, or the other for practising them: For what ground have they, or did they ever yet alledge, for their swearing to the Confession of Faith and their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant annexed? Did they ever yet alledge any but the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Our Royall Father and his Councell, who by their authoritie commanded them to bee sworne throughout the Realme? And did not We and Our Councell by equall authoritie command these pretended Innovations? Was not then the Prelats practice of them as well warranted, as this Confession of Faith and the band annexed, which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brought in by acts of Parliament or Assemblie, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Our Royall Fathers Prerogative, and put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the authoritie of his Councell? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, who did ever heare that men professing Pietie and Religion, durst adventure in the sight of God, in the house of God, and in the Pulpit, which is as it were the Chaire of God, and in the face of the Congregation, which is the people of God, to command the Bishops to be indited and accused of such horrible crimes, as <hi>whoring, excessive drinking, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive gaming, swearing, profane talking, profanation of the Lords day, contempt of Gods publike ordinances, neglecting pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in their families, mocking of the power of preaching, prayer, and spirituall communication; briberie, simonie, lying, perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, unhonest dealing in civill bargaines, adulterie, incest,</hi> and what not? We do even appeale to their owne consciences, whether they did thinke all of them, or any one of them, guiltie of all these crimes: Most certainly they did not; and that excuse which they bring for the justifying of this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Libell cannot any wayes extenuate their fault: They say that some particulars contained in the whole Libell may be proved against everie one of them, and therefore it is a good and a legall Libell, if they can make good any thing contained in it: But bee it legall or not, the world must needs take notice that it is most unconscionable. The other things mentioned before, and charged upon them in this Libell, are not crimes at all, being warranted by acts
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17348:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Parliament, Assembly and Councell; these last rehearsed are crimes indeed, odious in the sight of God and man, and of which, as if they be guilty, the Bishops deserve death and exquisite torments; so, if they who have accused them of these crimes, shall faile in proving them to bee guiltie, they deserve to bee infamous throughout all generations, for the most malicious and malignant traducers of the servants of God, that ever lived upon the earth, and must looke for the unavoidable judgements of God to fall upon them and their whole families for this so horrible a crime, committed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully against the knowledge of their owne consciences, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they doe expiate it with the bitter teares of repentance: For We desire them to declare <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> whether they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves did beleeve or conceive all the Bishops accused in the Libell, or onely some of them to bee guiltie of these last recy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted crimes: If not all, but some, why did they not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them, that the people might know whom they should take for guiltie, and whom for not guiltie? Nay, did they not beleeve and know, that some of these Bishops were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned men, free from the crimes objected? For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, We will onely name the Bishop of Edinburgh, seeing in the principall Presbyterie of his Diocesse this Libell was presented, admitted, and publiquely read in the Churches within the Precincts of it: did they then, or doe they yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve or suspect that he was guiltie of <hi>incest, adulterie, excessive whoring, gaming, drinking, dicing, swearing, &amp;c. ut supra?</hi> We doe verily beleeve, that if they were judicially called, they would absolve him from such foule crimes; how then they can answer to God, men, or their owne consciences, for accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that reverend, learned, and holy Prelate of such crimes, for which they themselves would be his compurgators, We must leave it to themselves to resolve: Nay, what if they themselves did not beleeve any one, not the most hated of all the Prelates to be guiltie of these last recyted crimes? Sure, the presumptions are very pregnant and unanswerable, that they did not beleeve it: for at the generall Assembly, when the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Bishops causes came to bee heard and discussed upon
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17348:115"/>
this Libell, they did not so much as offer to make any proofe of these last rehearsed crimes against them, they examined not so much as one witnesse upon them in discussing the processes of many of the Bishops: And in the printed Acts of their pretended Assembly (as shall appeare by those passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it in their place) in their particular sentences of depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and excommunication, they not onely do not censure them for these crimes, but doe not so much as take notice of them: And it is well knowne, that these men who in all their proceedings had made everie Bishops moat a beame, were not so mercifully or compassionately affected towards them, that they would have spared them, or forborn to make proofe of these crimes, if they had seene but colour for it. If they shall say, that though they could not prove these crimes, yet there was a publique scandall of them; There was indeed a scandall raised amongst them, and that publique enough, when it was proclaimed in the Pulpits; But by whom was it raised? even by the principall Covenanters themselves, who were resolved to raise a fame when they were sure they could prove no fact: or if they should alledge that they did forbeare probation, or examining of witnesses, out of their respect either to the Bishops calling or their persons, they will hardly find credit with any one; For who will thinke they did it out of the respect of their calling, which they have given out for Popish and Antichristian? or out of respect of their persons, whom they have scandalized in so many great and publique congregations of the Kingdome, infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in number those who were present at the Assembly? The plaine truth then was this: They could easily slander them with these crimes in the Churches, but they were sure they could make no proofe of them at the Assembly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who did ever heare, that the forme of proceeding of Presbyteries in that Kingdome was by reading of the Libell in any Church? the custome being to cyte them personally where they may be found; or if they be not to be found, by leaving both the cytation and copie of the Libell at the place of their dwelling; or if the partie bee out of the Kingdome,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:17348:115"/>
by cyting him publiquely in the Church, and afterward ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him with a copie of the Libell upon his coming home and appearance: and if he doe not appeare, by proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him <hi>tanquam pro confesso</hi>; which forme was observed by them in the processing of all the Ministers, whom at this time they suspended and transmitted over to the generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, none of their Libells being publiquely read in Churches: But with the Bishops they proceeded other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, against all course of Law, made the Libell against them bee read publiquely in the Churches, and that after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them, upon the Covenanters owne knowledge, had been served with it by the Officers of that Presbyterie; so that there was no use of any further publique citation, perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall citation being already made: Nay, and to doe it upon a Sunday, though that morning the Magistrates of Edinburgh, by Our Commissioners speciall commandement, required them to forbeare: Nay, yet to publish that infamous Libell in their Churches, upon a day when the holy Communion was solemnly administred; Nay, and in the Colledge Church where <hi>Rollock</hi> is Minister, (because it was late, and after noone before all the people had received) to have the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie thanks-giving and praiers after the Communion quite omitted, and the afternoone Sermon begun without any precedent praier, and all to gaine time for the reading of this lewd Libell, as if it had been of greater consequence then either the thanks-giving or praiers after the holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the reading of those Lessons and Chapters of sacred Scripture, or using of praier, which are duties usually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before Sermon: Nay, to have this Libell read in the afternoone, directly against the Act of the Presbyterie which appointed it to be read in the forenoone, and to have it read neither by Minister nor Reader, as the Act enjoyneth, but by a Lay-man, and a fierie Advocate: All these put together, let the Reader judge whether here were not many acts, first of injustice, then of impietie; As drawing along with them the profanation and violation of the Lords house, the Lords day, the Lords holy Communion, the Lords service and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17348:116"/>
worship in both parts of it, Praier and Preaching. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, the Reader shall doe well to observe in the Preface of this Libell, what a harmlesse and hazzardlesse mustring and training of their men they make: For all the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being now one grosse bodie, sworne to one Covenant, and to mutuall defence one of another, without admitting any motion which shall tend to the division or breaking of their rankes, see how they divide themselves, onely to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their armes, and to make them perfect in their postures and motions; after they have cast themselves in severall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, they fall to skirmishing, not in earnest, but in jest, to please themselves and the spectators: For since they could not all be Judges, and Commissioners of the Assembly, they make their fellow-Covenanters not elected Commissioners, to be Plaintiffes; so that indeed upon the point, the Plaintiffes and Judges are all one: for they having all sworne and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured (as they say themselves) the principall things to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the Assembly, the same actors before they came from their Tables at Edinburgh, sorted and divided their parts, appointed some to bee chosen Commissioners, and so to act the part of Judges, and others of themselves to draw a Libell against those whom they should nominate, so they should act the part of Plaintiffes: In the meane time, what was like to become of the poore Defendants and the parties cited? whether they were not like to bee killed in this play, let the spectators deliver their opinions: And this now is that Libell, with which the Covenanters did undoubtedly compasse their owne end, which was, to raise up in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple an utter abhorring of the present Bishops persons, and an irreconcilable hatred against both their persons and calling; but with what religion, justice, and honestie they have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it, others besides themselves, both in heaven and earth, must judge and give sentence.</p>
            <p>As this of the Libell was a tricke of falshood, so about this time there was put upon the people a notable tricke of forgerie, which was this: There was a maid, whose name is <hi>Michelson,</hi> her father was a Minister; and when he died left
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17348:116"/>
her young, she hath been for many yeeres distracted by fits: Upon this young Maids weaknesse some were pleased to worke, and to report her for one inspired with a spirit of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination; and finding, that out of her blind zeale shee was wonderfully affected with their Covenant, and that in her raving fits her words tended all, or for the most part, to the admiration of it, and detestation of the opposers of it; and perceiving, that shee was well skilled in the phrases of the Scripture, and had a good memorie, so that shee could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the bitter invectives, which both in the Pulpits and elsewhere shee had heard made against the Bishops and the Service-booke, they thought her a very fit instrument to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the people, and cryed her up so much, that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was made beleeve her words proceeded not from her selfe, but from God. Thence was that incredible concourse of all sorts of people, Noblemen, Gentlemen, Ministers, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of all rankes and qualities, who watched or stayed by her day and night, during the time of her pretended fits, and did admire her raptures and inspirations, as coming from Heaven: She spake but at certaine times, and many times had intermissions of daies and weekes, in all probabilitie, that she might have time to receive instructions, and to digest them against the next time of exercising her gifts (as they call them;) which so soone as shee was ready to begin, the newes of it was blowne all the Towne over, and the house so thronged, that thousands at every time could find no accesse. The joy which her auditors conceived for the comfort of such a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger from Heaven, and such messages as she delivered from thence, was many times expressed by them in teares, by none more then by <hi>Rollock</hi> her speciall Favourite; who being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red sometimes by the spectators to pray with her, and speake to her, answered, That he durst not doe it, as being no good manners in him to speake while his Master was speaking in her. Now, that shee was set up by the Covenanters, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade their ends with the people, there bee two reasons which may induce the Reader probably to beleeve: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that they of best judgement, who were present at the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17348:117"/>
time of her pretended raptures, did affirme, that they saw nor could observe nothing supernaturall in them; they onely found she had a good memorie, especially of that which she had read in the Scripture, or had heard preached: that shee had a very good expression of her selfe, but yet they found that both shee knew that shee was speaking, and what shee was speaking (contrary to that report which went about of her) and that while she was speaking, if she were interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any questions, shee made very pertinent answers to them, which could not have been, if all that time shee had been transported with any supernatuall rapture. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because most of all that shee spake, still tended to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters ends: when she spake of Christ, she ordinarily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him by the name of Covenanting Jesus: The summe of her speeches for the most part was, that it was revealed unto her from God, that their Covenant was approved and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Heaven; but that Our Covenant was an invention of Sathan; that all the adherents to it should bee confounded, as all the adherents to the former were and should be protected by God, the author of their Covenant, against all opposition whatsoever; which speeches of hers were averred by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters with as great confidence, and admired by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with as much veneration, if not more, as any other of their Pulpit Dictats: which presumptions did make very many (both Covenanters and others) thinke, that the crying up of this Maid, did looke something like a Romish impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
            <p>Let all this rebellious behaviour, and these contempts of Our Commissioner and Councell, interveening betweene Our last gracious Proclamation of the indiction of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, and the day of the Assembly neere at hand, bee laid together, and what judgement can any man make of them, but that they were devised and practised principally for this purpose, That Our Commissioner might prorogue or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Assembly, from whence by these strange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings hee could not have the least hope of any good: and if hee should discharge it, they were sure they should gaine
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:17348:117"/>
some credit with their partie, whom they had made beleeve that hee never intended otherwise, as also, should indict an Assembly themselves, which they made full accompt to doe; which appeareth both by the tenour of the Commissions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to their severall Commissioners, both from Presbyteries and Burrowes, which run thus: <hi>We give you full power to appeare for Us at this Assembly now indicted the</hi> 21. <hi>of November next, wheresoever it shall happen to be,</hi> not naming the place, Glasgow, where Wee had appointed it, hoping that it should bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued; in which case they intended to hold it at Edinburgh, the seat of their Tables, As also by divers of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Letters written to that purpose; the copie of one, written by the Lord of Balmerino, We here exhibit to you.</p>

            <p>IN the first of these, there is a meeting appointed of all the Commissioners, first at Edinburgh, then at Glasgow, which was (no doubt) to agree upon the conclusions to bee made in the Assembly, before the Assembly should assemble: In the second and third you see a course taken, That both from Presbyteries and Burrowes, the severall Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners shall have numbers of Assistants, without whose advice the Commissioners were to conclude nothing; a thing never heard of before at any Assembly of that Church; and by which multitude they meant to terrifie all those, who in Glasgow should offer to oppose or speake against them. In the fourth, to the high contempt of Our Authoritie and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, they appoint another day for the publique Fast then was by Us designed. In the sixth, they order that all these who had subscribed Our Covenant and Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:17348:119"/>
should bee presented as publique offenders.</p>
            <p>These new instructions, especially that Article which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed so great troupes to repaire to Glasgow, all which (as Our Commissioner was informed) meant to goe thither with Armes, and in hostile equipage, which is most severely prohibited by the Lawes of that Our Kingdome, moved Our Commissioner and Councell, by publique Proclamation at the Crosse of Edinburgh, severely to interdict any Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner for the Assembly at Glasgow to travell thither, or to continue there with more attendance then those of their owne family and ordinarie retinue; and that they should carrie with them no other Armes, but such as were allowed by the Lawes of that Kingdome, under the paines and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties contained in the said Lawes. This Proclamation they onely answered with a Protestation, yeelding no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it; for they travelled to Glasgow in great troupes, carrying with them prohibited and warlike Armes.</p>
            <p>It is easie now to be conceived, that Our Commissioner could expect no good from this Assembly, the preparations whereunto were so full of rebellion and tumult; and the precedent elections of the members whereof had induced many legall, unavoidable, and undeniable nullities of it: yet because Our people should clearely see the realitie of Our royall intentions, and the Covenanters partie might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how they had beene abused by the reports which their leaders had dispersed, That We meant nothing lesse then to keepe this Assembly; and principally, that in that Assembly We might fully make good to all Our subjects, whatsoever We had promised in Our last gracious declaration, (the heads of the Covenanters having mainly laboured with them that point, <hi>viz.</hi> that We never meant to performe what therein We had promised) Our Commissioner began his journie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Glasgow, and arrived there on the 17. day of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in a quiet and peaceable manner, none of his traine car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with them any prohibited armes: There met him at Glasgow all Our Councell by Our direction, according to a Letter which We had written unto them, requiring them to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:17348:119"/>
assist him all the time of his being there, with their best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and counsell: Our Letter to them here followeth.</p>

the Archbishop of S. Andrewes the late Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, had lately delivered up unto Us Our Great Seale of that Kingdome, which being by Us for a time deposited into the custodie of Our Commissioner untill We should otherwise dispose of it, it was thought fit, that Our Commission to him should be attested, not onely by Our Great Seale, which he then had in his custodie, but by Our Privie Seale also, which was in the keeping of the Lord Privie Seale: After the Commission read, Our Commissioner exhorted them to a peaceable and moderate carriage, touching a little (but with great discretion) the disorderly proceedings which had been used before their meeting: At which a Nobleman Lay-Elder presently took fire (an undoubted presage of their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding carriage) and answered sharply, That they had given his Grace content for all their proceedings; to which Our Commissioner replyed, That hee had never yet received any satisfaction from them in any of their proceedings, and, by way of attestation, called God to witnesse to it: It had like to have growne to a hot contestation, but that that night the Assembly was dismissed. The next day upon their first sitting down, they urged presently the choice of a Moderatour; but Our Commissioner desired first Our Letter to the Assembly to be read, which was done, and it was thus:

            <p>THen they called againe for the choice of a Moderator, at which time one Doctor <hi>Hammilton</hi> presented to Our Commissioner a Declinator and Protestation in the name of the Bishops against the Assembly, containing the nullities of it, with a desire that it might be read, and a publique Act en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for the production of it: Upon this there arose a very great heat in the Assembly, they alledging, that nothing could be done untill a Moderator was chosen; and they did directly refuse to reade the said Declinator: upon which both Our Commissioner entred a Protestation in Our Clerke of Registers hands against the refusall of it, and tooke instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereupon; and so likewise did Doctor <hi>Hammilton</hi> in the name of the Bishops. At last they proceeded to the choice of a Moderator, to which, before Our Commissioner gave way, hee entred (as before) another Protestation, that their Act of chusing should neither prejudice Our Prerogative and Authoritie, nor any Law or Custome of that Church and Kingdome, nor barre him (when he should see cause) from taking legall exceptions, either against the person elected, or the illegalitie of his election: And so they having put divers other stales upon the List, accordingly as it was resolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before at their Tables in Edinburgh, without one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie voice except his owne, who could not chuse himselfe, one Master <hi>Alexander Henderson,</hi> the prime and most rigid Covenanter in the Kingdome, was chosen Moderator.</p>
            <p>The third day Our Commissioner, at their first meeting, required againe that the Bishops Declinator and Protestation might be read, which hee conceived they had promised after the Moderator should be chosen: but they rejected it againe, adding then, that the Assembly must be fully constituted of all it members, and bee once an Assembly, before any thing
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17348:122"/>
could be presented to it: To which it was answered by Our Commissioner, That hee required it onely to be read, not to be discussed untill the members of the Assembly were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by allowing of their severall Commissions, because this Declinator contained reasons why either all, or at least some elected, should not be admitted Commissioners in the Assembly, because of the nullities of the elections expressed in the Declinator; which reasons containing the said nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, might perswade (as they hoped) with them, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting their Commissions, which could not bee done after their approving and allowing of them, and so by vertue of these Commissions, admitting them for constituted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Assembly. The reason why Our Commissioner did so earnestly urge the reading of that Declinator, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did fore-see the fallacie which they meant to use, <hi>viz.</hi> The Declinator cannot be read before the Assembly bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted; and they fearing that the Declinator contained rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against the constitution of it by such members as were elected, and that after they were once admitted, it was too late to alledge any reasons; for then they were sure to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that all elections were discussed, and the members of the Assembly received, and therefore nothing then to bee heard against either; which indeed afterward was their very answer: There was nothing left here to Our Commissioner, but entring a Protestation as formerly, and solemnly calling themselves to witnesse, whether with any shew of justice the reading of the Bishops Protestation could bee denied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the elections were admitted, the principall aime of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to shew reasons why they could not be admitted, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with what colour or face they (above all men) could doe it, who had read and published so many Protestations both against Our Proclamations and Acts of Our Councell; and so, how they could denie to Our Commissioner a thing required in Our name, and by Our authoritie, which they themselves had practised without any warrantie or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at all: But all in vaine; for not the least resolution taken at Edinburgh must suffer any abatement: and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:17348:122"/>
the reading of the Declinator, they first put by the Clerke of the Assembly his sonne, who by reason of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sicknesse had a lawfull deputation from him, and whom (as it seemeth) they afterward wrought to a demis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and went on to the election of a new Clerke, whom without one contrarie voice they did chuse, <hi>viz.</hi> one Master <hi>Archibald Johnston</hi> an Advocate, the Clerke of their Tables at Edinburgh; against whose election Our Commissioner like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise protested as formerly. At his admission hee made a short speech, declaring (against his conscience) his unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to accept that charge, but yet affirming, that at this time hee would not bee wanting to contribute his part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the defence of the prerogative of the Sonne of God; as if that now had been in any danger.</p>
            <p>The fourth day they begun the reading of the severall Commissions. Our Commissioner, as formerly, entred a Protestation to take exception against their elections, in his owne due time; onely hee was content they should goe on, that he might see their justice in allowing or disallowing the elections, of which he knew many to be very untoward, and made with violence: Now the Reader is carefully to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their partialitie in admitting or rejecting elections: for wheresoever there was a Non-covenanter chosen (of which number there were not above two or three) or any mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Covenanter, not designed by them at Edinburgh, and chosen according to their secret instructions (with which the Reader shall afterward be made acquainted) them they either quite rejected, or suspended from voice, untill some excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made against their election should bee discussed; which they were sure should never bee done: as shall now appeare in these particulars.</p>
            <p>When the Commission from the Presbyterie of Peebles was read, there was presently read a Protestation and Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given in by a meane Minister of that Presbyterie, not against the election it selfe (for there did not appeare the least shew of exception against it when the Act of the Presbyterie was read) but against some violence pretended to be used by
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:17348:123"/>
Our Lord Treasurer, who, being an inhabitant within the precincts of that Presbyterie, was present at the election: The petition was conceived in very boisterous and uncivil terms: The Lord Treasurer answered all that was pretended so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that not any one in the Assembly seemed to bee unsatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; there being not one election returned which was more punctually made, and that even according to their owne publique instructions: yet because the Commissioners ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, though Covenanters, were not the same who had been designed at Edinburgh, nor such as another Lord, dwelling in that Presbyterie, who was a Lay-Elder and Covenanter, had a mind to, the approbation of that Commission, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of these Commissioners most shamefully was put off and respited, untill that Petition and Protestation might be examined; and so it was continued from time to time, though it were often called upon: Our Commissioner told them, That sure there were none present, who did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at these proceedings; and that if the Petitioner failed in his probation (which afterward hee did, and asked pardon for it) hee deserved some exemplarie punishment to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon him, who had dared to traduce so great an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of State: In this particular it was too plain, that the poore Minister was onely set on to present this Protestation for the reasons now declared.</p>
            <p>After this, there arose a very hot contestation, concerning the election of the Lay-Elder for the Presbyterie of Brichen: The Earle of Montrose presented one Commission in which the Laird of Dunn was chosen Lay-Elder by the voyce of one Minister, and a few Lay-Elders: There was another Commission presented by that Presbyterie, in which was returned the Lord Carnaegie, lawfully chosen by the voyces of all the rest of the Ministers and Lay-Elders; yet because the Earle of Montrose did oppose the election of the Lord Carnaegie, though his owne brother in law, all the Covenanters in the Assembly sided with the Laird of Dunn, for whom the Earle of Montrose stood, both of them being rigid Covenanters, against the other Lord
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17348:123"/>
who was a Covenanter likewise, but a more moderate one. And indeed, it was a wonder to see how openly all rules of justice without any feare or shame, were laid aside in this particular; for though they did not approve the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Laird of Dunn, who wanted voyces to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, yet they would not admit of the other, whose e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection admitted not the least scruple. In the agitation of this business, there fell out a memorable passage, of which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters were very much ashamed, because it betrayed one of their secret instructions, &amp; it was this: There was written upon the back of that Commission which was tendered by the Lord Montrose, a Declaration wherein the lawfulnesse of that Commission, and the unlawfulnesse of the other was offered to be cleared, in which, among other things, it was objected against the Lord Carnaegie his election that it was made contrary to the directions of the Tables at Edinburgh; which the Clerk perceiving, stopped, and would read no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Our Commissioner hereupon required the Moderatour to give him a copie or extract of that paper which was last read, and of the names of those who had subscribed to it, and that subscribed by the hand of the Clerk of the Assembly. The Moderatour absolutely refused it: Our Commissioner told him, that he desired it to help him in Our service, that by it he might bee the better informed how to proceed in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting against such Commissions as he meant to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge: The Moderatour againe refused to doe it, alledging, that the challenged Declaration was but accidentally written on the backe of the Commission; Our Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner replyed, That could not be written privately or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, which was given in publike to the Assembly, and that by a member of it, of so great place and quality, for a justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his proceeding in that election; and withall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested, That though he were not Our Commissioner, but the meanest subject of the land, he could not in justice be denied the copie of any thing exhibited in a Court of justice. But all in vaine: for after much cavilling by the Moderatour and other covenanting Lords, Our Commissioner desiring the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:17348:124"/>
Moderator to put it to voyces whether he could be denied a copie of it; even that was refused him likewise, they being afraid, that the Assembly would not deny so notorious an act of justice: upon which Our Commissioner (though mildly, yet with some expression of distast) did thus deliver himselfe: Let God Almighty judge if this be a free Assembly, in which is denyed to his Majesties Commissioner that, which cannot be denyed to the meanest of his subjects; and at last, hee tooke instruments in the hands of Our Clerke of Register, that he was refused the copie of a Declarator gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in to the Assembly, delivered into the Clerkes hands, and publikely read by him, in which, amongst other things, was contained, that the election of the Lord Carnaegie, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner from Brichen, was invalid, as being contrarie to the directions of the Tables of the Commissioners at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh; which occasioned the Moderator to say, That Our Commissioner needed no copie of it, he had so faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated all that was contained in it: Our Commissioner hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, since he could not obtaine a copie of it, desired all present to be witnesses of what the Moderator had spoken, &amp; that he had acknowledged his faithfull repetition of that part of the Declarator whereof he was refused the copie; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againe tooke instruments. In this businesse Sir <hi>Lewis Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi> one of Our Assessors to Our Commissioner, spake some few words; which when the Moderator was about to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, the Lord of Montrose forbid him to answer one who had no place to speake there: Afterward there arose a great contestation between the Earle of Southesk, one of Our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors, and the Moderator, with so much heat on the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators side, and some Lords who sided with him, that Our Commissioner was put to moderate the Moderator, and quench the heat of the Assembly; for which many of them gave Our Commissioner thankes, and so all businesse was continued till Munday.</p>
            <p>On Munday, being the 5. day of their sitting, they went on in the rest of the controverted elections, refusing to heare the Lord Carnaegie his election discussed, but putting it off to a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17348:124"/>
Committee: Master <hi>Andrew Logie</hi> Minister of Red, but a Non-covenanter, being returned a Commissioner from the Presbyterie of Garrioche, was refused to be admitted, though they laid not the least exception against his election: their pretence was, There was a Petition presented against him to the Assembly, and no voice must be allowed him, untill he had answered that: A very easie device for putting by any Commissioner whom they liked not, since it was no hard matter to find one to present a Petition against any man. Another Minister of the Channery of Rosse, and Archdeacon of Rosse, one Master <hi>William Mackeinzey,</hi> Commissioner from the Presbyterie of the Channery, upon certaine cavills both of his election and commission, which did beare, that he should continue there no longer then Wee or Our Commissioner should continue the Assembly, because the sole power of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and dissolving of Assemblies did belong to Us, for the present was onely suspended from his voice; the reason was plaine, he was a Non-covenanter, and had openly averred in the Assembly, that at their election the Ministers of their Presbyterie were threatned by those who brought Letters from the Tables, if they should returne the election of any, but such as they, who brought the Letters, desired. Two elections were returned from the Presbyterie of Aberdene, One of Covenanters, made by a few Ministers, but many Lay-Elders, at which neither the Moderatour nor the Clerke of the Presbyterie were present; Another of Non-covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which election was made onely by Ministers, and at which the Moderatour and Clerke were both present; yet that other election, at the returne whereof there wanted the Clerkes hand, (without which no Presbyteriall Act can bee taken for a Record) was allowed, and the other rejected, upon the bare relation of one of the Covenanting Ministers who was returned wrongfully, and the attestation of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom the Moderatour openly in the Assembly called up and desired to testifie whether the relation of his fellow was true: an excellent way of proofe against a publique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17348:125"/>
to take the testimonie of one who was as wrongfully returned as the Relator.</p>
            <p>The Universitie of Aberdene sent none of their Professors to the Assembly, not daring to trust themselves upon the way, having been so much threatned with the losse of their lives for writing against the Covenant: Onely they sent one of their number, no Divine, but a Professor of Humanitie, to excuse their absence; his Commission being read, gave him onely power to be there, and did constitute him their Agent in any thing which should concerne their Universitie; requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to continue there, and from time to time to give them advertisement of all that passed. The Moderatour did justly affirme, That that was no Commission, the party ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no power by it to give any voice in the Assembly, and so there was no more to be said to it: but immediately some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being transmitted by whispering from eare to eare, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it came to the Moderatours eare, the Moderatour begun presently to recant, and perusing his letter of credence, said, hee perceived that there was onely want of formalitie in the draught, which they might easily passe over; and so they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that for a Commission which was none, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to have a voice in the Assembly, though the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie gave him no such power, nor would they have sent any Commissioner but a Divine. At this sudden change of the Moderatour, made in him by a whisper, many begun to smile, and to lay wagers that the party admitted was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanter, which the Moderatour did not expect from that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie, and that this secretly-conveyed intelligence of it had changed him; and indeed afterward it proved to be so.</p>
            <p>And thus the members of their Assembly were constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, just as they had designed them; at which they were mightily over-joyed, being now assured, that they might conclude what they pleased: And although it might in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reputation have better suited with the principles of wisedome, not to have taken exceptions against these few elections, which were made contrarie to their directions (for
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17348:125"/>
thereby they had gained the opinion of impartialitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had lost nothing of their power, those few voices not being able to carrie any thing against their great number) yet such was their blind obstinacie, that they scorned that any one should sit there who runne not their rebellious courses, as holding it a dis-reputation to them if they should be thought to have abated any thing, not onely of their power but even of their will. Besides, not onely their peevishnesse, but even their pride appeared notably in one particular: Wee, in Our Letters to the Assembly, had nominated for Assessors to Our Commissioner these sixe: The Earle of Traquair Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, the Earle of Roxburgh Lord Privie-Seale, the Earle of Argyle, the Earle of Lauderdaile, the Earle of Southesk, Lords of Our Privie Councell, and Sir <hi>Lewis Stuart</hi> an Advocate, a farre fewer number then ever Our royall Father called to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist any of his Commissioners; all which ever constantly had voices in the Assembly; But here, though these sixe suffrages were able to doe nothing against their minds; yet because they would be sure to clip the wings of Authoritie, they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely refused to let them have any voice at all, telling Our Commissioner, That he might consult with these Assessors if he pleased, but that they were to have no voice in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: affirming, with incredible impudence, That if We Our Selfe were there, We should have but one voice, and that not negative neither, nor more affirmative then any one member of the Assembly had: by which meanes they have published to the World this sweet and wholsome doctrine, That their King in their Ecclesiasticall Assembly hath no more power then any Towne-Clerke, Taylor, or Sadler who shall sit as a Lay-Elder there: which desperate opinion of theirs, doth plainly shew the reason why in their last publique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions preceding the Assembly, they ordered, That every Lay-Elder from Presbyteries should come attended with three or foure, and every Commissioner from Burrowes with five or sixe of their owne ranke and qualitie, who should continue with them all the time of the Assembly, without whose advice they should not give voice to any
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17348:126"/>
thing; a thing never heard of at any generall Assembly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Sure they had heard and knew the number &amp; names of the Assessors, whom Wee had appointed to assist Our Commissioner; and therefore they would have every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall Artizan, chosen a Lay-Elder for the Assembly, (whom they held to have equall power with Us in it) to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the same badge of power and state with Us, and to have their Assessors as well as We, and those equall in number to Ours, and the same power with Ours, of consulting, though not concluding: All which, whether royall Majestie and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Soveraigntie can or ought to digest, any reasonable man may judge.</p>
            <p>The Assembly being just now the same thing which the Tables were at Edinburgh in substance, but in condition far worse (for here were none now but the most obstinate Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters, whom the severall Tables had picked out of all the packe) and they meeting at the Towne-house of Glasgow alwayes before they met at the Church (the place of the Assembly) the Moderator being the same materially who governed them at Edinburgh, though not so formally chosen as now; the Clerke of the Assembly being the same, who was Clerke to their Covenant and to their Tables at Edinburgh; the members of the Assembly being the same who sate at their Tables there, and those the most corrupted and distempered of them all: who could now expect lesse insolent conclusions from this Assembly, then they had found from their Tables?</p>
            <p>And indeed the very same were found: For immediately they bragged that now they were a constituted Assembly, and resolved to laugh at any who should quarrell with the elections which they had approved; and especially at the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Declinator, if it should containe any arguments to that purpose. The first Cocke who begun to crow upon this dunghill, though it were within night, no ordinarie time of crowing, was Master <hi>Andrew Ramsey</hi> a Minister of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, who, getting up upon a stoole or fourme, made a very great bragge, offering by dispute to prove against any man
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17348:126"/>
the lawfulnesse of lay Elders, by Scripture, Antiquitie, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Councels, the judgement of all the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, even of the Church of England, who admitted them into the High Commission. Our Commissioner seeing him crowd so much in a very little room, told him that he runne no great hazzard or danger in his challenge; for he was sure the Judges would bee his seconds: yet if it pleased him, hee would find one should enter into the Lists with him, either publiquely or privately, upon that quarrell; but many of his brethren were not very well pleased with his glorious chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, as making accompt that hee would never bee able to make good the greatest part of it: And with this bragge the Assembly dissolved for that night.</p>
            <p>The next day, being the 27. of November, after the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was met, Our Commissioner urged once againe that the Bishops Declinator might bee read; which was accordingly done by the Clerke of the Assembly. It was entertained with much jeering and laughter, and by transmission of a whisper from one eare to another, they resolved when it was read out to have received it with a generall hissing; but yet by another generall whisper, transmitted as the former, that course was stopped. After it was ended, Our Commissioner spake home to them, for the necessitie of that Declinator, and the unavoidable strength of the reasons contained in the same, and in depressing, by way of parallel, their Libell against the Bishops: which hee spared not to call infamous and scurril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, both in the matter of it, and the manner of promulging it; and hereupon tooke instruments in Our Clerke of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters hands, both for the production and reading of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinator. Some of the Lords of the Assembly offered to doe the like in the Clerk of the Assemblies hands, but Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner told him it was needlesse, since it was not tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Assembly but to himselfe: First, the Moderatour in a short speech deplored the obstinacie of the Bishops hearts, who in all that Declinator had bewrayed no signe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse and sorrow for their wicked courses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then the Lords of the Assembly perceiving their errour, that they who
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17348:127"/>
found themselves to bee Judges, had offered to take instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Clerkes hands of the production of any exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits (which was never heard to bee done by the Judge, but onely by the actor or plaintiffe) prompted some young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, and Gentlemen Covenanters (but not members of the Assembly) then present, to demand instruments of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Bishops Declinator; in whose name one <hi>Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> one of the Clerkes of Our Session (and so acquainted with Law termes) both demanded instruments, and thundered out a verball Protestation, in such Law termes as was not easie to be understood by most of the auditors: The summe of what was understood, was this, That they would pursue their Libell against the Bishops so long as they had lives and fortunes, <hi>etiam in foro contentiosissimo,</hi> and required Doctor <hi>Hammilton</hi> their Proctor then present, to take notice that they cyted him to compeere <hi>die in diem</hi> till sentence were given. Our Commissioner first protested against that Protestation, and then discharged the Bishops Proctor from appearance before the Assembly, to which he had presented no Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; but required him to appeare before himselfe, to whom it was presented, when he should require him: The Declinator of the Bishops here insueth.</p>

                           <pb n="252" facs="tcp:17348:129"/>Giving, and not granting, that the persons foresaid directed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in name of the Clergy to this meeting, were capable of that authority, and that the said Presbyteries had the authority to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Commissioners to the generall Assembly; yet have they now lost and fallen from all such right, if any they had, in so farre as they have deposed the Moderatours, who were lawfully appointed to governe them, by the Bishops in their Synods, and elected others in their place, contrary to the Act of the Assembly at Glasgow 1610. and Act of Parl. 1612. ordaining Bishops to be Moderatours at these meetings; and in their absence, the Minister whom the Bishop should appoint at the Synode. So these meetings having disclaimed the authority of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, deposed their lawfull Moderatours, and chusing others without authority, cannot be esteemed lawfull convocations, that can have law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power of sending out Commissioners with authority to judge of the affaires of this Church.</p>
                        <p>And yet doth the nullity of the Commissions, flowing from such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> meetings, further appeare in this, that they have associate to themselves a laick ruling Elder (as they call him) out of every Session and Parish, who, being ordinarily the Lord of the Parish, or a man of the greatest authority in the bounds, doth over-rule in the election of the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, both by his authority and their number, being moe then the Ministers, whereof some being ordinarily absent, and five or six, or so many of them put in list, and removed, there remain but a few Ministers to voice to the election; and in effect the Commissioners for the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie are chosen by lay-men, contrary to all order, decencie, and custome observed in the Christian world, no wise according to the custome of this Church, which they pretend to follow: the Presbyteries for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly never associating to themselves lay-elders in the election of the Commissioners to the generall Assembly, but onely for their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance in discipline and correction of manners, calling for them at such occasions as they stood in need of their <hi>godly concurrence,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring otherwise their meeting not necessarie, and providing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly that they should not be equall, but fewer in number then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, as by Act of Assembly at Saint Andrews, April 24. 1582. (where Master <hi>Andrew Melvill</hi> was Moderatour) doth appeare. Like as these fourty yeares by gone and upwards, long before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishing of Bishops, these lay-elders have not been called at all to Presbyteries. And by the Act at Dundie 1597. (whereby it is pretended that Presbyteries have authoritie to send these lay Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners) it doth no way appeare that those lay-elders had any hand in chusing of the Ministers: and this is the onely Act of the Assembly, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing Presbyteries to chuse Commissioners to the general Assembly: nor have lay elders sate ordinarily in Presbyteries upon any occasion these fourty yeares, and upwards, nor ever had any place nor voyce in the election of Ministers for the generall Assembly, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those chosen by them to this Assembly have no lawfull power nor authority.</p>

                           <pb n="253" facs="tcp:17348:129"/>Beside, the persons Ecclesiasticall, pretended to be authorized Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> to this Assemblie, have so behaved themselves, that justly they may be thought unworthy and uncapable of Commission to a free and lawfull Assemblie.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For that by their seditious and railing Sermons and Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, they have wounded the Kings honour and Soveraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and animated his liedges to rebellion, averring that all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie Soveraigne is <hi>Originally</hi> in the <hi>collective bodie,</hi> derived from thence to the Prince; and that not onely in case of negligence, it is <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletivè</hi> in the <hi>collective bodie,</hi> as being communicate from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montie to the King, <hi>Cumulativè</hi> not <hi>Privativè:</hi> but also in case of mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>administration, to returne to the <hi>collective bodie</hi>; so that <hi>Rex excidit ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re suo,</hi> and that they may refuse obedience.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Next, they are knowne to bee such as have either beene schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically refractorie and opposite to good order setled in the Church and State; or such as having promised, subscribed, and sworne obedience to their Ordinarie, have never made conscience of their oath; or such as have sworne and accordingly practised, yet contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to their promise and practice, have resiled, to the contempt of authoritie, and disturbance of the Church; or such as are under the Censures of the Church of Ireland, for their disobedience to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; or under the Censures of this Church, or conveened, at least deserving to bee conveened before the Ordinaries, or a lawfull gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assemblie, for divers transgressions deserving deprivation: As first, for uttering in their Sermons, rash and irreverent speeches in Pulpit against his Majesties Councell and their proceedings, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable by deprivation, by the Act of Assemblie at Edinburgh, May 22. 1590. Next, for reproving his Majesties Lawes, Statutes, and Ordinances, contrarie to the Act of Assembly at Perth, <hi>Maii</hi> 1. 1596. Thirdly, for expressing of mens names in Pulpit; or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing them vively to their reproach, where there was no notorious fault; against another Act of the same Assemblie. Fourthly, for using applications in their Sermons, not tending to the edification of their present Auditorie; contrarie to another Act of the same Assemblie. Fifthly, for keeping conventions not allowed by his Majestie, without his knowledge and consent; contrarie to another Act of the same As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie. Sixthly, for receiving of people of other Ministers flocks to the Communion; contrary to order, Acts of Assemblies and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. Seventhly, for intruding themselves into other mens Pulpits, without calling or authoritie. Eighthly, for usurping the authoritie to convent their Brethren, and proceed against them to the Censures of suspension and deprivation. Ninthly, for pressing the people to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a Covenant, not allowed by authoritie; and opposing and withstanding the subscribing of a Covenant offered by his Majestie, and allowed by the Councell: Beside many personall faults and enormities, whereof many of them are guiltie, which in charitie we forbeare to expresse. But hereby it doth appeare, how unfit these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17348:130"/>
are to be members of a free and lawfull Assemblie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Nor doth it stand with Reason, Scripture, or practice of the Christian Church, that Lay-men should be authorized to have deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive voice in a generall Assemblie. In that Act of Dundie, 1597. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by these Elders pretend to have this place, there is no warrant expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for them, to deliberate and determine. Their presence and assistance wee approve, being allowed and authorized by the Prince. The Kings Majesties presence in person, or by his delegates, wee hold most necessarie to see all things orderly and peaceably done; and that hee have the chiefe hand in all Deliberations and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. Nor do we refuse that any intelligent or moderate man may make remonstrance of his opinion, with the reasons of it, in that way that becommeth him in a Nationall Assemblie, due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence being kept, and confusion avoided. But that any Lay-man, except hee bee delegate by Soveraigne authoritie, shall presume to have a definitive and decisive voice, we esteeme it to bee intrusion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Pastorall charge, and without warrant. May we not therefore intreat my Lord Commissioner his Grace, in the words of the Fathers of the fourth generall Councell at Chalcedon? <hi>Mitte for as superfluos.</hi> Nor will a pious Prince bee offended with it; but with <hi>Theodosius</hi> the younger will say, <hi>Illegitimum est, eum qui non sit in ordine Sanctissimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Episcoporum Ecclesiasticus immisceri tractatibus</hi>— And <hi>Pulcheria</hi> the Empresse commanded <hi>Strategus, Ut Clerici, Monachi, &amp; Laici vire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellerentur, exceptis paucis illis quos Episcopi secum duxerunt.</hi> Upon this respect was <hi>Martinus</hi> in that Councell of Chalcedon moved to say; <hi>Non esse suum, sed Episcoporum tantum, subscribere.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If these pretended Commissioners, both Lay and Ecclesiasticall, were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> lawfully authorized, (as it is evident they are not) and for none other cause declinable, yet the Law doth admit, that justly a Judge may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, who is probably suspect: And of all probabilities, this is the most pregnant, when the Judge, before he come to judgement, doth give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of these things he hath to judge. This made our Reformers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation against the Councel of Trent valide, and their not compearing justifiable, because Pope <hi>Leo</hi> 10. had precondemned <hi>Luther,</hi> as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his Bull, dated 8. <hi>Junii</hi> 1520. renewed by <hi>Paul</hi> 3. dated in <hi>Aug.</hi> 1535. This was the cause why <hi>Athanasius</hi> would not give his appearance at some Councels, nor <hi>Hosius</hi> of Corduba, nor <hi>Maximus</hi> Patriarch of Constantinople. But so it is, the most part, if not all of the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners directed to this meeting, have precondemned Episcopall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and condemned, at least suspended obedience to the Acts of the generall Assemblie and Parliament concerning the five Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Perth, have approven their Covenant as most necessarie to be embraced of all in this Kingdome, and not onely have given judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these things before hand, but by most solemne oaths have bound themselves to defend and stand to the same: as doth appeare by their Covenant, Petitions, Protestations, Pamphlets, Libels, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: and therefore by no Law nor equitie can these pretended Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:17348:130"/>
bee admitted to determine in this meeting, concerning these persons and points, which before hand they have so unjustly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                        <p>Further, with no Law nor reason can it subsist, that the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> persons shall be both Judges and Parties. And wee appeale the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of all honest men, if all, at least the greatest part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Commissioners, have not declared themselves partie to the Archbishops and Bishops of this Church: for in that they have declined the Bishops to be their Judges as being their partie, (as their Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Petitions, Declarations and Protestations do beare) have they not <hi>simul &amp; semel, &amp; ipso facto</hi> declared themselves to bee partie against Bishops; whom they have not onely declined, but persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their calumnies and reproaches vented by word and writ, in publike and in private, by invading their persons, opposing and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing them by strength of an unlawfull Combination; for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing and swearing whereof, they have by their owne authoritie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and kept Fasts, not onely in their owne Churches, but where worthie men refused to bee accessorie to these disorderly and impious courses, they have (by aid of the unruly multitude) entred their Churches, usurped upon their charges, reading and causing to bee read that unlawfull Covenant; by threatning and menacing compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling some (otherwise unwilling) out of just feare to set their hands to it; by processing, suspending, and removing obedient and worthie Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters from their places by the usurped authoritie of their Table and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries? And whereas by all Law and Justice, persons finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wronged in judgement, have never beene denied the remedie of declinatorie and appellation; neverthelesse not a few of these Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have proceeded against sundrie worthie Ministers, who have decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and appealed from their judgements, without respect to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; by these meanes craftily intending to disable them to bee Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for the Church; directly or indirectly causing their stipends to bee kept back from them: By which meanes not the least part of the subscribing Ministers have beene gained to their Covenant.</p>
                        <p>But it is without example uncharitable and illegall, that under the pretext of summons (the like whereof was never used, nor in the like manner against the most hainous malefactors in the Kingdome) they have devised, forged, vented, and published a most infamous and scurrile Libell, full of impudent lies and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calumnies against the Archbishops and Bishops of this Church; and have first given out from their Table, the order prescribed in these subsequent Articles, which we have insert, that the world may bee witnesse of the illegalitie and maliciousnesse of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>

                        <p>According to which Articles, upon Sunday, Octob. 28. they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed read the said Libell in all the Churches of Edinburgh notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing my Lord Commissioners command given to the Provost and Bailies to the contrarie, except in Holy-rood-house, where it was read the next Sunday, as it was in other Churches of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; proceeding herein 1. Against all charitie, which doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have it selfe unseemely, nor delighteth in the discoverie of mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, nor take up a reproach, nor backbite with the tongue; much lesse to write a book against a brother. 2. Against the order prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Apostle <hi>not to rebuke an Elder, but to intreat him as a Father:</hi> and by the Act of Parliament, <hi>Jam.</hi> 6. <hi>par.</hi> 8. discharging all persons to impugne or to procure the diminution of the authoritie and power of the three Estates or any of them. 3. Against all lawfull and formall proceeding, especially that prescribed by the Act of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assemblie at Perth, <hi>Martii</hi> 1. 1596. whereby it is ordained, that all summons containe the speciall cause and crime, which the said Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell doth not; naming onely generall calumnies, reproaches and asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, without instruction of any particular, but leaving these to be filled up by malitious delation, after they have defamed their Brethren by publishing this Libell; as appeares by the 8. and 11. Articles of the said instructions: and against the order prescribed by the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie at Saint Andrewes, Aprill 24. 1582. <hi>whereby it is enacted, that in processe of deprivation of Ministers, there be a libelled precept upon fortie dayes warning, being within the Realme, and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score dayes, being without the Realme, to bee directed by the Kirke and such Commissioners thereof, as elects and admits the person complained of, summoning them to compeare and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:17348:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon the complaint. And in case of their absence at the first summons, the second to be directed upon the like warning, with certification, if he faile, the Libell shall be admitted to probation, and he shall be holden</hi> pro confesso. Which forme not being kept in a summons inferring the punishment of deprivation, the same cannot be sustained by the order of that Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie. 4. Against common equitie which admits summons onely by the authoritie of that Judge before whom the delinquent is to compeare; whereby the summons directed by the authoritie of these pretended Presbyteries, cannot sustaine for compearance before the generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie, nor could reference be made from the Presbyterie to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assemblie, the parties never being summoned to compeare before the Presbyterie, whereby either in presence of the partie, or in case of contumacie, the complaint might be referred to the Assemblie. That there was no cytation before the reference, is cleare by the said instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And what a strange and odious forme it is to insert such a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnious Libell in the Presbyterie books, without cyting of the parties to answer thereto: and to cyte Bishops before the generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie by the said Libell, by publishing the same at Churches, to which they had no relation and were many miles distant, Wee leave it to the judgement of indifferent men. 5. Against all decencie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect due to men of their place, the said persons being men of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and some of them of his Majesties most honourable privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and knowne to bee of blamelesse conversation, and to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served well, thus to bee reviled and traduced, doth redound to the reproach of Church and State, and of the Gospell whereof they are Preachers. 6. Lastly, to omit many other informalities against their owne consciences, which wee charge in the sight of God, as they must answer before his great and fearefull tribunall, if they suspect and know not perfectly, according to the judgement of charitie, them whom they thus accuse, to bee free of these crimes wherewith they charge them, at least of many of them; as appeares evidently by the 11. Article of the said instructions, having therein libelled the generall, and have yet to seek the specification thereof, from the malice of their neighbours, if so bee they can furnish it. By which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formall and malicious proceeding, it is most apparent, that our said parties do seek our disgrace and overthrow most malicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and illegally. And therefore wee call heaven and earth to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, if this bee not a barbarous and violent persecution, that all circumstances being considered, hath few or none to parallel it since the beginning of Christianitie; and if wee have not just cause to decline the said pretended Commissioners as our partie.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, can these men expect, but in a lawfull Assemble they were to bee called and censured for their enorme transgressions foresaid? And will any man thinke, that they can bee judges in their owne cause? It is alleadged out of the Canon-Law against the Pope, that if the Pope be at variance with any man, he ought not to bee Judge himselfe, but to chuse arbitrators. And this may militate against them,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:17348:133"/>
except they be more unruly then Popes. <hi>Ludovicus Bavarus</hi> and all the Estates of Germanie with him, did plead this nullitie against the sentence and proceeding of Pope <hi>John</hi> 22. and of his Councell: And the Archbishop of Cullen 1546. did plead the nullitie of <hi>Paul</hi> 3. his Bull of excommunication, because hee protested, that so soone as a lawfull Councell should be opened, hee would implead the Pope as partie, being guiltie of many things censurable by the Councell.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But the late Protestation doth shew the authors thereof to bee no lesse injurious to our place and authority, then they are over-weening of their owne. For it is against reason and practice of the Christian Church, that no Primate, Archbishop, nor Bishop, have place nor voice deliberative or decisive in generall Assemblies, except they be authorized and elected by their Presbyteriall meetings, consisting of preaching and ruling Elders (as they call them) and without warrant or example in the Primitive and purest times of the Church.</p>
                        <p>This also doth inferre the nullitie of an Assemblie, if the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator and President for matters of doctrine, and discipline, shall bee neither the Primate, Archbishop, nor Bishop, but hee who by plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Presbyters and Lay-mens voices shall bee elected: which happely may be one of the inferiour Clergie, or a Lay-person, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it hath fallen out: Whereas canonically, according to the ancient practice of the Church, the Primate should preside, according to the constitution of the first Councell of Nice Can. 6. of Antioch Can. 9. and of the Imperiall Law Novell. constitut. 123. cap. 10. and according to our owne Law. For what place in Assemblies Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops and Bishops had in other Christian Nations, the same they had (no doubt) in Scotland, and yet still do retaine, except by some municipall Law it hath beene restrained, which cannot be showne. For the restraint of their authoritie by the Act of Parliament 1592. is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored by the Act of Parliament 1606. and 1609. and all Acts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to their jurisdiction abrogated. Neither doth that Act 1592. establishing generall Assemblies, debarre Bishops from presiding therein; nor the abrogation of their Commission granted to them by Act of Parliament in Ecclesiasticall causes, imply and inferre the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogation of that authoritie which they received not from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but from Christ, from whom they received the spirituall oversight of the Clergie under their charge; whereto belongeth the President<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in all Assemblies for matters spirituall, alwayes with due sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the supreme Governour: which is so intrinsecally inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in them, as they are Bishops, that <hi>hoc ipso</hi> that they are Bishops, they are Presidents of all Assemblies of the Clergie: as the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of the Kingdome hath place in Councell and Session, not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Act or Statute, but <hi>hoc ipso</hi> that he is Chancellour. By Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Bishops are declared to have their right in Synods and other inferiour meetings, but by no Law restrained nor debarred from the exercise of it in Nationall Assemblies: and the law allowing Bishops to bee Moderators of the Synods, doth present a list in absence of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:17348:133"/>
Metropolitan, to whom of right this place doth belong, as said is, out of which the Moderator of the generall Assemblie shall be chosen. For, is it not more agreeable to reason, order, and decencie, that out of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators of Synods a Moderator of the generall Assemblie should be chosen, then of the inferiour Clergie subject to them?</p>
                        <p>As concerning that Act of the generall Assemblie 1580. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Bishops are declared to have no warrant out of Scripture; if cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of time shall bee regarded, the authoritie of that Assemblie might bee neglected no lesse then that at Glasgow, 1610. But it is ordinarie that prior Acts of Assemblies and Parliaments give place to the posterior: for <hi>Posteriora derogant prioribus.</hi> And there past not full six yeares when a generall Assemblie at Edinburgh found, that the name of Bishops hath a speciall charge and function annexed to it by the word of God; and that it was lawfull for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assemblie to admit a Bishop to a benefice, presented by the Kings Majestie, with power to admit, visite, and deprive Ministers, and to be Moderators of the Presbyteries where they are resident, and subject onely to the sentence of the generall Assemblie.</p>
                        <p>As for that Act at <hi>Mont rose,</hi> let them answer to it that have their calling by that Commission. Wee professe that wee have a lawfull calling by the election of the Clergie, who are of the Chapiter of our Cathedrals, and consecration of Bishops by his Majesties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and approbation, according to the laudable Lawes and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent custome of this Kingdome, and of the Church in ancient times, and do homage to our Soveraigne Lord for our Temporalities, and acknowledge him <hi>solo Deo minorem,</hi> next unto God in all causes, and over all persons Spirituall or Temporall, in his owne Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions supreme Governour. But now wee may take up <hi>Cyprian</hi> his complaint, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Ep.</hi> 14. <hi>Quod non periculum metuere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus de offensâ Domini, quando aliqui de Presbyteris nec Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lii nec loci sui memores, sed neque futurum Dei judicium, neque prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum sibi Episcopum cogitantes, quod nunquam omnino sub anteces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soribus factum est, cum contumelia &amp; contemptâ praepositi, totum sibi vendicent? Atque utinam non prostratâ fratrum nostrorum salute sibi omnia vendicarent. Contumelias Episcopatûs nostri dissimulare &amp; ferre possem, sicut dissimulavi semper &amp; pertuli; sed dissimulandi nunc locus non est, quando decipiatur fraternitas nostra à quibusdam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strûm, qui dùm sine ratione restituendae salutis plausibiles esse cupiunt, magis lapsis obsunt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, it is most manifest by the premises, how absurd it is, and contrarie to all reason and practise of the Christian Church, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Archbishops and Bishops shall bee judged by Presbyters; and more absurd, that they should bee judged by a mixt meeting of Presbyters and Laicks, conveening without lawfull authoritie of the Church. How, and by whom they are to bee judged, according to the custome of ancient times, may be seene by the Councell of Chalcedon, <hi>Can.</hi> 9. and <hi>Concil. Milevit. Can.</hi> 22. and <hi>Concil.

Nor do wee decline the lawfull triall of any competent judicatorie in the Kingdome, especially of a generall Assemblie lawfully consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, or of his Majesties High Commissioner, for any thing in life or doctrine can be laid to our charge: onely we declare and affirme, That it is against order, decencie, and Scripture, that we should be judged by Presbyters or by Laicks, without authority and Commission from Soveraigne authoritie.</p>
                        <p>For the reasons foresaid, and many moe, and for discharge of our dutie to God, to his Church, and to our Sacred Soveraigne, lest by our silence we betray the Churches right, his Majesties authoritie, and our owne consciences, We for our selves, and in name of the Church of Scotland, are forced to protest, That this Assemblie bee reputed and holden null in Law Divine and humane, and that no Church-man bee holden to appeare before, assist or approve it; and therefore, that no letter, petition, subscription, interlocutor, certification, admonition, or other Act whatsoever proceeding from the said Assemblie, or any member thereof, be any wise prejudiciall to the Religion and Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Faith by Act of Parliament established, or to the Church, or any member thereof, or to the jurisdiction, liberties, priviledges, rents, benefices, and possessions of the same, Acts of generall Assemblie, of Councell and Parliament in favours thereof, or to the three Estates of the Kingdome, or any of them, or to us, or any of us, in our persons or estates, authoritie, jurisdiction, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, rents, benefices, reputation, and good name: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie that all such Acts and deeds above mentioned, and everie one of them, are, and shall be reputed and esteemed unjust, illegall and null in themselves, with all that hath followed or may follow thereupon.</p>
                        <p>And forasmuch as the said Assemblie doth intend (as wee are informed) to call in question, discusse, and condemne things not onely in themselves lawfull and warrantable, but also defined and determined by Acts of generall Assemblie and Parliaments, and in practice accordingly, to the disgrace and prejudice of reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, authoritie of the Lawes and Liberties of the Church and Kingdome, weakning his Majesties authoritie, disgracing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and practice which hee holdeth in the Communion of the Church where hee liveth, and branding of Reformed Churches with the foule aspersions of Idolatrie and superstition; wee protest before God and man, That what shall bee done in this kinde, may not redound to the disgrace or disadvantage of Reformed Religion, nor be reputed a deed of the Church of Scotland.</p>
                        <p>Wee protest that wee imbrace and hold, that the Religion presently professed in the Church of Scotland, according to the Confession ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, received by the Estates of this Kingdome, and ratified in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the yeare 1567. is the true Religion bringing men to eternall Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and do detest all contrarie errour.</p>
                        <p>Wee protest, that Episcopall government in the Church is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and necessarie: and that the same is not opposed and impugned
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:17348:134"/>
for any defect or fault, either in the government or Governours; but by the malice and craft of the Devill, envying the successe of that government in this Church these many yeares by-past, most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in planting of Churches with able and learned Ministers, recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Church rents, helping of the Ministers stipends, preventing of these jarres betwixt the King and the Church, which in former times dangerously infested the same, keeping the people in peace and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and suppressing of Poperie, which, in respect either of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their professors, or boldnesse of their profession, was never at so low an ebbe in this Kingdome as before these stirres.</p>
                        <p>We protest that, seeing these who for scruple of conscience did mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Service Book, Canons, and High Commission, which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended or given forth to be the cause of the troubles of this Church, have now received satisfaction, and his Majestie is graciously pleased to forget and forgive all offences by-past in these stirres, that all the subjects of this Kingdome may live in peace and Christian love, as becommeth faithfull subjects and good Christians, laying aside all hatred, envie, and bitternesse; And if any shall refuse so to do, they may beare the blame, and be thought the cause of the troubles that may ensue: and the same bee not imputed to us, or any of us, who desire nothing more, then to live in peace and concord with all men under his Majesties obedience; and who have committed nothing against the Lawes of the Kingdome and Church, that may give any man just cause of offence; and are so farre from wishing hurt to any man, in his person or estate, notwithstanding all the indignities and injuries wee have suffered, that for quenching this present combustion, and setling peace in this Church and Countrey, wee could bee content (after clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our innocencie of all things wherewith wee can bee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) not onely to lay downe our Bishopricks at his Majesties feet, to bee disposed of at his Royall pleasure, but also, if so bee it pleased God, to lay downe our lives, and become a sacrifice for this attonement.</p>
                        <p>We protest in the sight of God, to whom one day we must give account, that we make use of this Declinator and Protestation out of the conscience of our dutie to God and his Church, and not out of feare of any guiltinesse, whereof any of us is conscious to himselfe, either of wickednesse in our lives, or miscarriage in our callings; being content everie one of us, for our owne particular (as wee have never showne our selves to be otherwise) to undergo the lawfull and most exact triall of any competent judicatorie within this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or of his Majesties High Commissioner.</p>
                        <p>And we most humbly intreat his Grace to intercede with the Kings Majestie, that he may appoint a free and lawfull Generall Assemblie, such as Gods word, the practice of the Primitive Church, and Lawes of the Kingdome do prescribe and allow, with all convenient speed, to the effect the present distractions of the Church may bee setled.

                           <salute>May it please your Grace,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>ANd you right Noble, Right Worshipfull, and you most Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend brethren, conveened by his Majesties Proclamation in this venerable nationall Assembly, to consult upon the most convenient wayes, and to enact such Ecclesiasticall Lawes, as to your wisedomes seemes most expedient, for preserving of peace and truth in this Church, for which ends wee from the bottome of our hearts (as feeling members of the same) earnestly intreat him, who hath promised to be with his owne to the end of the world, by his spirit and grace, so to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and assist your wisedomes, that by this long expected meeting, glory may redound to his ever glorious Name, and peace to this rent Church, which all the members thereof, with most earnest wishes, expect at your hands. For the present, we thought it our duty, as those whom it doth most clearly concerne (our great Shepheard having committed to our charge a part of that Flock which he hath redeemed with his precious bloud) to present unto you our just feares which arise from the sudden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching of the Laick (now called Ruling) Elders, in divers Presbyteries of this Kingdome, having chiefe hand in chusing of Commissioners there, lest they, with Commissioners thus elected, may bring upon the neck of the Ministery and Church here, the heavie yoake of over-ruling Elders in all times comming, to the no small hurt of us and our successors in the Gospel, except timely remedy be provided.</p>
                        <p>Our humble supplication therefore to your Grace, and Members of this present Assembly, is, that all these Commissioners thus chosen by the voyce of Laick Elders, and in whose Commissions they have had hand, may be removed, as men to whose voyces and judgements we cannot submit our selves in matter of Church government, for the just feares above exprest, they being justly suspect Judges not to be admitted, and their elections and Commissions void for reasons following: First, there is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> no Law in this Kingdome whereby Laick Elders have any voyce in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:17348:136"/>
chusing Commissioners to Generall Assemblies; the chusers therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no legall power to elect, those that are chosen by such, can have no place nor voyce in this Assembly. Secondly, albeit there have beene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> heretofore, and before Churches were fully planted, a custome that Laick-Elders did sit in Presbyteries, yet that custome hath beene these 35. yeeres by-past, universally (and above forty yeeres in most Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries) interrupted; which prescription is sufficient to make voyd any such custome: so that it can be no sufficient warrant for them to sit and voyce in Presbyteries now, much lesse to intrude themselves (as they have done in many Presbyteries) contrarie to the minds and publicke protestation of the Ministerie. Thirdly, when Laick-Elders had place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in Presbyteries, yet it was ordained that the voyces should not be equall in number, with the voyces of the Ministerie, as is to be seene in the booke of discipline Chapter. But in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, their number were not onely equall, but in most parts more, because out of every Parish there was a Laick-Elder, and so at least equall in number; and in election of these Commissioners, against whose election we except, there was put upon the list six in some places, and in others foure of the Ministers, who being removed, in their absence the choyce was made when the Laick-Elders by six or foure at the least exceeded the Ministers in number of voyces, yea in some Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries the Laick-Elders were twice so many in number; so that these Commissioners are mainly chosen by the Laitie, and not by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, neither can wee acknowledge them for ours. Fourthly, these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laicke-Elders did of old onely assist in Discipline, not medling with points of Doctrine (suffering the spirit of the Prophets to be subject to the Prophets, according to the Apostolicall rule;) but now they intrude themselves to sit and voice in the Presbyteries in matters of Doctrine, and have given Commission to those whom we except against, to voyce in this venerable Assembly, in Doctrine aswell as in matters of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline; which Commissions are null, as proceeding <hi>à non habente potestatem.</hi> For these and other most weighty causes, the election of such Commissioners, and their place in this Assembly being so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Church, threaten the same with the most intolerable yoak of bondage to be laid upon the neck of the Presbyteries by Laick over-ruling-Elders, to the prejudice of the liberties of the said Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and whole Discipline of this Church. We could not, out of conscience
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:17348:136"/>
to God, our callings, and flocks, but make humble remonstrance of the same to your Grace and members of this grave Assembly: withall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing, both in our own names, and in name of all the Ministerie and body of this Church that will adhere to this present supplication, that all senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, conclusions, Canons, Statutes, and Ordinances, which shall be made in that Assembly wherein the foresaid Commissioners shall have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative voyces, to be voyd, null, and of no effect to oblige us or any of us to the obedience of the same: But if this our just supplication be not admitted (which we hope and earnestly pray may be graciously accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) then this our protestation may be of force against such Lawes and proceedings that may follow thereupon. Thus hoping for your charitable construction of this our necessarie duty in so eminent a danger of the Church, and humbly intreating these presents may be put upon Record, We rest.</p>

            <p>ANd when the Protestation of the Presbyterie of Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow (which was a very strong one) begun to bee read, the Principall of the Colledge there desired the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it for a time; to which the Moderatour gladly yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but Our Commissioner, who had delivered it in with his owne hands, pressed the reading of it out; which the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratour refused, alledging that any man might withdraw his owne Protestation, much more desire the forbearance of reading of it: to which Our Commissioner replyed, That the Protestation was subscribed not onely by the hand of the Principall, but the <hi>major</hi> part of the Ministers of that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, of whom many were Covenanters; that in all their names it was presented unto him, and therefore could not be re-called by any one of them, without the consent of the rest, praying him that it might bee read out to the end: but all in vaine; for no justice could be had from them, especially in a point which so much concerned their reputation: for they conceived it would bee a great blurre to their businesse, if a Protestation (made by that Presbyterie, in which was the seat of the Assembly) should bee knowne: and therefore they would neither reade it, nor did they deliver it backe againe,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:17348:137"/>
against all rules both of justice and equitie: After this contest the Assembly for that night was dismissed.</p>
            <p>Our Commissioner wondring that the Principall of the Colledge should in publique desire the forbearance of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the Protestation of the Presbyterie of Glasgow in the Assembly, used meanes to know the reason of it, and found by the averment of persons of good credit upon their owne knowledge, that the night before late at ten of the clocke, the Lord <hi>Lowdan</hi> and the Moderatour, with divers others Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting-Ministers, had been with the Principall, and told him, that the Presbyteriall Protestation would make a great division amongst them; that unlesse he did withdraw it, hee must never looke to live quietly in Glasgow, nor any where in Scotland; that the Principall told them, it was presented to Our Commissioner, from whom it was not possible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it; that then by the same threatnings they adjured him to desire the forbearance of reading of it, if it should bee ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the Assembly; that after they were parted from him, his wife all in teares begged the like of him, affirming, that the Lord <hi>Lindsey</hi> had been with her, and sworne to her, that both he and his must be utterly ruined, if shee could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with him for re-calling that Protestation. This and many other passages heretofore mentioned, banishing quite out of Our Commissioners mind, and the minds of all Our well affected Councellours there present, all hopes, not onely of just and faire, but even of formall proceedings in that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, where not so much as the shew and countenance of justice was to be discerned, nor any thing but the power and obstinate wilfulnesse of the Covenanters, and the unanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable nullities of this Assembly, in regard both of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers elected, and the manner of their election, being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, and the reasons of the Bishops Declinator pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to Our Commissioner being seriously weighed, by which they did not decline the judgement of a generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly lawfully constituted, but onely of this Assembly, which was to bee accounted far rather a Laicall convention, then Ecclesiasticall, all the members whereof had barred
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:17348:137"/>
themselves from being Judges by their solemn oath of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination for the rooting out of that Kingdome both the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops persons and callings; to whose sentence We or Our Commissioner could not deliver them over without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying all courses of justice, and denying to Our Bishops that protection which cannot bee denied by Us to any of Our subjects, <hi>viz.</hi> the benefit of the Lawes of that Our Church and Kingdome: And besides, Our Commissioner having certaine and unquestionable intelligence of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters unmoveable resolution, that although the Assembly should be continued, and all things which they desired (even to their own wishes) should be granted and effected, yet that the quietnesse and peace of that Kingdome should be never a whit the more settled or established, but that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to chuse at this assembly certain Committees, who, under the name of Commissioners from the generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, should keep up their Tables, and bee chosen and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from one Assembly to another, and so hold on the same rebellious courses which they have held ever since the first erection of their Tables, to the utter overthrow of Our royall Authoritie, and the authoritie of the Lords of Our Councell, and Lords of Our Session under Us: and Our Commissioner well weighing Our instructions, according to which hee was to carry himselfe in this Assembly, if hee should find that these mischiefes and courses of injustice could not bee stopped, resolved the next day (according to Our speciall commandment) in Our name, and by Our authoritie to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve that Assembly, whose aime was onely to robbe Us of Our Soveraigne power, and to put it in the hands of their Commissioners.</p>
            <p>According to which resolution Our Commissioner the next day, being Wednesday the 28. of November, went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the morning to the Church, and Our Councell (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving warning over night) met him in the Chapter-house, where they sate in consultation before they went to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly: He did then impart to them the resolution he had to dissolve the Assembly, and did aske their advice for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:17348:138"/>
of doing it: after hearing each of their advice severally, he was confirmed in his resolution. The reason why Our Commissioner held the Councell in that place, was, because some of Our Councell, who were present, should have no time to communicate his resolution to the Covenanters, nor to consult with them about the hindering it; the Assembly being fully set before the Councell came out, so that what had passed there, could not be communicated to them.</p>
            <p>The first thing propounded there by the Moderatour that day, was this: A day or two before, there were brought into the Assembly three or foure great volumes by their new Clerke, which he alledged were the Acts of the generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly from the very first reformation of that Church, which, by the speciall providence of God, and his own care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full industry, had been recovered, else they had been lost for ever, to the invaluable losse of the puritie of the Religion and Discipline established amongst them; for they had been throwne by for many yeeres, untill he by some strange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had light upon them: after which speech of the Clerke, the Moderatour had desired them to chuse a Committee to peruse these Bookes, and to report to the Assembly whether they conceived them to bee the true and authenticall Acts of the generall Assemblies of the Church of Scotland: The day before this, these Committees had made their report that they had perused them, and had found them to bee true and authenticall Records, and delivered in writing some reasons of this their opinion; which made the impartiall auditors wonder how in two daies men could peruse, and make a judgement of such volumes, which other men (who tooke themselves to be no fooles) thought could hardly be done in one yeere: but that was all one, the Moderatour this day put it to the question and voices, Whether they would allow the copies of those Bookes of Assembly (which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees the day before had reported to bee good and faithfull copies) to bee reputed ever hereafter for the authenticall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and Registers of the Church of Scotland: Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner prayed them to forbeare doing any thing suddenly
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:17348:138"/>
in a businesse of so great importance, that nothing, especially if it were doubtfull, could bee made a publique Record of any Judicatorie which was to oblige Our subjects, unlesse We first by Our Advocate and learned Councell were satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the authenticall authoritie of that Record; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wished them to stay untill that course might bee taken, and before that time not to put it to voices: But all in vaine, for presently they of the Assembly (without one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie voice) concluded these Bookes to be authenticall Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and so to bee held and reputed for ever, without knowing what was in them: They were foure Bookes, and very large, and confessed not to be the Originals, but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies. Our Commissioner then remembring that at Our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace at Holy-rood-house hee was denied the sight of the Bookes of the Assembly (the Covenanters having threatned the former Clerke of the Assembly, if hee should let Our Commissioner have the perusall of them) begun now to thinke, that there might be stuffe enough in them against Our Regall authoritie, and perhaps a great deale of it of their own devising; which caused Our Commissioner to enter into Our Clerke of Registers hands a solemn Protestation against the validitie of these Records, and against any of Our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects being obliged by them, untill such time as they should be perused and allowed by such as We should authorize by Commission for that purpose.</p>
            <p>Next, the Moderatour desired the Clerke to reade certaine answers, which upon the sudden had been drawne up (as he said) by certaine Brethren to the reasons contained in the Bishops Declinator which had been read the day before: And indeed, so soone as they were heard, it was easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that they were drawne up upon a sudden, without either feare or wit, being very poore and silly, stuffed full of cytations out of their own bookes of Discipline, which did allow lay-Elders; and by these testimonies concluded the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Bishops against Lay-Elders, &amp; Ministers, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners chosen by them for having voice in the Assembly, to bee invalid; which made some admire by what conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:17348:139"/>
it could be inferred, that because there had been Lay-Elders in particular Church-Sessions, nay and perhaps in Presbyteries, that therefore these Lay-Elders either had, or must now have voices in the generall Assembly, or in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Ministers Commissioners to it: Yet the Moderatour caused another paper to bee read in defence of Lay-Elders, of the very same tedious stuffe with the former: And, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie those Bookes of Discipline, so often cyted in both these papers, the Moderatour desired the whole Assembly to heare himself reade a long Latine testimonie, given in the <hi>Syntagma</hi> of the confessions of the Reformed Churches, to the puritie of the discipline of the Church of Scotland. Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner called for the Book, &amp; desired to see what he had read, and found it to be a private testimonie of one unknowne, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted by the Printer or setter out of that <hi>Syntagma,</hi> to make it sell the better, because it had some new thing in it; which made a good many laugh at that so much magnified testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. Then the Moderator, to take away that exception in the Bishops Declinator, that the Assembly was a declared partie (and therefore could not be their Judge) alledged, that the Remonstrants had made the same objection against the Synod of Dort, but that it was repelled by all the Divines there present, and the invaliditie of that exception declared by none better then by the Divines of great Britaine, whose judgement against that exception he then out of the publique Acts of that Synod did reade: Our Commissioner told the Moderatour, that he should have done well to have transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Scottish that passage which he last read, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer out of the <hi>Syntagma,</hi> that so many of the Lay-Elders, who were to judge of the fitnesse of these cytations, might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him and them; which the Moderatour passed over with a smile. ONE who stood by Our Commissioner, and had been present at the Synod of Dort, asked leave first of Our Commissioner, and then of the Moderatour to speake, which being granted him by both, hee answered the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours answer to the Bishops objection, thus: That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops exception against them of the Assembly, as <hi>pars adversa,</hi>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:17348:139"/>
differed from that of the Remonstrants against the Synod of Dort two waies: First, in regard of the matter of it: For the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod consisting of Divines, &amp; the matters controverted being points of Divinitie (and by some men thought to bee funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points of faith, though they were not so) in which Schollers use not to be neutrall, it was impossible for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants to find Divines to be their Judges, if they would except against such Divines as had declared themselves to bee of the one opinion or the other: But it was not so with Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacie in the judgement of the members of this Assembly; for they could not hold the allowing or rejecting of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie to bee a point of doctrine, because points of doctrine are not alterable; but the Church of Scotland in her positive confession, <hi>Article</hi> 21. did hold Church policie or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alterable at the will of the Church; which opinion, whether he did allow or not, hee was not then and there to declare: but sure in such points, which they themselves held alterable and indifferent at the will of the Church, being no points of doctrine, there was no necessitie of pre-declaring their judgement, especially after they meant to bee Judges: Nay, there was a necessitie of not pre-declaring their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against Episcopall government, considering it stood now in force by Acts both of Church and Parliament; and therefore that the declaration of their judgement against it, (even since they intended to be Judges of it, but before they were actually so) did barre them from being Judges of it at all. But secondly, and that upon which he principally insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, was this: That the Bishops case in their exception against this Assembly, differed from that of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants against the other Synod, in the manner of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Synods pre-declaration, and of the members of this Assemblies pre-declaration. Many of the members of that Synod had pre-declared themselves by discoursing, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, preaching, &amp;c. but not by any judiciall Act, nor by any Act equivalent to a judiciall Act, such as swearing against the other tenet, binding themselves by Oathes, Covenants, Combinations, Confederacies, Associations against the

abetters of it; all which being Acts analogicall to judiciall Acts, and being done by the members of this Assembly against the Bishops, absolutely barred them from being Judges in the question of these Bishops persons or calling. Some answer was made to this by the Moderatour and others, which required no reply; and therefore received none, that which was answered being no way against that which had been delivered: For the Moderatour conceiving that hee who spake had affirmed that the five Articles treated of at the Synod of Dort, had been fundamentall points of faith (of which opinion the speaker never was, nor is) fell upon a discourse of fundamentall and not fundamentall points of faith; affirming that the Synod of Dort had never determined the five Articles to bee fundamentall points of faith, which the former speaker knew very well to bee true: And it made many auditors thinke, that the Moderatour did deliver this onely because he would have something to say; for they did conceive that he had been a man so rigid in these tenets, that hee had held them to bee fundamentall points of faith: But whether hee did or not, there were many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters members of the Assembly, who did hold them to bee fundamentall points, &amp; most unchristianly and uncharitably had preached, that the Remonstrants tenets did destroy the very foundation of faith; and whosoever sided with them in the five Articles, could not possibly bee saved. But now the other exception laid by him that spake, and in which hee conceived the strength of his speech principally to lie, <hi>viz.</hi> That by their swearing, and combining by a Covenant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Bishops (which was a plain pre-judging of them) they had barred themselves from being their Judges; the Moderatour was pleased to make no answer at all, though of all that was spoken it most principally required one. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Minister, one of the gravest and learnedest in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, did conceive that he which spake had affirmed, that Councels and Synods were onely Judges of points of faith and doctrine, but not of government or other matters; and instanced in <hi>Novatus</hi> and <hi>Donatus,</hi> who by Councels and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:17348:140"/>
had beene censured in points of schisme; which no man ever denyed, nor ever came within the compasse of the thoughts or words of him that spake. Here a Lay-Elder, who was a Lord, conceived that he who spake had said something insinuating that Lay-Elders had given voyces in some Councels; Thereupon the person that spake, unwilling to let that passe, asked leave to tell his Lordship that he was mistaken, &amp; that if Our Commissioner and the Assemblie would give him leave, he would maintaine it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any man in the Assembly, that neither the name nor thing of a Lay-Elder, was ever knowne to any generall or Provinciall Councell; nay, not to any particular Church in the whole Christian world, before <hi>Calvins</hi> dayes. To this no replie was made, save onely by the Moderatour, who first said that it would be thought a strange thing in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, if any of this Assemblie should stand up in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation house, and speake against their Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: to which was answered by him that spake, That he neither did speake, nor would have spoken there, without leave asked and obtained; nor would he have asked leave if it had not been to have cleared a passage of the Synod of Dort urged by the Moderatour, and in which he himselfe was interessed. And it seemes here the Moderatour was brought very low, by telling the partie that his father while he lived was of another opinion: to which the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That that was a weake reason; for there were some members of the Assembly then sitting, whose Fathers had beene Papists: And he who spake did verie much wonder that the Moderatour should thinke it strange for him to differ from his Father in his judgement of these points of Ecclesiasticall government; for he did not apprehend it so great a matter for any man to differ from his Father in judgment, as to differ from himselfe: and hee was sure that the Moderatour knew well enough that many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Assembly, who were now fiercest against Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopall government, within these few yeeres had been as earnest maintainers of it as any, &amp; more ambitious and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest suitors for Bishopricks then any other. The Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour at last cut off all further contestation about these
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:17348:141"/>
Lay-Elders, by affirming that the state of the question as it stood before them, was not whether Lay-Elders had ever beene received in other Churches, but whether their office and place in the Assembly was agreeable with the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Church of Scotland; and so no more was spoke of it.</p>
            <p>The Moderatour from that speech which was made for justifying the Bishops exception against the competencie of their Judges, <hi>viz.</hi> the Assembly, because the members of it had declared themselves parties, tooke occasion to speak thus to the Assembly: Since we see both the competencie and constitution of this Judicatorie and Assembly is thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly impugned, it is high time to cleare this point, of which none can bee Judge but the Assembly it selfe, and therefore I will presently put it to voyces, Whether this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie be the lawfull and competent Judge of the Libell against the Bishops, notwithstanding the reasons contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their Declinator.</p>
            <p>This gave our Commissioner the occasion (which hee neglected not) to do and declare that which by Our speciall commandement he had resolved on; for he presently made a speech of a competent length, the summe whereof was this: I should perhaps have continued a little longer with you, if you had not falne upon a point which doth inforce my deserting you: You are now about to settle the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this Judicatorie, and the competencie of it against the Bishops, whom you have cyted hither; neither of which I can allow, if I shall discharge either my duty towards God, or loyaltie towards my gracious and just Master. This is a day to me both of gladness and sadnesse; Gladnesse in that I have both seene this Assemblie meet, which his Majesties subjects have been made beleeve was never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Him, and in that I shall now in his Majesties name make good unto you all his most gracious offers in his last Royall Proclamation, which likewise his Majesties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were made beleeve would never be performed by Him: Of Sadnesse, in that you who have called so much for a free Generall Assembly, having one most free, in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties intentions, granted you, have so handled and marred
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:17348:141"/>

                        <p>The Kings Majestie, as he conceived, for the ease and benefit of his subjects, established the high Commission, that thereby justice might be ministred, and the faults and errours of such persons as are made liable thereto, taken order with and punished, with the more conveniencie and lesse trouble to the people: But finding his gracious intentions therein to be mistaken, hath been pleased to discharge, like as by these presents he doth discharge the same, and all acts and deeds whatsoever made for establishing thereof. And the Kings Majestie being informed, that the urging of the five Articles of Perthes Assembly hath bred distraction in the Church and State, hath been graciously pleased to take the same to his Royall consideration, and for the quiet and peace of this Countrie, hath not onely dispensed with the practice of the said Articles, but also discharged all and whomsoever persons from urging the practice thereof, upon either Laicke or Ecclesiasticall person whatsoever: And hath freed all his subjects from all censure and paines, whether Ecclesiasticall or Secular, for not urging, practising, or obeying them, or any of them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

                        <p>And that none of Our good subjects may have cause of grievances against the proceedings of the Prelates, his Majestie is content, that all and every one of the present Bishops and their Successors, shall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable, and accordingly from time to time censurable according to their merits by the generall Assembly.</p>

               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:17348:142"/>AFter the reading whereof, Our Commissioner went on, and added: I have, you see, subscribed that paper with mine owne hand, and to make his Majesties Religion, Grace, Goodnesse, and the Zeale which hee hath to settle the peace of this Church and Kingdome knowne to all succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding generations, I doe require that it bee entred into your ordinarie Bookes of Assembly; but with this provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That this my assent to the Act of registring this his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Declaration, shall be no approbation of the lawfulness of this Assembly, or of any other Act made, or to be made in it; but that all Protestations, made or to be made against this Assembly in all other acts and proceedings thereof, shall stand in full force and effect: And of the delivery of this paper, containing his Majesties gracious offers, into the hands of the Clerke of the Assembly, and of my requiring it to be registred in the Bookes of the same, as also of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation against the lawfulnesse of this Assembly in all other Acts, I take publique instruments in the hands of the Clerke of Our Soveraigne Lord his Register, and require him to make an act thereof. Which being done, the Moderatour in a short speech acknowledged Our speciall goodnesse in granting the particulars contained in the paper, promising it should be registred in the bookes of assembly, and desired to goe on with the businesse of the assembly.</p>
            <p>But Our Commissioner told them, hee must goe on with them no more; for now the sad part was behind, <hi>viz.</hi> That since they had brought Lay-Elders to give voices in this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, a thing not practised before, or at least dis-used so long, that no man present had seen it; the Ministers sitting here as Commissioners were chosen by Lay-Elders, a thing never heard of before in this Church, all the persons having voices here, were before the elections designed by the Tables at Edinburgh, all others by their expresse directions barred, these few Commissioners sent hither, but not chosen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their designation, were by their cavills, made for that purpose, set aside, and not admitted to have voices, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17348:143"/>
cyted hither were to bee judged by the very same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who had pre-judged and condemned them at their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; hee attested heaven and earth, whether this could bee imagined to be any way a free Assembly, and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God to witnesse, that they themselves were the cause, and the only cause why this Assembly could not have that happy issue which We heartily wished, and why the Bishops could receive no censure from them, in regard of these their sinister proceedings: for how could any man expect justice from them, who had denied it to Us, in refusing voices to Our Commissioners assessors, which was never denied to Our Royall Father, when hee called farre more assessors then Wee did now? Much more to this purpose was delivered by Our Commissioner; upon all which he commanded and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them not to proceed any further in this Assembly, and declared that whatsoever they should say or doe hereafter in it, hee in Our name protested against it, and that it should never oblige any of Our subjects, nor be reputed for an Act of generall Assembly.</p>
            <p>The Moderatour with a speech well penned, which hee had in readinesse whensoever the Assembly should bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, seemed much to deplore Our Commissioners resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for breaking up the Assembly; hee attributed very much to Our power in Ecclesiasticall causes and assemblies, said many things of Our power, quite contrarie to much which they have since printed in their seditious Pamphlets and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, and much more then was liked and approved by many of his fellow-Covenanters: towards the end of his speech he affirmed, That We were Universall Bishop over all Our Kingdomes, &amp;c. which made Our Commissioner use meanes to have the copie of his speech, but it could not be obtained while it was fresh in the auditors memories: Many daies after Our Commissioner was gone from Glasgow, a copie of it was sent him, but all that which concerned Our Ecclesiasticall power, especially of Our being Universall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in Our Kingdomes, was quite left out; by which it was plaine, that (as it was before conjectured) hee had displeased
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:17348:143"/>
many of the Assembly, by giving more Ecclesiasticall power to Us in that speech, then they intended Wee should ever have. The conclusion of his speech was, That as Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner had served his Master carefully and faithfully, in preserving his Priviledges and Prerogatives, so they must needs likewise be faithfull and carefull in preserving the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Prerogatives of the kingdome of the Sonne of God, which was his Church; That they should much grieve for his absence, whose presence had beene so acceptable and comfortable to them, and who had carried himselfe among them with so much wisdome and moderation; that they should have a great misse of him, with many more words, tending to the very high commendation of Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner.</p>
            <p>After the Moderatour, divers of the Lords spake much, to vindicate the Covenanters from their prelimitations and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister dealings in their elections: But Our Commissioner presently choaked their confidence, with the production of two papers, which they little supposed he had ever seene: They contained their secret instructions, with which the whole Tables were not acquainted, for they must then of necessitie some way or other have come to the knowledge of all the covenanters, very many of whom by these secret orders were barred from being chosen commissioners to the assembly, as well as the Non-covenanters; and therefore they fearing to lose or displease such a considerable number of their owne partie, did by these private advertisements (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived onely by the chiefe Rulers of the Table, but never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Tables themselves) take order that none who could fall within the suspition of moderation, should bee chosen commissioner for the assembly.</p>
            <p>The one of these papers was directed to one Lay Elder of every Presbyterie, some speciall confident of theirs, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these nine Articles ensuing.</p>

            <p>NOw both these were so closely carried, that the rest of the covenanting Ministers never suspected there had beene any other instructions, save the two publicke and avowed papers before related; nor would they ever have su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected any such close and double dealing, but that when they came to their elections, they found for the most part the ablest and most experienced Ministers passed by, and onely the rigidest and hottest men chosen; which made them (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after the reason of it) come to heare of these private Instructions, at which they stormed exceedingly, but could not then helpe any thing. And now whether these two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers doe not containe prelimitations of the assembly, a thing against which they most fearfully cryed out, We leave it to the judgement of the Reader.</p>
            <p>The Moderatour and some Noblemen lay Elders, went about to cleare themselves from the notice of these two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the secret instructions, but could not doe it: Our Commissioner when he delivered them to the Clerke to be read, told him, That surely they were papers which he had seene before, and with which he was well acquainted: The former of these, to a lay Elder of every Presbyterie, in which is that seditious Article, being the sixt in number (intimating their feare of the losse of their Civill libertie as well as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian) he acknowledged he had seene; but denied that he had seene the other. One of the principall covenanting Lords affirmed, That these Instructions were not sent from the Tables, but that they might bee some private advices from one friend to another; for proofe whereof, hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to produce the two papers of publique Instructions
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:17348:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which had beene sent from their Tables, and which are set downe before by Us in this Narration. To this Our Commissioner answered, That the sending of these publike instructions, of which all the Kingdome had notice, was a weake argument to prove that they sent no other private ones; That he acknowledged these private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions were not sent from their publike Tables, but he offered to prove that they were sent to the severall Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by the direction of some of the principall rulers of the Tables, who laboured by all meanes to conceale them from the rest of their partie, who they were sure would take offence at them: That they were sent from one friend to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother by way of private advice, he declared to be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for these two reasons; First, because it could not bee imagined that severall men, writing to their private friends, should light upon the same words, and yet that the copies of these instructions sent unto him Our Commissioner from many parts of the Kingdome, very farre distant one from another, were the very same: Secondly, because he and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man did finde that all the elections now returned, were made throughout the whole Kingdome according to these private instructions, and in pursuance of them: And, that these private instructions were undoubtedly sent, besides the two reasons last mentioned, it doth evidently appeare; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because it is well knowne, that they who had never yet let any thing slip which they thought was advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to them, would not have let this passe unquestioned, but would have required Our Commissioner to prove the truth of these secret instructions, which brought so great a scandall upon their proceedings if they were not forged; and so great a scandall upon him if they were: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their not urging of him to make proofe of them, doth cleerely evince their guiltinesse. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Our Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, though he was loath to nominate unto them those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Covenanters from whom he received copies of these secret instructions, unlesse he were put to it; yet hee hath upon his Honour protested unto Us, that he received them onely by the meanes of Covenanters, who found themselves aggrieved by these sinister dealings, and that hee
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17348:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will justifie the receipt of these papers from them whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he shall be put to it, as he would have done in the Assembly if hee had beene urged therunto; which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they would have done, but did not, because they knew there were divers members of the Assembly there present, who were well acquainted with the truth of what hee had delivered concerning these secret instructions. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, because in their protestation made against Our last Proclamation, they have confessed some of them, which were not in either of their publike instructions, and which never came to Our Commissioners notice, but by these pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate papers.</p>
            <p>After this, first divers of the Lords, and then some of the Ministers, intreated Our Commissioner to stay, adding many words both to that purpose, and for justifying their proceedings. To the Lords our Commissioner answered, That for many monthes, onely their Tables had been obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that Wee and Our Councell Table had received no obedience at all; he was therefore now to try their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this point, whether they would dissolve themselves at our speciall commandement. To the Ministers he repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That one of the chiefe reasons which had moved Us to dissolve this Assembly, was, to vindicate them from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of Lay-Elders, who as they had gone about to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the Bishops, so now to oppresse them; and, if Wee did not protect them, would undoubtedly prove, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruling but over-ruling Elders: And withall added, That if they would now depart he would be a suitor to Us for the indiction of a new free generall Assembly, in which they might mend all the faults committed by them in their proceedings at this.</p>
            <p>Here the Earle of Argyle, one of our Councellers and Assessors to Our Commissioner, desired to speak: his voyce was low, his speech he directed to the Covenanters; the summe of it was, That he was surprised, and did not expect this sudden rupture, but that he was willing to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which was, That he held it fit the Assembly should consist of Lay-men as well as Church-men; because these two made up one complete body, exhorted them to stand
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:17348:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the Confession of Faith, as it was sworn in 1581. After he had done, Our Commissioner desired the Moderatour to say prayer, and so to dismisse the Assembly; which he was about to doe, but was hindered by the Lords, who fell againe with new perswasions to urge Our Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners stay with them: which he answered with so much expression of griefe for there misdemeanours, which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily inforced this rupture, that verie many of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly seemed to be much moved with it. When nothing could perswade his stay, at last some of the Lords told him, that fearing this rupture they had a protestation ready a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst what he had said and done, which they desired him to heare read; which so soone as the Clerk begun to read, Our Commissioner repeated his former protestation, adding, in expresse words, that in Our name hee dissolved the Court under the higest paines: and so came out with the Lords of Our Councell, leaving the Clerk reading their protestation. When he came to the Church doore, he found it shut, so that some of his company were glad to force it open.</p>
            <p>No sooner was he gone, but the Lord Areskyn, eldest son to the Earle of Marr, stood up and made this wise speech, not without teares: My Lords, and the rest, my heart hath beene long with you, I will dallie no more with God, I begge to bee admitted into your blessed Covenant, and pray you all to pray to God for me, that he would forgive me for dallying with him so long. Three others of meaner qualitie desired the same, and so all those foure were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently admitted into their Covenant. These men, at least the Lord Areskyn, were resolved to enter into their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant long agoe, but were reserved on purpose for doing of it at that houre, for the greater glory of their Covenant: For no sooner had they sworn, &amp; the Moderator received them by the hand, but presently he desired the whole audience to admire Gods approbation and sealing of their proceedings, that even at that instant, when they might have feared some shrinking and back-sliding because of the present rupture, He had moved the hearts of these men to begge admittance into their blessed societie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:17348:147"/>Immediatly after, divers stood up and spake, but all much about one, and to this sense: They had seene how carefull and punctuall Our Commissioner was, like a good servant, faithfully to serve Us his Master, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Our instructions (speaking withall much to his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular commendation;) how much more then ought they to be carefull to bee found faithfull in following his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, who was Master, as to all themselves, so even to him who was Our Commissioners Master? These speeches being ended, two things were immediately put to the question: First, whether notwithstanding Our Commissioners departure and protestation they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to their owne protestation, and continue the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. They all voyced affirmatively, except the Lord <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naegie</hi> Commissioner from the Presbyterie of Brichen, Sir <hi>John Carnaegie</hi> Commissioner from the Presbyterie of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broath, two Ministers Commissioners from the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie of Strabogie, the lay Elder and Ministers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners from the Presbyterie of Peebles, Doctor <hi>Strang</hi> Principall of the Colledge of Glasgow, Doctor <hi>Baroune</hi> Commissioner from the Universitie of S. Andrewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with some others, who refused to sit with them any longer. The second was whether the Assembly, though discharged by Our Commissioner, was competent Judge to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and whether they would goe on in their tryall, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the reasons conteyned in their Declinator: and this passed affirmatively without one contrarie voyce; and so for that night the Assembly was dismissed.</p>
            <p>Our Commissioner after he had left the Assemblie, that very night, though late, assembled Our Councell; none were absent except the Earle of Argyle, who made some excuse and pretence for his not comming, and the Lord Almond, who was then sick. Two things Our Councell resolved on; first, to write unto Us a letter of thanks for those gracious proffers, which Wee by Our Commissioner had made at the Assembly; Next, to draw up a Proclamation for the dissolving of the Assembly. Their Letter here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

And albeit the wished effects did not follow, but by the contrary, by Our so gracious procedure they were rather embolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not onely to continue in their stubborne and unlawfull waies, but also daily adde to their former procedures acts of neglect, and contempt of authority, as evidently appeared by open opposing of Our just and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:17348:148"/>
pleasure and command, exprest in Our last Proclamation anent the discharge of the Service Booke, Booke of Canons, high Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, &amp;c. protesting against the same, and striving by many indirect meanes to withdraw the hearts of Our good people, not onely from a hearty acknowledgement of Our gracious dealing with them, but also from the due obedience to those Our just &amp; religious commands, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing We had been formerly so oft petitioned by themselves for the same. By their daily and hourely guarding and watching about Our Castle of Edinburgh, suffering nothing to bee imported therein, but at their discretion, And openly stopping and impeding any importation of ammunition, or other necessaries whatsoever to any other of Our houses within that Kingdome: Denying to Us their Soveraigne Lord that libertie and freedome, which the meanest of them assume to themselves, (an act without precedent or example in the Christian world,) By ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Convocations and Councell Tables of Nobility, Gentry, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and Ministers within the Citie of Edinburgh, where, not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lawes of the Kingdome, they, without warrant of authoritie, conveene, assemble, and treat upon matters, as well ecclesiasticall as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, send their injunctions and directions throughout the countrey to their subordinate Tables, and other under-ministers appointed by them for that effect. And under colour and pretext of Religion exercing an unwarranted and unbounded libertie, require obedience to their illegall and unlawfull procedures and directions, to the great and seen prejudice of Authority, and lawfull Monarchicall government. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it was evidently manifest by the illegall and unformall course taken in the election of their Commissioners for the Assembly, whereof some are under the censure of this Church, some under the censure of the Church of Ireland, and some long since banished for open and avowed teaching against Monarchie, others of them suspended, and some admitted to the Ministerie contrary to the forme prescribed by the Lawes of this Kingdome, others of them a long time since denounced Rebels, and put to the Horne, who by all law and unviolable custome and practique of this Kingdome, are, and ever have been incapable, either to pursue, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend before any Judicatorie, far lesse to be Judges themselves; some of them confined, and all of them by oath and subscription bound to the overthrow of Episcopacie. And by this and other their under-hand working, and private informations and perswasions, have given just
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:17348:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ground of suspicion of their partiality herein, &amp; so made themselves unfit Judges of what concerneth Episcopacie. And also it was sufficiently clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the peremptorie and illegall procedures of the Presbyteries, who at their own hand by order of law, and without due forme of processe, thrust out the Moderatours lawfully established, and placed others, whom they found most inclinable to their turbulent humours; associate to themselves for the choosing of the said Commissioners for the Assembly, a Laick-Elder out of each Paroch, who being in most places equall, if not moe in number then the Ministerie, made choice both of the Ministers, who should be Commissioners from the Presbyteries, as also of a Ruling-Elder; being directed more therein by the warrants from the foresaid pretended Tables, then by their owne judgements, as appeares by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall private instructions sent from them, farre contrary to the Lawes of the Countrey, and lowable custome of the Church: by which doings it is too manifest, that no calme nor peaceable procedure or course could have been expected from this Assembly, for settling of the present disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and distractions: Yet We were pleased herein in some sort to blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Our own judgement, and over-looke the saids disorders, and patiently to attend the meeting of the said Assembly, still hoping that when they were met together, by Our Commissioner his presence, and assistance of such other well disposed subjects who were to be there, and by their owne seeing the reall performance of all that was promised by Our last Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, they should have been induced to returne to their due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of subjects: But perceiving that their seditious disposition still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases, by their repairing to the said Assembly with great bands and troupes of men, all boddin in feare of warre, with guns and pistolets, contrarie to the lawes of this Kingdome, custome observed in all As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and in high contempt of Our last Proclamation at Edinburgh the <hi>16.</hi> of this instant: As also by their peremptory refusing of Our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors, authorized by Us (although fewer in number then Our dearest Father was in use to have at divers Assemblies) the power of voting in this Assembly, as formerly they have done in other Assemblies; and by their partiall, unjust, and unchristian refusing, and not suffering to bee read the reasons and arguments given in by the Bishops, and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to Our Commissioner, why the Assembly ought not to proceed to the election of a Moderatour without them, neither yet to the admitting of any of the Commissioners of the saids Commissioners from Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:17348:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before they were heard object against the same, though ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly required by our Commissioner in our name.

            <p>THis Proclamation being very solemnly made with sound of Trumpets, and by Harolds, with coats of Our arms on their backs, at the market Crosse of <hi>Glascow,</hi> was received with a Protestation read in the same place by <hi>Iohnston</hi> the then Clerk of the Assembly, assisted by the Lord <hi>Areskyn,</hi> and divers others, young Noblemen, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The paper which <hi>Iohnston</hi> read, was not, as it seemeth, that very Protestation which they printed; for he read some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of a paper to that purpose, and offered it by the name of a Protestation to him who read Our Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which paper the Clarke of our Councell offering to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>Iohnston</hi> refused to deliver it, saying, He must stay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it were written.

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:17348:150"/>
together in the Name of the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> the only Head, and Monarch of his own Church; And we <hi>Noblemen, Barons, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Ministers, Burgesses</hi> and <hi>Commons, Subscribers of the Confession of Faith,</hi> Make it knowne that where We His Majesties loyall Subjects of all degrees, considering and taking to heart the many and great innovations and corruptions lately by the Prelates and their adherents intruded into the doctrine, worship, and discipline of this Church, which had been before in great purity to our unspeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort established amongst us, were moved to present many earnest desires and humble supplications to his sacred Majestie, for granting a free ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assemblie, as the only legall and ready meane to try these inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, to purge out the corruptions, and settle the order of the church, for the good of Religion, the honour of the King, and the comfort and peace of the Kirk and Kingdome: It pleased his gracious Majestie, out of his Royall bountie, to direct unto this Kingdome, the Noble and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Lord, <hi>James</hi> Marques of <hi>Hammiltoun,</hi> with Commission to hear and redresse the just grievances of the good Subjects, who by many peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and frequent conferences, being fully informed of the absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a free generall Assemblie, as the only Iudicatorie which had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to remedie those evils, was pleased to undergoe the paines of a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to <hi>England,</hi> for presenting the pittifull condition of our Church to to his sacred Majestie; And the said Commissioner his Grace returned againe in August last, with power to indict an Assemblie, but with the condition of such prelimitations, as did both destroy the freedome of an Assembly, and could no wayes cure the present diseases of this Church which was made so clearly apparent to his Grace, that for satisfying the reasonable desire of the Subjects, groaning under the wearinesse and prejudices of longsome attendance, He was againe pleased to undertake another journey to His Majestie, and promised to indeavour to obtain a free Generall Assemblie, without any prelimitation, either of the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and members, or matters to be treated, or manner, and order of proceeding; so that if any question should arise concerning these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, the same should be cognosced, judged, and determined by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, as the onely Iudge competent: And accordingly by warrant from our Sacred Soveraigne, returned to this Kingdome, and in September last, caused indict a free Generall Assemblie to be holden at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the <hi>21.</hi> of November instant, to the unspeakable ioy of all good Subiects and Christian hearts, who thereby did expect the perfect satisfaction of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:17348:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their long expectations; and the finall remedie of their pressing grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances: But these hopes were soone blasted: for albeit the Assemblie did meet and begin at the appointed day, and hath hitherto continued, still assisted with His Graces personall presence, yet His Grace hath never allowed any freedome to the Assemblie, competent to it by the Word of God, acts and practice of this Church, and his Majesties In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but hath laboured to restraine the same, by protesting against all the acts made therein, and against the constitution thereof by such members, as by all law reason and custome of this Church were ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in our free Assemblies, and by denying his approbation to the things proponed and concluded, though most cleare, customable, and uncontraverted.</p>
                        <p>And now since his Grace after the presenting and reading of his owne commission from our sacred Soveraigne, and after his seeing all our commissions from Presbyteries and Burghes produced and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Assembly constitute of all the members by unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, doth now to our greater griefe, without any just cause or occasion offered by us, unexpectedly depart and discharge any further meeting, or proceeding in this assemblie, under the paine of treason; and after seven dayes sitting, declare all Acts made, or hereafter to be made in this Assemblie, to be of no force nor strength; and that for such causes as are either expressed in his Maiesties former proclamations, (and so are answered in our former protestations) or set downe in the declinatour, and protestation presented in name of the Prelats, (which are fully clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our answer made thereto) or else were long since proponed by the Commissioner his Grace in his eleven articles or demands sent unto us, before the indiction of the Assembly (and so were satisfied by our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, which his Grace acknowledged, by promising after the recept thereof to procure a free generall Assembly, with power to determine upon all questions, anent the members, manner, and matters thereof) all which for avoiding tediousnesse we here repeat: Or otherwise the said causes alleadged by the Commissioner, were proponed by His Grace, in the Assemblie; such as first, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:17348:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to have voice in the election of commissioners from Presbyteries, which was knowne to His Grace, before the indiction and meeting of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, and is so agreeable to the acts and practice of this Church, in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably observed before the late times of corruption, that not one of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly doubted thereof, to whom by the indiction and promise of a free assembly, the determination of that question, anent the members consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent propertie belonged.</p>
                        <p>And last, that the voices of the six Assessors, who did sit with His Grace, were not asked and numbered, which we could not conceive to be any just cause of offence, since after <hi>39.</hi> Nationall assemblies of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed church, where neither the Kings Majestie, nor any in his name was present, at the humble and earnest desire of the assembly, His Majestie graciously vouchsafed His presence either in His owne Royall Person, or by a Commissioner, not for voting or multiplying of voices, but as Princes and Emperours of old, in a Princely manner to countenance that meeting, and to preside in it for externall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and if Wee had been honoured with His Majesties Personall presence, His Majestie (according to the practice of King <hi>James</hi> of blessed memorie) would have onely given his owne Iudgement in voting of matters, and would not have called others who had not been cloathed with commission from the church to carry things by pluralitie of voices.</p>
                        <p>Therefore in conscience of our duty to God and his truth, the King and his honour, the Church and her liberties, this Kingdome and her peace, this Assemblie and her freedome, to our selves and our safety, to our Posterity, Persons and Estates, We professe with sorrowfull and heavie, but loyall hearts, That We cannot dissolve this Assemblie, for the reasons following.</p>

                           <hi>1.</hi> For the reasons already printed anent the necessity of convee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Generall Assemblie, which are now more strong in this case, seeing the Assemblie was already indicted by his Majesties authority, did conveene, and is fully constitute in all the members thereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word of God, and discipline of this church, in the presence and audience of his Majesties Commissioner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who hath really acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the same, by assisting therein seven dayes, and exhibition of His Majesties Royall Declaration, to be registrate in the Bookes of this Assemblie, which accordingly is done.</p>

in name of the Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons, whereunto We doe now iudicially adhere, as also unto the Confession of Faith &amp; covenant, subscribed &amp; sworn by the Body of this Kingdome.</p>

                           <hi>3.</hi> Because as We are obliged by the application and explication subioyned necessarily to the Confession of Faith subscribed by Vs; So the Kings Maiestie, and his Commissioner, and Privie Councell, have urged many of this Kingdome to subscribe the Confession of Faith made in <hi>an. 1580.</hi> and <hi>1590.</hi> and so to returne to the doctrine and discipline of this Church, as it was then professed: But it is cleare by the doctrine and discipline of this Church, contained in the book of Policie then regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate in the books of Assemblie, &amp; subscribed by the Presbyteries of this Church; That it was most unlawfull in it selfe, and preiudiciall to these priviledges which Christ in his Word hath left to his Church, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve or breake up the Assemblie of this Church, or to stop and stay their proceedings in constitution of Acts for the welfare of the Church, or execution of discipline against offenders; and so to make it appeare, that Religion and Church-government should depend absolutely upon the pleasure of the Prince.</p>

                           <hi>4.</hi> Because there is no ground of pretence either by Act of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, or Parliament, or any preceding practice, whereby the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie may lawfully dissolve the Generall Assemblie of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> far lesse His Maiesties Commissioner, who by his commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion hath power to indict and keep it, <hi>secundùm legem &amp; praxim:</hi> But upon the contrarie, His Maiesties prerogative Royall, is declared by Act of Parliament, to be no wayes preiudiciall to the priviledges and liberties, which God hath granted to the spirituall office-bearers, and meetings of this Church; which are most frequently ratified in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments, and especially in the last Parliament holden by His Maiestie himself: which priviledges and liberties of the Church, his Maiestie will never diminish or infringe, being bound to maintain the same in inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie by solemn oath given at his Royal Coronation in this Kingdome.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <hi>5.</hi> The Assemblies of this Church have still inioyed this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of uninterrupted sitting, without or notwithstanding any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramand, as is evident by all the Records thereof; and in speciall by the generall Assembly holden in <hi>anno 1582.</hi> which being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with letters of Horning by the Kings Majestie his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner and Councell, to stay their processe against Master <hi>Robert Montgomerie,</hi> pretended Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> or otherwise
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:17348:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to dissolve and rise, did notwithstanding shew their liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by continuing and sitting still, and without any stay, going on in that processe against the said Master <hi>Robert,</hi> to the finall end thereof: And thereafter by letter to his Majestie, did shew clearly, how far his Majestie had been uninformed, and upon misinformation, prejudged the prerogative of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and the liberties of this Church, and did inact and ordain, that none should procure any such warrant or charge under the pain of excommunication.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <hi>6.</hi> Because now to dissolve, after so many supplications and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, after so many reiterared promises, after our long attendance and expectation, after so many references of processes from Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, after the publick indiction of the Assemblie, and the solemn Fast appointed for the same, after frequent Convention, formall constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Assemblie in all the members thereof, and seven dayes sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, were by this act to offend God, contemne the Subjects petitions, deceive many of their conceived hopes of redresse of the calamities of the Church and Kingdome, multiply the combustions of this Church, and make every man despair hereafter ever to see Religion establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Innovations removed, the Subjects complaint respected, or the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders punished with consent of authority, and so by casting the Church loose and desolate, would abandon both to ruine.</p>
                        <p n="7">
                           <hi>7.</hi> It is most necessary to continue this Assembly for preveening the prejudices which may ensue upon the pretence of two Covenants, whereas indeed there is but one, That first subscribed in <hi>1580</hi> and <hi>1590</hi> being a Nationall covenant and oath to God; which is lately renewed by Vs, with that necessary explanation, which the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons introduced since that time contrary to the same, inforced: which is also acknowledged by the Act of councell in September last, declaring the same to be subscribed, as it was meaned the time of the first sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription: And therefore for removing that shame, and all prejudices which may follow upon the show of two different covenants &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of Faith in one Nation, The Assemblie cannot dissolve, before it trie, find and determine, that both these covenants, are but one and the self same covenant: The latter renewed by us, agreeing to the true genuine sense and meaning of the first, as it was subscribed in <hi>Anno 1580.</hi>

            <p>THe Reader shall not need to looke after much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in this protestation; for if he doe, he will be sure to lose his labour. Much is repeated in it, of that which hath beene delivered in their former petitions and protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; all which shall now be passed by, what is new in it, the Reader shall doe well to cast his eye upon that, taking along with him this advertisment, That there is little or indeed nothing in it new, which is true. Towards the beginning you finde the Protestation made, not onely in the name of the generall Assembly, but in the name of the <hi>Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Ministers, Burgesses, and Commons, Subscribers of the Confession of Faith</hi>: Now how this Protestation could be made at Glasgow in their names, who at that time neither were acquainted nor possibly could be acquainted with what passed at Glasgow, being in the severall parts of the Kingdome so farre distant from
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:17348:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, and many parts having no Commissioners there, except those that were in the Assembly, Wee leave it to the Readers consideration. They affirme not many lines after, That it was made <hi>cleare to Our Commissioner, that the Assembly which hee meant to indict in August, was clogged with such prelimitations, that he undertooke another journey to Us, and promised to endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a free generall Assembly without any prelimitation, &amp;c.</hi> All which is so farre from truth, as nothing can be more; for he did never desire the Assembly to be prelimited; for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by their instructions both publique and private did prelimitate it, he did onely desire, that (according to the usuall custome before Assemblies) some previous meeting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation might be held concerning the formes of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; which might very well have been forgot, there having been no Assembly held for many yeeres before. Againe, in the last words at the end of the first section, one would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how any man could have the boldnesse to affirme, That this their Assembly was constituted <hi>of such members, as by all law, reason, and custome of that Church were ever admitted in their free Assemblies,</hi> since they in their owne conscience doe know, that there is no law extant for lay-Elders having voice in generall Assemblies: And if there be no law for it, We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the judgement of every man indued with reason, whether there can bee any reason found for it, and whether if such a proposition were to be propounded, and to passe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a law, he would give his voice unto it if he had power so to do, That lay-men (especially many of them, being ignorant and mechanicall persons) should sit in the highest Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Judicatorie, and by their voices determine points of faith, and other highest points of doctrine, and to inflict the highest censures of the Church, even excommunication and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, not onely of Ministers, but of Bishops, especially when in an Assembly the number of the lay-voices shall be equall or very neere equall to those of the Clergie, So that it may fall out, that the voices of the lay-men, having the voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces but of twenty or thirty Clergie men concurring with them in opinion, may carrie the determination of the highest
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:17348:155"/>
point of doctrine against the rest of the Clergie, and those perhaps the holiest, ablest, and most learned, though their number exceed a hundred. Sure if such a proposition were to be past into a law, few voices would be found to enact it; and therefore if there be no law for it already (as undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is none) they might have done well not to have talked of reason for it: And that which they averre of the custome of that Church, is as untrue as what they said either of law or reason: for We demand if there have been never a free Assembly in Scotland these last forty yeeres? Sure they will confesse there hath been; and yet in none of these, lay-Elders chosen by and sent from Presbyteries had voices in these Assemblies: nay, since the first Reformation, hath there been any free generall Assembly in that Kingdome? No que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion they will say there hath; and yet We challenge them to name but any one Assembly before this, in which the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters chosen Commissioners to it from the severall Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were chosen by the voices and suffrages of lay-Elders: so that for that point it is impossible they should alledge either law, reason, or custome, or so much as any one instance; and yet the elections of all the Ministers present at this Assembly were carried by the voices of lay-men, and in many places in despite of the Ministers.</p>
            <p>A little after the beginning of the second section they doe affirme that which they themselves doe know not to be so; for when they say that Our Commissioner <hi>did unexpectedly depart and discharge any further meeting or proceeding in this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> how can that stand with the words of the Earle of Rothes, who when Our Commissioner was rising and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of the assembly, told him, that his departure and discharging of the assembly was a thing not unlooked for, but expected by them; and therefore they were provided for him, and had a Protestation ready written against his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of the assembly, which he desired him to heare (as is before mentioned?) But Our Commissioner refusing, the Clerke presently begun to reade it, and Our Commissioner and Councell at their departure left them reading it; and after
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:17348:155"/>
his departure it was read out to the end, and presently put to voices whether all the members of the assembly would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to it; and the very Title page of their Protestation affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that it was first read in the high Church, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the Market-Crosse of Glasgow: Besides, the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour made a speech to Our Commissioner upon his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which none of the auditors did conceive to bee extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie; for when it was compared with any other speeches of his, delivered at any other time of the Assembly, it was agreed that it was so much better penned or premeditated and delivered then any of the rest of his speeches, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it was provided against Our Commissioners depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and yet these men protest, that Our Commissioners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture and discharging of the Assembly was to them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unexpected, when they knew that they had carried themselves, and meant to carry themselves so, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible but that he should discharge the Assembly. A great marke of the sinceritie of their proceedings.</p>
            <p>That which immediately after they adde, That <hi>they have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared in their answer</hi> to the Bishops Declinator all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contained in it against the assembly, <hi>as also those proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by Our Commissioner in his</hi> 11. <hi>Articles or Demands, sent unto them before the indiction of the Assembly, and that Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner acknowledged so much,</hi> is all of equall untruth with the former; for neither have they satisfied the Bishops rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons propounded in their Declinator, nor gave they any satisfaction to Our Commissioner his eleven Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or Demands: and that Our Commissioner acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that hee had received satisfaction to them is so manifest an untruth, as they themselves doe know there is no colour for it: They affirme within a few lines after, that <hi>Our Commissioner did know, before the indiction of the Assembly, that ruling Elders were to have voices in the election of Commissioners from Presbyteries</hi>: He did know it indeed, but could not tell how to helpe it; and so soone as he did know it, which was immediately before the indiction of the Assembly, he did sharply expostulate it with them, and assured them, that it
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:17348:156"/>
would induce a nullitie upon the elections made to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly; That We would never allow any for members of the Assembly who were so chosen; That he had notice of this their intention by the complaints of many covenanting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, who were resolved to protest against all such electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but that he did know of any such elections with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of them, cannot be charged upon him. And whereas they say, that these elections <hi>are agreeable to the Acts and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of that Church,</hi> they have received already a sufficient chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to make that good, which undoubtedly they cannot: And where they adde, that <hi>not one of the Assembly doubted thereof,</hi> it is well knowne that some of the Ministers of Edinburgh, and many more Ministers of the Assembly did grieve at it, but did not know how to remedy it.</p>
            <p>The whole third Section is so derogatorie to Our Royall authoritie, and indeed doth so unworthily debase the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Monarchs, as it is not to be answered any way but by justice: for it giveth no more power to Us, if We had beene present and sitting at the Assembly at Glasgow, then <hi>Thomas Patterson</hi> a Taylor of Edinburgh had, who sate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner there.</p>
            <p>After, they subjoine some reasons for their Protestation: In the first, they affirme that the Assembly was constituted by the word of God; but they doe not prove it, and sure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will. Then they affirme, that Our Commissioner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the lawfulnesse of their <hi>Assembly, by assisting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in seven dayes</hi>; but they conceale that he solemnely protested, and entred his particular Protestation against every thing they said or did in it; and if hee who protesteth against a thing, may be said to acknowledge the lawfulnesse of it, then it may be that they themselves doe acknowledge the justice and equitie of all Our Proclamations, and Our power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in discharging of this Assembly, notwithstanding all their Protestations made against these. And for Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner his <hi>exhibition of Our Royall Declaration to be registred in the Bookes of this Assembly,</hi> let the Reader remember the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation before mentioned, which Our Commissioner made
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:17348:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when he did so, and that scruple is quickly removed.</p>
            <p>Their second and third reasons are of their owne fancies: They have lately sworne so, and to that sense they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated their Covenant, therefore it must be so: But they did wrong in both, and therefore none must follow them in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for every Oath unlawfully taken is unlawfully kept.</p>
            <p>Their fourth reason hath not one true word in it; for there is Law for Our authoritie to dissolve the Assembly, there being an expresse Act of Parliament which giveth Us the sole power of indicting of an Assembly, <hi>viz.</hi> the first act of the 21. Parliament of Our Royall Father: and sure, <hi>ejusdem est destituere cujus est instituere,</hi> whosoever hath the power of indicting hath the power of dissolving. They adde that there is no preceding practice for it. We wonder they can or dare affirme it: Did not Our Royall Father discharge that Assembly at Aberdene? and when some few turbulent Ministers did notwithstanding hold it, were they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented before the Lords of his Councell for it? who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly had punished them most severely, if by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of the Councells authoritie, and appealing to a Generall Assemblie, they had not falne into an act of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and so by Our Councell were turned over to the Judges in criminall causes; before whom, by a Jurie or Assise, they were found guiltie of treason, for that act of declining Our Royall Father and his Councells authoritie, all which we touched a little before. And that by clayming Our power to indict or dissolve the Assemblies of the Church, We doe infringe the priviledge and liberties of the Church, or doe any act not consistent with the Oath which We took at Our Coronation in that Kingdome, as is suggested in this fourth reason, is most falsly and most seditiously affirmed, onely for drawing away of the hearts of Our good subjects from Us and our government. The Act of Parliament for Our sole power of indicting Assemblies here followeth.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Their fifth reason conteineth an instance of an Assemblie that would not stay a Processe which they had intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Archbishop <hi>Montgomerie</hi> the Archbishop of Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow, nor yet dissolve it selfe, notwithstanding they were charged by Our Royall Father and his Councell with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Horning and Rebellion to doe one of the two: An excellent argument, Because one Assembly did wickedly, and that which they could not doe, we must doe so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; as if many yeeres hence, an Assembly being charged by one of Our Successours to dissolve, should not obey, but alledge for their defence, That this Assembly of Glasgow would not dissolve it selfe, notwithstanding the members thereof were charged by Us to doe so under paine of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; as if one unjust act could justifie another. But they should doe well to remember, that those who did but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to hold an Assembly at Aberdene, after it was discharged by Our Royall Father, were first convented before his Councell, and afterwards severely punished for it.</p>
            <p>In their sixth reason there is no Reason to be found.</p>
            <p>In their seventh reason they alledge, that they cannot rise untill they have found Our Covenant and theirs to be all one. If by their Covenant they meane the Confession of Faith and Covenant annexed, which was first injoyned by Our Royall Father, and twice afterward by his authoritie renewed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then they needed not to have sit one houre lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for finding of that; for any man that can read may finde
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:17348:157"/>
the words and syllables of both, to be the very same with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least alteration: But if by their Covenant they doe understand their explications, additions, and glosses which destroy and corrupt the verie text of the first Covenant, then certainly they should not have risen yet, nor could have risen untill the end of the world; for they will never finde that these corrupt glosses, &amp; apocryphall additions of their owne, can consist with Our Royall Father his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and Covenant, upon which they pretend they ground their owne. Besides, as shall presently appeare, they have discharged all men to subscribe the Confession and Covenant commanded by Our authority; which Wee suppose they would not have done if they had found them to be one; and therefore if they be men of their words, they should have sate still and not risen yet, because as yet they have not found them to be one.</p>
            <p>After their seven reasons they adde seven protestations of the same piece with their reasons: The first, third, fourth, and fifth are not worth the reading, for they conteine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their usuall tautologies and taking the sacred name of God in vaine. In the second, and latter end of their sixth reason, their is so much boldnesse expressed, as could never have beene expected from any men who had been acquainted with the names of King, Law, Authoritie or Government: For who ever heard that subjects durst require their Kings Commissioner not to depart out of the Assembly, when he himselfe had pleased, although he had not been commanded by Us so to doe? what greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand could they have laid upon the meanest member of the Assembly then this, by which they affronted Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner and in him Us and Our authoritie? But their cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Our Councell, who signed Our Proclamation, to appeare as offenders before Us and Our three Estates of Parliament, (which by the way Wee wonder how they can bee made up without Bishops) and to answer the subscription of Our Proclamation as a crime, is a bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that calleth more for admiration then refutation. They cyte for this their doing the twelfth act of the second Parliament of Our Royall Progenitor <hi>James</hi> the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:17348:158"/>
fourth. Wee wondered that in his dayes there should bee any warrant found for the allowing the members of a generall Assembly in any thing, in whose time a generall Assembly had no existence: but when we looked upon the act, We wondered much more; for there is not so much as any word to bee read there, which can bee drawne to any shew of construction that way. That act attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth rather too much to Privie Councellours, then dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth them; so that upon perusall of the act, We were almost inforced to excuse them, and lay the fault upon the Printer, who had mistaken the cytation, untill Wee remembred that in their cytations both of other acts of Parliament, and many passages of holy Scripture, they are as farre out as in this, hoping (belike) that the Reader would never peruse them. That which they affirme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the sixth Protestation, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates moved Our Commissioner to dissolve the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, We must averre upon Our owne knowledge to be farre otherwise; for he did it by Our speciall comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, when none of the Prelates were neere Us to give Us any such advice. Their seventh protestation is usuall with them, and therefore now not to be taken notice of.</p>
            <p>And now when the Reader hath perused both Our Proclamation for the dissolving of that Assembly, and their Protestation against that Our Proclamation, and hath well weighed all the precedent first violences, and then jugglings for their obtayning of such persons onely to be elected, as should be sure to stand for such conclusions as they had resolved upon at their Tables at Edinburgh, We doe leave it to the judgement of every man to consider whether Wee could any longer continue that Assembly without indangering Our owne Royall authoritie, which they intended to supplant, and betraying into the hands and power of their sworne and combined enemies the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of that Church, who never declined, nor yet doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the tryall of a generall Assembly lawfully consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</p>
            <p>They did long call for a free generall Assembly; Wee granted them one most free on Our part, and in Our
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:17348:158"/>
intentions: But as they have handled and marred the matter, let God and the World judge whether the least shadow or footstep of freedome can in this assembly of theirs be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any man who hath not given a Bill of divorce both to his naturall light, that is, his Understanding, and to his connaturall light, that is, his Conscience. It is a great errour to conceive, that libertie and limitation are destructive one of another: for that freedome which admitteth no bounds and limits, is not libertie but licentiousnesse: When therefore they talked of a free generall assembly, We tooke it as granted that they meant not an assembly in which every one both in the necessarie preparations preceding it, and in the necessarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in it, might say and doe what hee would; but such an assembly, in which no man having interest, should bee barred either in the precedings to it, or proceedings in it, of that libertie which the lawes or customes of that Kingdome and Church in which that assembly was convocated, doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him: which two bounds whosoever shall transgresse, though they pretend libertie and freedome, yet in all true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment &amp; construction, they must be taken either for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed &amp; common, or clandestine enemies to the freedome of that assembly. What wresting and wringing was used in their last Protestation made at Edinburgh, to charge Our gracious Proclamation with prelimitations, is knowne; and it was detested by many even of their owne Covenant. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their courses, especially in the elections of the members of this assembly, were not onely prelimitations of it, but strong barres against the freedome of it, and such as did utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroy both the name and nature of a free assembly, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing upon it many and maine nullities, besides the reasons contained in the Bishops Declinator, let these few particulars declare.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, whereas they refused so much as to heare from Our Commissioner of any precedent treatie for repairing and right ordering of things before the Assembly, alledging that it could not be a free Assembly where there was any consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation before, either concerning the chusers, or those to bee
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:17348:159"/>
chosen, or things to be discussed in the Assembly, but that all things must be treated of upon the place, else the Assembly must needs be prelimitated. Whether they did not transgress in all these particulars is easie to bee discerned: For besides these instructions, which it may bee are not come to Our knowledge, We have seen, and Our Commissioner at the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly did produce foure severall papers of instructions, sent from them, who call themselves the Table, all of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining prelimitations, and such as are repugnant not onely to that which they called the freedome, but to that which is indeed the freedome of an Assembly: Two of these papers were such as they were content should be communicated to all their associates, <hi>viz.</hi> that larger paper sent abroad to all Presbyteries, before or about the time of Our indiction of the Assembly; and that lesser paper, for their meeting first at Edinburgh, then at Glasgow some few daies before the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, and for chusing of assessors; These two papers Our Commissioner delivered not into the assembly, because they did publiquely avow them: But their other two papers of secret instructions were directed, not from the Table pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, but under-hand, from such as were the prime Leaders of the rest; The one of them was delivered or sent onely to one Minister of every Presbyterie whom they trusted most, and was onely to be communicated to such as hee might be confident of, and was quite concealed from the rest of the Ministers, although Covenanters: The other paper was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected onely to one lay-Elder of every Presbyterie, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated as hee should see cause, and to be quite concealed from all others: These are the two papers which before you heard were delivered by Our Commissioner into the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and they did containe directions, which being follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as they were) did banish all freedome from this assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; as doth appeare before by the reading of the papers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second: Some Presbyteries did chuse their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners before the assembly was indicted, and therefore those Commissioners could not lawfully have any voice there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:17348:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third: Neither lay-Elder, nor Minister chosen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner by lay-Elders, could have voice in the assembly, because such elections are not warranted by the lawes of that Church and Kingdome, nor by the practice and custome of either; for even that little which seemeth to make for their lay-Elders, is onely to be found in these bookes, which they call the bookes of Discipline, which were penned by some private men, but never confirmed either by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Act of generall assembly; and therefore are of no authoritie: And yet in these elections they did transgresse even the rules of these bookes, there being more lay-Elders who gave voices at every one of these elections, then there were Ministers; contrarie to their bookes of Discipline, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that the lay-Elders should alwaies be fewer. But say there were an Ecclesiasticall order or law for these lay-Elders, yet the interruption of that order for above fortie yeeres, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth so strong a prescription in that Our Kingdome against it, as that without a new reviving of that law by some new order from the generall assembly, it ought not againe to have been put in practice: For if We should put in practice and take the penalties of many dis-used lawes, without new inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of them, it would bee thought by Our subjects hard usage.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth: In many Presbyteries these lay-Elders disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed wholly in their election from chusing those Ministers whom their owne fellow-Ministers did chuse, and carried it from them by number of voices, although in all reason the Ministers should best know the abilities and fitnesse of their brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fifth: These men elected as lay-Elders to have voices in this assembly, could not be thought able and fit men, since they were never Elders before, all or most of them being newly chosen; some of them were chosen lay-Elders the very day before the election of the Commissioners to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, which sheweth plainly they were chosen onely to serve their associates turne.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The sixth: Since the institution of lay-Elders by their own
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:17348:160"/>
principles is to watch over the manners of that people in that Parish wherein they live, how can any man bee chosen a Ruling-Elder from a Presbyterie, who is not an inhabitant within any Parish of the precinct of that Presbyterie? And yet divers such, especially Noblemen, were chosen as lay-Elders Commissioners from Presbyteries, within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts whereof they never were inhabitants, against all sense or reason, even upon their owne grounds.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The seventh: They can shew neither law nor practice for chusing assessors to the Ruling-Elders, without whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent they were not to give voice to any thing in the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The eight: The introducing of lay-Elders is a burthen so grievous to the Ministers, as that many Presbyteries did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and supplicate against them, and many Presbyteries (though they were in a manner forced to yeeld to it then) yet did protest against it for the time to come.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> The ninth: In the election of Commissioners to this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, for the most part the fittest men were passed by, and few chosen who ever were Commissioners at any assembly before: the reason was, they conceived that new men would not stand much for their owne libertie in an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, of the liberties whereof they were utterly ignorant: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, some were chosen who were under the censures of the Church, some who were deprived by the Church, some who had been expelled out of the Universitie for reading to their Scholars against Monarchicall government, some who had been banished out of that Kingdome for their seditious Sermons and behaviour, some who for the like offences had been banished out of Ireland, some who were then lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sentence of excommunication, some who then had no ordination or imposition of hands, some who had lately been admitted to the Ministerie, contrarie to the standing lawes of that Church and Kingdome, and all of them were chosen by lay-Elders: Now what a scandall were it to the Reformed Churches, to allow this to be an assembly, which did consist of such members, and so irregularly chosen?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:17348:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> The tenth: Divers members of this Assembly, even whilst they sate there, were Rebels, and at Our Horne; and so by the lawes of that Our Kingdome uncapable of sitting as Judges in any Judicatorie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> The eleventh: Three oathes were to bee taken by every member of this Assembly: the oath to the confession of faith lately renewed by Our commandement, the oath of Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the oath of Supremacie, any of which three oathes whosoever shall refuse, cannot sit as a Judge in any Court of that Kingdome; and yet none of all these three oathes were sworne by any member of this Assembly.</p>
            <p>Besides these nullities of this Assembly, what indecencie and rudenesse was to be discerned in it? not so much as the face of an Ecclesiasticall meeting to bee seen, not a gowne worne by any member of it, unlesse it were by one or two Ministers who lived in the Towne, the appearance in a manner wholly Laicall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amongst the members of it were seven Earles, ten Lords, fortie Gentlemen, one and fiftie Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses; many of them in coloured clothes, and swords by their sides, all which did give voices not onely in very high points of controversie (which We are sure very many of them did not understand,) but also in the sentences of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation pronounced against the Bishops and others: Nay and more, all things in the Assembly carried by the sway of these lay-Elders, insomuch that all the time which Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner stayed in the Assembly, it was a very rare thing to heare a Minister speake; for there was one Earle and one Lord who spake farre more then all the Ministers, except the Moderatour. And in the Assembly every thing which was put to voices, was so clearly discerned to have been resolved amongst themselves before by a palpable pre-agreement, that it was very tedious to the auditors to heare the List of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly called, when the conclusion of it was knowne to them all, after the hearing of his voice who was first called; which made some present to envie no member of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly but one, whose fortune it was ever to bee first called, his name being set downe first in the List; his name was
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:17348:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Master <hi>Alexander Carse</hi> Minister of Polwart, one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners from the Presbyterie of Dunce: For if the Acts of this Assembly should come out in Latine, and bee thought worth any thing in the Christian world, and withall it should be expressed that the List of the members of it was called to the passing of every Act, and his name should ever be found to be the first, there was never a Father nor Bishop, whose name is in any of the Greeke or Latine Councells, so famous as this man should now be: for hee would be taken for a man of an unparalleled judgement both for soundnesse and profoundnesse, from whose judgement not one of the whole Assembly (except one, and that but once) did ever swerve in the least particular; for as he begun, all the rest did constantly follow.</p>
            <p>All these things being well considered, what hope could bee conceived of any good, either for the Church or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, from an Assembly thus miserably constituted? And therefore We resolved to dissolve it, as knowing that it would make that Church and Kingdome ridiculous to the whole World, especially to the adversaries of Our Religion; that it would both grieve and scandalize all the other Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, and make Our Justice to bee universally tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, if We should have suffered the Bishops Our subjects, in that which concerned their callings, their reputations and fortunes, to be judged by their sworne enemies thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared against them.</p>
            <p>After Our Commissioners departure from Glasgow, they still continued their Assembly notwithstanding Our dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it by Proclamation under paine of treason: And then immediately the Earle of Argyle, who indeed all this while had beene the heart of their Covenant, begun to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe openly to be the head of it; for he presently adjoined himselfe to them, sate continually with them in the assembly, although he were no member of it, nor had suffrage there, but sate onely as their chiefe director and countenancer, and indeed like Our Commissioner.</p>
            <p>It was not to be expected that after We had dissolved the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:17348:161"/>
assembly, they would observe any greater moderation in their proceedings then they had done before: nor did they indeed; for all things passed in a hudling confusion, nothing argued publikely, but every particular referred to some few Committees, who were the most rigidest they could pick out of the whole packe: what they resolved on, was propounded presently to the assembly, swallowed downe without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discussing; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Alexander Carse</hi> was called up, what he said first all the rest said the same. In one houre they declared six generall assemblies to be null and void, though two of them were then and are still in force by severall acts of Parliament, and divers acts of the other foure are ratified and confirmed by Parliament. In another houre they condemned, upon the report of a few Ministers, all the Arminian tenets (as they call them) and, under that name, many things received by all the Reformed Churches: a strange way, to condemne the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian tenets without defining what those tenets were. In another houre, they deprived the Archbishop of Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes, the Bishops of Galloway and Brechen, and so at other times all the rest of the Bishops, many of whom they likewise excommunicated: where it is observable, that in the printed acts of this their (now after Our dissolving of it) pretended assembly, the acts of the depositions of the Bishops beare no such odious crimes, as they had made Our people beleeve they were guilty of in that infamous libell which they caused to be read in the Pulpits against them; for proofe whereof We have caused one of their sentences of deposition to be here inserted, whereby it may be seene that not so much as one witnesse was examined, nor offered to be produced against them for any one of those fearfull crimes with which they were slandered in the libell, but were onely deposed for their obedience to acts of Parliaments and generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>

            <p>IN another houre they declared Episcopall government to be inconsistent with the lawes of that Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and so abolished it for ever, though it did then, and doth still stand confirmed by many Acts both of Parliaments and Assemblies: they deprived the Ministers, whose hands were at the Protestations against lay-Elders and elections made by them: some Ministers they deprived for Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme; a course never heard of in any place where any rule of justice was observed, that a Minister should be deprived for holding any tenet which is not against the doctrine of that Church wherein he liveth, and that before it be prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and condemned by that Church: Now there is nothing in the confession of that Church against these tenets. At the Synod of Dort no man was censured for holding any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine against the conclusions of it, before the Synod had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined against them, nor was hee to bee censured for any thing he had preached or printed, before that Synod did ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto him their Canons to be subscribed: But at Glasgow no such course was taken, but Ministers were deprived without so much as ever being once asked the question whether they held any such opinion; or if they did, whether they would now recall their opinions, and conforme their judgements to the judgement of the Assembly in these points. Some of their Ministers being asked the question, With what conscience or justice they could deprive their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren for holding opinions not condemned by that Church, who perhaps after their Church had condemned them, out of their love to the peace of their Church would have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne any further medling with them; They returned this weake answer, That these tenets were condemned by that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:17348:163"/>
Church under the generall name of Poperie: But they could make no answer when it was told them, That certainly these tenets could not be counted Popish, concerning which, or the chiefe of which, as learned Papists as any in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dominicans and Jesuites did differ as much as the Protestants did; and that those who doe adhere to the Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan confession, did hold that side of these tenets which the Arminians doe hold, and yet they were very far from being Papists, being the first Protestants; and therefore it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all sense to condemne that for Poperie, which was held by many Protestant Churches, and rejected by many learned Papists. But all would not serve; they would deprive Ministers for holding them, before they themselves had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them. In the deprivation of one of these Ministers there did fall out a memorable passage, which was this: The Moderatour of the Assembly, after the sentence of a Ministers deprivation, was pleased to move this learned question to the Assembly, Whether<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if this deprived Minister should bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize a childe, the childe must not be baptized againe? But he was presently taken off by one of his brethren, who it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth was much ashamed of such a question, &amp; told him, That they did never re-baptize those who had been baptized by Popish Priests; and so all further talke of it was hushed. What conclusions were to bee expected from an Assembly whose Moderatour was so grosly ignorant as to move such questions, is easie to be conjectured.</p>
            <p>And the weaknesse of their conclusions would easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, if all their severall Acts were printed; but because the Reader shall be able to make some judgement of them, We have here caused an Index of the titles of their Acts to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, by which may be seen what they hold.</p>

            <p>BY these it is easie to be discerned what conclusions, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sedition and Rebellion, and the overthrow of the lawes both of Church and Kingdome, were agreed upon; what false, nay and what foolish positions there were esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished; For instance, Had it not been enough to have remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Episcopall government, the five Articles of Perth, and the other pretended innovations, if they had been furnished with lawfull power so to doe? No, but they will have it concluded, that all these were abjured in the confession of faith when it was first sworne; which no reasonable man can beleeve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which they themselves did allow in many not to abjure when they first swore their Covenant, and to which many Ministers, members of this Assembly, had sworne at their admission into their Benefices, according to the Acts of Parliament, and Acts of generall Assembly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in that case; And so by swearing that these things were abjured in the first confession, they make them profess that they had perjured themselves in taking the other oath of their conformitie to these pretended innovations: Upon which rocke one Minister of the Assembly finding himselfe to be set fast, when that Act was voiced unto which decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Episcopall government, and the five Articles of Perth to have been abjured formerly, and so to be for ever removed: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert Baylie</hi> voiced thus, <hi>Removed but not abjured,</hi> to the great scandall of the rest of the Assembly, hee being reputed for one of the ablest men in it: But the Act was drawne up in these termes, <hi>Abjured and removed,</hi> by the voices of all the Assembly, except his alone, who, knowing that all the Acts were particularly to be read and voiced to againe, had drawn
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:17348:165"/>
up a supplication to the Assembly in the name of those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, who before had conformed themselves to the five Articles of Perth, for a mitigation of that Act, at least that it might receive a publique hearing and arguing; which the rest having knowledge of, when that Act came to bee read and voiced to againe, one of the Lords, who was a lay-Elder, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded with the Clerke, that in calling the List this Minister his name should be omitted, and so the Act passed without so much as asking of his voice, who had his supplication ready when he should be called upon by his name, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the omission of his name was purposely done, he durst stirre no more in it, for feare of publique envie, and some private mischiefe which might be done unto him; And yet you must think this was a most godly and free Assembly.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of their Assembly, they divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into severall Committees, which should after their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing see all their Acts put in execution; a thing never heard of before in that Church. The Moderatour concluded with thankes to God for their good successe, and then to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and the rest for their great paines, and last of all with a speech to the Earle of Argyle, giving him thankes for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and counsell, by which they had been so much streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and comforted: The Lord Argyle answered him with a long speech; first, intreating all present not to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construe his too late declaring himselfe for them, protesting that he was alwaies set their way, but had delayed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it so long as he found his close carriage might be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to their cause; but now of late, matters had come to such a height, that he found it behoved him to adjoin himself openly to their societie, except he should prove a <hi>Knave,</hi> (this was, as We are informed, his owne word): Then he went on and exhorted them all to unitie, wishing all, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Ruling-Elders and Ministers, to keepe a good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence; intreated all the Ministers to consider what had brought the Bishops to ruine, <hi>viz.</hi> pride and avarice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willed them to shun these two rockes if they would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape shipwrack.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:17348:166"/>The Lord who delivered this speech, delivered indeed the true meaning and sense of the Covenanters: for it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bishops bringing in the pretended innovations, nor their suspecting them to bee guilty of the odious crimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed against them in their Libell, which incensed this and the other Covenanting Lords against the Bishops, but their feare of their daily rising in dignitie and place, which in this speech is called pride in them; and their feare that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops might recover out of their hands by law some of the Church lands belonging to their Churches, which in this speech is called avarice in the Bishops. In the meane time, whether it be not pride in these Lords to envie any mans ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the Church and Common-wealth, according to that worth and sufficiencie which his Prince shall find in him, and whether it bee not avarice in them not to endure that other men should legally seeke to recover their owne from them, shall be left to the judgement of the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But for this revolted Lord who made this speech, and professeth in it, That if he had now not adjoyned himselfe to them, he should have proved a Knave, We can give this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of him, That at his last being here with Us in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (at which time We had good reason to mis-doubt him) he gave Us assurance that hee would rest fully satisfied, if We would performe those things which Wee have made good by Our last gracious Declaration (in which We have gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more then We did at that time promise) so that We had little reason to expect his adjoyning himselfe to them, who had given Us so great assurance to the contrary, besides that assurance which hee gave to Our Commissioner when hee was in Scotland. And now if by his owne confession hee carried things closely for the Covenanters advantage, being then one of the Lords of Our secret Councell, and that in the end hee must openly joyne with them or bee a Knave; what hee hath proved himselfe to bee by this close and false carriage, let the World judge.</p>
            <p>Our Commissioner, after he had by Our commandement dissolved the Assembly, hearing that they who remained
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:17348:166"/>
still at Glasgow under the name of an Assembly, went about to put such a sense upon that confession of faith and band annexed, which We lately had commanded to bee renewed, as agreed best with those corrupt glosses and false interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which by their owne Covenant they had put upon it, as if Episcopall government had now by Our commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment been abjured; and so did begin to magnifie Our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and resolved to declare it to be all one with their owne, though they had in their Pulpits called it the depth of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and had assured their followers, that it could not bee sworne unto without perjurie, and that even after that Act of Councell, upon which they did ground their interpretation, he, having perused Our instructions which required him not to suffer the confession of faith to be sworne in any sense, which might not consist with the lawes of that Church and Kingdome then in force; thought it convenient to print a Declaration of Our cleare meaning and intention in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that oath; which, so soon as it was published, made them quite change their minds, and prohibit the subscription to Our Covenant, which they had immediately before so much extolled: Our Commissioners Declaration We have here caused to be re-printed together with their printed answer to it, because We are confident both by Our owne judgement, and the judgement of others who have perused them both, that the five reasons contained in Our Commissioners De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration stand yet unshaken for any thing delivered in their answer unto them; and that as strongly as the Divines of Aberdenes first Queries, Replies and Duplies doe.

                        <p>WHereas some have given out that by the Act of Councell, which explaineth the Confession of Faith lately commanded to bee sworne by his Majestie, to be understood of the Confession of Faith, as it was then professed and received, when it was made, and that in that Confession, defence both of the doctrine and discipline then esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished is sworn, at which time Episcopall government being (as they
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:17348:167"/>
say) abolished, it must needs follow, that the same government is by this late oath abjured.</p>
                        <p>And understanding that even amongst those who continue together still at Glasgow, under the name of a pretended and unlawfull generall Assemblie, this objection is held to be of some moment, and used by them to the great disturbance of the peace of this Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to the great disquieting of the mindes of such his Majesties good subjects as have taken the said Oath, and yet never meaned nor do meane to abjure Episcopall Government; and to perswade others, that if they shall take the same Oath thus explained by the said Act of Councell, by so doing they must likewise abjure the said government..</p>
                        <p>We <hi>James</hi> Marquesse of Hamiltoun, his Majesties High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, wondring that any such scrupulous misconstruction should be made of his Majesties gracious and pious intentions, and being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to remove all doubts from the mindes of his Majesties good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to keep them from being poysoned by such as by forced and forged inferences would make them beleeve, that they had actually by taking that Oath sworne that which neither virtually nor verily they have sworne, or ever intended to sweare, or was required by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to be sworne by them, either directly or indirectly; considering that all Oathes must be taken according to the minde, intention, and commandement of that Authoritie which exacteth the Oath; and that we, by speciall commandement from his sacred Majestie, commanded the said Oath to be administred, wee do hereby freely and ingeniously professe and declare our minde and meaning herein, as wee have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly heretofore done since our comming into this Kingdome about this imployment; <hi>viz.</hi> That by any such words or Act of Councell we never meaned or intended that Episcopall government should bee abjured, nor any thing else which was established by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Acts of the Church of this Kingdome which are now in force, and were so at the time of the taking of the said Oath.</p>
                        <p>Nor indeed could wee have any other intention or meaning, being clearely warranted and expresly commanded by his Majesties instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to exact the said Oath, and take order that it should bee sworne throughout the Kingdome in that faire and lawfull sense, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Neither in this point did we deliver our owne words, or his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties minde ambiguously or doubtfully, so as any other sense, to our thinking, could bee picked or wrung out of either the one or the other; for we do attest the Lords of the Councell, whether wee did not to manie, or all of them upon severall occasions in conference with them ever since our comming into this Kingdome, constantly declare unto them, that his Majesties resolution was not to suffer Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall government to be abolished: Wee attest all the Lords of Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether before our tendering of that Oath to them, or their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships taking of it, wee did not fully and freely declare to them, that his Majesties minde in commanding us to see this Oath taken, and our own minde in requiring them to take it, was onely to settle and secure the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:17348:167"/>
Religion and Faith professed in this Kingdome, but was not to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the abjuring of Episcopall government, or any other thing now in force by the Lawes of this Church and State at the time of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring this Oath, which their Lordships, being the reverend and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Judges of the Lawes, knew well could not bee abjured; after which perspicuous predeclaration of our minde, their Lordships un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly in that same sense and none other took the said Oath.</p>
                        <p>And now, good Reader, having heard his Majesties minde and intention, and in pursuance of them the minde of his Majesties High Commissioner concerning this Oath, the reasons to repell the former objection seeme to bee needlesse (the knowne minde of the supreme Magistrate who urgeth an Oath, being to be taken for the undoubted sense of it;) yet for as much as that objection hath of late beene main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged for alienating the mindes of many of his Majesties good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and well affected to that government, from adhering unto it, be pleased to know, that the former objection hath neither shew nor force of reason in it, and that by the said Oath and that explanation set down in the Act of Councell, Episcopall government neither was, nor possib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could bee, abjured, and that for many reasons, but especially these five, which we having seen and approved, have caused to bee here inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and leave them to thine impartiall consideration.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, God forbid it should be imagined that his Majestie should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his subjects to take an Oath which in it selfe is absolutely unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but for a man to sweare against a thing which is established by the Lawes of Church and Kingdome in which he liveth (unlesse that thing be repugnant to the Law of God) is absolutely unlawfull, untill such time as that Kingdome and Church do first repeale these Lawes; and therefore Episcopall government, not being repugnant to the Law of God, nay, being consonant unto it, as being of Apostolicall institution (which shall be demonstrated if any man please to argue it) and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fully established, both by Acts of Parliament, and Acts of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assemblie at the time when this Oath was administred; to abjure it before these Acts be repealed, is absolutely unlawfull, and against the word of God: and it is to be hoped no man will conceive that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie meaned to command a thing absolutely unlawfull. And if it should be said, as it is said by some, (who not being able to avoid the force of reason, do betake themselves to pitifull shifts and evasions) that these Acts of Parliament and Assembly, establishing Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall government, were unlawfully and unduly obtained; certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they have any reasons for this their bold assertion, which is of a more dangerous consequence then that it ought to be endured in any well setled Church or Common-wealth; these reasons may bee presented lawfully to these judicatories to entreat them to reduce the saids Acts, if there shall be strength and validitie found in them: But to hold, that untill such time as these judicatories shall repeale the saids Lawes, they either ought to bee, or can possibly bee abjured, is a wicked position, and destructive of the verie foundation of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:17348:168"/>
both in Church and Common-wealth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it cannot bee imagined that this Oath should oblige the now takers of it farther then it did oblige the takers of it at first: for doctrine and points of faith it did oblige them then, and so doth it us now, perpetually, because these points in themselves are perpetuall, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, and eternall: But for points of discipline and government, and policie of the Church, that Oath could binde the first takers of it no longer then that discipline and government should stand in force by the Lawes of this Church and Kingdome, which our Church in her posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Confession of Faith printed amongst the Acts of Parliament, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. 20.21. declareth to bee alterable at the will of the Church it selfe, and so repealable by succeeding Acts, if the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>rch shall see cause. When a King at his Coronation taketh an Oath to rule accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawes of his Kingdom, or a Judge at his admission sweareth to give judgement according to these Lawes, the meaning of their Oaths cannot be that they shall rule or judge according to them longer then they continue to be Lawes: but if any of them shall come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to bee lawfully repealed, both King and Judge are free from ruling and judging according to such of them as are thus lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, notwithstanding their originall Oath. Since therefore if the first takers of that Oath were now alive, they could not bee said to have abjured Episcopall government, which hath been since establshed by Lawes of this Church and Kingdom, especially considering that this Church in her Confession holdeth Church government to bee altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the will of the Church; certainely we repeating but their Oath, cannot be said to abjure that government now, more then they could be said to do it if they were now alive and repeating the same Oath.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, how can it be thought that the verie Act of his Majesties commanding this Oath should make Episcopall government to bee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by it, more then the Covenanters requiring it of their associats, in both Covenants the words and syllables of the Confession of Faith being the same? Now it is well knowne that many were brought in to subscribe their Covenant, by the solemne protestations of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers and urgers of it, that they might subscribe it without abjuring of Episcopacie, and other such things as were established by Law, since the time that this Oath was first invented and made; and the three Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in their first answers to the Aberdene Quaeres have fully and clearely expressed themselves to that sense, holding these things for the present not to bee abjured, but onely referred to the tryall of a free generall Assemblie: And likewise the adherers to the last Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation against his Majesties Proclamation, bearing date the ninth of September, in their ninth reason against the subscription urged by his Majestie do plainely averre, that this Oath urged by his Majestie doth oblige the takers of it, <hi>to maintaine Perth Articles, and to maintaine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacie.</hi> Why therefore some men swearing the same words and syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables should have their words taken to another sense, and bee thought to abjure Episcopall government, more then others who have
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:17348:168"/>
taken the same oath in the same words, must needs passe the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of an ordinarie understanding.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> It is a received maxime, and <hi>it cannot be denied, but that oaths mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred unto us must either bee refused, or else taken according to the knowne minde, professed intention, and expresse command of Authoritie urging the same:</hi> A proposition, not onely received in all Schooles, but positively set down by the adherers to the said protestation <hi>totidem verbis</hi> in the place above cited. But it is notoriously knowne even unto those who subscribed the Confession of Faith by his Majesties commandment, that his Majestie not onely in his Kingdomes of England and Ireland, is a maintainer and upholder of Episcopall government according to the laws of the said Churches and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, but that likewaies he is a defender, and intends to continue a defender of the same government in his Kingdome of Scotland, both before the time, and at the time when hee urged this oath; as is evident by that which is in my Lord Commissioner his Preface, both concerning his Majesties instructions to his Grace, and his Graces expressing his Majesties minde, both to the Lords of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and to the Lords of Session; and the same likewayes is plainly expressed and acknowledged by the adherers to the said pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation in the place above cited: their words being these; <hi>And it is most manifest that his Majesties minde, intention, and commandment, is no other but that the Confession be sworne, for the maintenance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as it is already or presently professed (these two being co-incident altogether one and the same, not onely in our common forme of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but in all his Majesties Proclamations) and thus as it includeth, and continueth within the compasse thereof, the foresaids novations and Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie, which under that name were also ratified in the first Parliament holden by his Majestie.</hi> From whence it is plaine, that Episcopacie not being taken away or suspended by any of his Majesties declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as these other things were which they call novations; it must needs both in deed, and in the judgement of the said protesters no wayes bee intended by his Majestie to be abjured by the said oath. Now both the <hi>major</hi> and that part of the <hi>minor</hi> which concerneth Episcopall government in the Church of Scotland, being clearly acknowledged by the Protesters; and the other part of the <hi>minor</hi> concerning that government in his other two Kingdomes being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously knowne, not onely to them, but to all others who know his Majestie, how it can be imagined that his Majestie by that oath should command Episcopacie to be abjured, or how could any one to whom his Majesties minde concerning Episcopall government was known, honestly or safely abjure it, let it be left to the whole world to judge; especially considering that the Protesters themselves in that place above cited, by a <hi>dilemma,</hi> which we leave to themselves to answer, have averred, that when that Act of Councell should come out, yet that it could not be inferred from thence that any such thing was abjured.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="332" facs="tcp:17348:169"/>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly and lastly, If the explanation in that Act of Councell be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that not onely rigid but unreasonable and senslesse sense which they urge, yet they can never make it appeare, that Episcopall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the first time of the administring of that oath was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished: The very words of that Confession of Faith, immediatly after the beginning of it, being these, <hi>Received, beleeved, defended by many and sundrie notable Kirks and Realmes, but chiefly by the Kirk of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the Kings Majestie and three Estates of this Realme, as Gods eternall truth and onely ground of our salvation, &amp;c.</hi> By which it is evident, that the subscription to this Confession of Faith is to be urged in no other sense then as it was then beleeved and received by the Kings Majestie, and the three Estates of this Realme at that time in being; and it is well knowne, that at that time Bishops, Abbats and Priors made up a third Estate of this Realme, which gave approbation to this Confession of Faith: and therefore it is not to bee conceived, that this third Estate did then abjure Episcopacie, or that Episcopacie was at the first swearing of that Confession abolished. But say that at that time it was abolished by Acts of generall Assemblie, yet was it not so by any Act of Parliament, nay by many Acts of Parliament it was in force, because none of them was repealed; some whereof are annexed in the sheet immediatly after these reasons, which wee pray the Reader carefully to peruse and ponder: and at the very time of the taking of this oath and after, Bishops, whose names are well knowne, were in being. Now it is to bee hoped that in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, or any other well constituted republick, that damnable Jesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall position shall never take place, That what is once enacted by a Monarch and his three Estates in Parliament, shall ever be held repealed or repealable by any Ecclesiasticall nationall Synod.</p>
                        <p>By all which it is evident, that the explanation of that Act of Councell so groundlesly urged, can induce no man to imagine that by the Confession of Faith lately sworne by his Majesties command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Episcopall government, which then did, and yet doth stand e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished by Acts of this Church and Kingdome, either was, or possibly could be abjured.</p>
                        <p>And having now (good Reader) heard his Majesties minde in his instructions to us, our minde in requiring in his Majesties name this oath to be taken, and these few reasons of many which doe evidently evince the inconsequence of that sense, which without any shew of inference is put upon it by those who would go on in making men still beleeve, that all which they doe or say is grounded upon Authority, though they themselves doe well know the contrary; wee suppose that all they who have taken this oath will rest satisfied that they have not abjured Episcopall government; and that they who shall take it, will take it in no other sense.</p>
                        <p>Which timely warning of ours, we are the more willing to give, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are given to understand, that even they who were wont to call the takers of this oath (notwithstanding of that explanation by
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:17348:169"/>
act of councell) perjured and damned persons, and in their pulpits called the urging of it the depth of sathan, doe now meane to take it themselves, and urge others to take it in that sense which they make men beleeve (though wrongfully) that act of councell makes advantageous to their ends.</p>
                        <p>But we doe in his Majesties name require that none presume to take the said oath, unlesse they bee required so to doe by such as shall have lawfull authoritie from his Majestie to administer it unto them: being confident, that none either will or can take the said oath or any other oath in any sense, which may not consist with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall government, having his Majesties sense, and so the sense of all lawfull authority fully explayned to them.</p>

            <p>First by the parliament 1567. cap. 2. whereby at the time of reformation the Popes authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was abolished, it is enacted by the said act, <hi>That no bishop, nor other prelate in this realme, use any jurisdiction in time coming by the bishop of Romes authority.</hi> And by the third act of the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, whereby it is declared, <hi>That all acts not agreeing with Gods word, and contrary to the confession of faith approved by the estates in that parliament, to have no effect nor strength in time to come.</hi> Whereby it is evident, that it was not the reformers inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion to suppresse episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, but that bishops should not use any jurisdiction by the bishop of Rome his authority; &amp; seeing they did allow episcopacie to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:17348:170"/>
in the church, that they did not esteeme the same contrary to Gods word and confession foresaid: as appeares more clearly by the sixth act of the said parliament, which is ratified in the parliament 1579. cap. 68. whereby it is declared, <hi>That the ministers of the blessed Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of Iesus Christ, whom God of his mercie hath now raised up amongst us, or hereafter shall raise, agreeing with them that now live in doctrine or administration of the sacraments, and the people of this realme that professe Christ as hee is now offered in his Evangel, and doe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the holy sacraments, as in the reformed kirks of this realme they are publickly administrate, according to the confession of the faith, to be the only true and holy kirk of Iesus Christ within this realme</hi>; without any exception by reason of policie and discipline, declaring only such as either gain-say the word of the Evangel according to the heads of the said confession, or refuse the participation of the holy sacraments as they are now ministrate, to bee no members of the said kirk so long as they keep themselves so divided from the societie of Christs body. Whereby it is manifest, that it was not the said reformers minde to exclude any from that society by reason of discipline, and that they did not at that time innovate or change any thing in that policie they found in the said kirk before the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>This is likewaies evident by the oath to be ministred to the king at his coronation, by the eigth act of the said parliament, wherby he is to sweare <hi>to maintaine the true religion of Iesus Christ, the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his holy word &amp; due and right ministration of the sacraments now received and preached within this realme, and shall abolish and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all false religion contrarie to the same</hi>; without swearing to any innovation of policie and discipline of the kirk.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it doth evidently appeare by these subsequent acts of parliament, that by the muncipall law of this realme archbishops and bishops was not only allowed in the kirk, but also had jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and authority to governe the same.</p>

short time they made such progresse, that being invested in the prime places of estate, and arming themselves with the boundlesse power of the high Commission, they made themselves lords over GODS inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: and out of their greatnesse, without any shew of order or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, without advise of the Kirk, but at their own pleasure enterprised to alter and subvert the former doctrine and discipline of this Kirk, and introduce many fearefull corruptions and innovations, to the utter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of Religion; and to make us no lesse miserable then we were happy before.

Yet some having subscribed that Covenant in different senses, others forbearing to subscribe the same, as some of the Lords of Session, till the Assembly should declare the genuine and true meaning of the Confession, upon whose interpretation, as of the onely competent Judge, they might acquiesce, and rest satisfied: which now after accurate tryall of the acts of generall Assemblies, and mature deliberation, is fully cleared, and explained in this last ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assembly by GODS mercy, and his Majesties gracious favour of indiction, holden at <hi>Glasgow</hi>: as the act made thereupon doth proport: whereby Episcopall government, mongst many other innovations is found upon undeniable evidences of truth and declared to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and abjured in this Kirk, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1580.

This Declaration is onely made by his Majesties Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <note n="*" place="margin">The Lords of Councell did take and were to take this oath as well as any other in the knowne sense of us who commanded it, and therefore any Act of Councell for their explanation was unnecessary, and it is unjustly affirmed that this Declaration or explanation was made by Our Commissioner, for it was made by Vs, but published by him at Our Commandement, as is plainly expressed in the title of it.</note> and not by the Lords of secret Councell, who should be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Interpreters of their owne act, and whose act should be the ample expression of their meaning, else acts of Councell, by possibilitie of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:17348:173"/>
admitting the variable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentarie of intentions, will losse all force &amp; vigour in themselves. And yet it is evident that the Councellers have not only actually sworne to maintaine the Religion &amp; Discipline establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. When Episcopacie was condemned; but likewise intended to doe so: because they have distinguished and opposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Religion presently professed, 1638. mentioned in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and the Religion professed in <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. mentioned in their act; and by that opposition of <hi>now</hi> and <hi>then,</hi> they reject the one, and swear the other: otherwise they needed no declaration: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding accompanies their subscriptions, and is acknowledged by the Commissioner in the second line, to bee an act explaining the Confession, for obedience whereof all those who have subscribed that Covenant, have done the same. 2. Albeit his Majesty did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any difference between the Religion, Doctrine and Discipline now profest, from that which was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. (wherewith his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie can hardly be acquainted, without perusing the records of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies) yet his Majesties Reall intention was to maintaine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith professed in <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. because his Royall disigne by that commandement was to maintaine true Christian Religion in puritie (whereunto Episcopacie by this Kirk was ever judged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as prejudiciall) and to remove the fears of his Majesties good Subjects, complaining of by-gone innovations, and apprehending greater changes: which ends are only obtained by subscription of the Confession as it was <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. And no wise by maintaining the Religion now presently profest; because the corruptions now present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received in this Kirk, are the grounds of our just complaints, as being <note n="*" place="margin">But when shall they bee proved to bee contrarie to the word of God?</note> contrary to the word of God, and foresaid confession in <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. 3. Wee must distinguish between oathes, tendered by the first framers of the Confession, <note n="*" place="margin">They themselves doe know that this Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not framed at first by the Church as the positive Confession was, but by one Master <hi>Iohn Crage,</hi> and commanded by the Authoritie of our Royall Father, hee did advise with the Church concerning it, but they received it from him, not he from them.</note> the whole Kirk, who have power to interpret and explaine the same, and oathes required, to bee renewed by the supreme Magistrat the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, who as <hi>custos utriusque tabulae,</hi> and a true <note n="*" place="margin">That the supreame Magistrate should as the Sonne of the Church onely receive the meaning of the Church, and cause it to bee received by his subjects, is not only the Jesuiticall tenet, but their very words and syllables, and as they are alledged here very false, for the greatest part of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession conteyneth not matters of faith, but of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, discipline and ceremonies: besides this confession was first injoyned by Our Royall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Councell before it was approved by the Church: how then Our Royall father, if hee were now living, should receive the meaning of it from the Church after hee had subscribed it, and commaunded his houshould to doe so; or we should now receive the meaning of it from the generall Assembly after it was subscribed by Our commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee cannot apprehend.</note> Sonne of the Kirk, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the true meaning of the Kirk, and cause it to be received of those whom God hath subjected to him.</p>
            <p>And wee are confident that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, in his just and pious disposition, will never take away the benefite of that holy nationall oath, and confession of Faith subscribed by his Majesties Father of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed memorie 1580. and now lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed againe, &amp; solemnely sworne by the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:17348:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Subjects of this Kingdome, upon the pretence of any intentions repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the true sense of that confession: which even as it is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Councell, doth never import that his Majestie was framing or administring any new confession or oath, but only injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to renew the old confession 1580. and therefore unquestionably should be taken in the true meaning of that time. Fourthly, if there were any reall opposition betwixt his Majesties Proclamation and the act of explanation made by his Majesties Commissioner and Councell, <note n="*" place="margin">Nay the first should be preferred: for if our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner and Councell had explained it contrarie to Our meaning, Our declaration comming after should be preferred to their misinterpretation.</note> Yet the last must be observed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the first, because the first is his privat will, the second his publick, and judiciall will. <hi>Et posterior derogat priori, publica privatae.</hi> And albeit we doe not now expresse that the Councell did subscribe the confession of Faith in obedience to a mandat, where there was any contrariety, repugnancie, or ambiguity betwixt the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat and the Confession it self, which was commanded, yet the Councell making an act that they did subscribe it as it was professed 1580. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring publickly that this was their owne meaning, both they and such of his Majesties liedges, who did subscribe in obedience of their charge, are obliged to observe <hi>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m juratam,</hi> and the reall matter of the oath (more then the minde and mandat of the prescriver) especially seeing it is no new Confession, but the renewed Confession of the whole Kirk of Scotland; The meaning whereof cannot bee declared nor interpret by any, but the whole Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> who now upon unanswerable reasons, have clearly found that Episcopall governement, was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished and abjured: It followeth by good consequence, that the Councell did both virtually and verily swear, yea intend to swear the abjuration of Episcopacie, which is found by that confession 1580. and the discipline of the Kirk then established, to be a corrupt government in this Kirk, of human invention, wanting warrand from the word of God, tending to the overthrow of this Kirk: So that any declaration in the contrare hereof is <hi>protestatio contraria facto,</hi> and the reasons thereof cannot be forceable, to brangle the resolution of any judicious well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Christian, if he will patiently read and ponder, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupation, these following answers to the five reasons insert in that declaration.</p>
            <p>The first aleadged reason is this, that his Majestie could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an oath absolutly unlawfull:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer to the first reason.</hi>
               </note> but it is absolutely unlawfull to swear against any thing established by the Laws of the Kirk and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if the same be not repugnant to the word of God or repealed by posteriour lawes. <note n="*" place="margin">The last part of the first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, though in it lyeth the principall explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this first reason.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To this we answer, First. The Kings Majesty by commanding his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to renew the confession of Faith for maintaning the doctrine &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline profest <hi>in anno</hi> 1580. hath commanded them to abjure whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is found by the competent Judge to bee introduced since that time repugnant therto, albeit by the corruption of times it were cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenanced with some law interveening. Secondly, the Lords of Councell and Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:17348:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and other Subjects have subscribed the confession of Faith as it was 1580. not only without any restriction of it to the present laws, but in a direct opposition to what is presently established by return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the present corruptions in the profession, <hi>tanquam termino a quo,</hi> to the profession 1580. <hi>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quam terminum ad quem</hi>: which a <note n="*" place="margin">How many of them have determined so? they know that they are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable in number to those who have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</note> great part of Councellours and other Subjects have declared to bee their meaning. Thirdly, Episcopacie is found by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> in many Assemblies to be an office unwarranted by the word of God, unlawfull and repugnant thereto: so that the abjuration thereof in this Kirk is lawfull and necessare. Fourthly, Episcopacy was never<note n="*" place="margin">Most false.</note> restored by any Assembly of this Kirk, nor these Assemblies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was condemned, repealed, without the which the same could not bee established by a Parliament, whose power doth no more reach to the placeing officers originally in the Kirk, then the Kirks power to the making states men in the common-wealth. Fifthly, the lawes which any wayes contribute to the introduction of Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, do only extend to civill privileges, and were alwayes protested against by the Kirk, as contrarie to the nationall Covenant of this land. Sixthly, if any Assembly can be pretended to countenance E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacie or other corruptions, it sufficeth to say that the same with all the acts thereof is declared to have been nul and void <hi>ab initio</hi> for undeniable reasons, as the act at more length proports. Seventhly, the breach of our nationall Covenant by introduction of corruptions therby abolished, hath undoubtedly in high measure offended God: and therefore at the renovation of that Covenant againe with God, we ought not only to abjure al these innovatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but hereafter should be carefull not to be relapse in our offence. Eightly, in no Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Episcopacie is expresly or <hi>specifice</hi> abjured, before all Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall lawes favouring the same was repealed, &amp; declared null, but only virtually and generally, as being formerly abjured <hi>in anno</hi> 1580. And as the tryall hereof was referred to the Assembly, as the only Judge competent, so now when the Assembly hath declared &amp; found Presbyteriall government to have been approved, &amp; Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall government condemned, abolished and abjured <hi>in anno</hi> 1580. and in liew of perceiving that Episcopacie is of an Apostolick insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, have clearly seen that it is justly condemned in our Kirk, as the invention of man wanting warrand or fundament in the word of God, tending to the overthrow of this Kirk, Therfore albeit Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie had been abjured expresly in the renovation of this Confession commanded by his Majestie, it was not unlawful, but most necessary and incumbent to us all, who are tyed by that nationall Covenant against that unlawful Hierarchicall government, albeit we had never renewed the same: But we are falsly calumniat to have condemned the name of a Bishop, even as it is used in Scripture, which the act of Assembly it selfe, sufficiently refutes, by allowing S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Bishops to-wit Pastours of a particular flock, and condemning only al other Bishops brought in without the warrand of Scripture.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer to the second reason.</hi>
               </note>The second reason in the Declaration is, that the oath for preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the discipline and government of the Kirk, cannot oblige after the alteration &amp; change of that discipline &amp; government: and seeing the Discipline and government of the Kirk is not only alterable, but cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged in this Kirk, we are not tyed by that oath, after the alteration.</p>
            <p>Wherunto we answer, first, that it is true, that policie and order in ceremonies is temporarie and may bee changed, as is meaned in that article of the Confession cited in the declaration: But a Bishop, or his office, or the government of Gods house cannot be called a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, nay, they will be loath to be vilified by that appellation: but if it be a ceremony, they are of no Apostolick constitution, as is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the first reason: so that if they be lawfull governours in Gods house, warranted by his word, they are not alterable: and so this second reason militats not for them, if their office be changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and accounted among alterable ceremonies: they are well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded from our Kirk; &amp; may be so by that second reason of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration. 2. One cause of generall Councels is, for constituting a good order and policie in ceremonies: which is grounded upon the last verse of the 14. Chap. to the 1. <hi>Corinth. willing that all things bee done decently and in order,</hi> wherein the Lord giveth not power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute new officers in his Kirk, but commandeth his owne officers to exerce their functions by his commandements without indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or confusion, in the variable circumstances thereof, to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined according to the present occasions of edification, 3. In the 15. Chap. of the same confession of Faith, all mens inventions in matters of Religion are condemned; And in the 19 Chap. Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall discipline uprightly ministred as Gods word prescribeth. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. is set down as the third essentiall and unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble marke of the true Kirk of God; and so is not of that nature with temporarie, changeable ceremonies; though unwarrantably ranked with them in the declaration. 4. It is evident at our first reformation what policie was perpetuall, and what ceremonies changeable, for in the first booke of Policie compyled that same yeare with the Confession, 9 head is expressed a two-fold policie of the Kirke; The one absolutely necessary in all Kirks, the other not necessar, but changeable; such as, what day of the week sermon should bee, and the like; whereof they established no order, but permitted every particular Kirk to appoint their own policie, as they thought most expedient for edification; if parity of reason will make Episcopacie of this nature, let all men judge. 5. Our confession speaketh of an order in ceremonies; which cannot bee appointed for all ages, as is before said. But when they speak of the office-bearers in the Kirk, they acknowledge according to the truth, that <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed an ordinare constant government of his Kirk by his four or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar office-bearers, The <hi>Pastor, Elder, Doctour,</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacon,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrat the same perpetually; as is set downe in the first booke of Discipline, and in the treatise before the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> which was drawn
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:17348:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
up at that same time, and allowed by the same persons. Like as in the yeare of God, 1560. when that confession was made, &amp; in the yeare 1567. when it was ratified, and by continuall acts of Assembly, and by the second book of Discipline; The government of Christs Kirk by these foure ordinarie office-bearers, is set down as founded only upon the Word of God, as constant unchangeable, and perpetuall; and as that holy discipline without which Gods word cannot be preserved; so that the intruding of any other officer in Gods house was accounted an offence against the Lord of the house. 6. By our oath, we are obliged to continue in obedience of discipline as well as doctrine, because they are both grounded on the Word of God, without the warrand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all traditions that are brought in are abjured, and the discipline of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> is set down in the book of policy, as grounded on Gods word &amp; commanded to continue to the worlds end, whereunto we have sworn, and cannot without perjury to God, gainsay it, like as the Assembly ordaines the discipline of the Kirk to bee subscribed as such, and the act of Parliament 1592. Ratifieth the discipline of the Kirk, as a privilege granted by God, whereinto the Kings prerogative cannot bee prejudiciall. 7. It carrieth no shew of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or face of probabilitie, that the Kirk and reformers of Religion which condemneth all other ordinar officers in the Kirk, but these foure appointed by <hi>Christ,</hi> did mean under the name of variable ceremonies, to comprehend and admit Episcopacy, which frequently they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, as an invention of man, without the warrand of Gods word, tending to the overthrow of the Kirk and puritie of Religion. 8. <note n="*" place="margin">Because in the XXI. Article cited, the word Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie is used, therefore they would inferre that this reason supposeth Episcopall government to be but a ceremonie: But weakly, for the reason consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in the word policie which they take no notice of, and Episcopall government being a part of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall policie, they hold the one alterable, (as all they doe who adhere to that XXI. article) must needs hold the other so too: nor can it be inferred from any thing in this reason that Episcopall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is mainteyned by it to be alterable, but that they themselves, and that XXI. article doe hold it to be so.</note> The <hi>Prelats</hi> themselves will not grant Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie to be reckoned in the orders of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which cannot bee unchangeably constitute for all ages, times and places, but are temporall as devised by man; and so changeable, when they rather foster su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition then edifie the Kirk, but herein they will disclaime the benefit of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reason, and undoubtedly affirme, that Episcopall government, not only may be, but should be, and was appointed for all ages, times, &amp; places; &amp; that it is not the devise of man te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall &amp; changeable, but deriveth its extraction from divine Apostolick, at the least Ecclesiasticall, perpetuall and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar institution, as is averred in the first reason; and so should ever be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. 9. This Kirk hath ever condemned all such as held the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and policie thereof, to be indifferent and changeable; &amp; in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in <hi>An.</hi> 1581. which is the year of the subscription of the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Faith, and book of policie, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert Montgomery</hi> is accused and condemned for that doctrine. 10. In the Assembly 1596. upon the Kings Majesties proposition, and demand that it might bee lawfull for him to reason or move doubts, in any point of the externall poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, government, or discipline of the Kirk, which are not ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:17348:176"/>
               <hi>affirmative</hi> or <hi>negative</hi> in the Scripture. The Assembly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that it might bee lawfull for his Majestie, or his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, to propone any point to the generall Assembly in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of externall government, alterable, according to the circumstances, providing it be done in right time and place, <hi>Animo aedificandi, non ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandi</hi>: But as for the essentiall discipline, in the book of Policie: <note n="*" place="margin">The As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired it, but did ever Our Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Father doe so?</note> The same Assembly desireth the Kings Majestie to declare before his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, that he never intended to prejudge the same. 11. Albeit it were granted that discipline were changeable, yet now seeing by the Kings Majesties own consent, we have sworn to maintaine the discipline of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as it was 1580. we are obliged strictly, <hi>interposito juramento,</hi> to abide by that discipline <hi>specificè</hi>: at least till it be lawfully changed by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in her free generall Assembly, which can never be presupponed: because <hi>in rei veritate,</hi> the Discipline, as well as the doctrine, is acknowledged and sworn to, as unchangeable, wherein we must continue all the dayes of our life: and defend the same according to our power, under the penaltie of procuring deservedly upon our selves, all the curses contained in Gods Word. 12. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> condemned Episcopall, and re-establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed Presbyteriall government perpetually: which we have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by joyning our selves in the assertory part of our oath, unto the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> in doctrine as well as in discipline, and in the promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory part thereof by swearing to continue in the obedience of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, as well as Doctrine: to show that Discipline as well as Doctrine, is not variable, nor so sworn to by us: but as an immutable law and constitution, which we are obliged to maintain perpetually.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer to the third reason.</hi>
               </note>The third reason is that we who subscribed the Covenant, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that Episcopacy was not abjured thereby, which is qualified by two instances. First that the Ministers in their answers to the <hi>Quaeres of Aberdeine,</hi> expressed themselves in that sense, holding these things for the present not to be abjured, but onely to be referred to the tryall of a free generall Assembly. Next, that it is averred in our last reasons against the subscription urged by his Majestie, that this oath, required by his Majestie, doth oblige the takers of it, to maintaine <hi>Perth</hi> arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and Episcopacie.</p>
            <p>This needeth no answer if the preceding narration, and the whole passages of the businesse were considered and known; for in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our Covenant, we did not expresly <hi>&amp; specificè,</hi> abjure Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, but onely generally and virtually, by abjuring whatsoever was abjured in the Confession, 1580. which we found to be a strong band, lying upon us to bind us straitly to the obedience of the discipline then established: wherein because there had interveined some alterations, we permitted justly the tryall thereof to the Kirk, whether <hi>Episcopacie, Perth articles,</hi> and other innovations were not condemned and abjured by the said oath, which now the Assembly after carefull search and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the records have clearly found. This is the true meaning and substance of the answer made to the <hi>Quaeres of Aberdeine,</hi> and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:17348:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ought also to be the ingenuous meaning of the Councellours, who by their act declared they subscribed the Confession 1580. as it was then professed: which is consonant to our generall application, and which being now declared by their mother Kirk, they ought to reverence and obey, and not upon light and subtill pretences to neglect and contemne. 2. For the second instance: It is true that when the Councell was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to subscribe the Confession, 1580. conforme to the warrands bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (that they should maintaine the Religion now presently profest) wee justly feared, that the same being subscribed in 1638. would comprehend Episcopacie, <hi>Perth</hi> articles, and all other corruptions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced since 1580. And therefore both in our written reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that subscription, and in our speeches at the Councell table, and to sundry Councellours in private, we dehorted them upon that reason from that subscription: which was the true cause why the Councell being convinced with that reason, made their explanatory act, declaring that they subscribed the Confession according to the meaning 1580. and as it was then profest, for removing of that doubt. 3. <note n="*" place="margin">We defie any man living to produce from any Jesuit or the greatest patron of equivocation yet ever heard of, such a wicked position as this, that the swearer is neither bound to the meaning of the exacter of the oath, nor to his own meaning who takes the oath, but to the realitie of the thing sworne, as it shall be afterward explicated by the competent Judge: For then no man can tell what he sweareth, when he sweareth; if the declaration of the competent Judge shall come after, it were to be wished that he who set downe this proposition, had set his hand to it, that the world might take notice of him for an ignorant foole and an arrand knave: In the meane time, till <hi>Iohnston</hi> finde out another, he must be taken for the man, because his hand is at this foolish Pamphlet.</note> Albeit by the meaning of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriver of an oath, the swearer were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly bound to maintaine <hi>Episcopacie, Five Articles of Perth,</hi> and such-like, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the premitted considerations, he is more oblished to the realitie <hi>rei ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratae,</hi> which is now declared and found to abjure Episcopacie, &amp;c. Nor to the meaning of the prescriver or his owne either, being contrare to the explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the soveraigne Judge compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>The fourth reason is Syllogistically urged thus:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer to the fourth reason.</hi>
               </note> It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but that oaths ministred unto us, must either be refused or else taken, according to the known minde, professed intention, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse command of authoritie urging the same. But it is notoriously known, that his Majestie, not onely in his Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> is a maintainer of Episcopall government, but likewise is a defender, and mindes to continue a defender thereof in his Kingdome of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And therefore the oath being taken, and not refused, must be sworn conforme to his Majesties known meaning. The minor is confirmed from our own Assertions.</p>
            <p>To this it is answered first, that in contradictory oaths, <note n="*" place="margin">This is directly contrary to the words of their owne protestation against Our Proclamation, dated the ninth of <hi>September:</hi> see their ninth Reason in that Protestation against the subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Covenant, and you shall finde it flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradictory to this which they affirme now.</note> the swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is more obliged to the true meaning of the oath, clearly exprest therein, then either to his own meaning, or any sense of the prescriver, being contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Especially in this case, where there is no new oath which may receive any new meaning, but the reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the old oath, which can admit no new destructive sense:

but must be sworn conforme to the genuine originall first meaning. 2. That oath was justly refused by us upon that ground of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pance amongst many others; and such like, was not received by the Councell, till they declared their meaning by act <hi>simul &amp; semel</hi> with their subscription. 3. We doe not meddle with the Kirks of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">They doe not meddle with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but yet in all their Writings declare that the government of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is against the Word of God; and the paterne shewed in the Mount: and that their new fancied government, conteined in their imaginarie books of discipline, is onely according unto it.</note> but recommends to them the paterne shown in the Mount: all our arguments and proceedings being for the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where, from the time of her more pure reformation then of her sister Kirks, Episcopacie hath ever been abolished, till the latter times of corruption. So that though his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie hath hitherto maintained Episcopacie in <hi>Scotland,</hi> because his Majestie wanted the meanes to be informed of the acts of this Kirk, yet we know that God hath so richly replenished his Royall breast, with such justice and pietie, that when his Majestie shall receive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect information, wee are confident that He will never desire any change or alteration in our ancient Kirk government and discipline. Especially now when his Majesty hath caused the maintainance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be religiously sworn.</p>

               </note> at the first time of administering the oath was abolished; the very words of that confession of Faith, immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beginning of it being these: <hi>Received, beleeved, and defended by many and sundry notable Kirks and Realmes, but chiefly by the Kirk of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the Kings Majestie, and three Estates of this Realme, as Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall truth, and onely ground of our salvation.</hi> Whereupon is inferred that Bishops, Abbots and Pryors, made up, at that time a third Estate of this Realme, which gave approbation to the confession of Faith: and therefore this third Estate did not abjure Episcopacie. And albeit it had bin abolished by acts of Assembly, yet it was not so by act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but in force by many of them standing unrepealed, which are annexed to the reasons. Which being the acts of a Monarch, &amp; his three Estates, are never repealable by any Ecclesiasticall nationall Synod.</p>
            <p>For answer hereunto, 1. It doth appeare and is manifest by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters and acts of Assembly, that before the subscription of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession at the time thereof, and thereafter: That <hi>Abbots, Priors,</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> were so clearly, evidently, and expresly condemned in this Kirk, That the best wits of this age opposers of Episcopacy cannot yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire one sillable to be added for farther assurance, and the most able maintainers thereof could not pick any quarrell to the clearnesse of the expression. 2. The clause citted in the reason, is onely anent the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and not anent the discipline, which thereafter is determined and the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> detested: And the Discipline of the Kirk sworn unto. 3. Albeit that clause were of discipline, yet it maketh nothing for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops except by inference, that they are comprehended under the name of the third estate: which cannot be so understood, for collections by
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:17348:177"/>
way of inference or <hi>ex consequenti,</hi> cannot be adduced against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse acts of the time: wherein the makers signifie their minds in clear termes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>&amp; apertissime dicendo,</hi> leaveth no place to presume the contrare: especially in this kingdome, where these expressions of <hi>stylus curiae</hi> are carefully observed without change: which may be seen in the same case by many Parliaments: where it is <note n="*" place="margin">But it is most notorious that at those Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were holden when the confession of faith was first sworne unto, Bishops had voyces and were present, and so then Episcopall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not be abjured, for proofe whereof We refer the reader to the Parliament Roll inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the end of this answer.</note> not our that no <hi>Prelate</hi> was present, or allowed: and yet the acts proporting to be made by his Majestie and three Estates are interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the quoter as made by the <hi>Prelats</hi> with others. 4. Episcopacie was abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only by acts of Assembly, but there is no standing laws for Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall government, but some against the same, as shall be evident in the answer made to the acts of Parliament, subjoyned hereto: but if there be any Acts of Parliament standing for Episcopacie, the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie; his Commissioner, the Councell, the Collective-body of the Kingdome, hath actually renunced the same by returning to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and discipline, 1580. whereunto Episcopacie is contrare: which God-willing may also be inacted at the next Parliament, proclaimed to be holden by his Majestie in <hi>May</hi> 5. The acts of the Assembly, and the book of Policie in the 1. and 10. chapter, putteth clear merches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt civill and Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction; making every one indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in matters properly belonging to their owne judicatorie, and every one subject to the other in matters properly belonging to that other. <note n="*" place="margin">Let any kingdome which is acquainted with Parliaments consisting of a <hi>Monarche</hi> and his three <hi>estates,</hi> digest this proposition, and then the Parliament can be no more the highest Court of the Kingdome.</note> So that as the Assembly cannot make ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill laws nor repeal them, nor imped the Parliament from making or repealing ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill laws, no more can the Parliament make Ecclesiasticall laws originally, nor repeal, or hinder the lawfull Assemblies to repeal the same. For albeit acts of the Assembly are, and may be ratified in Parliament, that is, only that the civill sanction may concur with the Ecclesiasticall constitution: But will not stop the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly to recall their owne act: which being adnulled by them, the <note n="*" place="margin">A most false position: As if the convocation in England, or the generall Assembly in Scotland had power to reconcile the two kingdomes to the Church of Rome, to reduce Poperie into them, and to restore to the Church all the Abbey lands, notwithstanding many Acts of Parliaments in both kingdomes to the contrary.</note> civill ratification and sanction fals <hi>ex consequenti.</hi> For to maintain that the Kirk may not repeal her own acts, ratified once in Parliament, is so derogatorie to Christs prerogative and ordinance, to the liberty of the Kirk, and freedome of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to the nature, end, and reason of all Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, as we have more largely cleared in the Protestation 22 <hi>September</hi> last) that we beleeve few or none will be of that opinion.

After the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this Kingdome, the Kirk was still wrestling against all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and especially against Episcopacie. But though they clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and frequently condemned the same, yet the power of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of reformation withstood them long: so that her owne policy could not be obtained ratified expresly <hi>&amp; specifice</hi> in Parliament, till the yeare of God 1592. which abrogateth all those proceeding acts, alledged in the contrare. 2. That acts of Parliament can no more make Ecclesiasticall offices, nor give Ecclesiasticall priviledges, nor the acts of Assembly can establish civill offices of Estate, or grant to them civill priviledges; each Judicatorie being properly confined within their owne spheres.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="351" facs="tcp:17348:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>But before the acts of Parliament be particularly marked and cited,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Answer to the acts</hi> 1567.</note> there be two reasons prefixed: the one taken from some acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 1567. cap. 2.3.6. and cap. 68. Par. 1579. The other from the oath ministred to the King, at his coronation, for the act of Parliament 1567. Bearing that no Bishop nor other Prelate in this Realme, use any jurisdiction in time comming by the Bishop of Romes authority, It is evident hereby that Episcopacy is altogether condemned, as all other Prelacie was: for before that time they had no jurisdiction but from the Pope: and therefore being discharged to execute that; they are discharged by the act to execute any at all. That this is the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and scope of that act is manifest: because the Kirk in the book of common order, and in the first book of discipline at that same time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth no other ordinary office bearers appointed by Christ <hi>in Ecclesia constituta.</hi> But the <hi>Pastor, Doctour, Elder</hi> and <hi>Deacon:</hi> and in her Assemblies at that same time, was still censuring these who were called or designed <hi>Bishops</hi> by reason of their benefices, as is instructed by the acts printed before the book of discipline. And therefore in the act of Councell, 1560. made in the same yeare by these same persons, ratifying the first book of discipline, they provided only that <hi>Bishops, Abbots, Pryors, &amp;c.</hi> Being protestants, brook their revenewes during their life-times: they sustaining Ministers in the meane time. 2. In the yeare 1566. which precedes that Parliament, the Kirk of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome approved the Confession of <hi>Helvetia</hi>; wherein the <hi>parity of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> is preferred as Gods ordinance warranded by his word, to <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,</hi> as an humane consuetude. 3. Because at that time the Queene had restored the Archbishop of S. Andrews; therefore the Kirk suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Nobility of the Kingdome, against that restitution, which they condemne as the curing of the head of the beast once wounded within this land. Wherein they expresly ground themselves upon the said act of Parliament being before made in the year 1560. as a certaine abrogation of the Arch-bishops authority. 4. In the 2. book of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline chap. 11. the Kirk useth the same act of Parliament as an abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Papisticall Kirk, and Papisticall jurisdiction, and thereby of Episcopall jurisdiction and power. 5. The Kirk thereafter in the same chapter declareth their uniformity of this meaning by urging the act of Parliament, 1567. printed amongst the black acts and renewed in the Parliament holden 1579. (which immediately followeth the act here cited) declaring that no other Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction shall be used within this Realme, but that which is and shall be in the reformed Kirk and floweth therefrom: and they urge that none under the abused ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in Papistry, of <hi>Prelates, &amp;c.</hi> attempt to claime the benefite of any act of Parliament, having no commission of the reformed Kirk within this Realme. Whereby our Kirk declared all <hi>Episcopall</hi> jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be <hi>Papisticall.</hi> Which is the true meaning of the word, his <hi>Hirarchie</hi> in the short confession. For their jurisdiction could flow from none other but from the <hi>Pope:</hi> Seeing it flows not from the Kirk: but was abolished and condemned by them: as is cleare by the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:17348:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Assembly. 6. The acts doe abolish all <hi>Papisticall</hi> jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And therefore all <hi>Episcopall</hi> jurisdiction, because <hi>Episcopall</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and jurisdiction is <hi>Papisticall:</hi> as is acknowledged by many, and specially by Doctor <hi>Poklingtun</hi> Chaplaine to the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> who deduceth a continuall lineall succession from <hi>Peter</hi> through the whole <hi>Popes,</hi> unto the present <hi>Arch bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> and by the quotter himselfe, who alledgeth (albeit falsly) that this Kirk retained the <hi>Papisticall</hi> Policy and government. 6. Where it is said in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; that our Kirk did not innovate any thing in that Policy which they found in the Kirk before the reformation: the same is controlled by the book of Common prayer, first book of Discipline, and acts of the Assemblies.</p>

The same doth not only not mention Bishops, but declareth the true Kirk to consist only of Ministers of the Gospell then living, and these who thereafter should rise; agreeing with them, in doctrine and administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and the people, as the members thereof, which directly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth Bishops: against whom the doctrine and practise of this Kirk, continually sounded: especially at that time. For in the government of this Kirk by weekly meeting of Ministers, Elders, and reformed townes from the yeare 1560. to the yeare 1576. (except the <hi>interim</hi> of the pretended convention at <hi>Leeth</hi> 1572.) and from the yeare 1575. to the year 1581. The Assemblies for the most part were imployed in abolishing the corruptions of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and in establishing the setled Policy: which was agreed upon, 1578. In the second book of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. In the which acts of Assembly and book of Discipline is set down at large the doctrine of the Kirk of Scotland, anent that disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as grounded and well warranded in the word of God, and against <hi>Episcopall</hi> jurisdiction, as an unlawfull humane invention: So that <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi> being contrary to the doctrine of the Kirk of Scotland, 1579. The <hi>Bishops</hi> disagreeing from the Ministers of the Evangel then living, in doctrine and in the use and administration of the Sacraments, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the said acts to be no members of this Kirk, and the same acts cited for them doe sufficiently evince that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was still condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, notwithstanding all opposition made in the contrare.</p>
                        <p>As for the Kings oath, the same containeth no mention of Bishops, but by the contrary,<note place="margin">

                           </note> the King is obliged thereby to maintaine the true Religion of Jesus Christ, the preaching of his holy word, and right ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Sacraments, then received and preached within this Realme. And seeing it is cleared by the preceeding relation, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were never allowed, but oppugned by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that oath doth not allow, but exclude Episcopacy which is also more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous in the short confession 1580. and 1581. when the Kirk set downe her constant policy in Doctrine and Discipline grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word of God, wherein the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> is abjured as contrary thereto; and craved an oath from his Majesty for maintenance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which now also our gracious Soveraign in the judgement of the Kirk
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:17348:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Scotland</hi> is obliged to maintaine, as being founded upon the word of God, and exclusive of Episcopacie as repugnant thereto. The acts of Parliament thereafter particularly cited are these mentioned in order.</p>
                        <p>The 24. act 1567. ratifying all civill priviledges formerly granted to the spirituall estate, and the 35. act 1571. Ratifying all acts made anent the freedome, and liberty of the true Kirk: the same cannot bee extended to the establishing of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> because it is not mentioned in these acts, but by the contrary was abolished by the acts of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and Parliament, before mentioned, so that the priviledges therein mentioned, are granted to such Kirk-men as then were received by the Kirk and Kingdome: and the freedome of the Kirk must be interpret by her owne judgement: who thought ever <hi>Episcopall</hi> jurisdiction an heavy bondage: and yet those priviledges can inferre no spirituall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, but only civill priviledges; some immunities and extempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons granted for the goods and persons of Kirk-men as is cleare, 1. act <hi>Iames</hi> 1. Par. 1. and 26, act Par. 2. <hi>Iames</hi> 1. and 4. act Par. 3. <hi>Iames</hi> 2. with many others.</p>
                        <p>It is here to be observed, that the carefull evolver of these acts of Parliament, hath omitted to cite the 7. act 1.

It is answered that the Kirk in this meane time, from the yeare 1575. was busied in abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and establishing the constant policie, as is cleare by the printed acts of Assembly before the book of Discipline, and unprinted acts of Parliament: The Kirk by her Commissioners daily reasoning and agreeing with the Kings Majesty and his Commissioners upon these heads of policie, whereupon the Parliament, by the said 69. act 1579. declareth there is none other jurisdiction ecclesiasticall to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, but that which is in this reformed Kirk, and floweth there-from, which extinguisheth <hi>Episcopacy</hi>; because it doth not flow from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Kirk: neither can produce its chartor from her: for besides that it was abolished by the foresaid acts 1567. It was condemned also in the book of Policie, and in the generall Assembly holden at <hi>Dundie,</hi> 1580. and their whole estate spirituall, and temporall condemned in the Assembly at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> 1581. and so acknowledged by his Majesties Commissioner in the Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> 1581. so that by this act of Parliam. 1579. The <hi>Bishops</hi> are so abolished, that unlesse they be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by lawfull Assemblies of the Kirk, no act of Parliament since sen can conduce for their establishment: seeing this act with the other acts for their abolition, standeth yet unrepealed. And farther for the act of Parliament, 1578. if the same contribute any thing, for <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> it must either be because <hi>Bishops</hi> are there mentioned, or for the power thereby conferred upon them: But both these are weak grounds. The first because there is no <hi>Bishop</hi> there named, but such as stood provided <hi>de facto</hi> on life: which is an designation of the benefice, which was not then extinct; and not of the office which was extinct. The power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them by the said act can give no strength to the argument: because there is no jurisdiction granted thereby to them, but only pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to visit Hospitalls: which the Parliam. might have granted to any person: but was most proper to these idle titulars of benefices, who might best attend the same, or imploy means for their reparation. And this charge is likewise communicate by act of Parliament to all Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours of this Kingdome for the time being: And as to the 71. act 1579. we repeat the former answers that <hi>Superintendents</hi> and <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners</hi> are there joyned with the <hi>Bishops</hi>; to show that no power is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them as <hi>Bishops,</hi> but <hi>Commissioners</hi> from the Kirk, and the name is still used, because the benefice was not extinct, but they were knowne by that appellation.</p>

                              <hi>Anent the act</hi> 1581.</note> for it is an expresse ratification of the former acts of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and abrogation of all acts or constitutions, cannons ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill or municipall contrare to the Religion then presently profest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this kingdome: which is not only clearly exprest in the words: but if they were doubtsome (as they are not) were manifest for these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. First, the Assembly holden at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> about the very same day, honoured with the presence of his Majesties Commissioner, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by him to have condemned <hi>Episcopacy</hi> whereunto tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall jurisdiction is annexed: and the Assembly declaring that function to be against the word of God and acts of the Kirk, thereupon did sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat the Parliament, that they should make no acts repugnant to the word of God, especially concerning <hi>Bishops.</hi> Secondly, the King and Estates by that act ratifieth all acts made for maintainance of the liberty of the true Kirk of God, presently professed within this Realme and purity thereof: which present profession can be no other, then that which was received by the Kirk and Assembly then presently sitting so near the Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which had approven the <hi>Presbyteriall government,</hi> condemned the <hi>Episcopall,</hi> and ratified <hi>the short confession simul &amp; semel,</hi> wherein the Estates had sworn to the <hi>Presbyteriall</hi> and abjured <hi>Episcopall</hi> government. Thirdly, this ratification of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer acts of Parliament must bee interpreted, according to the words thereof, to be in all points, which are not prejudiciall to that purity of Religion and liberty of the Kirk presently professed within this Realm. And at this time the whole Estates had subscribed the short Confession and so sworn to the discipline, set down in the book of discipline, which by this act is ratified in the first place, before any speciall enumeration of particular acts. Fourthly, it hath beene formerly showne that in the preceeding acts of Parliament where <hi>Arch-bishops</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi> are named, the same hath beene by reason of their benefice, and not their office: which the Parliament could not give them being abrogate by Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: or having intended really to give them any place, would not have joyned <hi>Superintendents</hi> and other Commissioners with them: or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they are named as having equall power with the <hi>Superintendents</hi> and other Commissioners, as in the convention at Leeth; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the time, especially 1572. and 1573. Wherein some titulars or possessors of prelacies, so called in the 46. act of the Parliament 1572. had a commission from the Kirk like unto <hi>Superintendents,</hi> which was not fully abrogate untill 1580. But all this was without prejudice of the Kirk her liberty, to recall her own commission from these who were provided to prelacies; and to condemne their <hi>Episcopall</hi> offices, whereunto they ascrived the power; which they really had by their commission: as the Kirk did upon good reasons abrogate the office of <hi>Superintendents</hi> without impunging of the saids acts of Parliament (which were never rescinded till 1592.) whereby it is evident, that though this act of Parliament 1581. ratifie the former acts wherein <hi>Arch bishops, Bishops, Superintendents,</hi> or other Commissioners
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:17348:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Kirk are named, yet seeing the said acts are <hi>alternative</hi> conceived, the vigour and efficacy thereof subsists by this ratification in the last alternative; viz. Commissioners from the Kirk, Dyoces or Province: seeing the remanent were formerly condemned: especially by this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Edinburgh holden the time of the Parliament. Fifthly, this ratification 1581. of the former acts made in favours of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion repeating only the titles of these acts and not themselves, cannot import any corroboration of the offices under the titles mentioned in these former acts: because this ratification, can only be extended to the matter, and not to the designation of the persons, exprest in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer acts, which is only personall and circumstantiall, as for instance, this act 1581. could not confer any power or employment upon <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents:</hi> because that office was then abrogate; and out of the Kirk. But the true meaning of the act is; that ratifying the substance and matter in favours of the Kirk and Religion, it doth intrust the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to these whom the Kirk shall lawfully authorize with commission for that end, which is more manifest in the 114. act Par. 12. 1592. wherein this act 1581. and all the acts therein contained are ratified <hi>quoad materiam:</hi> and yet all <hi>Arch-bishops</hi> and <hi>Commissioners</hi> are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged and all Ecclesiasticall matters subjected to Presbyteries. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it cannot probably agree with reason that by this ratification the Parliament, above their power would endevoure to establish in the Kirk any function so recently condemned of before by the Assemblies at <hi>Dundie</hi> 1580. and at <hi>Glasgow</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> 1581. immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Parliament.</p>

To answer: <hi>Primo,</hi> that the Kirk from the yeare of God 1580, 1581. that the Confession was subscribed, unto the year 1597. all this time was by continuall acts condemning the office of <hi>Bishops,</hi> their spirituall, their temporall, their whole estate, their confusion of civill and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall jurisdiction, and craving in Councell and Parliament the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of Prelacies and the erection of Presbyteries.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>De facto</hi> the former <hi>Bishops</hi> being continually processed and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced by the Kirk, these who presumed to usurp that office condemned by the Kirk, namely Mr. <hi>Patrick Adamson,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert Mountgomrie</hi> in the yeare 1582. 1584. 1586. they were deprived and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by this Kirk before the Parliament, 1587.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>De facto</hi> no Ecclesiasticall <hi>Bishop</hi> voted in Parliament but <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomry</hi> and <hi>Adamson,</hi> who were taken in by the Earle of <hi>Arran,</hi> unto the Parliament holden in <hi>May</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> 1584. Wherein the <hi>three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states</hi> ratifieth the honour and dignity of the <hi>three Estates,</hi> so that as these

two <hi>Bishops</hi> cannot be called the <hi>third Estate</hi> which doth ratifie, so the Estate of <hi>Bishops,</hi> cannot be called the <hi>third Estate,</hi> which is ratified: especially seeing by that same Parliament in the 132. act. <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Diocie are but nominate the Kings Commissioners. And in the last act of that same Parliament, printed of old in black letter, there is set downe the Kings Commission granted to the said pretended Bishop <hi>Adamson.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. From 1581. till the yeare 1597. the quoter doth not eite nor can cite any act of Parliament expresly nominating any ecclesiasticall <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> but that in the 1584. wherein he is named as one amongst other the Kings Commissioners, whereof some were meere secular persons.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It is cleare by the first act of the ninth Parliament 1584. and the eleventh act of the 10. Parliament 1585. that <hi>Bishopricks, Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Abbacies, Priories, Nunries,</hi> were then thought to be alike in the Kings hands, were granted to whatsoever persons being his subjects, albeit they brooked no office in the Kirk: so that some of these lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships and Baronies were erected before 1587. and excluded from the annexation.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. As the Kirk had ever been craving the dissolution of Prelacies, and condemning the temporall as well as the spirituall estate of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> by their act of the Assembly 1581. and by their censure of the Presbyterie of <hi>Striviling</hi> for admitting <hi>Montgomrie</hi> to the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Bishoprick of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and censure of <hi>Mountgomrie</hi> for aspy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereto, contrare to the word of God and acts of the Kirk in the Assembly 1587. <hi>Iuni.</hi> So in the 11. Parl. of King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixt 29. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1587. 29. act. The three Estates of Parliament annexeth to the crown, all Lordships and Barronies pertaining to whatsoever, <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,</hi> or <hi>Bishops, Abbots, Pryors, Nunnes,</hi> and <hi>Munkes:</hi> reserving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to <hi>Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Pryors, Pryoresses, commendators,</hi> and others possessours of great Benefices of the estate of <hi>Prelates,</hi> and which before had or hath vote in Parliament, the principall Castles and Fortalices: whereby it is cleare, that the <hi>stylus curiae</hi> naming three Estates did no wayes include Ministers being <hi>Bishops:</hi> seeing no ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall <hi>Bishops,</hi> sate in that Parliament, nor could sit: because the only two <hi>Bishops</hi> of the time <hi>Adamson</hi> and <hi>Montgomery,</hi> were before depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and excommunicat, and certainly they neither would nor could have sitten as an Estate in Parliament to abrogate their owne estate and lordships, and temporall land, whereupon that act acknowledgeth any right they had, did depend. 2. It is cleare that <hi>Archbishops</hi> or <hi>Bishops, Abbots, Pryors, &amp;c.</hi> all alike voted in Parliament of old, not by reason of their ecclesiasticall office, but by reason of their great benefices and lordships: which here is said to have had vote in Parliament: for that cannot be relative to the persons, as unto <hi>Pryoresses:</hi> but unto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices.

                           </hi> were called <hi>Bishops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots,

&amp;c.</hi> by vertue of the benefice without any office, in the rolls of Parliament, and in the act of Assembly 1587. The <hi>Bishoprick</hi> of <hi>Cathnes</hi> is said to vaike by decease of <hi>Robert Earle of March,</hi> the Kings Uncle: And the Assembly in their letter to the King declareth, to be against the word of God and acts of the Kirk, to present and admit any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to that Bishoprick, as also some of these titulars, and possessours of the benefices, albeit they had no ecclesiasticall office, did some times ryde and vote in parliament. 3. It is cleare that the three Estates by taking away from <hi>Archbishops,</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> their Lordships Barronies, and temporall lands, they took away their vote in parliament, which doth not subsist, but in and by the benefice, and therefore ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call persons separat to the Gospel for want of their great benefices, had no vote in parliament, till the 1597. (albeit all the interveened acts are made by the three Estates,) wherein the Kings Majesty restoreth Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to the titles and dignities of Prelacies, which showeth that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were disponed to others then Ministers; and provideth that Ministers presented to these titles and dignities, and to the benefice of <hi>Bishopricks,</hi> shall have vote in parliament; which sheweth that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice and not the office giveth right to vote in parliament, like as the very act of parliament 1606. acknowledgeth, that by the act of anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation of the temporality of benefice to the Crown 1587. the estate of <hi>Bishops</hi> were indirectly abolished; and therefore they behoved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scind the act of annexation anent the benefice, and restore them to these titles and dignities, before Ministers could vote in parliament, but these acts also are hereafter answered. 7. But as for 130. act 1584. no <hi>Bishop</hi> is therein mentioned; and yet it is adduced for <hi>Bishops,</hi> because the three estates are therein named, under one of which the <hi>Prelate</hi> claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be comprehended, but why more he then <hi>Abbots,</hi> and <hi>Pry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Yea, after the 1592. where Bishops were discharged, for if Bishops were an estate, there behoved to be foure estates of parliament; as there are so many named in the Commission granted by King JAMES, and King CHARLES, viz. The Clargie, Nobility, Barons, and Borrows, and that as ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call persons separate to the Gospel, since the reformation, were never warranted to voice in Parliament, while 1597. So on the other part, the Barons are, and have beene, as an estate of parliament in uncontravered possession of voting in parliament, conforme to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:17348:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the 101. act Parl. 7. King IAMES the first, renewed again in the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 1585. and 1587. act 113. wherein precepts of the Chancelary are ordained to be directed to the Barons as unto an Estate of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: even as they shall be direct unto other Estates, to wit, The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and Borrows; which in that act is mentioned. So in this same act of parliament (which in the narrative relateth the bygone great decay of the ecclesiasticall Estate) There are exprest three compleat Estates in Parliament, The Nobility, Barrons, and Borrows. And as in law the three Estates are intire without Bishops or Ministers voters in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, So also, it is most expedient, and necessar for the liberty of the Kirk, honour of the King, and peace of this kingdome: That no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters vote in Parliament, as is more clearly and largely proved in the reasons of the protestation, given into Parliament against the same, 1606. And in the act of this Assembly against civill places of Kirk-men.</p>
                        <p>As for the 131. act 1584. no <hi>Bishop</hi> is therein mentioned to get any benefite thereby, and far lesse can the same reach to the prejudice of the late Assembly, which was indicted by his Majesty, and is an ordinare judicatory allowed by the lawes of God and man: like as it is answered in our protestation, more largely.</p>
                        <p>And for the 132. and 133. act of the said Parliament 1584. there is no Ecclesiasticall priviledge or authority thereby granted to <hi>Bishops</hi> as <hi>Bishops</hi>; but only a power of cognition: wherein the Parliament hath joyned others the Kings Commissioners with them, only as the Kings Commissioners: and granted the same unto seculare persons with them: but the King could never provide them to the office and jurisdiction of Bishops, which was abolished by many acts of Parliament and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies before written.</p>
                        <p>The 23. act 1587. worketh directly against <hi>Bishops:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Anent the act</hi> 1587.</note> being a generall ratification of all acts formerly made anent the religion presently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in this kingdome: which must include the acts abolishing <hi>Episcopacy</hi>; but especially, seeing in the same Parliament 1587. temporall livings are taken from the <hi>Bishops,</hi> as well as the office was 1567. And the same act undoubtedly was granted in the same meaning, wherein the Kirk did crave it; who that same yeare had often condemned <hi>Episcopall</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as contraire to Gods word, and the liberty of the Kirk, and approved <hi>Presbyteriall</hi> government, as flowing from the pure fountaine of Gods word.</p>
                        <p>It falleth in here to be remarked that the act 114. <hi>anno</hi> 1592. is never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Anent the act</hi> 1592.</note> and that because it not only revocks in particular the foresaid acts 1584. but in generall all other acts contrary to that discipline then established, and in particulare, the Assemblies, Presbyteries and Synods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the discipline and jurisdiction of this Kirk, are ratified and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, as most just and Godly, notwithstanding whatsoever statutes, acts, cannons, civill or municipall lawes made in the contrare: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto his Majesties prerogative is declared to be no wayes prejudiciall. Further the said act abrogates all acts granting commission to <hi>Bishops,</hi> and other Judges constitute in Ecclesiasticall causes; and ordaineth
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:17348:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>
presentation to benefices to be direct to Presbyteries, with power to give collation thereupon: And so containeth a ratification of the heads of Policy set downe in the second book of discipline. Which act is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed act 60. <hi>anno</hi> 1593. and the power of Presbyteries acknowledged 1594. act 129. and was never rescinded expresly <hi>in totum</hi>; but only in part by the ratification of the act of <hi>Glasgow.</hi> Which now cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected; but falleth <hi>ex consequenti:</hi> seeing that Assembly of <hi>Glasgow</hi> is now upon just and infallible reasons declared to have been null <hi>ab initio:</hi> and so this act of Parliament, wisely omitted by the collecter to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners grace might serve alone, without our preceeding speciall answers, for clearing the whole preceeding acts.</p>
                        <p>The 23. act 1597. granteth the priviledge of a voyce in Parliament to the whole Kirk;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Anent the acts</hi> 1597.</note> and under that name to Abbots, or other persons provided to prelacies, as well as <hi>Bishops:</hi> even as in time of papistry. So as Sir <hi>Robert Spottiswood,</hi> Abbot of <hi>New-abbay</hi> road thereafter in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: which was both unwarrantable and unusuall. Which doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contribute for the <hi>Bishops</hi> advantage, because albeit the benefice was not extinct, yet neither the King nor the Parliament might give them the office so oft condemned by this Kirk: which is also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the same act; because after the granting to them of the said voyce, the Parliament remitteth them to the King and the Assembly, concerning their office in their spirituall policy and government in the Kirk. 2. The said act beareth expresly to be but prejudice of the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and discipline of the Kirk, established by acts of Parliament made in any time preceeding, and permitted by the said acts to all provinciall and generall Assemblies, and other whatsoever Presbyteries and Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Kirk: and so the same cannot derogate from the former acts ratifying the present discipline of the Kirk, especially the said act 1592. nor yet from the acts of the Assembly abjuring <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> 3. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge is granted upon condition they be actuall Pastors and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. And so we referre to the world and themselves, if with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences they may claime the benefice of that act. 4. That priviledge was obtruded, and pretended to be introduced in favours of the Kirk: who may and hath renounced the same, as being incompatible with their spirituall function: as the act of the Assembly at more length beareth, upon undeniable reasons. 5. When voyce in Parliament was first plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible obtruded upon the Kirk, it was neither proponed nor tolerated in other tearmes then that onely such should have vote in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as had Commissiom from the Kirk. So that not as <hi>Bishops,</hi> but as Ministers, Commissioners from the Kirk, they had vote in Parliament. Like as the Assembly at <hi>Montrose,</hi> 1600. being so hardly prest by authority, that they could not get it altogether refused (albeit in their conference at <hi>Haly-rud-house,</hi> 1599. they proponed unanswerable reasons against this, and all other civill places of pastours) set downe cautions, binding the Ministers voters in Parliament, to bee insert in the act of parliament subsequent: which was omitted notwithstanding of the <hi>Bishops</hi> oath and duty in the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:17348:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>
contrare; for the breach whereof they are now most justly censured. 6. The ratificatory acts of the priviledges of the Kirk and Discipline thereof then profest, are not thereby abrogate, but notwithstanding thereof must stand in force, because it is ever understood, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided in Parliament, that all acts thereof are made <hi>salvo jure cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juslibe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Further the <hi>Bishops</hi> in their declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour professe they never had commission from this Kirk to voice for her in Parliament, according to the cautions set down in the Assembly at <hi>Montrose:</hi> for the which cautions that Assembly was never challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as trenching upon the third estate.</p>

                              <hi>Anent the act</hi> 1606.</note> for albeit the King and parliament might have repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to their rents, teends, lands, &amp;c. which were annexed to the Crown; yea, might have disponed to them any part of the patrimony of the Crown, If lordly titles and civill places in the persons of pastors separat to the Gospel, had been lawfull, yet could not give them the spirituall office, and jurisdiction spirituall, which was abolished and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by many preceeding acts of Assembly and parliament forecited. <hi>Et quod illud tantum agebatur,</hi> is evident by the whole straine of the act, reponing them, for remeed of their contempt and poverty to their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, priviledges, livings, rents, lands, and teinds: and this alwayes limited, as was competent to them, since the reformation of Religion in the reformed Kirk: From which time their office and jurisdiction spirituall was alwayes extinct. Which is evidently acknowledged in the act of Parliament 1592. and expresly in the act of parliament 1597. granting voice in parliament to Ministers. Which albeit it was the first step to <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> yet the parliament thereby hath remitted the office of Bishops in their spiritual policy and government (as not pertaining to their civill place and jurisdiction) to the King and the generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Ministers, as properly belonging to them, but prejudice alwayes of the jurisdiction and discipline of the Kirk, permitted by many acts of Parliament, (whereof that 1592. forecited is one) to generall provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Assemblies, Presbyteries and Sessions of the Kirk, which were never prejudged neither by the act 1606. nor by the act 1609. albeit corruption was then fast advancing; till the yeare 1612. at which time first, and never before, the King and Estates had taken the advice of the pretended Assembly at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> anent their office and spirituall jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction formerly remitted to them; as is cleare in the act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:17348:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
1612. relative to that remit in the Parliament 1597. which for that cause is also omitted by the quotter.</p>
                        <p>Like as also the act of parliament 1609. restoreth them only to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall jurisdiction,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Anent the act</hi> 1609.</note> and priviledges, lawfully pertaining to them and flowing from his Majesty, as any other ordinare jurisdiction doth; with reservation of the Kings supremacy and prerogative therein; which can no wayes comprehend their ecclesiasticall office, because the same is not a temporall jurisdiction, neither did lawfully pertaine to them, but by the law of God, and acts of this Kirk after reformation; and by the act 1592. was abrogat and taken from them; and the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall power established in presbyteries. So that if it be an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall office, it cannot flow from the King, who cannot make a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, Doctor, Elder or Deacon in the Kirk; albeit hee may present a Minister made by the KING of Kings to the Kirk; neither can the parliament institute originally any ecclesiasticall office in the Kirk, as is before said. Further the intended scope of that act is only the restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Commissariats and temporal jurisdiction flowing from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; as is cleare by the act it selfe, bearing that they shall brooke all priviledges and jurisdictions granted to them by his Majesty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dintegrates them to their former authority and jurisdiction, lawfully pertaining to them, alwayes flowing from his Majesty (from whom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temporall jurisdiction doth flow) which is only the jurisdiction of Commissers in temporall causes, and no waies any spirituall jurisdiction competent <hi>ratione officii:</hi> which by Gods word and the lawes of the Kingdome was abjured in them, and established in assemblies, presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, &amp;c. as is many times before repeated. But to convince them further it is not or that both 1606, and 1609. they road in Parliament, and by their own voices and the iniquity of the time, made the said acts without inserting the cautions made at <hi>Montrose,</hi> without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the Kirk, contraire to the said cautions and their owne oath given for observance thereof, against which the Kirk of Scotland did protest solemnly, clearing unanswerably, not only the unlawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their Ecclesiastick <hi>Episcopall</hi> function; but also of the civill places in persons of Pastors, from Gods word, our confession of Faith, 1580. acts of this Kirk and Kingdome; but this protestation being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by them was printed to the view of the world.</p>

                              <hi>Anent the act</hi> 1617.</note>And as for the act of the Parliament 1617. it cannot set down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration to the office, without a preceeding act of the Kirk: which is not alleadged: but by the contraire, the Kirk, had before condemned that office, and did particularly protest against that act of Parliament. Moreover this act is builded upon the supposed ground of <hi>Glasgow</hi> Assembly 1610. which for infallible reasons is now annulled: and so not only this act 1617. but all after acts, ratifying the same, fall <hi>ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequenti</hi>; both by the light of reason, law and practise of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

after the abolition of the ecclesiasticall constitutions, which they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine under civill sanction to be obeyed: and yet being once annulled they cannot be obeyed. And further even that corrupt Assembly of <hi>Glasgow</hi> 1610. which is now declared to have been null <hi>ab initio,</hi> did never restore the office of a diocesian Bishop before condemned in this Kirk; but did too far enlarge and extend the power of these who were provided to the benefice of <hi>Bishops</hi>; and yet alwayes under cautions and limitations sworn unto: which they never observed; and upon condition of their subjection for censure to yearly generall Assemblies: which they have not keeped, but impeded, and so they ought not to clame the benefice of these acts of Parliament concluded by their own voyces, and protested against by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> and violated by themselves.</p>

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:17348:186"/>
against the same: And that they continued their daily and hourely guarding and watching Our Castle of Edinburgh, suffering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be imported therein, but at their discretion, stopping and impeding, any importation of ammunition, or other necessaries whatsoever to any of Our houses within this Kingdome: Denying to Us their soveraigne Lord that libertie and freedome, which the meanest of them assume to themselves (an act without prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or example in the Christian world.) Like as they spared not boldly and openly to continue their conventions and Councell tables of Nobility, Gentrie, Ministers and Burgesses within the citie of Edinburgh, where, not regarding the laws of the Kingdome, without warrant of Authority, they conveened, assembled, and treated upon matters, as well Ecclesiasticall as Civill, sent their injunctions and directions throughout the countrey to their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate tables, and other under Ministers appointed by them for that effect. And under colour and pretext of Religion, exercing an unwarranted libertie, required obedience to their unlawfull and illegall directions, to the seen prejudice of Authority, and lawfull monarchicall government. And notwithstanding it was evidently manifest by the illegall and unformall course taken in the election of the Commissioners for the Assembly, whereof some of them were under the censure of this Church, some under the censure of the Church of Ireland, some long since banished for open and avowed teaching against Monarchie, others of them suspended, and some admitted to the Ministerie contrary to the forme prescribed by the lawes of this Kingdome; others of them rebells, and at the Horne, some of them confined, and all of them by oath and subscription bound to the overthrow of Episcopall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And by this and other their under-hand working, and private informations and perswasions, have given just ground of suspicion of their partialitie, and so made themselves unfit judges of what concerneth Episcopacie. And als albeit it was sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared by the peremptory and illegall procedures of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, who at their owne hand by order of Law, and without due forme of processe, thrust out Moderatours lawfully esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, and placed others whom they found most inclinable to their turbulent humours, associate to themseves, for chusing of the Commissioners to the Assembly, a Laick-Elder out of each Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, who being in most places equall, if not moe in number
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:17348:187"/>
then the ministerie, made choice both of the ministers, who should be Commissioners from the Presbyteries, as also of a Laick-Elder, (which in time will prove to be of a dangerous consequence, and import a heavie burthen to the libertie of Church and Church-men) being more directed therein by the warrants of the foresaid pretended Tables, then by their owne judgements; as appeared by the severall instructions sent from them (farre contrary to the Lawes of this Country, and lowable custome of this Church) some whereof were produced and exhibit by Our Commissioner, and publikly read: One whereof, direct to the Noblemen and Barons of each Presbyterie, doth among many other odde passages, require diligence, lest (say they) by our owne sillinesse and treacherie wee lose so faire an occasion of our libertie both Christian and Civill; a strange phrase to proceed from dutifull or loyall hearted sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The other to the Moderatours of the severall Presbyteries, under the title of <hi>Private Instructions, August 27.</hi> first, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth that these private instructions shall be discovered to none, but to brethren well affected to the cause: secondly, order must be taken, that none be chosen ruling Elders but Covenanters, and those well affected to the businesse: thirdly, that where the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister is not well affected, the ruling Elder be chosen by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the shire, and spoken to particularly for that effect: fourthly, that they be carefull that no Chappelmen, chaptermen, or Minister justice of peace, be chosen, although Covenanters, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they have publikly renounced, or declared the unlawfulnesse of their places: fifthly, that the ruling Elders come from every Church, in equall number with the Ministers; and if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster oppose, to put themselves in possession, notwithstanding of any opposition: sixthly, that the Commissioner of the shire cause conveen before him the ruling Elder of every Kirk chosen before the day of the election, and enjoyne them upon their oath, that they give vote to none but to those who are named already at the meeting at Edinburgh: seventhly, that where there is a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the bounds of the Presbyterie, he be chosen, and where there is none, there be chosen a Baron, or one of the best quality, and he onely a Covenanter: eighthly, that the ablest man in every Presbyterie be provided to dispute <hi>de potestate supremi magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus in Ecclesiasticis, praesertim in convocandis conciliis, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby it is most evident what prelimitations, indirect and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:17348:187"/>
partiall courses, and dangerous propositions have beene used in the preparations and elections to this pretended Assembly. By which unlawfull doings, although Wee had sufficient reason to have discharged the meeting of the said Assembly, yet We were pleased patiently to attend the same, still hoping that when they were met together by the presence of Our Commissioner, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of some well affected subjects, who were to be there, and by their own seeing the real performance of what was promised by Our Proclamation, they should have bin induced to return to the due o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of subjects. But when We perceived that their turbulent dispositions did increase, as was manifest by their repairing to the said pretended Assembly with great troups and bands of men, all boddin in fear of war, with guns, &amp; Pistolets, contrary to the lawes of this Kingdome, and in high contempt of Our Proclamation at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh the <hi>16.</hi> day of Novemb. last: And also by the peremptory refusing to the assessors, authorized by Us (although fewer in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then Our dearest Father was in use to have) the power of voting in this Assembly, as formerly they had done in all others, openly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verring that We, nor Our Commissioner, had no further power there then the meanest Commissioner of their number: &amp; by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and unjust refusing, &amp; not suffering to be read the reasons &amp; arguments given in by the Bishops, &amp; their adherents to Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, why they ought not to proceed to the election of a Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, neither yet to the trying and admitting of the Commissioners, before they were heard, though in Our name they were earnestly required thereto by Our Commissioner: and notwithstanding that Our Commissioner by warrant from Us gave in under his hand a sufficient Declaration of all that was contained in Our late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, bearing likewayes Our pleasure of the registration of the same in the books of Assembly, for all assurance of the truth and puritie of Religion to all Our good subjects, as doth clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the declaration it self; wherof the tenor follows. The Kings Majesty being informed that many of his good subjects have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that by the introducing of the Service Book, and Booke of Canons, the inbringing of Superstition hath been intended, hath been graciously pleased to discharge, like as by these he doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Service Booke, and Booke of Canons, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them, and either of them, and annulls and rescinds all Acts of Councell, Proclamations, and other acts and deeds what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:17348:188"/>
that have beene made or published for establishing them, or either of them, and declares the same to be null, and to have no force nor effect in time comming. The Kings Majestie, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for the ease and benefit of the subject, established the high Commission, that thereby justice might be administrate and the faults and errours of such persons as are made lyable thereto, taken order with, and punished with the more conveniencie, and lesse trouble to the people. But finding his gracious intention therein to be mistaken, hath beene pleased to discharge, like as by these Hee doth discharge the same, and all acts and deeds whatsoever made for establishing thereof. And the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty being informed, that the urging of the five Articles of Perth Assembly hath bred distraction in the Church and State, hath been graciously pleased to take the same into His royall conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and, for the quiet and peace of this countrey, hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispensed with the practice of the saids articles, but also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all and whatsoever persons from urging the practice thereof, upon either laicke or ecclesiasticall person whatsoever, and hath freed all His subjects from all censure and paines whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ecclesiasticall or secular, for not urging, practising, or obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or any of them, notwithstanding of any thing contained in the Acts of Parliament, or generall Assembly in the contrary. And his Maiesty is further contented, that the Assembly take the same so farre to their consideration, as to represent it to the next Parliament, there to be ratified as the Estates shall finde fitting. And because it hath been pretended, that oaths have been admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrate different from that which is set downe in the acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, his Maiesty is pleased to declare by me, that no other oath shall be required of any Minister at his entry, nor that which is set downe in the act of Parliament. And that it may appeare how carefull his Maiesty is that no corruption nor innovation shall creepe into this Church, neither yet any scandall, vice, or fault of any person whatsoever, censurable or punishable by the Assembly; goe along unpunished, his Maiestie is content to declare by me, and assure all His good people, that generall Assemblies shall be kept so oft, and als oft as the affaires of this Church shall require. And that none of His good subiects may have cause of grievances against the proceedings of the Prelates, his Maiesty is content that all and every one of the present Bishops, and their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:17348:188"/>
shall bee answerable, and accordingly from time to time censurable, according to their merits by the generall Assembly. And to give all his Majesties good people full assurance, that Hee never intended to admit any alteration or change in the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion profest within this Kingdome, and that they may be truely and fully satisfied of the reality of His intentions and integrity of the same, his Majestie hath been pleased to require and command all His good subjects to subscribe the Confession of Faith, and band for maintenance thereof, and of his Majesties person and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, formerly signed by His dear Father, in <hi>ann. 1580.</hi> and now also requireth all these of this present Assembly to subscribe the same. And it is his Majesties will, that this be insert and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate in the books of Assembly, as a testimony to posteritie, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the sincerity of His intentions to the said true Religion, but also of His resolutions to maintain and defend the same, and His subjects in the profession thereof.</p>
                        <p>Which declaration was by Our speciall command and direction given in, and subscribed by Our Commissioner, upon protestation made by him, that his assenting to the registration hereof, should be no approbation of the lawfulnesse of this Assembly, nor of any of the acts or deeds done, or to be done therein. And finding them in like sort no wayes to be satisfied therewith, and that nothing else was able to give them contentment, except at their owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure they were permitted to overthrow all Episcopall government in the Church, and thereby to abrogate Our publike lawes stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in vigour by the space of many yeares by-gone, and to alter the fundamentall government of this kingdom, in taking away one of the three Estates, contrary to expresse acts of Parliament: And lest the continuance of their meetings might have produced other the like dangerous acts so derogatory to Royall authority, We were forced for preveening thereof, and for the reasons and causes above-mentioned, and divers others importing true monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall government, to dissolve and breake up the said preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Assembly, and to discharge them of all farther meeting, treating and concluding any thing therein. And yet in that calme and peaceable way, as Our Commissioner before his removing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired their pretended Moderator for that time to have said prayer, and so concluded that dayes session, that so they might have had time to thinke upon the just reasons of his refusing to assist, or be
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:17348:189"/>
any longer present at the said pretended Assembly, &amp; of the causes moving Us to the dissolving thereof: and notwithstanding his earnest urging the same, and being willing to returne the next morning to heare their answer; in place of all other satisfaction to his so reasonable and moderate desires, it was refused, and met with a protestation of an high and extraordinary straine, thereby presuming to cyte and call Our Councell in question, for their duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full assistance and obedience to Us and Our Commissioner. And finding their disobedience thus to increase, We were constrained to discharge them of new againe the next day thereafter, by publike proclamation, under the paine of treason. And albeit that their contumacie is such as hath not been heard of in former times, yet they shall never move Us to alter the least point or article of that We have already declared by proclamation, or declaration under Our Commissioners hand: All which was publikely read, and by Our Commissioner required to be insert and registrate in the books of Assembly, therein to remain as a testimonie to posterity, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the sinceritie of Our intentions to the true Religion, but also of Our resolution, to maintaine and defend the same, and Our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the profession thereof: And perceiving likewise that in contempt of Our proclamation at Glasgow the <hi>29.</hi> of November they goe still on to conveene, meet, and to make illegall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable acts, We have conceived it fitting to forewarne all Our good subjects of the danger that they may incurre by being insnared by these their unlawfull procedures. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose doe not onely liberate and free them from all obedience to any of the pretended acts, made, or to be made at the said preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded assembly, or Committees direct therefrom, but do also free them from all pain and censure which the said pretended assembly shall inflict upon them, or any of them. And therefore doe discharge and prohibit all Our subjects, that they nor none of them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nor give obedience to any pretended acts nor constitutions made or to bee made at the said pretended meetings, under all highest paines. And We command, charge, and inhibite all pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, sessions of Kirkes, Ministers within this Realme, that none of them presume nor take upon hand privately nor publikely in their sessions and meetings, nor in their conferences, sermons, nor no other manner of way, to authorize, approve, justifie, or allow the said unlawfull meeting or assembly at Glasgow: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:17348:189"/>
yet to make any Act thereupon, nor to do any other thing private or publike, which may seeme to countenance the said unlawfull Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, under the paine to bee repute, holden and esteemed and pursued as guiltie of their unlawfull meeting, and to bee punished therefore with all rigour: And siclike Wee command all and sundrie No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Magistrates, and all other Our lieges who shall happen to bee present and heare any Ministers either in publike or private conferences and speeches, or in their Sermons, to approve and allow the said unlawfull Assemblie, raile and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any speeches against Our Royall commandments, or proceedings of Us, or Our Councell, for punishing or suppressing such enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they make relation and report thereof to Our Councell, and furnish probation, to the effect the same may bee according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished, as they will answer to Us thereupon: Certifying them who shall heare and conceale the said speeches, that they shall bee esteemed as allowers of the same, and shall accordingly bee taken order with, and punished therefore without favour. And to this effect We likewise straightly charge and command all Judges whatsoever within this Realme, Clerks and Writers, not to grant or passe any Bill, summons, or letters, or any other exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution whatsoever, upon any Act or Deed proceeding from the said pretended Assemblie, and all keepers of the signet from sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netting thereof, and that under all highest paines. And because Wee gave order and warrant to Our Commissioner to make open declaration, not onely of Our sense, but even of the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Confession of Faith, <hi>in Anno 1580.</hi> by which it may clearely appeare, that as Wee never intended thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Episcopacie, so by no right construction can it bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes interpreted, as is more nor evident by the reasons contained in the said Declaration, and many more, which for brevitie (the thing in it selfe being so cleare) are omitted. Herefore Wee do not onely prohibit and discharge all Our subjects from subscribing any band, or giving any writ, subscription, or oath to, or upon any Act, or Deed that proceeds from the foresaid pretended Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, but also do require them not to subscribe, nor sweare the said Confession in no other sense then that which is contained in
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:17348:190"/>
the said Declaration, and manifestly emitted by Our Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, under all highest paines. And that none of Our good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who in their duty and bound obedience to Us shall refuse to acknowledge the said pretended Assemblie, or any of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Acts, constitutions, warrants, or directions proceeding therefrom, may have just ground of feare of danger or harme by doing thereof, Wee do by these promise, and upon the word of a King oblige Our selves by all the Royall authoritie and power wherewith God hath endowed Us, to protect and defend them, and everie one of them in their persons, fortunes, and goods, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all and whatsoever person or persons who shall dare or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to call in question, trouble, or any wayes molest them, or any of them therefore. And Our will is, and Wee charge you straitly and command, that incontinent these Our Letters seene, you passe, and make publication hereof by open Proclamation at the market crosse of Edinburgh, and other places needfull, wherethrough none pretend ignorance of the same.</p>

But these hopes were soone blasted, for albeit the Assemblie did meet and begin at the appointed day, and for the space of seven dayes sitting was countenanced with his Graces personall presence, yet his Grace did never allow any freedome to the Assemblie, competent to it by the Word of God, Acts and practice of this Kirk, and his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties indiction, but did labour to restraine the samine during the time of his abode there, by protesting against all the Acts made therein, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the constitution thereof by such members, as by all Law, reason, and custome of this Kirk, were ever admitted as members constituents of our free Assemblies, and by denying his approbation to the things proponed and concluded, though most cleare, customable, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted.</p>

Neither hath any of us fortified, or provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any of our private houses for warlike defence; so that all those are heavie, and unjust imputations: But wee confesse and grant, that there being some provision and ammunition quietly imported into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for furnishing the Castle of Edinburgh, and intended secretly to have been put therein, we have carefully preveened the samine by our diligent attendance, And that for such reasons, grounded upon equitie, the Law of nature, and municipall Lawes and Acts of Parliament of this Kingdome, and the lowable example of our predecessours: For the truth is, that having petitioned his Majestie for redresse of our just grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and a legall triall thereof, before we received any answer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, all possible meanes were used to dissolve that union which was made amongst us for that good cause, and to impede all our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from deliberating thereupon, wherein the town of Edinburgh made a considerable part, not onely as an important member of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, but as a most commodious and ordinarie place of our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; so that when all other meanes of perswasion had failed, the meanes of terrour was not left unassaied: And for that effect a great quantitie of ammunition was brought by sea from forraine parts to have beene clandestinly imported into the Castle of Edinburgh, as no
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:17348:192"/>
doubt it was intended, seeing the samine was unloaded in the dead time of the night: And we considering that in case the samine had bin impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the castle, with other provision and store formerly therein, the samine might have bin used &amp; imploied for the overthrow of that place, and tended to our great prejudice, by with-drawing them, upon that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and displacing us from our ordinarie meetings; upon these reasons and considerations we preveened the samine by such a loyal way as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be offensive to Authoritie: <note n="*" place="margin">True: but We, and Our Councell, and Our Judges, and the rest of Our loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all subjects are the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; mutiners and rebels are but a private and schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call part, though never so many.</note> 
                           <hi>For the safetie of the publike is the end of all lawfull power, and supreme Law.</hi> And the adversaries of our Religion having formerly boasted, by that provision so to furnish the Castle, that it might beat down the town of Edinburgh, and bar the supplicants from meeting therein, we had just reason to hinder that fetter of slavery to be put upon the towne; and that the Castle of Edinburgh, which is amongst the first strengths of the land against forraine forces, might bee turned as a speciall engine of constraint against the subjects, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their lawfull meetings, or to force the towne of Edinburgh to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the rest of the supplicants: Which great prejudice the Law of nature teacheth us to avoid, And yet we have not proceeded therein without the warrant of the Acts of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>For first, where there is any violent presumption of spoyling of the Countrey, it is ordained that the <note n="*" place="margin">But not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or against the Kings command; his Generall (much lesse any Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his) cannot do that.</note> Lievtenant raise the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and passe to such Castles and fortalices where there is any unrulie men, and take sovertie of the persons within these houses, that the Countrey and all the Kings lieges bee unharmed and unskathed of the saids houses, and of them who inhabits the samine from time forth: And if any make difficultie to bee arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, and finde sovertie as Law will, they shall bee streinied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>James</hi> 2. Parliament 2. Act 3. And therefore now seeing there is not onely violent presumption, but great menacing, from the adversaries of the truth and Countrey, and their adherents, of the breaking of the Countrey and harming of the samine; and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Majesties lieges within Edinburgh, by the extraordinarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of munition to the Castle of Edinburgh, and that by the saids Bishops plots from his Majesties prime officers, who in his Majesties absence should preveene that inconvenient by the ordinance of that Act: Therefore upon their default the Countrey it selfe and the Kings lieges, in whose favours the Act is made, may provide for their owne safetie, and keep themselves unharmed by that Castle, or any inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof, and so preveen the importation of ammunition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, conforme to the said Act of Parliament.</p>

                           <note n="*" place="margin">All this which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Our Castles and Forts, and keeping Us out of them, containeth no lesse then trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and is not to be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a pen.</note>Secondly, as the Castle of Edinburgh and certaine other Castles and lands are the Kings undoubted annexed propertie, so it is to bee considered for what cause they were annexed, by whom annexed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what condition, and how to be disponed upon. For the onely cause exprest in the annexation thereof 41. Act. <hi>James</hi> 2. Parliament 11. is, that the povertie of the Crowne is oftimes the cause of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie of the Realme: Which Act makes no mention that the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:17348:192"/>
King was annexer of the Castles and Lands to the Crowne, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that by the advice of the full Councell of the Parliament it was so statute and ordained, And appoints that they may not bee disponed upon, without advice, deliverance, and decreet of the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for great, seene, and reasonable causes of the Realme: So that being thus annexed to the Crowne by the Realme it selfe, for avoyding an inconvenient to the Realme, and being annexed with condition not to be disponed upon without the advice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet of the whole Parliament, and for great, seene, and reasonable causes of the Realme; justice and equitie will require, that these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles should not be made an instrument of the povertie and desolation of the capitall towne of the Realme, and of the harme of the most considerable part of the bodie of the Realme there conveened for supplicating his Majestie and the Councell, and preparing overtures to the future Parliament, for redresse of our just grievances. But now by this extraordinarie provision to the Castle, being threatned with ruine and exterminion, they may stop the misimploying of that benefit granted to the Realme <hi>eo animo &amp; ad hunc finem,</hi> for the well of the Realme, while the Parliament of the Kingdome give their humble advice to his Majestie thereanent.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, by the 9. Act. 9. Parl. <hi>James</hi> 6. it is acknowledged that the Castle of Edinburgh, Dumbartane, Stirling, and Blaknesse, are foure chiefe strengths of the Realme which ought to be safely kept to the Kings behove, and wel-fare of the Realme: And for keeping the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Edinburgh, there is assigned, with consent of the Estates, both money and victuall, a great part whereof is forth of the thirds of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which thirds in December 1561. were decerned and ordained by Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> with advice of her Councell and others of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then present, to bee up taken and imployed for these two uses: <hi>viz.</hi> Sustaining of Ministers, and entertaining and setting forward the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and publike affaires of the Countrey and Common-wealth of the Realme: which was also enacted, Act 10. Parl. 1. <hi>James</hi> 6. and thereafter ratified Act 121. Parl. 12. <hi>James</hi> 6. Whereby it doth appeare that as the Castle is the Kings undeniable annexed propertie, so it is also a strength of the Realme, which should be safely kept to his Majesties behove, and wel-fare of the Realme, having for the keeping thereof rents assigned with consent of the three Estates of the Kingdom forth out of the thirds of benefices, estimate by the Estates <hi>in eum usum,</hi> for entertaining and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forward the publike affaires of the Countrey and Common-wealth of the Realm. And consequently the most <note n="*" place="margin">Which the Covenanters are not.</note>loyall part of the body of the Realme hath maine interest to divert the converting of this strength to the weakning or ruine of the Realme or any member thereof, threatned by this unusuall provision, and openly denounced by our said enemies.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, by the 125. Act 7. Parl. <hi>James</hi> 6. it is acknowledged that the Kings Castles and strengths are the keyes of the Realme: and the onely use of keyes is for keeping together in safetie and preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:17348:193"/>
and not for spartling, dispersing, or perdition. So that the Realme and collective bodie thereof can hardly be disallowed for contributing their loyall endeavours to the good keeping of their <note n="*" place="margin">Whether should the King or his subjects keep the keyes of his owne Kingdome?</note> owne keyes, when contrarie to the right end these keyes are used against the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and Realme, whereof they should be, and are the keyes of safetie: as by the said Act is declared.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, by the same Act, all violent detainers of the Kings Castles from him, or constrainers of the Kings regents do redeeme his owne houses, and all makers of any such bargaine, merchandise, or market of the Kings Castles, are onely ordained to rander and deliver againe what they have received for reddition of the saids Castles, and that the King shall have action for repetition thereof as necessarily given for the time, and wrongously received for unlawfull causes. And our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings being compared with the subject of that Act of Parliament, cannot deserve so harsh constructions, where the <note n="*" place="margin">But the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters are the worst part.</note>best part of the bodie of the Realme being constrained for indemnitie of their persons and goods, do neither take nor detaine the Castle, but onely with-hold importation, first clandestinly intended, and thereafter openly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, of all kinde of warlike and invasive furniture, which could bee usefull to no purpose, but to the harm and annoyance of those who were conveened for the just occasions foresaids, who deserve and expect approbation and <note n="*" place="margin">Wee do not take them to be such fooles as to expect thanks from Us for their proceedings; if they do, they are like enough to go without them.</note> thankes from his Majestie in his own due time, for keeping his evill Counsellours, and bad Patriots, from putting hand in his best subjects.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, by the 25. Act 6. Parliament <hi>James</hi> 2. sundry points of treason are ennumerate: And amongst the rest, one is the assailing, without consent of the Estates, the Castles or places where the Kings person shall happen to bee: And now the Kings person not being in this Castle, but out of the Countrey, and the <note n="*" place="margin">The worst and most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sloyall part of all Our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> best and most loyall part of his subiects both for number and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, imploring his Maiesties authoritie, for convocating the Estates to take order with these, who, presuming upon his Majesties absence, are bold to give him sinistrous information and counsell, these who do no wayes assaile the Castle, but barrs these evill Patriots from putting in execution their damnable suggestions by their supercherie violence and terrifications from that Castle, before the convention of Estates, cannot in Law and equitie bee challenged in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, so necessarie to them in the <hi>interim,</hi> while the Estates conveene in a Parliament, which now his Majestie hath beene graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to proclaime.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, it is knowne by our Chronicles and Records, that the Castle of Edinburgh was given in keeping to the house of <hi>Erskine</hi> by the King and Estates of Parliament, <note n="*" place="margin">In what hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie be these words? is it not <hi>Regi</hi> as well as <hi>conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui ordinum?</hi> or can there bee a convention of the three Estates called without the King or his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie?</note> 
                           <hi>hac lege expressa &amp; condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, ut nulli nisi conventui ordinum reposcenti traderent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Eighthly, this Act is not unexampled in the Christian world: but
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:17348:193"/>
hath many presidents both in the History of other Kirks and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and of our own, which hath many such examples even done by the Estates themselves: whose fact doth make our right, and whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is ratified conforme to the ancient and loveable custome, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing rebellious subjects, and preserving the faithfull, Act 130. Par. 8. <hi>James</hi> 6.</p>

                           <hi>James</hi> the 6. Parl. 11. wherein is acknowledged that it is necessary to the King and his Estates to be truly informed of the needs and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses pertaining to His loving subjects in all estates, and therefore rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the Act made by King <hi>James,</hi> 1, <hi>anno</hi> 1427. Giving power to Barons, to propone all and sundry needs, and causes, and to heare, treat, and determine all causes to be proponed in Parliament: which necessary and true information cannot be made to his Majestie and Estates, <note n="†" place="margin">But was ever that previous meeting or contention of the Estates without the calling and authoritie of the King?</note> without privy meeting and consultation: and consequently it being granted to them, to informe the King and Estates, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone, heare, treat, and finally determine all needs and causes to be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Parliament, there must be necessarily understood to be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power granted to them for meeting and advising upon that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: <hi>Quia aliquo concesso, omnia concessa videntur, sine quibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessum expediri nequit.</hi> And as to the Ministers they have likewayes power granted to them, not onely by the word of God and constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Kirke, but by the King and laws of this land, to propone, reason, and vote in Assemblies, and be the samine parity of reason to keep preceding meetings, not to determinate or execute, but to consult upon their necessary propositions: So that these lawfull meetings, for the religious end, suffer wrongously the invidious designation of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell tables: which is onely done for procuring misconstruction against them; because at these meetings and consultations they sat about a table, which posture is no wayes prejudiciall to Authority, the meanest of mechanik crafts having their own tables where about they sit, when they consult upon the smallest businesse importing their trade.

                           </note>The third particular challenge in the Proclamation, is for the illegall and unformall course taken in the election of Commissioners to the Assembly, whereof some are alledged to have beene under the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this Kirke, some under the censure of the Kirke of Ireland, some banished for teaching against Monarchie, others being suspended, some admitted to the Ministery contrare to the laws of this kingdome, others at the Horne, some confined, and all by oath bound to the overthrow of Episcopacie: Whereunto although no answer be requisite, seeing the persons thereby meaned, are not specially condescended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet for clearing all mens mindes, and showing the warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of our proceedings, it is of truth that the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, after particular triall which they took upon some such

For the censure of the Kirk of Ireland, it was not notified to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by any such objection, and yet out of their zeal and care to satisfie all these misinformations, whereof they heard some whisperings, they fand after triall, that these censures inflicted were for the same causes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saids, and yet could not militate out-with the bounds of that diocie where they were censured in their own law and practique, and none of them were ever banished for any cause, let be for that odious cause pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Proclamation: wherein the mention of Horning against some of the Commissioners could not bee a lawfull exception against them, because Horning can neither take away their Ministeriall function, nor deprive the Presbyteries of their voice by their Commissioners: But in speciall this Horning against the Commissioners to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cannot be respected; because it was done in Edinburgh upon a <note n="†" place="margin">But they know that many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Assembly were denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, and put to Our Horne, long before Our Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was thought on.</note>sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denty (upon what intention we permit every one to consider) after all the members of the Assembly were gone to Glasgow, and yet Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation was taken against the samine, and suspension craved upon the reall offer of consignation, which, contrarie to the common law and practice of this kingdome, was unexampledly refused, and publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments taken thereupon: All which objections are onely now remembred to blemish the proceedings of this Assembly, but were never urged nor proponed in the Assembly; but on the contrarie, the Commissions of all persons were produced, examined, discussed, and approven in my Lord Commissioners owne audience, without any contrarie voice of the Assembly: And yet upon these challenges much is built against the Assembly, and the samine are aggravate from a preceding oath, whereby it is alledged that the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were bound to overthrow Episcopall government, which is of the same stamp and mettall with the rest: For the truth is, that there was never any oath given, nor exacted, but that which is contained in the Covenant, whereby all was abjured, onely in generall, which was contrarie to the Confession of Faith 1580. leaving to the tryall and determination of the Assembly, whether Episcopacie and some other innovations were repugnant to the said confession, or not. And at the best, it is a bad inference, that one who hath maintained ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox opinions, and preached against heresie, and errour, may not in the lawfull judicatorie voice for condemnation of these errours.

So that the desire of this liberty cannot be judged an affectation of licentious living without subjection to lawfull authority, which in our solemne Covenant with God wee have sworne to maintaine. And as for the other paper, the <note n="†" place="margin">If it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it is forged by none but Covenanters, who from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny severall shires in the kingdome did send copies of the same writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the same words to Our Commissioner and others, and yet those Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters did not know one of anothers sending.</note> same is the forgerie of our enemies presented to the Commissioner his Grace, of deliberate purpose to make a pretext for discharge of the Assembly, which we are sorry was so readily embraced, notwithstanding that when the same was produced by the Commissioner, the same was not onely cleared to be no draught sent by publicke advice, but the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Assembly, and even those whom his Grace most suspected, denyed the same, and offered to controll it by production of the true paper of their instructions, altogether disagreeing from that other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Commissioner, except in the two points following, which had been craftily intermixed with the saids untruths, to give them some countenance of probability. Likeas they professed to his Grace, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <note n="*" place="margin">There was no man in the Assembly who offered any such oath as is here alledged. Wee doubt not but there were many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Assembly who might have taken that oath safely, because they were indeed never acquainted with these papers; but Our Commissioner (if he had beene put to it by the Assembly) could have named many, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially some of the Nobilitie, Gentrie, and Ministers, who could not have taken that oath without perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and since it is now denyed; they shalbe named in due time and place.</note> oath, that they had never seene the same before, nor ever read any of the Articles therein contained in any other paper, except the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:17348:195"/>
fourth and the eighth Articles, whereof the fourth was for eschewing (as farre as might be) Chappel-men, Chapter-men, and Ministers Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of peace, from being chosen Commissioners to the Assembly: which was so reasonable, that none could be offended thereat, because <note n="*" place="margin">First, this (nor the eighth) was not published in their publicke instructions (for it would have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many Covenanters who were both Chapter-men and Chappel-men) and therefore they acknowledging it to be one of their instructions, must needs confesse it to be amongst their private ones. But a wonder it is that men should not be ashamed to avow in print this their false and partiall dealing; for this instruction concerning Chapter-men and Chappel-men was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to barre some moderate covenanting Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters from being chosen Commissioners; for, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this instruction, Master <hi>Ramsey,</hi> who both was one of the Chapter of Edinburgh, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deane of Our Chappell, and <hi>Rollock,</hi> who was Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend of the same Chapter, and one of our Chaplains, who duely preached his turnes in Our Chappell, and some others, fierce and fiery revolted Chaptermen and Chappel-men, were chosen Commissioners, though the reason here expressed was as strong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them as against the rest.</note> Chappel-men had approven, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant of this Kirk practised the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations introduced of late; the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-men had practised the book of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and (contrarie to the Acts of the Kirk discharging Chapters and their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Bishops 1578.) had approven the corruptions of Kirk government, and Ministers Justices of Peace had likewise accepted that civill office upon them, whereunto they were promoved for the most part as creatures and dependers of Bishops. And the eighth, wherein some are desired to study the points which were likely to be agitate in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as, <hi>de Episcopatu, de senioribus,</hi> and among other points, <hi>de pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state supremi Magistratus in Ecclesiasticis, praesertim in convocandis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliis</hi>; whereat none can take just exception, because it was the duty of every member of that Assembly to instruct and enable themselves for agitating every point, which might occurre to be spoken of there by any, or been proponed by the Doctors of Aberdene, who were expected there, and commanded to study these points: So that this ought not to be wrested to their prejudice, seeing it was incumbent to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to know the precinct of the Kirks jurisdiction, especially anent their owne Assemblies, and to distinguish it from the civill jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the supreme Magistrate, giving to God what is Gods, and to Cesar what is Cesars, whereby the soveraign Magistrate hath no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, but great benefit, to know the extent of his power in matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, lest either he should come short of what is due to him, or, for want of true information, incroach upon the liberties of Christs Kirk: Whereby it is most evident, that no indirect nor partiall courses, nor dangerous propositions, have beene used in the preparations and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections to this Assembly, but such as are most legall, peaceable, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, and warrantable.</p>
                        <p>In the next place the Proclamation charges our innocency for repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Assembly with great troupes and bands of men boddin in fear of war, and furnished with forbidden armes,<note place="margin">

                           </note> in contempt of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Proclamation: whereas the truth is, that our going and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Glasgow was in the most peaceable, quiet, and single way which might serve for our security and indemnity against sundry outlawes, <hi>Clangregors,</hi> and their followers, who shortly before the meeting of the Assembly had done sundry outrages, and committed many insolencies upon the Kings good Subjects in these Westerne parts, both to private
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:17348:196"/>
men, whom by their number they might enforce, and by exacting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes at publicke mercats neere <hi>Glasgow,</hi> whereof many were adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by their private friends from these places, and to come thither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for eviting all affront or hazzard which they might incurre by that rascally multitude: So that being firmely resolved of before to goe thither every one accompanied with his own ordinary private train, we yet continued in that resolution, and went thither in most sober and quiet way, onely with this change, that for preveening that haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard we went not every man alone with his owne ordinary servants, but some few together went in company; which is not onely ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in going out the way, but was most expedient at that time for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the foresaid hazzard and prejudice: which moved us all so to carry with us some offensive weapons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherewith not onely these rebels were provided, but likewaies such who went to <hi>Glasgow</hi> with his Majesties Commissioners, who upon that same necessity were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <note n="*" place="margin">Most false.</note> provided with those prohibited weapons, and yet their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age nothing thought to deboird from the duty of good subjects. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these reasons some of the supplicants being present in Edinburgh, at the making of the said Proclamation 16. of November last, did protest that it might be lawfull for them to carry weapons for their own defence, and preservation against any such lawlesse invasion or violence as might threaten them, and that they might incurre no prejudice by carrying such weapons as those who followed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours and many others did, promising to carry themselves peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and irreproveably during the time of the Assembly, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they have done: and seeing our said carrying of weapons was for defence of our lives, against the invasion of these barbarous sorners, we are not censurable therefore by the act of Parlament prohibiting the saids weapons, because we was repairing to, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the Assembly at command of his Majesties letters and authority, which is in speciall words exprest in the act of Parliament, Act 18. Parliam. 1. <hi>James</hi> 6. which is thereafter ratified with the same provisions, Act. 87. Parliam. 6. <hi>James</hi> 6. and thereafter also rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Act. 248.

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:17348:196"/>
his Graces Assessors, yet for preservation of the liberty of the Kirke of Jesus Christ, We did in all humility remonstrate that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Commissioner and Assessors, how many soever (whose place is not to vote, but to assist the Commissioner by their counsell for his orderly proceeding) could have but onely one voice in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly: Since after thirty-nine nationall Assemblies of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Kirke, where neither the Kings Majesty, nor any in His name were present, at the humble and earnest desire of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, his Majestie graciously vouchsafed His presence, either in His own royall person, or by a Commissioner, not for voting or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of voices, but as Princes and Emperours of old in a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, to countenance that meeting, and to proceed in it for externall order: And if we had been honoured with his Majesties personall presence, his Majesty (according to the practice of King <hi>James</hi> of blessed memory) would onely have given His own judgement in voting of matters, and would not have called others who had not been cloathed with commission from the Kirke, to carrie things by plurality of voices. Which is also imported by his Graces Commission produced, wherein hee is nominate sole Commissioner.

                        <p>And further, whereas his Grace under his hand,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Anent his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein it is not satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie.</hi>
                           </note> gave in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties declaration, mentioned in this Proclamation, the same being considered by the Assembly, gave them matter of great joy, to finde his Majesties royall heart so farre enlarged towards them, as willingly to untie some of those grievous bands wherewith they had beene fettered by the meanes of some who abused their own places, and trust with his Majesty; But the same was not found satisfactory, nor sufficient for establishing of a legall security of the points therein mentionate, nor yet for purging the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and setling the peace of this Kirke, as was promised, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Commissioner his Grace would not stay to be informed, but did unexpectedly and suddenly remove, to the great grief of the Assembly, who thereby was necessitate to use the power <note n="*" place="margin">God never put it in their hands, but the Devill, who is the author of all sedition and rebellion.</note> God had put in their hands, for removing all innovations, and setling the purity,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:17348:197"/>
and peace of this Kirke. And seeing in this Proclamation his Majesties declaration is insert <hi>ad longum,</hi> and the Assembly taxed for not being fully satisfied therewith, we are enforced to repeat here the reasons which moved the Assembly not to think the same satisfactory, in hope that they, comming to his Majesties sacred eares, may procure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of his benigne favour, so acceptable to this Kirke, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of this Assembly, and production of the said declaration, and obtain his Royall approbation to the whole acts and proceedings of this Assembly, which is heartily wished, and would replenish the hearts of all good subjects with abundant joy and contentment. And first, where his Majestie hath discharged the Service Book, and Book of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and practice of both, and all Acts, Proclamations, and ordinances made for establishing thereof, upon information that by the introduction of them, the subjects have apprehended the inbringing of Popery, &amp; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition to have beene intended: Neither the discharge nor the ground thereof are satisfactory; Not the first, because as some Acts and Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations did serve for their establishing, so others gave them an high ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, as fit means to maintaine religion and beat down all supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And therefore though those which established them be rescin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet those which approved them do remaine, and may bring forth other Acts and Proclamations for restoring them or the like hereafter, if these books receive not a publick censure by the generall Assembly as the only judge competent to bar them and the like in all time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: Seeing Acts of Councell, and Proclamations, are frequent and variable, and yet are no legall valid meane either to introduce or abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish any thing concerning the doctrine and discipline of the Kirke, wherein they neither can meddle nor secure the subjects, Next, seeing by the constitutions of this Kirke <note n="*" place="margin">But never without the authoritie of Us and Our Successours.</note> the generall Assembly hath onely power to determine concerning the matters of Gods publick worship; And that the framers of these books, who called themselves the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative Kirk, made them to be practised in sundry places of the countrey by their own authority, and that which they borrowed from <note n="†" place="margin">The confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of faith and band an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, upon which their covenant is grounded, were injoyned at the first on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Our royall Father and his Councell, and so these Books were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by as good Authoritie as those.</note> the Lords of secret Councell: Therefore it was most necessarie that the same should be discharged by the generall Assembly (the onely true representative Kirk of this nation) for vindicating her just right from violent usurpation, and preventing the like in time comming; Not the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, for the subjects have just grounds of perswasion that the Prelats &amp; their followers (the framers &amp; followers of those books) intended the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bringing of Popery and superstition by the introducing thereof, because, 1. Many grosse points of Popery and superstition are not onely closely couched under the cover of ensnaring ambiguities (the most insinuating way of errours and best mask to superstition) but also expresly contained in the Books themselves; as was made manifest by sundry treatises read and considered in the Assembly, and is now so declared by the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. 2. The framers and favourers of these Books in their sermons and conferences have vented sundry Popish errours, and approven Popish
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:17348:197"/>
superstitions: which fully detecteth, and leaveth no doubt of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in the introducing of Books so full of Popery and superstition.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the discharge of the high Commission by his Majesties Proclamation or Declaration cannot be sufficient; because first, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty declareth that he established the same for the ease and benefit of the Subjects, that justice might be administrate with the more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie and lesse trouble of the people, And now dischargeth it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the subjects have mistaken his gracious intention: So that if the mistaking be removed, that which is conceived of it selfe to serve for administration of justice, with ease and benefit to the subjects, may bee established upon pretention of the removeall of all such mistakings. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, though the acts and deeds made for establishing thereof bee rescinded, yet the acts past heretofore by the high Commission are not rescinded: And so the subjects censured by it, are still esteemed under these censures, as appeareth by the tenour of the Proclamation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Assembly is taxed, as consisting of some members that are under the censures of this Kirke, meaning the Bishops censure in the high Commission. Thirdly, it being found contrary to the acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and acts of generall Assembly, and extremely derogatory to them and all other subalterne iudicatories both civill and Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall (which is made clearely manifest by a treatise presented to the generall Assembly,) and it being devised and brought in by the suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bishops, as a meane whereby they might, and have unlawfully, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranized over all the subiects, Therefore it is necessary that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and generall Assembly, the highest civill and Ecclesiasticall iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories that have been wronged, should by their severall sentences ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abolish it as unlawfull and hurtfull.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, whereas his Majesty dispenseth with the practice of Pearth Articles, dischargeth all from urging the practice thereof, freeth from censures for not urging or practising them, notwithstanding of any thing contained in the acts of Parliament, or generall Assembly to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and is content that the Assembly take the same so far to their consideration, as to represent it to the next Parliament there to be ratified as the Estates shall finde fitting: These cannot satisfie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause first, a dispensation with the practice, without a simple discharge, leaveth it still arbitrary to those who will practice, and so continueth the rent and distractions in this Kirke. Secondly, although his Maiestie had discharged the practice of them by his Proclamation or Declaration, yet the subiects had not been put in security thereby, except the generall Assembly (to whose tryall they belong and were referred by all the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers of the Confession in March) doe either repell the articles of Perth, or upon good reason declare that Assembly null, since his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Proclamation or Declaration is not a sufficient warrant to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe an act of Assembly or Parliament made to the contrary. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by tying the Assembly to take the same no further unto their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration then to represent it to the next Parliament, the Assembly is both prelimitate (whereanent refers to the six reasons against prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:17348:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>
insert in our Protestation September 22.) and weakned in power, <note n="*" place="margin">It may not; and the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the contrary is a false and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suiticall posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> as if it might not judge and determine in matters meerely Ecclesiasticall without a licence from his Majestie, or a reference to the Parliament, whereas the generall Assembly is supreme and independent in matters Ecclesiasticall, as the Parlament is in civill; so that when the acts of Assembly are ratified in Parliament, the same is for adioyning the civill sanction to the Ecclesiastick constitution for the great terrour of transgressors.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, anent the oaths administrate to Ministers at their entry, it hath not onely beene pretended, but is certaine, and will be made manifest to the Assembly, (which also now is done) that oaths have been exacted different from that which is set downe in the acts of Parliament, and in many severall wayes according to the pleasure of the Prelats: And where his Majestie declares that no other oath shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a Minister at his entry, nor that which is set down in the act of Parliament, <note n="*" place="margin">A fearefull proposition in deed it is, to hold Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be an uncontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church ever since the time of Christ and his Apostles, without the least suspicion of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie until with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these few yeeres.</note> the same is of fearefull consequence, because the act beares an oath to be given unto the Bishop by Ministers intrants, and so sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the office of a Bishop to be unchangeable and uncontroverted, whereby the Assembly is prelimited (against the reasons before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) which may finde that office uselesse and unlawfull in this Kirk, and which now they have found upon most infallible reasons.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, that his Maiesty assureth generall Assemblies shall be kept as oft as the affaires of this Kirk shall require, doth not satisfie, because first, by leaving the time undefinite, it preiudgeth the liberty of the Kirke of holding yeerly generall Assemblies at least, and oftner <hi>pro re nata</hi>: rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the act of Parliament 1592. the disuse whereof hath beene a maine cause of our evils, which should bee prevented in time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, by renewing that ancient necessarie custome and liberty: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the same act of Parliament it is provided that the King, or his Commissioner being present, shall appoint the time and place of the next Assembly: And in case his Maiesty or his Commissioner be not present for the time in the towne where the Assembly is holden, it shall be leasome to the said generall Assemblie by themselves to appoint the time and place of the next Assembly, as they have bin in use in times past: But this declaration not only leaves all indefinite but totally everts that power and liberty competent to them by law and custome. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, As it doth not determine how oft the ordinary effairs of this Kirke require an Assembly (which the custome of this Kirke and act foresaid evidently manifest to bee yeerely once at least) so neither doth it determine who shall judge when the necessity of extraordinary effairs require an Assembly <hi>pro re nata</hi>: whereas undoubtedly the Kirke will be most sensible of her owne necessities, and is the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judge of her owne effaires: And therefore should have freedome to appoint her owne times when she finds her selfe pressed with present exigencies, as his Maiesty hath also power when hee perceives any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity requiring the same.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, whereas his Maiesty is content that all the present Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:17348:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and their successours be answerable to, and censurable by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assembly, it doth not satisfie; because, First, it beares a prelimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Assembly in the matter of trying that Office, and presupposes the continuance thereof by succession as unquestionable. Secondly, They have beene formerly made censurable by the generall Assembly in the straightest way that the Kirke could enjoyn, or they could assure: And yet these thirty yeeres they have shunned all censure (though all their actions deserved it) by procuring generall Assemblies to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate, and then suddenly indicted when they had cunningly prepared both persons and purposes to their minde: Likeas now they have by their Declinator refused to answer, and be censured by this present Assembly indicted by his Majestie, conveened in the name of Christ, and perfitly constitute in the members thereof: And therefore it lyeth upon this present Assembly to take some solide course, for securing the Kirk, in all time comming, against the prejudices of their former and frequent breaches contrary to their oathes given.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, whereas his Majestie requireth this present Assembly to subscribe this Confession of Faith formerly signed by his Royall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1580. and lately commanded by his Majestie to be subscribed by all his Majesties subjects: The reasons contained in the Protestation September last 22. (whereto we adhere and repeats the same) do suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evidence that we cannot subscribe the same: to which we adde, First, that his Maiesties Commissioner hath declared to the Lords of Session when their subscriptions was required, that it might subsist with the innovations introduced since the yeere of God 1580. which <note n="*" place="margin">But they do not declare all the truth; for of twenty Lords of the Session, onely foure did it, but the rest who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent did the contrary.</note> some of the said Lords then did, and all of us doe now conceive to repugne to the genuine and true sense of the Confession of Faith as it was first made: Secondly, That his Grace hath protested divers times in this Assembly, that nothing done or to be done therein prejudge the Archbishops and Bishops in their priviledges, places, power and jurisdiction: whereby the declareth that these may subsist with the Confession of Faith, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they be novations introduced upon this Kirke, contrary to the same, since the yeer foresaid, as is now found by the Assembly: Thirdly, That to the Assembly presently conveened and perfectly consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in the members thereof, it pertaineth properly according to the word of God, constitutions of this Kirke, and booke of Policie, ratified in divers Assemblies, to determine what is the true meaning of the Confession of Faith, and to make the same knowne to all the members of this Kirke, who thereafter without scruple or danger may subscribe the same. And although the Assembly could not finde this Declaration satisfactory for these and the like weighty reasons, yet were they willing the same should be insert in their books for obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Maiesties desire: and thankfully acknowledging his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties pious affection to true Religion, and Royall resolution to defend the same and his subiects in the profession thereof, exprest in the closure of his Royall Declaration, they were confident that when his Maiestie shall bee fully informed that the novations introduced since the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:17348:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>

And thus true Religion being the channell which convoyeth both duties to their proper object, the evidence of Gods image in our dread Soveraigne his Depute shall bee terrible to all the enemies of his Majestie, and of his loyall subjects who stand for the Confession of Faith, and the true meaning thereof, and shall raise up the affections of his Religious subjects towards his Majestie above all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respects.</p>

                              <hi>Anent our sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting still after the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners discharge.</hi>
                           </note> for the reasons already printed anent the conveening a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assembly, which are now more strong in this case, seeing the Assembly was already indicted by his Majesties authority, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veen and is fully constitute in all the members thereof, according to the word of God and discipline of this Kirke, in presence and audience of his Majesties Commissioner, who hath really acknowledged the same by assisting therein seven dayes, and exhibition of his Majesties royall Declaration to be registrate in the books of this Assembly, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly was done. Secondly, for the reasons contained in the former Protestations made in name of the Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and Commons, wherunto we did then iudicially, and doe now actually adhere, as also unto the Confession of Faith and Covenant subscribed and sworn by the body of this Kingdome. Thirdly, because as we are obliged by the application and explication subioyned necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to the Confession of Faith subscribed by us, so the Kings Maiestie, and his Commissioner, and privie Councell, have urged many of this Kingdome to subscribe the Confession of Faith made <hi>in anno</hi> 1580. and 1590. And so to returne to the doctrine and discipline of this Kirke as it was then professed; but it is cleare by the doctrine and discipline of this Kirk, that it was most unlawfull in the selfe, and preiudiciall to these priviledges, which Christ in his word hath left to his Kirke to dissolve or breake up the Assembly of this Kirke, or to stop and stay their proceedings in constitution of Acts, for the well-farre of the Kirke or execution of discipline against offenders, and so to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that Religion and Kirke government should depend absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the pleasure of the Prince. Fourthly, because there is no ground of pretence, either by Act of Assembly, or Parliament, or any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding practice, whereby the Kings Maiesty may dissolve the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assembly of the Kirke of Scotland, farre lesse his Maiesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, who by his commission hath power to indict, and keepe it
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:17348:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>secundum legem &amp; praxim,</hi> but upon the contrary his Maiesties prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Royall is declared by Act of Parliament to be no wayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the priviledges and liberties which God hath granted to the spirituall office-bearers and meetings of this Kirke, which are most frequently ratified in Parliaments, and especially in the last Parliament holden by his Maiestie himselfe; which priviledges and liberties of the Kirk, his Maiestie will never diminish or infringe, being bound to maintaine the same in integrity by solemne oath given at his Royall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation in this Kingdome. Fifthly, the Assemblies of this Kirke have still enjoyed this freedome of uninterrupted sitting, without or not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any contramand, as is evident by all the records thereof, and in speciall by <note n="*" place="margin">That As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly is but one instance and a very reprovable one. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the pretended As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdene did the same, and were most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for it.</note> the generall Assembly holden <hi>in anno</hi> 1582. which being charged with letters of Horning by the Kings Maiestie his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, and Councell, to stay their proces against M. <hi>Robert Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomerie</hi> pretended Bishop of Glasgow, Or otherwaies to dissolve and rise, did notwithstanding shew their liberty and freedome by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing and sitting still, and without any stay going on in that proces against the said M. <hi>Robert,</hi> to the finall end thereof, and thereafter by letter to his Majestie did shew clearly, how farre his Majesty had been mis-informed, and upon mis-information prejudged the prerogative of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> and the liberties of this Kirke, and did enact and ordaine that none should procure any such warrant or charge under the paine of excommunication. Sixthly, because now to dissolve after so many supplications and complaints, after so many reiterated promises, after our long attendance and expectation, after so many references of processes from Presbyteries, after the publike indiction of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and the solemne Fast appointed for the same, and after frequent convention and formall constitution of the Assembly, in all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof and seven daies sitting, were by this Act to offend God contemne the subjects petitions, deceive many of their conceived hopes of redresse of the calamities of the Kirke and Kingdome, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the combustions of this Kirk, and make every man despaire here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ever to see Religion established, innovations removed, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects complaint respected, or the offenders punished with consent of Authority, and so by casting the Kirke and Estate loose and desolate, would abandon both to ruine. Seventhly, it was most necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this Assembly, for preveening the preiudices which might ensue upon the pretence of two Covenants, whereas indeed there is but one: that first subscribed in 1580. and 1590. being a nationall Covenant and oath to God, which is lately renewed by us, with that necessary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation which the corruptions introduced since that time contrary to the same, inforced: which is also acknowledged in the Act of Councell in September last, declaring the same to be subscribed as it was meaned the time of the first subscription; and therefore, for removing that shame and all prejudices which may follow upon the shew of two different Covenants and Confessions of Faith in one Nation, the Assembly could not dissolve before it had tryed, found, and determined that both
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:17348:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
these Covenants are but one and the selfe same Covenant: The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter renewed by us, agreeing to the true genuine sense and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the first as it was subscribed <hi>in anno</hi> 1580.</p>
                        <p>And further in the said Proclamation,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Anent our cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours.</hi>
                           </note> the straine of our Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is taxed, because we have thereby presumed to cite those of his Majesties Councell who have procured, subscribed, or ratified this Proclamation, to bee responsall to his Majestie and three Estates of Parliament; whereas the same cannot be justly quarrelled, because it it is grounded upon the Law of the Kingdome, and warranted by the act of Parliament therein cited 12. act. Par. 2. <hi>James</hi> 4. which act is grounded upon good reason: for it were strange to thinke that Councellours giving bad counsell, to the evident prejudice and ruine of the Countrey, and publick detriment of the good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, should not be countable therefore to his Majestie and his Estates; and it is not without instance in our Lawes, that perverse counsell hath beene given in misguiding the Kings and common good of this Realme, Act 6. Par. 1. <hi>James</hi> 4. which is also acknowledged by the reduction of grants made by Kings to these perverse Councellours, act 3. Par. 4. and act 5. Par. 1. <hi>James</hi> 4. The perversenesse of which misguiding counsell, hath been assuredly the cause why in the next Parliament in the yeere immediately subsequent, the Kings Councell was chosen in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and sworne in presence of the King and three Estates, and ordained to be responsall and accusable to the King and three Estates for their counsell: Which cleareth that both evill counsell may bee given, and that the Councell may be accused before the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for malversation in their charge. Like as his Maiestie in the Proclamation, makes all persons lyable to the Parliament and generall Assembly, and so giveth way to this previous cytation, which may serve for a forewarning and intimation that they may bee accused if they bee guilty, as wee know all are not, and wish that none were.</p>

                           </note> which resolveth into two heads; the first discharging obedience to the acts of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and liberating all, who shall disobey, from censure, and promising Protection to the disobeyers, and inhibiting all Presbyteries, Sessions of Kirks, Ministers within this Realme in their Sermons, Sessions, and meetings or any otherwaies, to authorize, approve, or allow the Assembly at Glasgow, or doe any deed which may countenance the same, under paine to be punished with all rigour. And commanding all who shall heare them, to delate the same, under paine of the like pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments; likewaies straitly charging and commanding all Judges with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Realme, Clerks, and Writers, not to grant or passe a bill, summond, or letters, or any other execution whatsoever, upon any act, or deed, proceeding from the said Assembly; and all keepers of the Signet from Signeting thereof, under all highest paine. And the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond head, commanding all Subiects to subscribe and sweare the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:17348:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Confession commanded by his Majestie conforme to the sense and meaning of the declaration published by the Commissioner, whereunto we need not here make any answer, but remits the same to a speciall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, published in print made to that <note n="a" place="margin">They should do well to try if they can answer it, and the Queries of Aberdene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that neither of them yet are answered at all.</note> Declaration. But for the first, the same is so farre repugnant to the word of God, practice of the primitive Kirke, the Lawes Civill and Canonicall, the custome of all Nations, the constitutions of our generall Assemblies, acts of Parliament, practice of other judicatories within this Kingdome, to the Confession of Faith and discipline of this Kirke, as we cannot believe any such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments to proceed from our gracious King, but from the malice and mis-information of our adversaries, the conscience of whose guiltinesse affrighteth them to undergoe their deserved censure, which is <note n="b" place="margin">All these texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused; for no such thing can either possibly or probably be inferred from them.</note> cleare first, That the same is contrary to the Law of God, from that place of Scripture <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. wherein the Kirke is commanded absolutely to inflict censures. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. wherein the Kirke did exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that commandment. And the Kirks of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> are reproved for not executing Ecclesiasticall censures against those who held the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> or of <hi>Jezebel,</hi> 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> So that the power of the keys in Ecclesiasticall censures is so intrinsecally and so essentially competent to the Kirk and generall Assembly <hi>jure divino,</hi> as obedience to her decreets and executions thereof, cannot be suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, far lesse taken away and discharged by humane authority, more nor the power of preaching and administration of the Sacraments. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is contrary to the practice of the Apostolike and Primitive Kirks, whose constant practice was to execute the spirituall functions and censures; and, notwithstanding humane prohibitions, to obey God rather then man. Thirdly, It is contrary to the civill Law, <hi>si contra jus vel utilitatem publicam, vel per mendacium fuerit aliquid postulatum vel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petratum ab Imperatore. Et titulo de diversis rescriptis &amp; pragmaticis sanctionibus.</hi> Fourthly, the same is contrary to the <note n="*" place="margin">It is well that they will cite the Pope his Law whom they call An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist; for when any thing is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against them out of the Canon Law, it is usuall with them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that as Popish and Anti-christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> Cannon Law <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. decretal. extravagan. titulo de rescriptis.</hi> Fifthly, it is contrary to the universall custome in all Nations ordaining their Judicatories to doe justice, notwithstanding their Princes prohibition, as is cleare by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varnvia in Spaine, Pappon in France, Suedwyne in Germanie, &amp;c.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the title <hi>de rescriptis aut constitutionibus principum.</hi> Sixthly, to the constitutions of generall Assemblies, because in sundry generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies upon complaints made that the Kings Majestie and his Councell by their letters offered some stop to the Kirk from going on in her Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall censures, especially by act of the generall Assembly convee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the new Colledge of <hi>Sanctandrows</hi> 20. April 1582. it is ordained that none being received to any Ecclesiastical function, office, or benefice, seek any way by the civill power to exeeme and withdraw themselves from the jurisdiction of the Kirk, or procure, obtain, or use any letters, or charges, either by themselves, or any other in their name, or at their command and instance, to impaire, hurt, or stay the said jurisdiction, disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, correction of manners, or punishment of their offences &amp; enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or to make any appellation from the general Assembly, to stop the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:17348:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
discipline, and order of the Ecclesiasticall policie, and jurisdiction granted by Gods Word to the office-bearers within the said Kirk, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paine of excommunication summarily, without any processe, or admonition to be pronounced by the judgement of the Eldership, by the Minister, or Ministers which shall be appointed by them, how soon it is known that any of the saids heads are transgressed; Likeas both the Kings Majestie and his Councell promised that none thereafter should have that cause to complaine, as is manifest by the Act of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly at <hi>Montrose</hi> in July 1597. And in the Assembly holden at Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> 24. April 1582. being charged with Letters of Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to proceed against Master <hi>Robert Montgomrie,</hi>; the Assemblie did write to his Majestie that this discharge was extraordinary, as a thing that was never heard nor seen since the world began, and was directly against the word of God; and Lawes of the Kingdome. And yet notwithstanding of the said charge the Assembly did proceed and excommunicate the said Master <hi>Robert.</hi> Further, In the Assembly at Edinburgh, the 27. of June 1582. Sess. 7. amongst the grievances presented by the Kirk to the King, The first is, That his Majestie by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of some Councellours is moved to take upon Him that spirituall power and authority which properly belongeth to Christ as only King and Head of his Kirk, the Ministerie and execution whereof is only gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to such as bear office in the Ecclesiasticall government of the same; so that in his Majesties person some men prease to erect a <note n="†" place="margin">Nay, but the pretended As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly hath erected a Popedome, and for their authority goe upon the same grounds, and use the very same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the very same places of Scripture which the Pope and the learnedst Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of the Pope doe for robbing of Princes of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over all Ecclesiasticall persons, and causes in their severall Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: The words which next follow are meere babling.</note> Popedome, as though his Majestie could not be full King and Head of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, unlesse alswell the spirituall as temporall sword be put in his Majesties hands, unlesse Christ be rest of his authority, and the two jurisdictions confounded, which God hath divided, which directly tends to the wrack and overthrow of all true Religion, &amp;c. And in the Assembly holden at Edinburgh in Octob. 1582. Sess. 15. Summonds are direct by the generall Assembly against the Kings Advocate, for drawing up the Kings Proclamation of that straine. 7. The foresaid command is also contrary to the Acts of Parliament: because as the Acts of Parliament appoint every matter for its owne Judicatorie, and to all Judicatories their own freedome, so much more doth this liberty belong to the nationall Assembly, being the supreme Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Ecclesiastick of this Kirk, and onely competent Judge in matters so important, and so nearly concerning Gods honour and worship im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, the salvation of the peoples soules, the setling of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Gods worship, the purging away the corruptions thereof, and right constitutions of the Kirk, whose liberties and priviledges are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, Parl. 12. King <hi>James</hi> 6. and Parl. 1. King <hi>Charles.</hi> Likeas by the 12. Par. 114. Act K. <hi>James</hi> 6. <hi>ann.</hi> 1592. the libertie and discipline of the Kirk, especially in her Presbyteries and Assemblies, are fully and firmly ratified, with declaration that the Act of the Kings Majesties prerogative Royall over all Estates and persons, shall no wayes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the priviledges which God hath given to the spirituall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-bearers in the Kirk, concerning heads of Religion, matters of heresie,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:17348:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>
excommunication, collation, and deprivation of Ministers, or any such like essentiall censures, especially grounded and having warrant of the word of God, with full power even to the particular Presbyteries to put order to all matters and causes Ecclesiasticall within their bounds, according to the Discipline of the Kirk. 8. The Lords of Councell and Session by Act 92. Parl. 6. King <hi>James</hi> 6. are ordained to proceed in all civill causes intended or depending before them, or to be intended, and to cause execute their Decrees, notwithstanding any private writing, charge, or command from the Kings Maiestie, or His Councell in the contrarie, and by the 47. Act, 11. Parl. King <hi>James</hi> 6. all licences and supersederees purchas'd from his Maiestie, are dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as contempt done to the Law, as great hurt to the lieges, and contrarie to iustice, and declareth the same to bee null of the Law, and not admissibly by any iudge, nor effectuall to the purchaser any wayes, and ordaineth all Judges within this Realme to proceed and do justice, siclike and in the same manner as if the said supersederees and licences never had beene purchased nor produced. Like as by the 106. Act Parl. King <hi>James</hi> 6. all licences granted by his Majestie to hinder the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Acts against Papists and other adversaries of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are discharged and declared to be of no force. According to which it hath beene the ordinarie custome both in Civill and Ecclesiasticall Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories (notwithstanding of privie warrants or prohibitions contrarie to Law which commonly are impetrate from his Majestie upon misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) to proceed and minister justice. 9. To discharge obedience to the Acts of the Assemblie, stop the execution thereof, protect and defend such as are delinquents and under the Kirks censure, doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly repugne to the large Confession of Faith of this Kirk. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in cap. 19. the third mark of the true Kirk is affirmed to bee upright, ministration of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, as Gods word prescribes, for establishing good order and repressing of vice: and so no more can bee impeded nor justly taken from the Kirk then any of her other two marks <hi>viz.</hi> The right preaching of the word and ministration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And therefore in the Oath at the Kings Coronation, he sweareth to maintaine this Confession, and these three marks of the Kirke, and particularly that hee shall be carefull to root out of his Empire all Hereticks and enemies to the worship of God, that shall be convict by the true Kirk of God of the foresaids crimes. 10. In the short Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith sworne, 1580. and 1590. and renewed by the greatest and <note n="*" place="margin">By the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, but the worst part of the Kingdome.</note>best part of this Kirk and Kingdome, with an explication renewed also at his Maiesties command by his Councell, all are bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in obedience of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Kirke and defend the same according to their vocation and power. So that seeing this generall Assemblie hath proceeded in their Constitution, Acts, and whole proceedings according to the Discipline of this Kirk of Scotland 1580. and 1590. contained in the second book of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: which in both these yeares were ordained to bee registrate and sworn to by all the Ministers of this Kirk, as the Discipline thereof, and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:17348:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wherein the Civill and Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction are so clearly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in the 1. c. l. 2. as the power of the sword may no wayes stop or impede the power of the keyes: and in the 7. c. the Eldership and Assemblies hath power to execute Ecclesiasticall punishment upon all transgressours and proud contemners of the Kirk: and in the 10. c. the office of the Christian Magistrate is described to assist and maintaine the Discipline of the Kirk, and punish those civilly who will not obey the censures thereof, without confounding alwayes the one jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the other: and this order of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended upon in generall Assemblies, as warranted by divine authoritie to be execute notwithstanding any humane inhibition, is set downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Psalmes in meeter: and therefore we can never expect that his Majestie, who out of his pious inclination to justice by a late Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 22.

               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:17348:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>NOt long after this Our Proclamation and their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, Our Commissioner (seeing all things tending to a present rupture) begun his journie according to the leave which We had granted him for his returne: After which time, and ever since, they have throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by threatnings made the Acts of their unlawfull As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly to be received, in many places have perswaded the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of them by force and armes, have levied souldiers, and imposed taxes upon Our subjects for payment of them, have required of Our Judges or Lords of the Session to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Acts, though none of them consented to it, have threatned and menaced them for refusing of it, have raised divers fortifications in Our Kingdome, have blocked up Our Castles and Forts, and now at last forcibly taken Our Castle of Edinburgh, have at home got their Preachers most sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously and rebelliously to teach Our people, that there is a necessitie of their carrying armes against Us, under paine of perjurie and damnation, have scattered abroad, especially here in England, divers infamous Libels justifying their own wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and rebellious courses, inciting Our people here to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the like rebellion, and to deface Our Ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>When the contrivers of that wicked Covenant first fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and devised it, and perswaded others who were well perswaded of their pietie, to enter into it, We dare appeale even to their owne consciences whether they did ever make the seduced people acquainted with their intentions of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing Episcopall government, &amp; introducing of lay-Elders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are the onely two things they make the seduced peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beleeve they now stand upon: And We do wonder there should be any man found in the world, who can hold it a sufficient warrant for Our subjects to take armes against Us their lawfull Soveraign, because We will not give them leave to abolish some things which stand fully established by Our Lawes and Acts of Parliament of that Kingdome, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce other things which are interdicted and prohibited
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:17348:204"/>
by the same: But much more have We reason to thinke Our subjects did them no whit beleeve that (though We should relieve all their grievances, just or pretended, as now We have done) they should yet be forced to acts of rebellion, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of armes against Us, as now they are. But such hath ever been the constant course of the Heads of all rebellions, to ingage their followers by degrees, to conceale from them their maine and wicked ends, which being at the first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, would be abhorred and detested, untill they have gone on so farre in following their Leaders, as afterward they are easily perswaded by them, that there is no hope of pardon left, and so nothing but danger, if they shall offer to retreat: The very same course hath been held in this rebellion for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Our subjects of that Kingdome. The specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence used by the contrivers of the Covenant to the people was Religion, but that which was intended by them was a Rebellion, grounded upon the discontents of some few: And the very meanes whereby they have fomented their factious waies, and kept up in Our people a beliefe that they intended onely Religion as they pretended, have been the very same which have been usually practised by other discontented mutiners. But yet We find, that the principall meanes used to foment this Rebellion by the Heads of it, have been these three.</p>
            <p>First, the seditious prayers and sermons of some Preachers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> suborned by them for that purpose, who made the people still beleeve, that all they said was Gospel, and they crying up in their Pulpits that Covenant, and most bitterly exclaiming against all opposers of it with the most vile and reproachfull termes they could devise, wrought the people to an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good opinion of all that favoured the Covenant, and a bad one of all those who opposed it: So that such things were delivered in their Pulpits, as cannot be related without both shame and horrour. One of them upon Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners comming home, prayed God to deliver them from all crafty compositions. Another refused to pray in the Church for Sir <hi>William Nesbett</hi> late Provost of Edinburgh, when hee
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:17348:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was lying upon his death-bed, onely because he had not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed the Covenant. Another prayed God to scatter them all in Israel, and to divide them in Jacob, who had counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Us to require the Confession of faith to bee subscribed by Our authoritie. Many Ministers would not admit to the Communion those who had not subscribed their Covenant, but in their exhortation before it, barred them in expresse termes with adulterers, slanderers, and blasphemers, &amp;c. Others would not suffer children to bee baptized in the Churches of those Ministers who were not of the Covenant, though they were their owne Parish Churches, but carried them sometimes many miles to be baptized by Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Ministers. One preached, That all the Non-subscribers of the Covenant were Atheists; and so concluded, That all the Lords of Our Councell, and all the Lords of Our Session were such: for none of them had subscribed it. Another preached, That as the wrath of God never was diverted from his people, untill the seven sonnes of <hi>Saul</hi> were hanged up before the Lord in Gibeon; so the wrath of God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver depart from that Kingdome, till the twice seven Prelates (which makes up the number of the Bishops in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) were hanged up before the Lord there; which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, foule and barbarous. Another preached, That though there were never so many Acts of Parliament against the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, yet it ought to be maintained against them all. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other delivered these words in his Sermon: <hi>Let us never give over till we have the King in our power, and then He shall see how good subjects we are.</hi> Another in his Sermon delivered this, That the bloudiest and sharpest warre was rather to be endured then the least errour in doctrine or discipline. Another in his Sermon wished, That hee and all the Bishops in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were in a bottomlesse boat at sea together; for he could bee well content to lose his life, so they might lose theirs. Thousands more such beastly, barbarous and profane spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were delivered by them, not onely in their Pulpits, but in their Sermons: For the Reader must know, that in these times of tumult, where the Churches were not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:17348:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the great multitudes, they did usually preach in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and profane places, in roomes which are yet in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not finished (intended for Lawyers to plead in) in the Halls of the Taylors, and other mechanicall tradesmen of Edinburgh, in some private houses, in the Hall of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Edinburgh, where one Sunday <hi>Rollock</hi> being to preach, but finding the crowds of people to be too great for that place, mounted upon the top of a paire of staires which went up to an upper ground, in an open place which was onely covered by the heavens, and from thence preached to a great troupe or multitude, whose breath is the onely aire hee desireth to live in, being shot quite through the head with popularitie. Others preached in the free-Schoole at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, where boyes use to play and bee punished. If these speeches, and many as bad or worse then these, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in such places, be fit to perswade the people that their Covenant comes from God, the Reader may easily discerne.</p>
            <p>The second meanes which they used for blind-folding the eyes of the people, were, their many false reports, which both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in their Pulpits and out of their Pulpits they vented amongst the people, which their Leaders knew in their owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to be most false. They gave it out, that We intended to bring in Poperie in all Our Kingdomes, or at least a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. It was preached that the Service Book was framed at Rome, and brought over by a country-man of theirs; when they doe know that every Papist by the Popes Bull is prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to heare the Service Booke read. Others preached that all England was of their opinion and judgement, and that they had good intelligence from hence, that no man would adhere to Us against them. Another preached that no man would have protested against the generall Assembly but for money, and that none had protested but they who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived some, when they did know that many had protested who had received none. It is true indeed, that some poore Ministers being thrust out of their Benefices by them for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to Us, were petitioners to Our Commissioner for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the necessities of them and their families; some of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:17348:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
those who were most necessitated, he did a little relieve; but some of that number were none of the protesters, and many who were protesters were none of that number. It was preached ordinarily in their Pulpits, that neither We nor Our Commissioner in Our name did ever intend to hold the generall Assembly, or if We did hold it, did never intend to performe any thing which We had promised in Our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Declaration; though they now know that We have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed both. Within these few daies some desired the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple publiquely in their Pulpits to give thankes to God for that overthrow which the Hollanders had given to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Fleet before Dunkirke; assuring their auditours that it was no lesse to be celebrated by them, then their deliverance from the Spanish Invasion in 88. because all that Fleet was prepared at Our charge, for their ruine and subversion: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many thousands more such reports and counterfeited let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters scattered by them, of which some no doubt were devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by themselves, whereby they kept Our people in that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in which at the very first they had resolved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve them. Now what a fearfull and terrible thing is it for men in the house of God, and in those places of these houses of God which they call the chaires of truth, to deliver such things as either they doe not know to be true, or doe know to be false? Besides these dictates of the Ministers, the lay-Elders, since they came to thinke themselves Ecclesiasticall persons (for so now they doe, and will not be called lay, but ruling-Elders) they have found new inspirations, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered doctrines as like their Divines as may be: one of them We cannot chuse but rehearse. An ancient Knight and a lay-Elder intruded himselfe and his fellowes upon a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie for chusing the Ministers Commissioners for the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly; and the Ministers of that Presbyterie not being able to keep them out, though they earnestly desired it, fell to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat these lay-Elders, that if they would needs intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their election, they would have a speciall care to chuse the ablest Ministers, and who were most inclined to moderation and peaceable courses, because the Church at
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:17348:206"/>
this time stood in great need of such Commissioners: The old Knight in great zeale replyed, That whosoever at this time gave his voice to a moderate or peaceable minded Minister, hee was a betrayer of Christ and his cause; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these times required no luke-warme Commissioners: which barbarous and unchristian speech of his being related by way of complaint to the Tables at Edinburgh, was so far from being censured, as it was approved for a high and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall ejaculation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third meanes whereby they have perverted Our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and continued them in their disobedience to Us and Our Lawes, have been their strange and damnable positions, whereby they have impoysoned Our subjects; some whereof We shall now declare unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, What subjects doe of their owne heads is much better then what they doe in obedience to Authoritie; the one savouring of constraint, but the other being volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie and cheerfull obedience. This proposition is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their Protestation, bearing date the 22. of September, 1638. made against Our gracious Declaration; it is in their fifth reason against the subscription to the Confession of faith urged by Us.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A second, The Parliaments power doth no more reach to the placing of Officers originally in the Church, then the Church hath power to make States-men in the Common-wealth. This position is in their answer to Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners Declaration, concerning Our sense and meaning, in commanding the Confession of faith to bee subscribed: Where they have added the word <hi>Originally</hi> onely to puzzle the Reader: For certainly their meaning must bee, That the Parliament hath no power for confirming of Officers placed in the Church by the Church it selfe; for no Act of Parliament in that Kingdome doth make any Officers in the Church originally, but onely ratifieth and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth such as were established by the Church in her generall Assemblies.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third position is this: The Parliament can make no law
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:17348:207"/>
at all concerning the Church, but onely ratifie what the Church decreeth: and after it hath ratified it, yet if the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Church shall prohibit it, and repeale that decree of the Church, all the subjects are discharged from yeelding obedience to the Act of Parliament, which either made any such law, or ratified any such decree of the Church. This position they deliver in their answer to the 5. reasons in the said Declaration; and would be well weighed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A fourth position is this: The Assembly hath power to discharge all subscription to the confession of faith comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be subscribed by Us, and as it is interpreted by Us or Our Commissioner; so leaving Us no power at all in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall causes, which all Reformed Churches give their Princes, according to Gods Law. This position is in the same place in their conclusion of their answers to the five reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A fifth position is this: The Assembly without Us is the Church, and the onely Judge competent fit to interpret and explaine all doubts arising upon the confession of faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Us; which they put in practice, by explicating Our confession of faith against Our owne meaning, and after We had dissolved the assembly. This position is set downe in the beginning of their conclusion after their answers to the five reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> A sixth position is this: Though the Law be interpreted, yet if it be interpreted in a sense disliked by most of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the body of the Kingdome, for whose good the Law was made, may crave the lawfull redresse of the grievances sustained by that Law. This position is in the fifth of their ten Articles propounded before the indiction of the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. A strange position, that they shall crave redresse of a Law, and before a Parliament which onely can redresse it; and though they call it a craving to redresse it, yet they meane an actuall redressing of it: for they (before a Parliament was at this time indicted) have actually done many things against Acts of Parliament, and stand upon their justification that they may lawfully doe so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:17348:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The seventh position is this: The Assembly is indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, either from King or Parliament in matters Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. This position is in their Protestation against Our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of the 18. of December 1638. in their third reason against Our gracious offers delivered into the Assembly by Our Commissioner; and is a position delivered not onely in the sense, but in the very words of the Jesuites. The other positions following, generally dispersed throughout their Protestations and Pamphlets, are so obvious to any one who hath read them, as the particular cytation of them may bee forborne; such as are these following.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> An eight position is: That in all matters determined in an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, We are to receive them as the son of the Church, and have no further interest in them, though they be not matters of faith but matters of government, and those concluded by them against Acts of Parliament established by Us and Our three Estates; nay, though they concerne secular businesse, as making of Salt, and fishing for Salmons on Sundaies, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Markets from one day in the weeke to another, and such like: for in their late pretended Assembly they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined of many such things, as doth appeare by the Index of their Acts. They will not find many Papists who have said so much for the Church of Rome, nor any Jesuites which have said more.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> A ninth position is this: It is lawfull for subjects to make a Covenant and combination without the King, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a band of mutuall defence against the King and all persons whatsoever, though by two Acts of Parliament before cyted, all such persons as shall be found either contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of, or adherers to any such league, are punishable with death.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> A tenth position is this: That it is lawfull for themselves sitting in an assembly, to indict a new assembly without Our consent, as they have now indicted a new assembly to bee held in July next; or out of the assembly when they please, as they professed that now they would have done, if We had
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:17348:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not indicted one, though this be directly and expresly against two Acts of Parliament before cyted.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> An eleventh position is this: If subjects bee called before Us and Our Councell for any misdemeanour, if they who are called doe any way conceive that the matter for which they are called, doth concerne the glory of God, or the good of the Church (and a wonder it is if any cause can be found which doth not concerne one of these two) then they may appeale from Us and Our Councell to the next generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly and Parliament; and in the meane time, before these appeales be either heard or discussed, they may disobey Us and Our Councell, although by an Act of Parliament before cyted, it is expresly made treason: and the Ministers who appealed from Our Royall Father and his Councell, were upon that Act arraigned and found guilty of treason.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> The twelfth position is this: That when We are intreated to indict a generall Assembly, it is not that there is any need of Our indiction, but rather to doe Us honour, and to beget some countenance to their proceedings; alledging that the power of indiction is in Us but <hi>cumulativè,</hi> not <hi>privativè,</hi> which if We shall refuse, then that power is <hi>suppletivè</hi> in the collective bodie of the people, as it is alwaies (say they) in all other cases, if the Prince shall either neglect or refuse to doe his dutie: Nor are they ashamed to averre, that all Soveraigne authoritie was originally in the collective bodie of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by them conferred with their owne consent upon the Prince; and therefore, if the Prince shall omit to doe his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he either falls from his right, or his right is interrupted, untill he returne to his dutie: but that in the meane time the Soveraigne right and authoritie doth returne to, and remaine with the people, from whom it was at the first derived upon the Prince: A prettie matter it were if Princes Crownes and Soveraignties should depend upon such notionall and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danticall distinctions, and wonder it is that these men who professe themselves to be the greatest enemies to Poperie in all the World, should borrow the very words and termes of
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:17348:208"/>
this ridiculous distinction from the Jesuites; which distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if it had ever been used in those primitive and purest Councels of the Church; all of which were onely called by the Emperours, and in which all matters were ordered and disposed by their Presidents and Deputies, it would have made those Emperours out of love with the Councels and Assemblies of the Church: But they were never robbed of that speciall prerogative of their Crowne untill the Bishops of Rome by their tyrannie and usurpation, and by animating and arming their owne subjects against them, dispossessed them of it: And now We and Our Successors being repos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of it againe by the Lawes of that Our Kingdome, and the usurpation of the Pope, in that very particular, being by many of Our Acts of Parliament excluded, wonder it is to see these men take upon themselves that usurped and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiered Papall authoritie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> The thirteenth position is this: If We or Our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner sitting in Assembly shall denie Our voice to any thing, which to Us appeareth to bee unjust and repugnant to Our Lawes, yet if that shall be concluded by most voices of the Assembly, that then We are bound <hi>jure divino</hi> to see all these conclusions made in despight of Us, obeyed by all Our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and by Our authoritie to inforce obedience to these Acts; and if Our Councellers or Judges shall refuse to do the like, then they shall be lyable to the sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and so be deprived not onely of their places, but of their estates: A position to which We suppose they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gaine the consent of Princes, or Magistrates put in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie under them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> A fourteenth position is this: An Assembly may abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Acts of Parliament, and discharge Our subjects from obedience to them, if they any way reflect upon businesse of the Church; which We wonder that the Nobilitie, Gentrie, and Burrowes can endure: for as it doth derogate principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Our authoritie, so doth it proportionably from theirs when they are assembled in Parliament: and indeed it is to be wondred at, how any man that is acquainted with
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:17348:209"/>
government can endure it: for it destroyeth not onely the nature, but the very name of <hi>the high Court of Parliament</hi>; for how can that be called the Highest Court of the Kingdome, if a generall assembly may rescind the acts of it? And that power which may repeale one act of it may repeale more, nay all acts of it, when it shall bee pleased to exercise that power, and say it is in order to the glory of God and the good of his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> A fifteenth position is this: The Protestation of subjects against Lawes established, whether it be made <hi>coram Judice,</hi> or <hi>non Judice,</hi> before the Judges of the people, or the people themselves who are borne to be judged, doth void all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to these Lawes, and dischargeth all the protesters from any obligation to live under them, before ever these Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the validitie of them shall come to be discussed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the competent Judges of them; nay, although they bee repelled by the Judges before whom they are made: all which (since these troubles begun in that Kingdome) have been usually practised by the Covenanters, who having sometimes made Protestations against Our Lawes before Our Councell, sometimes before Our Commissioner, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before the Lords of Our Session who repelled them all, then they made them before the people their owne asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates in the publique Market-places, and by that meanes held these Protestations sufficiently admitted, and themselves dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from obedience to all these Lawes against which they protested, alledging (perhaps) that they were unjustly and unduely enacted: which course, if it may be allowed in any Common-wealth, and that Protestations before they be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed, may discharge subjects from obedience to Lawes, what subject will yeeld obedience to any Law, by which he findeth himselfe pressed or inconvenienced, when the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of a Protestation, whether admitted or not admitted, is so readie at hand?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> A sixteenth and last position is this; which indeed is the worst of all: for it is both the mother and nurse of all the rest, and is such a shamefull one, that they have not printed
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:17348:209"/>
it <hi>in terminis</hi>; but it followeth by an unavoidable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence upon many of their printed positions, as all of them doe follow upon, and flow from it: And the practice of it is so current with them, as it appeareth almost in every one of their particular actions; And it is thus: A number of men, being the greater part of the Kingdome, because they are the greater, (and in that sense (say they) the more considerable part) may doe any thing which they themselves doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be conduceable to the glory of God, and the good of the Church, notwithstanding of any lawes standing in force to the contrarie; and that this greater part, especially met in a representative assembly, may, without the authoritie of Us, against the expresse commandement of Us and Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and Our Judges declaration of it to be against the lawes of Our Kingdome, chuse some few Noblemen, Gentlemen, Ministers and Burgesses, who, under the name of Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees or Commissioners from the generall assembly, to bee chosen from assembly to assembly, shall sit and determine of things concerning the Church and State, as if there were neither King, Councell, nor Judge in the land. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of a High Commission erected by Us and Our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, but whether this be not a higher Commission then that, We leave it to every impartiall judgement.</p>
            <p>They answer for themselves onely this, That they doe it as being put in authoritie by the generall assembly, which is (say they) a Court independent from Us, and therefore may erect what Court it will without Us, and may appoint what Commissioners it will to sit for that Court, so they meddle with nothing but Ecclesiasticall businesse: But let the Reader consider how many wicked and insufferable absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities this their answer carrieth along with it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, By what authoritie did they doe the same things which they now doe, before the assembly was indicted? They could not bee then Commissioners from the generall assembly.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next, Who gave the generall assembly power to erect any
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:17348:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such Table of Commissioners? They found themselves aggrieved with the high Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission established by Us, upon this ground, that there was no such Court established either by acts of generall assembly or Parliament: And now Wee desire them to shew any act of Parliament giving the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly power to erect any such Table of Commissioners.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in the erection of this Table, they out-doe any thing which yet hath been either said or done by the Jesuites in defence of the Churches authoritie, and the authoritie of her visible Head over Kings and Princes: for they did never yet affirme, that the Ecclesiasticall authoritie could bee exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised but by Ecclesiasticall persons: but these men doe hold, that Noblemen, Gentlemen, and Burgesses may execute this authoritie: But they say, they doe not exercise it as any such lay-men, but as ruling-Elders, and so in the capacitie of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall persons; But can there any childe be found who will not laugh at this, if ever he have heard but the common names of Church-men and Lay-men? Can these two be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded? Can the calling of a man by the name of an Elder make him an Ecclesiasticall person, if by his place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hee is never to discharge any office of a Church-man? They have declared it to be unlawfull for Bishops to have voices in Parliament, Councell, or any secular Judicatorie, because these places are incompatible with the places of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall persons: And shall not lay-persons be as incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at least to meddle with Divine and Ecclesiasticall busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses? Or if they shall, then let these Ecclesiasticall Elders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their places in Parliament and other secular Courts of justice, and become ruling-Elders onely.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, they alledge that they meddle onely in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall causes; Although it bee unlawfull for them to doe that, yet it were the more tolerable, if they did as they say: but they doe make good what they say, by telling the world what they meane by things Ecclesiasticall, and their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they doe expresse in the very termes of the Jesuites; for by Ecclesiasticall, they meane, as their practice sheweth, any
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:17348:210"/>
thing which is <hi>in ordine ad Ecclesiastica</hi>: nay more, <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> whatsoever may bee thought conducible to the good of the Church, or to any spirituall good, and yet more vastly to the glorie of God; by which latitude of the word <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> We would know what they have left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the compasse of their cognisance. Just nothing: For in this sense they may set the price on victuals, they may censure the actions of all men in what kind soever, because Saint <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth us, <hi>Whether we eate or drinke, or whatsoever we doe, doe it all to the glory of God.</hi> And truly, from this false and Jesuiticall interpretation of this word <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> have issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most of all their acts of sedition and rebellion: They have provided armes for Our subjects, they first blocked up all Our Forts &amp; Castles, and since have taken them, stopped Our Officers from carrying victualls or ammunition into them, they have raised Forts, taxed Our subjects, levied souldiers against Us, not onely turned Us out of the possession of Our Castles, but, so farre as in them lies, defeated Our title to them, by declaring that they are not Our Castles but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; they have incroached upon the undoubted bounds and markes of Our Soveraigntie, by sending warrants to Our Sheriffes for chusing Commissioners for the Shires for the next Parliament; they have discharged Our own Printer for printing any thing which concerneth these troubles, or may make against them, though commanded by Us and by Our Councell, so that if We have any thing to print there, We must first be a suiter to <hi>Jhonston</hi> their Clerke for his hand to it, else it cannot passe; they have injoyned or at least suffered the Preachers of their owne side to pray and preach most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly against Us and Our authoritie: those Preachers who continued in their loyaltie towards Us, they have most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly against Our lawes deprived of their Benefices, and most unmercifully and unchristianlike exposed them to miserie and beggerie, they have most contemptuously and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously used Our Councellours and Judges: When they are asked, why they doe these things, and by what authoritie they doe them:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:17348:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To the first they answer onely, That they doe them for the good of the Church, and the glorie of God, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may bee preserved, the honour of God maintained, and his glorie increased: Who would thinke that there should bee men found in the world, who call themselves after the name of Christ, and invocate the name of God, and yet dare profane and abuse the names of Religion, God; and his glorie, and to intitle those glorious names to such lewd actions of treason and rebellion, as can proceed from none but the Devill?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To the second: By what authoritie they doe these things, which are expresly against the Acts of Parliament, Acts of Councell, and Acts of generall Assemblies? They answer, that these Acts of Assembly were unduely obtained, and that now they have rescinded them. For Acts of Parliament and Acts of Councell, they expresse great wonder and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that any man should question their authoritie over them: For that question they use to answer with another of their owne, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether any man doth hold Christ or Us to be supreme? and being answered that Christ is supreme, then they conclude, That they being his Councell must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be supreme; That the Parliament is but the Councell of the Kingdome, That Our Privie Councellours and Judges are but the Councell and Judges of the King; but that they themselves are the immediate and independent Councellours of, and Judges under Christ, who is the King of all kings and kingdomes; and that therefore in all causes which they conceive to concerne Christ and his Kingdome, which is his Church, they are supreme and independent, above Us, Our Parliament, Our Councell, Our Judges: And that if Our Councellours or Judges doe not obey their commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they will proceed to the sentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against them, and by the same reason (though as yet they have not said it) they may proceed against Us with the same sentence: for We acknowledge Christ to bee the supreme King, as much as Our Councellours and Judges doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be the supreme Lord and Judge. These
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:17348:211"/>
furious frensies have not been heard of in the world, since the Anabaptists madnesse reigned in Germanie in <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth his time, which was most strongly and vehemently oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Protestant Princes, who adhered to the Augustan confession, and if <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> whom God used as the chiefe instruments in reforming the abuses of the Church of Rome, had not shewed themselves in their Sermons, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in the Universities, and publique writings which they published, stout Champions against them, and thereby had drawne all Protestants to detest and persecute them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the Reformation of the Church, falling out to bee about the same time when these Anabaptists raged most in their madnesse, had laboured and suffered extremely under the scandall of their frensies, in the opinion of all those who were attending and looking after the issue of that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And yet these same fooleries and frensies are daily acted by these who call themselves Commissioners of the Table, and presented to the Readers of their Pamphlets and Protestations, with the titles of irrefragable, undeniable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, unquestionable, Sun-shine truths, and twenty more such false impudent epithets, as one would wonder from whence they fetch the faces that can beare them out in saying so, when the whole Christian World who shall read them, upon the very first view or reading, must discerne that there is not the least step or shadow of truth to be found in them. We confesse We were amazed at, and aggrieved with their horrible impudence, expressed in their last Petition sent unto Us, in which they did invocate the name of God, calling him not onely as a witnesse, but as an approver of their actions; at their pretended assurance of Our justification of them all, when they undoubtedly know, that We doe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre and detest them all as rebellious and treasonable; at their shamelesse asseveration of their confidence that their neighbour Churches will approve all their proceedings; that they are affraid they should bee thought to have offended in nothing so much as in lenitie, when they have proceeded to
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:17348:212"/>
the deposition and excommunication of the Bishops and others their opposers, which is the utmost of that power which ever any Church did yet challenge to it selfe; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more such audacious untruths, which after We once heard read, We resolved never to answer, and now doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it onely thus, That in the maine points of it there is not one true word: To say nothing of the boldnesse of this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, which expecteth Our answers in such termes, as it doth not onely seeme to require Our approbation of their wicked proceedings, but almost to command it: and lastly, it is subscribed onely by the hands of the Moderatour and Clerke of the Assembly, as if it were an ordinarie cytation served upon the meanest subject of that Our Kingdome. And besides all these, We would know what Ecclesiasticall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, just or pretended, did ever use any coercive power, but that which was Ecclesiasticall, <hi>viz.</hi> suspension, deprivation, degradation, or excommunication. But this pretended As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly hath besides all these inforced her acts with armes, and all manner of violence both against the persons and fortunes of such as doe not agree unto them, but continue loyall to Us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:17348:212" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y this time We hope the Reader is well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that We have been from time to time well acquainted with, and rightly informed concerning all the particular passages of these troubles: For since We produce their owne originall foule and blacke acts, and the counsels which We tooke, and courses which We held for meeting with them, and hindering them, so farre as then on the sudden We could, every man will now hold their ordinarie and so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated calumnie sufficiently confuted, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and proffers on their parts were quite concealed from Us, That their petitions, remonstrances, and grievances were kept from Us, That We understood no more of the estate of the affaires of that Kingdome, then the malice of their adversaries and bad patriots were pleased to impart unto Us; That Our Commissioner in his severall journies between Us and them never made Us acquainted with the true state of the businesse, or with their requests and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations, That he at his severall returnes did do that which he thought fittest to be done, and not what We had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, or that if We did command him, Our commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were according to the information which hee had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto Us of their counsells and courses; which informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was never true nor right, but onely such as hee and the Bishops had contrived for mis-informing of Us: All which most wicked calumnies, invented onely to keep Our people unsatisfied, as they are attended with want of truth, so they are accompanied with a most undeserved ingratitude. For We doe professe, that there was no man since the time of these troubles, who hath more zealously stood between Our wrath and them, then Our Commissioner, and who hath more constantly laboured Us to admit any probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction which might be made of their actions, ever untill such time as they came to that height, that they could neither probably nor possibly receive any good construction; and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:17348:213"/>
yet even then all his perswasions were to pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse, if they should acknowledge their errours, and with a submissive humilitie returne to Our obedience. And here We must needs justifie all his proceedings with them, as being punctually and exactly ordered and performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Our instructions and commandements to him, and condemne their ingratitude to him, not doubting but ere long they will heartily wish that they had some such about Us, who might solicite Us for their peace and pardon so carefully as hee did, so long as hee had any hope of their amendment.</p>
            <p>The same course which they held with him their owne countrie-man, they held likewise with some of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of great place, especially some of the Prelates neere Us, and intrusted with the greatest businesse of this Church and Kingdome: For, during the time of all these troubles, they have likewise slandered them amongst Our subjects of that Kingdome, both for mis-information of Us, and giving Us counsell and advice to shunne all waies of peace; Whereas We must professe that those Prelates, whom (in their last se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and treasonable information to the good Christians of England) they have traduced for their greatest enemies, &amp; chiefly some of them whom they especially glance at with Our Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioner, have bin their greatest friends, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells were alwaies counsells of peace, and their solicitations to Us were vehement and earnest for granting unto them those unexpected and undeserved favours, which We were graciously pleased to bestow upon Our people, published in Our Proclamation at Edinburgh the 22. of September 1638. and afterward made good to them in Our name by Our Commissioner at the Assembly in Glasgow: These Prelates and Our Commissioner advising Us rather to condescend to these particulars, then to be put to the effusion of any drop of Our subjects bloud.</p>
            <p>But the miserie and misfortune of many of Our well meaning subjects in that Kingdome, hath in all this businesse
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:17348:213" rendition="simple:additions"/>
been this, That they trusted the mis-informations of their Leaders, even in those things of which their Leaders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves did not beleeve so much as one word: Such were their false reports of Our inclination to Poperie, of Our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions never to hold an Assembly, although We had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted it, of Our intention of never performing any thing in that Assembly which We had promised in Our gracious Proclamation of the indiction of it: All which false reports We have since sufficiently confuted by Our commanding the renovation of the subscription of that Confession of faith which cannot subsist with Poperie, by Our indicting a free generall Assembly (the freedome whereof they quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by their proceedings both before it and in it) by Our making good in that Assembly (such as it was) all Our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises; and therefore We cannot now but hope and expect, that all Our good and loyall subjects of that Our ancient and native Kingdome will, by their former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the falshood of their Seducers and Leaders, learne to give no trust or credit to their posteriour and new mis-informations, which by their last seditious Pamphlets printed or written, and by many intercepted letters We find to be these three especially, but all of them most notoriously false.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, they goe about to perswade Our good subjects, that We intend an invasion of that Our Kingdome: But they must have a great power over the faith of such as they can make beleeve that a King would invade his owne King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: Invasions made by Princes of other Princes domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions have been usuall; but for a Prince to invade his owne Kingdome is a prodigious untruth. But they tell Our people that We are coming thither attended with English troupes: We wonder if they should bee affraid of them whom Our people in their Pulpits, and elsewhere, have been made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve were all of their owne partie, and would take armes with them in their defence against Us.

threatned; and if for the securing of Our person they should offer themselves to bee Our guard wheresoever We goe; what doe they else but shew themselves to be true and loyall subjects, and lay an obligation on Us to continue in Our breast that full assurance of their loyaltie and fidelitie towards Us, of which We have alwaies by unanswerable demonstrations been fully perswaded; as also upbraid the disloyaltie of many of Our subjects of that Our native King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, amongst whom they are loath to trust Us without offering their persons to be Our guard?</p>
            <p>But these two things We doe desire all Our good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Kingdome firmly to beleeve: First, We are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that We shall not much stand in need of English troupes to chastise the Heads of this late Rebellion, as being fully perswaded that Our loyall subjects, who have all this while adhered unto Us; and Our mis-led subjects, who upon this Our Declaration wil adhere unto Us, but above all the justice of the cause of God and of Us his Anointed, shall be strength enough to bring those principall Rebells to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the tryall of Our Lawes. Next, Wee desire all Our good subjects there, to beleeve that We are so farre from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending any invasion of that Our native Kingdome, as that according to Our dutie and oath taken at Our Coronation, We shall by the grace of God alwaies be ready with Our whole power, estate, and expense of Our bloud (if the case shall so require) to defend that Our Kingdome and subjects thereof against all invasions whatsoever. For We doe at this time onely intend to reduce the principall Heads of these tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults to the obedience of Us and Our Lawes, and in case of their Rebellious obstinacie, to bring them to those deserved punishments, which in such cases the Lawes of that Our Kingdome have provided: nor can this either bee called or accounted an invasion, more then the Judges sentencing malefactours to punishment, can bee called an invasion of them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second mis-information whereby We find the Heads of this Rebellion goe about to keep Our people from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:17348:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Our obedience, is this: They make them beleeve, that since they have not accepted of Our gracious offers made in Our Declaration at Edinburgh the 22. of September last, and made good by Our Commissioner in Our name at the Assembly in Glasgow, that now We will certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme none of them: But these wicked mis-reporters speake both according to their owne deserts (as knowing that their rebellious misdemeanours have indeed deserved no such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at Our hands) and likewise, according to their owne desires (as fearing that if We should make them good, then Our people might and must receive satisfaction thereby) but they doe not speake according to Our Royall intentions, which are to assure Our subjects, that (as We have before expressed in Our Preface) their faults and disloyall courses shall not make Us goe backe from any thing which We have promised in either of those two Our gracious Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made at Edinburgh and Glasgow, but that We will performe them all for the securing of all Our good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from any further feares of these pretended innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third mis-information whereby the Heads of this Rebellion goe about to continue Our people in disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Us, is this: They would make them beleeve, that if they shall now yeeld, We doe intend to make that Our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Kingdome a Province, and to dispoile them of all their lawes and liberties, and to give them new lawes, as if they were a conquered Kingdome: A most divellish and false suggestion; for We professe We never harboured any such thought in Our Royall breast, but doe intend by the grace of God to continue that Our native Kingdome in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Our lawes, and confirme unto them all their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and when it shall please God to translate Us, to leave the same in charge to Our Successour.</p>
            <p>These foule but false aspersions being thus wiped off, We are now desirous to remove their grand and maine calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, whereby they doe at once endeavour both to disparage Our just, and to justifie their owne most unjust proceedings.
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:17348:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
They give out that We have no quarrell against them but Religion; and when they are asked in what points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion We will not yeeld to them, they doe not name any one of which they have complained in their Petitions, and which in them they called innovations in Religion (for they know, that in Our gracious Declarations We have given full satisfaction concerning them) but they instance in other two particulars: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, Our not admitting the introducing of lay-Elders into their Presbyteries, and that in equall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with the Ministers, and that these lay-Elders shall have voices, and alwaies the casting voice in the election of the Ministers Commissioners from the Presbyteries to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assembly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second, That We will not give way to the abolishing of Episcopall government. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, We professe that We cannot give way to it, it being a course unheard of, not onely in that Church of Scotland, but in any Church in any age: for how can We yeeld that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, Gentlemen, Commoners shall be made Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call persons, which must needs bring in a confusion of these two, <hi>Ecclesiasticall and secular persons,</hi> which have alwaies been distinguished? Next, how can We betray the Ministers of that Kingdome unto perpetuall slaverie? for if Episcopall government should bee gone (which they intend) and the Ministers in their Presbyteries shall be over-swayed by the voices of the lay-Elders, what face of Ecclesiasticall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can remaine, when it shall be quite pulled out of the hands of Ecclesiasticall persons? And therefore We cannot chuse but account it a great ingratitude in those Ministers who oppose Us, for whose maintenance as We first stood against the laitie, so We are now resolved to stand against them for their libertie. For the second, which is the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of Episcopall government, We professe We cannot yeeld unto it (though it were not warranted by Apostolicall institution at the first, and since by the perpetuall practice of the Church of Christ in all ages and places, as We hold it is warranted by both:) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because it is established in that Kingdome, and hath ever been by Acts of Parliament, and
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:17348:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is so now, and hath been for many yeeres by Acts of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assembly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next, because of the course which they have taken to abolish it, to wit, by an Assembly, holding that an Assembly may abolish Acts of Parliament; a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition which must not bee endured in any Monarchie: for then the Convocation in England, or generall Assembly in Scotland, might introduce in either of these Kingdomes, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, and the Popes authoritie if they had a mind to doe so, notwithstanding the Acts of Parliament in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes which have ejected them, and which Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were posteriour to the Acts of these Ecclesiasticall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and were confirmations of what was passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, We cannot destroy Episcopall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment without destroying one of the three Estates of Parliament, which Wee will not doe: but these men in an Ecclesiasticall Assembly, without Our consent, or consent of Parliament, have gone about to destroy the first of the three Estates of Parliament.</p>
            <p>But say that none of these things were so, yet Wee would be satisfied in this point, Whether Our refusing of the intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of lay-Elders, and the extrusion of Episcopall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can bee to the conscience of any man a sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or ground for his taking armes against his lawfull King and Soveraigne? for now their very Leaders, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that We have given them satisfaction in the rest, make these two the onely ground of all their armes. And Wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the consciences of most of Our subjects Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if, when they entered into that Covenant at the first, they did ever imagine that they should be perswaded to take armes against Us, for these two points of lay-Elders and Episcopall government, if they should receive satisfaction from Us in their other grievances, and feared innovations, as We have before declared. Wee are confident that no such matter was then within the compasse of their thoughts: We then having fully removed those pretended feares which occasioned their Covenant, Wee cannot but hope that Our
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:17348:216"/>
seduced subjects will returne to their former obedience; but for their seducers, Wee know that some of them from the very first were resolved never to receive any satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>This grand imposture and calumnie, with the other three, being removed, We will now declare fully and freely to all Our subjects of Our three Kingdomes, and to all forrainers besides, the true and onely causes which doe inforce Us at this time to use force for the repressing of the insolencies of such of Our subjects in that Kingdome as shall stand out against Us; first protesting that none of the causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, suggested by their Leaders, have settled in Us this resolution, but onely these causes which now follow.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, We will never endure that any of Our subjects, nay that all Our subjects (if they could possibly bee all of one mind) out of Parliament shall ever abolish or destroy any Act of Parliament, especially not Noblemen and others as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in an Ecclesiasticall Assembly: for to hold that any Assembly of subjects out of Parliament, or in Parliament without Our consent, may abolish any Act of Parliament, destroyeth the very foundation of government and justice in all Monarchies; and the doing of it by Ecclesiasticall persons in their Councells and Synods, hath been the cause of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite calamities and miserable wars and devastation of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in the Christian World, since the Pope and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave did usurp that unlawfull and unlimited power; which, being in that Our Kingdome in all these late troubles practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against the expresse lawes of the same, Wee are resolved to punish, unlesse the offenders betake themselves to Our mercie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, We are resolved not to endure that any of Our subjects, without Our consent, and the consent of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, shall destroy any of the three Estates of Parliament; which they in their late pretended Assembly have gone about to doe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:17348:216"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, We are resolved not to endure that any generall Assembly shall be called but by Our indiction, according to an expresse Act of Parliament in that case provided; or that it shall continue after that Wee by Our authority have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved it; and are resolved to punish them who shall doe so, as Our Royall Father punished those who did the like at Aberdene.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, We are resolved to punish those who have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed taxes upon Our subjects, levied men or armes, raised any fortifications in that Our Kingdome without Our leave, and first blocked up, and then taken Our Castles and Forts, and by violence dispossessed Our loyall subjects of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and castles, detaining them by force; for all these, by the expresse Lawes of that Our Kingdome, are acts of treason and rebellion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, We are resolved not to endure that the Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of subjects against Us, Our Councell, Our Judges and Lawes, shall discharge the obedience of the protesters unto these Lawes, unlesse they be admitted before the competent Judges, and legally discussed before them; the contrarie whereof hath been practised by the Covenanters all the time of these tumults.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, We are resolved not to endure that Our subjects shall enter into any covenant or band of mutuall defence, without Our leave asked and obtained, it being expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by divers Acts of Parliament of that Our Kingdome; for this hath been, and still is, the ground of all this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly and principally, We are resolved not to endure that any of Our subjects, under the name of a Table, or Committees of the generall Assembly, or under any other name, title or pretence whatsoever, shall sit without Our consent and authoritie, and order businesse of the Church and Kingdome at their pleasure; and if they shall be called in question for the same by Us, Our Councell, or Judges, shall appeale from Us and them, and refuse to be judged by either, alledging that they will be judged by none but by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:17348:217"/>
Assembly, which is Christs owne immediate Councell, and therefore hath no dependencie from, or subordination either to Our Councell or Judges, or Our Parliament, which is the Councell of Our Kingdome, and so that both Church-men and lay-men under Ecclesiasticall names shall exempt themselves from the authoritie of Us and Our Lawes, and the Assembly it selfe shall hold the members of it free from being judged in all matters of Assembly by any but by it selfe; which by the Lawes of that Our Kingdome is treason, as appeareth by the Act cyted in the bodie of this narration: Now all this hath been practised, and is practised by those which call themselves of the Table.</p>
            <p>From all which We hope it is evident, that the offences which We resolve to punish in some of Our subjects, doe not concerne Religion: So that the question is not, Whether there shall be a Service Booke, Booke of Canons, high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, nay, nor whether there shall be no lay-Elders in Assemblies, or no Episcopall government, (though We are resolved to reject the one, and retaine the other:) But the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion indeed is neither more nor lesse then this, Whether We and Our Successours shall be any more Kings of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for if these traiterous positions shall bee maintained and made good by force of armes, then We and Our Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours can bee no more Kings there, Our Parliament, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and Judges have no more authoritie there; So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse We will give over to be King, and so betray and desert that charge wherewith God hath intrusted Us, We must use that power which God hath put in Our hands, and by faire, just and legall waies, to Our great griefe, force them to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>These are the true reasons which have forced Us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this journey, and to make use of the armes and aide of Our loyall subjects here, for the securitie of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and safeguard of Our person, as likewise of the armes and aide of Our subjects of that Kingdome for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And here first We call God to witnesse what an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:17348:217"/>
journey this is unto Us, and how unwillingly We doe undertake it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, We doe professe and protest, that as We (like God himselfe, whose Vicegerent We are) have showne Our Selfe all this while slow to anger; so now like him We shall shew Our selves ready to forgive, upon the repentance of such of Our subjects as have been mis-led, their deserting the Heads of their Rebellion, and returning to Our obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that We intend to use no armes against that Our Kingdome, but onely against some Rebells in it, for their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension and bringing them to justice.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, that such even of those who shall be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, shall have their faire and legall tryalls according to the Lawes of that Our Kingdome, without the denyall of the least favour which can be allowed them by the course of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, if they will offer and submit their persons to a legall tryall.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, that all Our subjects of that Kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who shall now adhere unto Us, shall be protected and defended by Us in their persons and fortunes, with the uttermost of Our power: For We professe that We doe not hold it a nationall defection, but a revolt of some Rebells, who have mis-led a great many of the rest, We having a great many subjects of all rankes in that Our Kingdome, who for their constancie in their loyaltie and fidelitie towards Us, shall justly expect both protection and reward from Us.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, that whosoever shall goe about to make any of Our subjects beleeve that this is a nationall quarrell between these two ancient Kingdomes, both now being under Our government, shall be punished as a disturber of the peace of both: and therefore We exhort and require all Our subjects of both Kingdomes, who shall accompanie Us in this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to live and converse peaceably and lovingly, whereby as they shall doe Us most singular and acceptable service, so they shall notably disappoint the Heads of that Rebellion, who now labour no point so much as this, to make Our subjects of that Kingdome beleeve, that this journey of Ours bringeth
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:17348:218"/>
along with it a nationall invasion; and if Our subjects of both nations shall keep that friendly and loving correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their attendance upon Us in this journey, We doe not doubt but it will be a meanes to tye them in a stronger band of love for ever hereafter, when Our Scotish subjects shall here see the alacritie and forwardnesse of the English, and the English shall there perceive the alacritie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse of the Scotish, both of them meeting in this point and center, <hi>viz.</hi> the defence of Our person, and of Our Royall Crowne and Dignitie.</p>
            <p>To conclude: As We have found the aide and assistance of Our loving subjects here towards this journey, so We doe heartily desire their prayers all the time of Our absence for a good successe unto it, and that if it be possible We may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with peace, and without the effusion of any drop of Our subjects bloud: And We doe require all Our good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Our Kingdome of Scotland, especially the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters who should bee the messengers of peace, to frame and settle Our subjects minds to the courses and waies of peace, and to lead them on in the way of returning to Our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who doth resolve to maintaine them in the Religion now established amongst them, that so We be not forced to draw Our sword of justice against any of them, which in case of their obstinacie how unwillingly We shall doe, We call the King of kings to witnesse: But if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else will serve it must be, and their bloud will rest upon their owne heads.</p>
