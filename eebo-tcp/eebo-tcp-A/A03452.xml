            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Martin Luther</hi> when he had made his reuolt from the Catholike Roman Church, fynding that there were ſome thinges taught, and obſerued in the ſame Church, that were thereto deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended by ancient tradition, and alſo deduced from the ſcriptures, though not expreſſly therein mentioned, thought with himſelf that the only way for him to draw many diſciples after him, was, to proclayme in all his ſermons and writings, that we ought not to belieue or do nay thing concerning faith &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but that which was expreſſly comaunded and ſet downe in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word of God. By this deuyce in the beginning he found great applauſe, eſpecially among the vulgar ſort, into whoſe handes he had thruſt Bibles and Teſtaments tranſlated by himſelf into Dutche, to the beſt aduantage of his doctrine. But it was not long after that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17459:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſome of theſe his diſciples grew ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, as to examine his doctrine by his owne rule, and to ſee if all that he had taught them were expreſſly to be found in the written Word of God. In which examination, they found that the Chriſtening of yonge children was not there to be found; and thereupon eſteeming the baptiſme of children to be of no force, they reuolted from him and rebaptized themſelues, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the ſect of the Anabaptiſts.</p>
            <p>After theſe, <hi>Andrew Carolostadius,</hi> one of the firſt and greateſt diſciples of Luther, who with him allowed the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of children, although not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Scripture, began to diſſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

fell to robbing and ſpoyling of Churches throughout al the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Vpon this the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> as a Prince moſt carefull of his Oath, and of the good of his ſubiects, was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſend into theſe <hi>Netherlands</hi> the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> to take vpon him the generall gouernment, which in ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome a world was too great a charge to be menaged by a woman.</p>

            <p>Heere now it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whether in the ſight and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole World, the King of Spaine had not all right and reaſon on his ſide, to vſe ſuch meanes as he did for the puniſhment of ſuch capitall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and to imploy the ſubiects of one Countrey, for the chaſtiſement of the Rebells of another, when he had no other remedy.

of priuileges, but for ſeeking to reſtore priuiledges which his diſobedient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects had broken; the which if he had not done, then might he haue beene thought negligent and careleſſe of his Oath: but this, the equity of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would neuer permit.</p>

ſhe her ayding the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> both with men and money vnto her dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day.

after, yea euen at the very tyme when <hi>Drak</hi> was arriued home with his booty, (which was in Nouember in the yeare 1580.) and being all this while an eye witneſſe not only of the ſayd Queenes oppreſſing and impoueriſhing her own ſubiects at home, for the ayding of the foreſayd <hi>Hollanders</hi> abroad, &amp; rebellious ſubiectes of the King his Maiſter; but of her ſending forth alſo to robbe him, in his owne dominions, therby to ayde them vnlawfully with their Lords own treaſure.</p>
            <p>If now from the firſt to the laſt, the deportement of the Queene of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> towards the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> in the long continuance of ſo many great wronges and iniuryes, be but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently conſidered; what man, though but of meane capacity can iudge, but in the end, he muſt needes be prouoked to do ſomething againſt her, were it but in regard of Honour, he being a King ſo great and potent. And therefore it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17459:27"/>
was no wonder, that after ſo many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer yeares patience, he was in the end (and that alſo with an addition of eight yeares forbearance) after the taking of his aforſayd treaſure (in which tyme al detriments that could be done him, both by Sea &amp; Land, beſides the ayding alſo of <hi>Don Antonio</hi> (the pretended King of Portugall) being put in practiſe) forced to prepare that great Armada a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> by ſea, which he did in the yeare 1588. though with no ſucceſſe.

            <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Whether</hi> England <hi>hath receaued any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite by defending the quarrell of the</hi> Hollanders; <hi>or whether the</hi> Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>haue endeauoured to deſerue the friendſhip they haue receaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, or haue any way ſhewed themſelues grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for it.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TO examine and ſearch out the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which <hi>England</hi> may haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued by meanes of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> I know not whereor which way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> or their friends may perhaps ſay, that it was a benefit great inough for the Engliſh to aſſiſt them, in reaſon of ſtate, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they kept out warre from their own Country. But what an excuſe this is? when as the Engliſh neuer needed to haue feared warre in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but for their cauſe, and for taking
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17459:29"/>
their partes: for it was for their cauſe that the Engliſh ſeized vpon the ſix hundred thouſand ducates which were ſent out of Spayne to the Duke of <hi>Alua;</hi> which was a capital cauſe of enmity, and indeed the only cauſe that enforced the ſayd Duke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the tenth penny of the peoples goods, whereby the whole common multitude became diſpoſed the ſooner to rebellion. For the king of Spaynes money, was not detayned by the Engliſh vpon any couetous deſire to haue it for themſelues, but becauſe the Duke <hi>Alua</hi> ſhould not haue it to employ againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and that it might be tranſported from <hi>England</hi> vnto the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> &amp; ſo come to be vſed by them againſt the ſayd Duke, to whom it was ſent to haue byn imployed againſt them for their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
            <p>But it may be further alleaged in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17459:29"/>
excuſe of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that they were ſo gratefull, as they offred vnto the Queen of <hi>England</hi> the Soueraignty of the Netherlandes, which benefit ſhe would not accept of, and therefore it was not their fault that if ſhe obtayned it not. To this may be ſayd, that the Diuel offred to haue giuen Chriſt all the kingdoms of the world if he would haue worſhipped him, and ſo was more liberall of giuing that which was none of his own, then were the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi> But the Queen well knowing that by accepting this guift whereunto they had no right, ſhe ſhould haue been ſure to haue drawn a perpetual warre, and the whole charge thereof vpon her ſhoulders, and therefore refuſed this their liberality; yet was ſhe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling notwithſtanding to ayde them, without this obligation. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was; becauſe ſhe ſtill retayned a hop to be wholy diſburdned, or at leaſt much holpen in the bearing this charge
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17459:30"/>
by <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> or by bringing the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to the full poſſeſſion of the whole ſeuenteen Prouinces, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might depend vpon themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.</p>
            <p>It may alſo be alleaged, that ſhe had the Cautionary Townes of <hi>Briel, Fluſhing</hi> &amp; the other places, deliuered into her handes. True it is, ſhe had ſo, and thereby enioyed the benefit of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at more expence both of men and money. Other benefits can I remember none; nor can there be any found, &amp; ſo will ſpare the labor to look any further after them: yet becauſe ill turnes, and domages may more readily be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue heereby happened to the Queene and ſtate of <hi>England,</hi> I ſhall ſet downe what in this kind I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
            <p>Firſt then to begin with the afore mentioned Cautionary Townes, it appeareth, that becauſe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would ſo ſoone as they could, be the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17459:30"/>
freer to ſet the Engliſh at naught, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by meanes of the Truce with the King of Spayne, and the Archduke <hi>Albert,</hi> gotten togeather ſome ſpared money; they ſo laboured with their feed freind Sir <hi>Raph Winwood</hi> (a better <hi>Hollander</hi> then an <hi>Engliſhman)</hi> that for paltry payment they got their brydle out of the Engliſh handes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> began ſtraightwayes to ſhew their gratitude in forbidding the bringing of Engliſh dyed, and dreſſed clothes into <hi>Holland,</hi> and their adioyned Prouinces, without euer making the king or his Ambaſſador Ledger at the <hi>Hage</hi> priuy thereunto.</p>
            <p>Soon after, to make amendes for this their ſaucy and vnmannerly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they came to offer the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty himſelf a more inſolent affront. For whereas the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> as Admirall of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by order from the King, had ſent one <hi>M. Brown</hi> in the yeare 1616. to demaund of the ſaid
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17459:31"/>
               <hi>Hollanders,</hi> then fiſhing vpon the coaſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a certayne ancient duty, called <hi>Size herring;</hi> with much a do they payd it, as in former tymes it was accuſtomed; but yet withſome ſpeaches that it was the laſt tyme, that it ſhould be payed.</p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>M. Browne</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming the yeare following with the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and commaundement, with one ſhip of the Kinges only to demaund the duty afo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſayd, and with order, that if it were denyed, he ſhould take witnes of the refuſal in writing, and ſo peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably depart; being come aboard one of their ſhips, and demanding the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd duty, he was by the Maiſter therof denyed it, who told him playnly that he was commaunded by the States of <hi>Holland</hi> not to pay it vnto the King any more, of which he tooke witnes according to his order from his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</p>
            <p>Whyles this was a doing, there
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17459:31"/>
comes aboard that ſhip, the Maiſter of of another ſhip of <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp; demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>M. Brown</hi> his name, he replyed that his name was <hi>Browne:</hi> Why then (quoth he) if you be the man, I haue order to arreſt you, and to carry you into <hi>Holland:</hi> whereof <hi>M. Brown</hi> gaue notice to the Maiſter of the Kings ſhip, requyring him to aduertiſe his Maieſty of this inſolency, and ſo <hi>M. Brown</hi> was areſted and carryed away priſoner into <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this tyme, as I alſo haue heard it credibly reported, one M. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chibald Rantkin</hi> a Scottiſh gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding at <hi>Stockholme</hi> in <hi>Sweden,</hi> &amp; there ſoliciting for the payment of certayne money due vnto ſome <hi>Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> Mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; one <hi>Van<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dyke</hi> lying there alſo as Agent for the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> ſayd vnto ſome principal perſons of the <hi>Swedians,</hi> that they needed not be to haſty in paying the king of <hi>Englands</hi> ſubiects any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or to giue them any reſpect, for that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17459:32"/>
the ſayd Kinges promiſes, were not to be belieued, nor his threates to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For which villanous and inſolent ſpeaches, being afterward challenged by <hi>Rantkin,</hi> he had no better excuſe then to ſay, he was drunke when he ſpake them (for deny them he could not) and ſo his excuſe of playing the beaſt, excuſed him for playing the man.</p>
            <p>But now from theſe inſolent affronts and ſpeaches, let vs come to deeds, and ſee how they haue vſed our Engliſh Nation in the North ſeas, on the coaſt of <hi>Groonland</hi> &amp; thoſe partes, about the trayn-oyle fiſhing, where they haue offred them ſundry abuſes by giuing them blowes, chaſing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and doing vnto them diuers oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> detriments; not admitting to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the ſea fiſhing is free for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, where it is not vpon the coaſt of any Countrey, vnto which the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit belongeth by ancient prerogatiue.</p>
            <p>And yet is all this but little in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17459:32"/>
of their vſage of our Nation in the Eaſt Indyes, wher they haue as fiercely ſet vpon them with open hoſtility, as if before their meeting there, they had of long continuance beene mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, hauing ſlaine many of our men, and ſunke ſundry of our ſhipps. And when moreouer they haue taken ſome of our men priſoners, they haue vſed them, in the ſight of the Indians, in ſuch contemptible and diſdainefull manner, as if at home in their owne Countryes, the Engliſh in reſpect of them were but an abiect and a ſlauiſh Nation; and that the Hollanders were either their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, &amp; might vſe them at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or the Engliſh ſo baſe and vnpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, as they durſt not be reuenged, but quietly put vp any iniury at their handes.</p>
            <p>And indeed the <hi>Indians</hi> might in reaſon coniecture that the Hollanders would neuer haue dared ſo to domineer ouer the Engliſh abroad, if they had not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17459:33"/>
had the maiſtery of them at home; after which accounpt &amp; reckoning ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons abroad are wont to be looked into. What thinke you now of our Engliſh Prouerbe? <hi>Haue we not brauely ſet beggers on horſbacke?</hi> Nay haue not Engliſhmen (the premiſes conſidered) great reaſon to loue the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and to hate <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards?</hi> Yea, and to hate <hi>Spaniards</hi> only for the loue of ſuch courteous &amp; grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Hollanders?</p>
            <p>And as for the commodious trade which the Engliſh haue had in <hi>Muſcouy</hi> for more then threeſcore and ten years, and which the Hollanders haue now quite gotten from the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

their true Lord, and Maiſter? Surely there is no reaſon to think other wayes: and yet if any man ſhould, let him but looke into their attempt vpon <hi>Huys,</hi> &amp; alſo vpon <hi>Liege</hi> the principall Citty of that Countrey, not long ſince put in practiſe.</p>
            <p>Put the caſe then, that they had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued vnto their deſired greatnes, that is to ſay, to haue gotten the whole ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteene Netherland Prouinces with the Duchyes of <hi>Cleue</hi> and <hi>Iuliers,</hi> &amp; the reſt thereunto dependant, as alſo the Countrey of <hi>Liege;</hi> how would they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue borne themſelues towards <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France?</hi> How had they then beene able to haue giuen law to both theſe kingdomes; to the one by land, from the Countrey of <hi>Liege</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fining vpon it, and to the other by ſea, by being able to ouertop it in ſhipping? what doubt may be made heereof, conſidering what a correſpondent party they would haue found in <hi>France</hi> by their moſt confident

            <p>What policy might it then haue proued for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had by their help preuayled againſt the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> when they ſhould therby haue prepared an irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diable ſcourge for themſelues.</p>
            <p>Let it then be truely conſidered, whether it had not been greater policy, more honorable, &amp; more profitable, for both thoſe Nations, and more for the tranquility of Chriſtendome, that they had ſuffred the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> to haue brought theſe his rebellious ſubiects to obedience, and ſo to haue gouerned them in peace, to the end he might haue

            <p>
               <hi>England,</hi> as hath beene ſayd in the precedent Chapter, hath already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued proofe of the ingratitude of her coſtly Holland friends; and <hi>France</hi> no leſſe, by hauing not long ſince diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to be more ready to take their

partes that were in armes againſt the now regnant King, then the Kinges part againſt them. And if they had been ſo wary as to haue diſſembled ſom what longer their ingratitude &amp; inſolencyes towards <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> yet their audacious brauing of the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> (notwithſtanding they muſt paſſe with all their corne from <hi>Danske</hi> throgh his <hi>Sownd)</hi> were inough to haue diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered their proud contempt of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of Kinges; and what Neighbours they would haue proued to <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>France,</hi> when they ſhould haue arriued to their expected freedome of an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Republike. Let it then be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> could euer feare to be ſo much endomaged by <hi>Spayne,</hi> as by them; or that <hi>Spayne</hi> could haue ſo ready meanes to endomage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the Hollanders; or could haue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence in either Countrey with two ſuch turbulent factions.</p>
            <p>Thus may <hi>England</hi> as well by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ingratitude to <hi>France,</hi> as by the deere purchaſed expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in it ſelfe, cleerely behould what apparence there may be of expectation of any leaſt benefite by their meanes; ſince none can be found, none be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, albeit they were ſought after with the lanterne of <hi>Diogenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore no benefits can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, either paſt or to be expected, let vs then ſee what good fortune hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe betyded ſuch as haue beene the greteſt actors in this rebellious buſines, whereby it may appeare to the World, how their endeauours haue beene plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God.</p>
            <p>The firſt man that began the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and open rebellion of Townes in Holland, was the aforenamed <hi>Monſieur de Lymmay.</hi> This man amongſt other preſents which were giuen him, when he was in <hi>England,</hi> one was a very faire great maſtiffe Dog, which he much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed; and on a tyme playing with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17459:37"/>
him, he bitte him ſo ſoare in the arme, that he could by no meanes be cured, but in the end dyed thereof, ſtarcke mad, and raging, in the Towne of <hi>Liege.</hi> And thus came he to his death by being bitten of a Dog, that had beene a wolfe vnto many Eccleſiaſticall perſons, whoſe bloud without all forme of lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or any offence by them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he had cauſed to be ſhed, aſwell in the Towne of <hi>Briel</hi> which he ſurpryzed, as in other places.</p>
            <p>The next great Actor in this ill buſynes was the Duke of <hi>Alancon</hi> alſo before mentioned. This Duke after he had in the Citty of <hi>Antwerp</hi> beene inueſted in the Duchy of <hi>Brabant,</hi> as abſolute Soueraigne; fynding not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he was to be limitted &amp; gouerned by ſuch as he accompted his ſubiects; &amp; ſeeking thereupon to make his authority more abſolute, drew cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne troopes of his ſouldiers into the Town to haue ſurpryzed it, himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17459:37"/>
with his whole army hard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, who, through the reſiſtance of the Towneſmen, were all put to the ſword. Whereupon he with his whole army (the Artillery from the walles of the Towne playing vpon him) was forced to retyre thence in extreme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and melancholy, as a defeated enemy; and in the end to returne into <hi>France,</hi> where conſidering the tricks that had by n put vpon him in <hi>England,</hi> and what diſgrace he had therby recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Flanders,</hi> on the 10. day of <hi>Iune</hi> in the yeare 1584. he dyed of conceaued griefe, in the town of <hi>Chaſtea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next and chiefeſt ſtyrrer in this buſynes, was <hi>William of Naſſaw,</hi> Prince of <hi>Ora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge,</hi> who becauſe he was the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebell, or principall Actor in this great rebellion of all other, I hold it not vnfit, before I come to ſpeak of his death,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17459:38"/>
briefly to run ouer the thinges of moſt note in his life.</p>
            <p>This Prince, as in the firſt Chapter hath byn ſayd, retyred himſelf into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> ſo ſoone as he heard of the Duk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> his demaunding the tenth pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aforeſayd, hauing bred a generall diſguſt and auerſion in the myndes of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17459:38"/>
the people; certayne ſcouts of rebellion were ſecretly imployed abroad in the Country to ſound the people about their forwardnes to reuolt. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, anſwere was returned that they were found to be the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unto ready inough, ſo they might haue a head, but who this head ſhould be, that knew they not. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> heerupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in whoſe behalfe theſe ſcouts had beene imployed, called a conſultation of ſome fyue or ſix irreligicus Politikes (for ſuch beſt fitted to be his counſellours) to conſider what religion he were beſt to be of, for of all the religions now currant he could not be; and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himſelf to be of one, all might hold him to be of none. For he had ſo caryed himſelf vntil this day, that the Catholikes held him affected to them; The Lutherans to them; The Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts to them; And the Caluiniſts alſo to them.</p>
            <p>The Catholikes tooke him for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17459:39"/>
their freind, becauſe they thought him not to hate their religion, but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently well to affect it, in regard that he had beene brought vp in it, long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it, and had made as yet no open oppoſition or profeſſion againſt it; and for that he proteſted to vndergo this buſynes for the mayntayning of their rightes and priuiledges, and to free the Countrey from that terrible exaction of the tenth penny aforeſayd.</p>
            <p>The Lutherans tooke him for their frend, becauſe they held him in hart to be of their religion, ſince he had maryed the <hi>daughter</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who was now a Lutheran, in publique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and that he muſt in reaſon keep good correſpondence with the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans of <hi>Germany,</hi> in hope of hauing ayde from them.</p>
            <p>The Anabaptiſts tooke him as greatly to fauor their religion, becauſe his Chamberlayne being the chiefeſt man about him, was an Anabaptiſt,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17459:39"/>
(called of his fellow Anabaptiſts by the name of <hi>Mardochaeus)</hi> by whoſe meanes this Prince became greatly beholding vnto them, for the loane of ſundry good ſummes of money, which he had receaued of them.</p>
            <p>The Caluiniſts thought him aſſuredly their friend, becauſe he was an enemy vnto <hi>Spayne</hi> &amp; <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and becauſe he could not but ſee them more forward in action of Rebellion, then any of the others; ſeeing <hi>Briel</hi> and other Townes were already ſurpryzed by thoſe of their Nation and Religion.</p>
            <p>The aforeſayd Counſelours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that this indifferent carriage of the Prince, could but argue a diſperſed affection, &amp; might breed many iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and factions, and wherby he could not procure to himſelfe the aſſured affection of any one ſyde to ſticke faſt vnto him; their reſolution muſt now be taken without longer delay, of which of theſe he would declare himſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17459:40"/>
to be, albeit he might promiſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and protection to the reſt. There was no great need of learned Deuins to diſpute the matter, Scriptures and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers were not important to be looked after, Faith and Conſcience had heerin no clayme, and Reaſon of State did put the Holy Ghoſt to ſilence.</p>
            <p>It was therfore firſt debated whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were beſt &amp; moſt for this Prince his aduantage to declare himſelfe a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, becauſe the face of the State was yet Catholike. To this was allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that if he ſhould ſo do by fauouring all oppoſite to the Catholikes, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes would therfore diſfauour him, ſeeing the other through his fauour would inſult vpon them: and ſo might there be danger of their returning to the obedience of the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> whom thev were ſure was of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and would mayntayne them in it. All which conſidered, it was not thought fitting for him to declare
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17459:40"/>
himſelf to be a Catholike</p>
            <p>To declare himſelf a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> was alſo thought vnſit, becauſe the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> albeit a Lutheran, was yet a freind vnto the Emperour, and the howſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and beſides the Lutherans were but flegmatike &amp; cold fellowes, and too farre offto giue him aſſiſtance, if need ſhould require.</p>
            <p>To declare himſelfe an Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, was held leſſe fitting, for albeit they had ſhewed more heat of zeale, in their greater number that had ſuffred for their religion, then any of the others; yet were they but of the meaner ſort of people, not hauing any potent perſons among them, nor any forrayne Prince or State to take their partes.</p>
            <p>In fine it was reſolued that it was moſt conuenient for him to declare himſelf a Caluiniſt, in regard of their ſtirring ſpirits, whereof they had giuen greater proof then any of the others, &amp; that there was apparence of aſſiſtance
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17459:41"/>
from <hi>England,</hi> and of good correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the <hi>Huguenots</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> Vpon this reſolution, followed ſtraight-wayes the conuerſion of this Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> vnto Caluinian-Proteſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and his new gayned greateſt friendes ſo beſtirred themſelues, that Town vpon Town rebelled eſpecially after he had by ſolemne Oath ſworne to mayntayne the Catholike Clergy in all their rights and priuiledges, and in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike exerciſe of their Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about which point yet the town of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> amongſt others, very precyſely capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated with him, and he very ſeriouſly alſo proteſted and ſwore performance of the conditions: which Oath not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he made no more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſoone after to breake, then he had done ſundry oathes before; as the great and ſolemne Oath which he tooke of Fidelity to the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> when he receaued the Order of Knight-hood of the golden Fleece; the Oath of fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17459:41"/>
which he alſo tooke at the ſayd Kings making him Lieftenant Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Holland</hi> &amp;c. beſydes his ſundry other perfidious breaches both of oaths and promiſes.</p>
            <p>And becauſe there is not any fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or honeſt dealing to be expected, where there is layd no ground of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and vertue it is the leſſe wonder that this irreligious Noble Man ſo cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in choyce of religion. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne it is, that he was at the firſt a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike; and notwithſtanding that his malice had tranſported him ſo farre, as to protect and ſhelter ſome moſt ſacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Church-robbers; yet vpon the aryuall of the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his flight into <hi>Germany,</hi> he ſent for his eldeſt ſome Philip (who was Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> next after him) at that tyme a ſtudent in the Vniuerſity of <hi>Louayne,</hi> and moſt ſtraightly charged him, to liue and dye in the Catholike Roman Religion, as the ſayd Prince hath at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17459:42"/>
tymes to diuers perſons yet lyuing proteſted; wherby it may ſeem, that at that tyme he had yet retayned ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of religion; and holding that for the beſt, commaunded his ſonne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne ſtill therin.</p>
            <p>Foure wyues he had, the firſt was a Catholyke, the ſecond was a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran, the third and fourth were Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſts; which perchance was becauſe he found no noble woman fit for him to match withall that was an Anabaptiſt, that ſo he might haue had foure wyues of foure ſeuerall Religions; yet to ſhew his great good wil vnto the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts (albeit he could not match amongſt them) he gaue them vnder his hand wryting the priuiledge &amp; freedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me for exerciſe of their religion in their own howſes, which they yet in <hi>Holland</hi> enioy.</p>
            <p>When I conſider the life and actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of this man, I wonder in my ſelf, that the blyndnes of the popular multitude,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17459:42"/>
could be ſo great, as to honor and extol him ſo highly, and to accompt him the great Patron and Protectour of their Country, that was the greateſt enemy therof that euer it had; and who was the cauſe of ſpilling ſo much bloud, aſwell of the people of his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as of other Nations; and ſuch an one as was the betrayer, &amp; tranſporter alſo thereof, vnto another Nation, as much as in him lay, who had no right or clay me thereunto.</p>
            <p>To come now to touch the end of this man, when I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, I ſay, what it was, there commeth to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance this ſaying of a Pagan Poet:
<q>
                  <l>Tyraennous Lords, that cauſe Landes to rebell,</l>
                  <l>VVithout ſome blow, can hardly come to Hell.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>About ſome foure yeares before the death of this Prince, he was for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences depriued by the ſayd King of <hi>Spayne</hi> his ſoueraigne Lord, of all the authority and power which in former tymes the ſayd King had giuen him, &amp;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17459:43"/>
proclaymed for a publike enemy vnto the King, the peace, and Weal-publike of the Countrey; and his goods &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon expoſed to open violence by publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſentence. In the end after ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to that effect, the Prince percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, what victorious ſucceſſe the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> (that then vnder the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> commanded in the <hi>Netherlands)</hi> now began to haue in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> he fled ſecretly, from <hi>Antwerp</hi> (where he had layne lurcking for a time) vnto <hi>Delft</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; for it was the greateſt prayſe (forſooth) that this valiant Captayne atchieued in theſe warres, that he did commonly put on his Armour when he was eight or ten leagues from any place of danger.</p>
            <p>Being arriued at <hi>Delft,</hi> where he thought himſelfe in greateſt ſafety, he was vpon the tenth day of Iuly in the ſame yeare 1584. ſlayne with the ſhot of a Piſtoll, by one <hi>Ealtazar Gerard</hi> (ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>âs

by laying the fault vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he might repaire his owne reputation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of gayning ſo little honour among them as he had.

            <p>He dyed without any ſigne of a Chriſtian; and being dead ſeemed ſo vgly a corſe, as euen amazed the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

His Landes were all preſently ſeized on for his debts to the Queene, whereby he was now, as much diſgraced being dead, as he would perhaps haue beene, if he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued but a little longer; and as his life was not much laudable, ſo was his death not greatly lamented.</p>

            <p>The benefits then which <hi>England</hi> might expect by continuing to take the <hi>Hollanders</hi> partes, muſt be vnderſtood to be, endles Charges, great Diſhonour, and the high Diſpleaſure of Almighty God, togeather with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſing the ſame with contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ingratitude; which are motiues to mooue mad men to be their friendes.</p>

wherof no end can be determined, is alſo out of doubt.

            <p>You ſhall then vnderſtand that about the yeare 1607. one <hi>Iacobus Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> a Doctor and profeſſor of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant

Religion at <hi>Leyden</hi> (according as it is there profeſſed) did, after that he had, diuers yeares belieued and taught as they did, begin to fall into further conſideration then before he had done of certayne points of their doctrine, and eſpecially their doctrine of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> which is, <hi>That God hath abſolutely and precyſely choſen and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned ſome people to ſaluation, and ſome to damnation, before themſelues haue either done good or euill: And that to thoſe whome God, of an abſolute will, hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Againſt this doctrine <hi>Arminius</hi> oppoſed himſelf, affirming the ſame to be contrary to the Nature of God, <hi>as repugnant to his Wiſdome, to his Iuſtice, and to his Goodnes.</hi> That it alſo is againſt the Ghoſpel, which commaundeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17459:53"/>
and beliefe, and promiſeth the grace of the holy Ghoſt, Remiſſion of ſinnes, and euerlaſting Lyfe. And that which is more, it impugneth <hi>Free will,</hi> with which, and in the which, man was by God created.
