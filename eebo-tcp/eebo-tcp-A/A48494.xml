            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which I will here give thee one Inſtance
as it is recorded by that eminent <hi>Hiſtorian</hi>
Fulgoſus, <hi>L. 8. C.</hi> 11. That <hi>Guido Earl</hi> of
<hi>Mount-ferrant</hi> being beſeiged in that City,
our <hi>Author Bonatus</hi> ſent him word, that
if ſuch a day and hour he would make a
Sally on the Enemies Camp, he ſhould give
them an abſolute Defeat, and force them to
raiſe their ſeige and quit the place, but ſhould
himſelf receive a dangerous (but not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal)
wound in the thigh, The Earl took
his Councell, made his Sally on the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
providing himſelf of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
in caſe of a wound, and according to the
prediction, though vaſtly inferior in numbers,
obtained a moſt ſignal and intire Victory,

               <p>But Firſt of all There are ſome things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be premiſed; as the fit manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
a Queſtion, and divers other Points
to be obſerved in giving Judgment.</p>
               <p>Of which ſort of Conſiderations we ſhall reck
on up no fewer then One Hundred Forty and
Six, which though 'tis impoſſible they ſhould
happenor be obſerved altogether; yet they all
deſerve to be known, and without them an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer
ſhall never be able to give true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Judgment. But before we Treat diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of them, it will be convenient to ſay a little
of the right way or manner how a Queſtion
ſhould be propoſed for to Judge of things to
come, is no caſie Task, nor indeed can it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be exactly performed; but we may come
near the Truth, and differ from it only in ſome
ſmal time or circumſtances; which difficulty
ſhould not at all diſcourage us from ſtudying, and
endeavouring to obtain as great a Knowledge
therein, as Humane minds are capable of; for
ſince Inferiors are governed by Superiors (as all
Agree) and that the Nature and Diſpoſition
of ſuch Superiors may be known by their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are now exactly found out by the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42147:5"/>
Learned in Aſtronomy; we may thence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
arrive at an Ability of Judging of
things to come: That is, Declare what will
happen by or from ſuch their motions, and by
conſequence truly foretell future Accidents; for
this Art has it's peculiar Rules and Aphoriſms,
and it's End is Judgment, which takes off their
objection who ſay that Aſtrology is nothing worth;
for it would not be an Art, unleſs it had its
proper precepts; but that it is an Art we have
ſufficiently proved elſewhere, and the ſame is
generally acknowledged; and its end is to give
Judgment, as aforeſaid, which are of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
Imprinted on Inferiors by the Motions of
the Superior Bodies, and their Qualities and
Effects in or upon the ſame.</p>

to Inquire, 'tis not enough, unleſs the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Bodies ſympathize therewith; nor is
ſuch motion of the Stars enough, unleſs by
the Election of his will the perſon does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
Inquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Second</hi> Conſiderable is (what we hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at before) the method or manner every
one ought to obſerve that inquires of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer;
which is, that when he intends to
take an Artiſt's Judgment of things paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or to come, he ſhould firſt with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
Spirit pray unto the Lord, from whom
proceeds the ſucceſs of every lawful enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
that he would grant him the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of thoſe things, of the Truth of which
he would be reſolv'd: And then let him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
himſelf to the Aſtrologer with a ſerious
intent of being ſatisfied in ſome certain and
particular doubt, and this not on trifling
occaſions, or light ſudden motions, much leſs
in matters bafe or unlawful, as many ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
people uſe to do; but in matters of
honeſt importance, and ſuch as have poſſeſt
and diſturbed his mind for the ſpace of a day
and night or longer; unleſs in ſudden acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
which admit not of delay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42147:6"/>
Thoſe that take this ſober Courſe, ſhall
find the Truth in what they inquire after; but
whoſoever do otherwiſe, deceive both themſelves
and the Artiſt; for a fooliſh Querent may cauſe
a wiſe Reſpondent to erre, which brings a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
upon Art amongſt inconſiderate people; when
as the Aſtrologer is not blameable, but the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran
ſilly Querent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Third,</hi> Is to conſider how many
waies Planets operate upon Inferior Bodies,
according to the divers Qualities of their
Motions; there being Sixteen different wayes
of ſuch their Operations and Effects in all
things that are either wholly or in part per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
or deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Fourth,</hi> Is to conſider particularly
theſe ſeveral Sixteen wayes, and what are the
aſſiſting cauſes that help forwards things to
perfection, and what thoſe are that deſtroy
things after they are perfected: Now of
theſe the firſt is Profection, or an Advance
of or in things; which the Philoſophers call
<hi>Alchecohol.</hi> 2. Detriment, which they call
<hi>Aliber.</hi> 3. Conjunction or Reverſion,
which they call <hi>Alitiſall.</hi> 4. Seperation,
which they call <hi>Alnichirat.</hi> 5. Tranſlation
of light, which they call <hi>Annecad.</hi> 6. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
which they call <hi>Algemei.</hi> 7. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,
which they call <hi>Almana.</hi> 8. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
called <hi>Alcohol.</hi> 9. Being void of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42147:7"/>
courſe, called <hi>Gaſtalcobol.</hi> 10. Permiſſion,
called <hi>Galaalocir.</hi> 11. The reſtoring or giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Vertue or Diſpoſition, called <hi>Alteat.</hi>
12. The with-drawing of Vertue, called
<hi>Dalpha Alchoa.</hi> 13. The with-drawer or
driver away of Diſpoſition, called <hi>Daff ared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</hi>
14. Fortitude, <hi>Alcoevah.</hi> 15. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſity
<hi>Adirof.</hi> The 16th. Is the ſtate of the
Moon, called <hi>Gnaymel,</hi> or the Moon ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
which the Ancients generally hold
to be of ill ſignification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fifth,</hi> Is to conſider, How many
wayes the Moon comes to be ſo ill affected,
which are generally reckoned to be Ten, but
in my opinion Seven more may be added,
whereby hindrances and damage happen in
all Queſtions, Nativities, Elections, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whatſoever: The Firſt is, When the
Moon is Combuſt, that is to ſay under the
Suns Beams, which is counted from 15 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of the Body of the Sun as ſhe applies
to him to 12 degrees diſtance from him as
ſhe is ſeperating from him; and the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is greater when ſhe is going to the Sun
than when ſhe is going from him; becauſe
as ſhe goes off, when ſhe is got five degrees
diſtant, ſhe is ſaid to be eſcaped; though not
wholly freed: As when a Feavor hath left
a Man, he is ſaid to be recovered, although
he be Weake and Faint, becauſe he is ſecure
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42147:7"/>
now that he ſhall obtaine his health again.
The 2d. Is when ſhe is in the degrees of her
Deſcenſions, that is in the 3d. degree of
<hi>Scorpio,</hi> or in any part of <hi>Scorpio</hi> or <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi>
or injoyned with any Planet that is in
her or its own Decenſions as if ſhe be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Sun, who is in <hi>Scorpio</hi> or <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi>
or in his proper Deſcenſion, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary</hi>
or <hi>Libra, viz.</hi> in its <hi>19th.</hi> degree or
in any part of <hi>Libra;</hi> or ſhould be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Mars,</hi> and he be in <hi>Libra</hi> or <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
or in the 28th. degree, or in any part
of <hi>Cancer;</hi> and ſo with any other Planet
or Planets reſpectively. The 3d. Is when
ſhe is poſited in any of the Combuſt degrees,
of which the worſt are thoſe 12. degrees
which are before the degree which is directly
oppoſite to the degree in which the Sun is,
wherever ſhe ſhall happen to be. The 4th.
Is when ſhe is in Conjunction, Oppoſition, or
Square to either of the Infortunes <hi>Saturn</hi> or
<hi>Mars,</hi> without a perfect reception; for
with one it hinders but little, but in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places 'tis a grand Impediment, both in
the ſaid Aſpects and alſo in Corporal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
ſave only where the Infortune
ſhall have Two of his ſmaller Dignities, as
with <hi>Saturn</hi> in the 4. laſt degrees of <hi>Aries</hi>
or <hi>Gemini,</hi> in each of which he has a Term
and a Triplicity; or with <hi>Mars</hi> in the laſt 10.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42147:8"/>
degrees of <hi>Piſces,</hi> where he has a Face and
a Triplicity; and ſo in any other Sign or
place. The 5th. Is when ſhe is with the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons</hi>
Head or with the <hi>Dragons</hi> Tail, that
is within Twelve degrees of either of them,
becauſe that is the place where ſhe is eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
The 6th. Is when ſhe is in <hi>Gemini</hi> which
is the Twelfth from her own Houſe. The
7th. Is when ſhe is in the ends of Signs, which
are all Terms of the Infortunes, except the
laſt 6. degrees of <hi>Leo,</hi> which belong to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter;</hi>
but in the firſt eight ſhe is weakened,
becauſe they are Terms of <hi>Saturn.</hi> If it be
objected by the ſame reaſon ſhe muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedited
likewiſe in the firſt 6. degrees of
<hi>Cancer,</hi> ſince they are Terms of <hi>Mars;</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
no, becauſe <hi>Cancer</hi> is her own Houſe
and greateſt Fortitude. The 8th. Is when
ſhe is in the 6th. 8th. 9th. or 12th. Houſes
(not in reception with the Aſcendent) or
joyned to any Planet that is in any of them,
or poſited in the Third Houſe, becauſe it is
Cadent from Augies; yet becauſe the ſame
is ſaid to be her joy (or that ſhe delights
therein) ſhe is not afflicted there ſo much
as in other Cadent Houſes. The 9th. Is when
ſhe is between the 15. degree of <hi>Libra</hi> and
the 15. degree of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> which 30. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
are called the Combuſt way. The 10th.
When ſhe is void of courſe, that is not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42147:8"/>
joyned to any Planet by Body or Aſpect, or
in that condition when they call her Ferall
or Deſart, that is in a place where ſhe has not
any Dignity. The 11th. When ſhe is ſlow of
courſe, becauſe then ſhe may be compared
to a Planet Retrograde. The 12th. When ſhe
is in want of light, ſo that no part or very
little of her is ſeen, which happens about the
end of the Lunar Month. The 13th. When
ſhe is beſieged by the two Infortunes impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her. The 14th. If ſhe be in Azimene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
The 15th. If in Pitted degrees. The
16th. If in Smoaky degrees. The 17th. and
laſt, Is when ſhe is poſited in thoſe degrees
which are called dark: To know and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
all which you have Tables com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
in moſt Books of Aſtrology.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Conſideration, Is to regard
another manner whereby Planets are dibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
or weakened and afflicted, not much
different from the former; which comes to
paſs Ten wayes. The 1. When a Planet is
Candent from Angles or from the Aſcendant,
ſo that he doth not behold the ſame. The
2. When a Planet is Retrograd. The 3. If they
be Combuſt, that is within 15 degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or after the Sun; the lower Planets are
more debilitated being behind the Sun, and
leſs before him, when they are direct; but
when retrograde the contrary. 4. When
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42147:9"/>
any of them is in Oppoſition, Corporal
Conjunction, or Square of either or both
the Infortunes, without Reception. 5. When
they are beſieged by the Infortunes, ſo as
to ſeparate from one and be joyned to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
without perfect Reception of
Houſe, Exaltation, or two of the ſmaller
Dignities, which are <hi>Term, Triplicity,</hi> and
<hi>Face.</hi> 6. When a Planet is joyned to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in his Declenſion or Fall; that is, in
Oppoſition to its own Houſe or Exaltation.
7. When it is joyned to a Planet Cadent
from the Aſcendent, or ſeparates from a
Planet that did receive him, and is joyned
to one that doth not. 8. When a Planet is
Perigrine, that is, In a place where he hath
not any Dignity; or being one of the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
is followed by the Sun, or being of the
Inferiors when it follows the Sun. 9. When
a Planet is with the <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Tail</hi> of the
<hi>Dragon,</hi> without Latitude. 10. When a
Planet weakens it ſelf, that is, when it is in
the <hi>Seventh Houſe</hi> from its own, Feral, or not
in Reception. Theſe are the Impediments
of the Planets, that cauſe Hinderances De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
and Miſchiefs in Nativities, Queſtions,
Elections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which thou oughteſt to
be well acquainted with. There are ſome
more that ſeem neceſſary to be known, but
to avoid tediouſneſs and confuſion, I ſhall
at preſent omit them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:42147:9"/>
The <hi>Seventh Conſideration,</hi> Is to beware
of thoſe Caſes wherein the Aſtrologer is
ſubject to err and miſtake; of which the
Learned have named Four: 1. When the
Querent is ſo ſilly that he knows not how
to ask, nor what he would have. 2. When
the time for which the Figure is erected, is
miſtaken. 3. When the Artiſt knows not
whether the Sun be gone off the line of the
Mid-heaven, or be ſtill upon it; or be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
or before it. 4. When the Fortunes and
Infortunes ſhall be of equal ſtrength; at
which time thou therefore oughteſt not to
receive any Queſtion. But in my opinion
there may well be added yet three wayes
more, wherein the Aſtrologer will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to err: 1. When the Querent comes
onely to try him, or put a trick upon him;
as many do, ſaying, <hi>Let us go to ſuch an
Aſtrologer, and ask him ſuch a thing, and
ſee if he can tell us the truth or not.</hi> Juſt
as the Jews propounded Queſtions to our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, not ſo much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
as to tempt and enſnare him.
2. Wherein the Artiſt will be liable to err
in, is when the Querent does not ask out of
a ſerious or ſettled intention; as ſome do
when they meet an Aſtrologer by chance,
or go to him on other buſineſs; on a ſudden
they think of ſomething, and ſo ask as it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42147:10"/>
were by the by; wherein 'tis a thouſand to
one but miſtakes happen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thou may'ſt be ready to ſay,</hi> How
ſhall I know whether the Querent come out of
a ſolid intention, or onely to try me? <hi>To which
I anſwer,</hi> That it ſeems a very abſtruſe and
difficult point, perfectly to find out; but this
I have often experienced and found true, <hi>viz.</hi>
I obſerved the hour of the Queſtion, and if the
Aſcendent then happened very near the end of
one Sign and beginning of another, ſo that it
ſeemed as between both; I ſaid they did not
ask ſeriouſly, or that they came to try me; and
I have had many that have thereupon confeſt
what I ſaid to be true, and began to think
that I knew more than before they believed.
<hi>For in ſuch Caſes I uſe to ſay,</hi> Pray Friend
do not trouble me, unleſs you ask ſeriouſly; for
I ſuſpect that you would put a trick upon me,
by not propoſing this Queſtion as you ought;
however if you will give me trouble for your
pleaſure, be pleaſed to give me likewiſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for my pains; <hi>and immediately, if
there were any deceit intended, away they
went. Another,</hi> viz. <hi>a third way whereby
an Aſtrologer may erre, Is when the Lord
of the Aſendant and Lord of the Hour are
not the ſame, nor of the ſame Triplicity;
or be not of the ſame Complection with
the Aſcendant; for then the Queſtion is not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42147:10"/>
Radical, as I have frequently found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
And this I have recited, that
thou may'ſt know for what perſons thou
ſhould'ſt undertake to give Judgment; for
as one ſays,</hi> The iſſue of the thing is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ſolicitude of the Querent, and as
he comes in neceſſity, as ſad, thoughtful, and
hoping that thou art able and knoweſt how to
ſatisfie him the truth of the matter; <hi>and in
ſuch caſe thou may'ſt ſecurely venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Queſtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Eighth Conſideration</hi> is, To mind
how many of the aforeſaid manners or
points neceſſary to be uſed and heeded in
giving Judgments, thou haſt to conſider;
and they are thirty: that is to ſay, ſixteen
impediments of the Moon, ten of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Planets, as hath been ſaid; and beſides
all thoſe the Planets ſeveral Joys, which are
four, of which the firſt is the Houſe which
each Planet does delight in, as <hi>Mercury</hi> in
the Aſcendant, the <hi>Moon</hi> in the third, <hi>Venus</hi>
in the fifth, <hi>Mars</hi> in the ſixth, the <hi>Sun</hi> in the
ninth, <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the eleventh, <hi>Saturn</hi> in the
twelfth. The ſecond is, When a Planet is
in a Sign he delights in, as <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Sagittary, Mars</hi> in <hi>Scorpio,
Sol</hi> in <hi>Leo, Venus</hi> in <hi>Taurus, Mercury</hi> in
<hi>Virgo,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Cancer.</hi> The third
is, When Diurnal Planets, as <hi>Saturn, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42147:11"/>
Sol,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> are in Diurnal
Houſes in the Eaſt and Oriental of the Sun
near the Horoſcope; and Nocturnal Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
as <hi>Mars, Venus, Luna,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi>
are in Nocturnal Houſes in the Weſt, and
Occidental of the Sun; eſpecially near the
Cuſp of the Seventh. The fourth is, When
the three Superiors, <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> or
<hi>Mars,</hi> are in Maſculine Quarters; which are
counted from the Cuſp of the tenth Houſe
to the Cuſp of the Aſcendant, and from the
Cuſp of the fourth Houſe to the Cuſp of
the ſeventh Houſe; and when the Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines,
<hi>viz. Venus</hi> or the <hi>Moon,</hi> are in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine
Quarters, which are from the Cuſp
of the Aſcendant to the Cuſp of the fourth
Houſe, and from the Cuſp of the ſeventh to
the Cuſp of the tenth. As for <hi>Mercury</hi> he
delights when with Maſculine Planets in
Maſculine Quarters, but with Feminine
Planets in Feminine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ninth Conſideration</hi> is, To take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the ſeveral wayes as well ſecret as
manifeſt, good and evil, whereby things
are helpt or hindred to be done or not done;
and of theſe there are one and twenty in
Number: 1. A moſt ſtrong ſecret Helper.
2. A very ſtrong ſecret Helper. 3. A ſtrong
Helper. 4. A weak ſecret Helper. 5. A
weaker ſecret Helper. 6. A moſt ſecret
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42147:11"/>
Helper. 7. A moſt ſtrong manifeſt Helper
8. A very ſtrong manifeſt Helper. 9. A ſtrong
manifeſt Helper. 10. A weak manifeſt Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
12. A moſt weak manifeſt Helper.
13. A moſt ſtrong ſecret Hinderer. 14. A
very ſtrong ſecret Hinderer. 15. A ſtrong
ſecret Hinderer. 16. A weak ſecret Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.
17. A weaker ſecret Hinderer.
18. A moſt weak ſecret Hinderer. 19. A
moſt ſtrong manifeſt Hinderer. 20. A very
ſtrong manifeſt Hinderer. And 21. A ſtrong
manifeſt Hinderer. All which we ſhall treat
particularly, the ſame being a ſecret of
ſecrets. In the Judicial part of Aſtrology,
which the Ancients did not regard, nor
have ſaid any thing plainly of it that I find,
ſave onely that <hi>Haly</hi> ſeems to have toucht
a little upon it in his Expoſition of the 23th.
of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s <hi>Centiloquium;</hi> nor do I believe
they omitted thoſe things out of Ignorance,
but rather thorow diſuſe or fear of being too
tedious, or burthening the minds of their
Readers or Auditors: For they were wont
to judge according as they found the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
diſpoſed in Houſes and Signs, their
Fortitudes and Debilities, together with
the part of Fortune, and ſome few other
things: But thou oughteſt to conſider in
thy Judgments, not onely what they did,
but alſo all other circumſtances that thou
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42147:12"/>
canſt: For when thou do'ſt erect a Figure,
thou ſhould'ſt firſt find the Significator of
the thing inquired after, or to be underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and ſee if any of the Fixed Stars of his
own nature be in either of his Houſes, or
in his Exaltation, or in Conjunction with
him to a minute: for then ſuch Star ſhall
ſo far help the Significator, that the thing
ſhall be accompliſh'd and effected, even
beyond the Querents hopes; and this is a
moſt ſtrong ſecret Helper: For the Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
may well wonder how it comes to paſs.
Now if the ſame Star ſhould be in the ſame
degree with the Significator from one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
to 15 before him or 5 behind him; it
will ſtill help him, but not ſo much; and
this we call a very ſtrong ſecret Helper:
but if it be with him in the ſame degree, but
above 16 minutes diſtance and within 50,
it will ſomewhat help, yet this leſs; and
this we call in the Poſitive degree onely a
ſtrong ſecret Helper. If it be in the ſame
degree with the Significator, in a place
where he has two of his ſmaller Dignities,
in the very ſame minute, or within 16 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
it will help him, yet leſs, and then
'tis a weak ſecret Helper; from 16 to 50
min. ſtill leſs; and then 'tis a weaker ſecret
Helper: but if it be with the Significator in
a place where he has no dignities at all, it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42147:12"/>
will ſtill help, but as it were inſenſibly;
and this we call a moſt weak ſecret Helper.
The like we may ſay on the contrary of
thoſe things that prejudice, fruſtrate, and
hinder buſineſs: For if a Planet, which is a
Significator of any thing, being in a place
where he has not any Dignities, ſhall be
joyned with one of the Fixed Stars of a
contrary nature, it will weaken him, and
not ſuffer the thing to come to paſs; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
otherwiſe by the Figure it ſeemed
never ſo probable: ſo that for want of
heeding this, the Artiſt often gets diſcredit,
and raiſes a ſcandal on the Art it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the ignorant; and this is a moſt
ſtrong ſecret Hinderer: Whereas if the
ſame Star be remote above 16 minutes
from the Significator, it will weaken him,
but not altogether ſo much; whence it may
be called onely a very ſtrong ſecret Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.
And ſo downwards thorow all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in the ſame manner as we ſaid of the
Helpers or Aſſiſtant Cauſes reſpectively.</p>

                  <p>The ſeveral Modes before-mentioned are
thus to be known and diſtinguiſhed, A
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42147:13"/>
moſt ſtrong manifeſt Helper or Adjuvant
Cauſe, is when the Planet which is Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator
of a thing, is in his own Houſe: in an
Angle on the very minute of the Cuſp, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
ſwift of courſe, in reception, and
free from all affliction and impediment;
which moſt ſeldom happens.</p>
                  <p>A very ſtrong manifeſt Helper, is when
the Significator is in his Houſe or Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in an Angle, within a degree or two of
the Cuſp, free from impediment, and in
Reception; which very ſeldom happens.</p>
                  <p>A ſtrong manifeſt Helper is when the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator
is in an Angle in his Houſe or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation,
within 3 degrees before the Cuſp,
or 5 after it.</p>
                  <p>A weak manifeſt Helper is where a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
is in two of his leſſer Dignities in an
Angle within 5 degrees before or 15 after
it; or is in his Houſe or Exaltation in a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Houſe free from Affliction.</p>
                  <p>A weaker open Helper is when the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator
is in his own Houſe or Exaltation,
or two of his leſſer Dignities, but in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Houſe of the Figure, yet beholding
the Aſcendant.</p>
                  <p>A moſt weak open Helper is when the
Significator is in ſome of his greater Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
or two of his leſſer, not beholding
the Aſcendant; or in one of his leſſer Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42147:13"/>
onely beholding the ſame, or joyn'd
to a Planet that beholds the ſame, and has
ſome Dignities therein.</p>
                  <p>A moſt ſtrong open Hinderer is when the
Significator is in a place where he hath no
dignity, no delight is not received; beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the two Infortunes, cadent from an
Angle, and from the Aſcendant; and ſo
much the worſe, if joyned with any of the
Fixed Stars, of a miſchievous nature,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may be other both adjuvant and
obſtructing cauſes, beſides what we have
mentioned, both open and ſecret, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Conjunctions of Planets and
their Aſpects, too tedious here to diſcourſe
of. Nor ſhall I here enlarge on all thoſe
before-mentioned, but muſt aſſure thee
that this Ninth Conſideration carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
will be of great uſe in raiſing a true
and wary Judgment; eſpecially if thou haſt
alwayes a diligent Eye to the Moon: for
ſhe of all the Planets has the greateſt ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and correſpondence with inferiour
things, both in general and particular; as
well the ſpecies of the kinds as the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals
of the Species, with winds, to paſs
by her daily effects which ſhe cauſes in all
things here, and frequent revolutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Elements and Elementary Bodies,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42147:14"/>
by reaſon of the nearneſs of her Orb to the
Earth, and ſmaller Circle than any other
Planet; ſo that ſhe ſeems a <hi>Mediatrix</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Superior and Inferior Bodies.</p>
                  <p>And as we ſee that in the New Moon
ſhe appears ſmall, thin, and little, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
her light gradually increaſes, till
all that part of her body towards us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
repleniſht with luſtre; and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
it decayes by inſenſible degrees, till ſhe
totally diſappears: juſt ſo do all bodies
both of things Rational, Irrational, and
Vegetative; as Men grow until they are
compleated to their determinate ſtature,
and then droop and decline continually,
till their life is ended; and ſo of all other
things: Hence 'tis neceſſary to make the
Moon concerned in the Signification of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Queſtion, Nativity, Enterprize, and
Buſineſs, and her good condition to ſhew
the good iſſue of the thing; and ſo on the
contrary. For her Vertue and Power is
ſuch and ſo great, <hi>That if the Lord of the
Aſcendant or other Significator of a buſineſs
be ſo weak and afflicted, that he cannot bring
it about and compleat it as he ought; if ſhe be
but ſtrong, it ſhall notwithſtanding be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed:
For ſhe is the School-miſtriſs of all
things, the Bringer down of all the Planets
Influences, and a kind of an</hi> Inter-nuncio
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42147:14"/>
                     <hi>between them; carrying their Vertues from
one to the other, by receiving the diſpoſition of
one Planet and bearing it to another.</hi> And
ſome have thought that ſhe does this at all
times, of which opinion was that Tyrant
<hi>Cylinus de Romano,</hi> viz. <hi>That when ſhe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates
from one planet, ſhe takes the vertue
and carries it to another, committing the ſame
to the firſt that ſhe can meet with.</hi> And ſome
have imagined that <hi>Zael</hi> ſaid the ſame,
but his meaning was not abſolutely ſo;
for he believed, <hi>That the Moon did bear
what was committed to her; but if it were not
ſo given or committed to her, ſhe could not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
any thing to any;</hi> to which I aſſent: for
when the Moon is joyned to any planet
that receives her, then that planet commits
its diſpoſition to her, who carries it with
her, and beſtows it on that planet whom
ſhe firſt meets with in any of her dignities,
and not to another; according to that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſme,
<hi>A planet gives nothing in a place
where he has promiſed nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tenth Conſideration,</hi> Is warily to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
what Fixed Stars may either help or
hinder the matter in queſtion; for they have
oftentimes great power, and lead the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
ſometimes into error: and let the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
be ſure to conſider the places of the Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42147:15"/>
Stars, as they are in the preſent age care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
reduced.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eleventh Conſideration,</hi> Is to take
notice of the Malevolent planets, and what
they ſignifie; for <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
bad, <hi>Saturn</hi> for exceſs of cold, and
<hi>Mars</hi> for exceſs of heat; not that either
of them is really hot or cold, but virtually
ſo; and theſe are their effects. And ſo
they ſignifie evil and damage and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
unleſs they receive the Significator
or the Moon by Houſe, Exaltation, or two
of their ſmaller Dignities; or ſhall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
be Significators; for then they will
bridle in their malice, and not weaken or
hinder him whom they receive, with what
Aſpect ſoever they behold him; but if they
do not receive, their malice is increaſed;
and ſo much the more if they be in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or ſquare; for in ſextill or trine the
miſchief is leſs: Yet <hi>Zaell</hi> ſeems to ſay,
<hi>That the Infortunes lay aſide or reſtrain their
malice, where they are in trine or ſextill;</hi>
but his meaning was onely that they were
not then ſo violent, and intended not that
their malice was wholly abated.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Twelfth Conſideration,</hi> Is to behold
the Fortunes, and ſee what they ſignifie;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42147:15"/>
for <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are Fortunes by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and being temperate, are ſaid to be
without any malice, becauſe they do hurt
to none, unleſs now and then by accident;
which is beſide their intention and very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
for they make their impreſſions tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately
and profitably, and alwayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
to help both their own and others,
whether they receive them or not; but ſo
much the better if they receive them: and
their trine or ſextill is better and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
than their ſquare, and their
ſquare than their oppoſitions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Thirteenth Conſideration,</hi> Is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Sun and his Significators, for he
is alſo called a Fortune, and is ſo, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
aſpect he ſhall be beheld by, unleſs it
be oppoſition; but by conjunction he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
an Infortune, becauſe then he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
every Star that is ſo in conjunction
with him, combuſt and unfortunate; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the ſame ſhall be in the heart of the
Sun, and there every Star is fortified.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fourteenth Conſideration,</hi> Is to mind
<hi>Mercury</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> and what planets
they are joyned with, becauſe they will
have the ſame ſignifications with thoſe
with whom they are ſo joyned; being of a
convertible nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:42147:16"/>
The <hi>Fifteenth Conſideration,</hi> Is to regard
the ſeveral wayes in general whereby pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
make impreſſions on theſe inferior
things, which are two, one good and the
other bad; for the Fortunes have power of
imprinting good naturally, and the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
as naturally ſhower down ill impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
whence thou mayſt where ever thou
ſeeſt the Fortunes, hope for good; and
when thou beholdeſt the Malevolents, fear
miſchief, unleſs the ſame be reſtrained as
aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sixteenth Conſideration,</hi> Is to take
notice whether the planet that is Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of any thing, be afflicted by either of
the Malevolents; which is when one of
them caſts his rayes upon the rayes of ſuch
Significators, according to the quantity of
their Orbs: and whil'ſt he ſo continues
with his rayes or light under thoſe of the
Malevolent, ſuch Significator is ſaid to be
impedited, hindered, or afflicted, till the
Malevolent have paſſed him: and <hi>Zael</hi>
ſays, <hi>After the ill planet has paſt the planet
he did afflict one whole degree, the planet ſhall
be ſaid to be freed from him.</hi> But I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think, that after the Malevolent is
paſt him one minute, he may be ſaid to be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42147:16"/>
free and eſcaped; for afterwards he can
onely frighten him: True it is, he raiſes a
greater fear when he is paſt him onely one
minute, than when he is gone by a whole
degree: but yet even then it is ſuch a kind
of fear as is not altogether without ſome
glimmering of hope. As thus, One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to go into a Battel, inquires whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ſhall return from thence ſafe and
ſound or not? And the <hi>Aſcendant</hi> is <hi>Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>
13 degrees, and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the 7th. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and 54 min. of <hi>Aquary,</hi> in the 9th.
joyned with <hi>Saturn;</hi> who is likewiſe in 7
degr. 53 min. of <hi>Aquary;</hi> ſo that <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
is now ſeperated from <hi>Saturn,</hi> who was
Lord of the Houſe of Death one minute;
whence it appears that he ſhould have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that Engagement by reaſon of the
Conjunction, and was in peril of death
and a kind of deſperate fear that he ſhould
be ſlain by his Enemies, and ſhall be purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them ſo that he ſhall ſeem not able to
eſcape, and they ſhall often lay hands on
him; but at laſt he ſhall get from them and
make his eſcape, even beyond his own
hopes; and all becauſe <hi>Mercury</hi> is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from <hi>Saturn.</hi> And <hi>Zael</hi> ſaith, <hi>That
if a Malevolent planet that would hinder
any buſineſs, be cadent from the Aſcendant,
ſo that he cannot behold it, he cannot really
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42147:17"/>
hinder the matters; but onely puts the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
concerned into terrors and frights about
it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Seventeenth Conſideration,</hi> Is to
view whether the planet that is Significator,
be ſafe and proſperous, that is free from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
affliction from the Infortunes; and one
of the Fortunes caſts his beams or light on
beams of ſuch Significator; for then ſhall
that planet be ſaid to be ſafe and guarded;
till the Fortune is paſt by the ſpace of one
minute, and ſignifies the perfection of the
thing. But after he has paſt him one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
it will not be perfected or accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed;
for it onely raiſes hopes, as (we ſaid)
the Malevolent in the like caſe could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but create fear; yet is ſuch a hope as
the Querent will believe and fancy himſelf
as it were certain, yet not without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of doubt: As for example, A Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is propoſed of ſome weighty and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
buſineſs, whether it will be done and
brought to paſs or not? And 17 degrees of
<hi>Scorpio</hi> aſcends, and <hi>Mars</hi> is 12 degrees 13
min. of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in 12 deg. and
14 min. of <hi>Capricorn;</hi> ſo that <hi>Venus</hi> is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Mars</hi> by a trine, and receives him
in her Houſe, who likewiſe receives her in
his Exaltation; ſo that the Querent thinks,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42147:17"/>
and all others concerned verily believe
that it would be accompliſhed by that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of perfect friendſhip; in which flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hopes they continue till <hi>Venus</hi> hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the aſpect of <hi>Mars</hi> one whole degree;
but at laſt the buſineſs comes to juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all, becauſe <hi>Venus</hi> was paſt <hi>Mars</hi>
one minute at the time of the Queſtion
propoſed: yet may a thing poſſibly in ſuch
a caſe be brought to paſs, but not without
extraordinary labour and trouble. And
here likewiſe <hi>Zaell</hi> affirms, <hi>That if the
Fortune be cadent from the Aſcendant, ſo that
it cannot behold the ſame, it onely flatters
with ſplendid hopes, but never compleats the
buſineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eighteenth Conſideration,</hi> Is to take
notice when a planet is in the Angles of the
Infortunes, for unleſs theſe receive him
there, he ſhall be ſaid to be in an ill conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in ſtraits and troubles; as a man
on whom ſome have made an aſſault; who
has many to combate with and none to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
or take his part; or like one that ſtrives
againſt the ſtream, or falls into a deep
pool, and knows not how to ſwim; and
yet by thruſting out his hands and feet, may
obtain the bank and eſcape; though this
ſeldom happens.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:42147:18"/>
Now a planet is ſaid to be in the Angles
of a Malevolent, when the Malevolent or
Infortune, <hi>viz. Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> is in one
Sign, and the other planet in the fourth,
ſeventh, or tenth from him; as if <hi>Mars</hi> be
in <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in <hi>Cancer, Libra,</hi> or
<hi>Capricorn,</hi> he is ſaid to be in his Angles: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the like of their Corporeal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.
But if there be a reception, he
does not afflict; for reception abates all
malice, as we have ſaid elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Nineteenth Conſideration,</hi> Is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Moon if ſhe be void of courſe,
for then it ſignifies an impediment to the
thing in queſtion; it will not come to a
good end, nor be accompliſhed: but the
Querent ſhall be forc'd to deſiſt with ſhame
and loſs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Twentieth Conſideration,</hi> Is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
whether the Moon or Significator be
joyned to any of the planets, for thence
you muſt derive your judgement of what is
like to happen in the buſineſs. Take notice
therefore whether the planet to which the
Moon or Significator joyns, receives them;
for then there will be a good laudable end:
and the matter will be accompliſht with
ſucceſs, if the receiver be a Fortune. But
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42147:18"/>
if there be no reception, yet if the Moon or
Significator ſhall give vertue to that planet,
the thing will ſtill come to paſs. But if it
be an Infortune; though they do not give
him vertue, yet without a reception it will
not do; but with a reception, if he be not
afflicted, it ſignifies a good end of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though not without much labour and
tediouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>The 21 Conſideration is, To ſee from
what planet the Moon ſeparates; for that
ſignifies what is paſt of the buſineſs: as
from a Fortune the good, from an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
the ill that hath been.</p>
                  <p>The 22 Conſideration is, To note which
of the planets the Moon is now joyned to,
for that ſignifies what is now preſent; and
from thence we muſt judge of the preſent
ſtate of any matter.</p>
                  <p>The 23 Conſideration is, To behold to
whom the Moon is now joyning, ſo as her
Conjunction is not yet compleated; for
that ſignifies what is to come; wherefore if
thou wouldſt judge of a thing, which as
yet is not, but 'tis hoped will hereafter be
brought to paſs, 'tis neceſſary then thou
ſhouldeſt ſee to whom the Moon will next
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42147:19"/>
joyn; and according to her Significations,
judge whether good or evil</p>
                  <p>The 24 Conſideration is, To note whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the planet who is Significator, be in his
Declenſion, for then it cauſes a hinderance
to every thing thereby ſignified, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and grief about it; and if the Queſtion
be about a priſon wherein the querent fears
he ſhall be put; it ſignifies he ſhall be caſt
into the ſame together with diſgrace and
prejudice; and if the Queſtion concerus
one already in Priſon, it ſignifies a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
confinement and more affliction then
he believes.</p>
                  <p>The 25 Conſideration is, Whether the
Planet that is Significator be Retrograde,
or Stationary to Retrogradation; for then
it ſignifies miſchief and damage, diſcord,
contradiction, and going backwards with
damage; yet being ſtationary, is not ſo
bad, as being retrogaade: For the laſt
notes the miſchief to be as it were preſent
and in being. But being ſtationary, notes
that 'tis paſt and over.</p>
                  <p>The 26 Conſideration is, Whether the
Significator be in his ſecond ſtation, that is
towards Direction: for that ſignifies alſo
hinderance and evil, which already hath
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42147:19"/>
been and is paſt; yet ſome ſay that this
ſecond ſtation is as good as direction: but
that is onely a way of ſpeaking, as when
one hath been ſick and begins to grow well,
we ſay he is recovered and ſound, which
is not ſimply true, but ſomewhat near it:
for as the firſt ſtation is not ſo bad as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trogradation,
ſo the ſecond ſtation is not
ſo good as direction.</p>
                  <p>The 27 Conſideration is, Whether the
Infortunes are the Significators of any
thing; for if they ſignifie ill, the evil will
be much augmented, and if good, it will
be much diminiſhed, abated, imperfect, and
with difficulty; ſo that the party will ſcarce
think his buſineſs done, unleſs by chance
they be in a very good condition and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
diſpoſed.</p>
                  <p>The 28 Conſideration is, Whether the
Significator be ſlow of Courſe, for then it
delays the effect; and if it be in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of any thing, retards it, ſo that it will
ſcarce ever be finiſhed: Beſides, things
proceed ſlowly, whoſe Significators are
poſited in Sagittary, Capricorn, Aquary, or
Piſces; or who are the Lords of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be ſlow of courſe; in Aries or
Scorpio they are not quite ſo dilatory. In
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42147:20"/>
Leo they haſten buſineſs, more in Taurus or
Libra, but moſt of all in Gemini or
Virgo.</p>
                  <p>The 29 Conſideration is, Whether the
Moon be joyned to any planet by body or
aſpect exactly to a minute; for that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the preſent ſtate of the things; and
from that minute obſerve what planet ſhe
joyns next, for he ſhall be Significator of
all that ſhall happen of that thing; as the
planet ſhe was laſt before with, was of
what is already paſt as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>The 30 Conſideration is, To obſerve
when a planet that is Significator, or the
Moon, ſhall have paſt the 29th. degree of
the Sign wherein it is, and touches the 30th.
and eſpecially if it have paſt one minute of
that degree; for then it ſhall have no
ſtrength in that Sign, but in the next; ſo
that if in the firſt it ſignified any evil, it ſhall
hurt the perſon, or thing threatned, no more
than the fall of a houſe ſhall one that is
juſt got out of it, or being with one foot
upon the threſhold, has one behind him
that throws him out; and then the building
falls. And if it ſignified any good, it ſhall
profit no more than he that hath ſpread a
net for birds, and juſt touches the feathers
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42147:20"/>
of their tails, but never catches their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and therefore <hi>Zaell</hi> ſays, <hi>If a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
or the Moon be in the 29th. degree of any
Sign, its vertue is yet in that Sign wherein
he is; becauſe he has not yet wholly paſt the
29th. degree.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The 31 Conſideration is, To look when
one planet applies to the Conjunction of
another, if he be near the end of the ſame
Sign wherein he is himſelf, or that other
to whom he applies; ſo that he will paſs
out of that Sign before the Conjunction is
perfected: and to ſee if he be joyned with
him in the following Sign to which he is
changed, becauſe then the cauſe is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
if that planet confers any thing on
him in that Sign wherein he is ſo joyned to
him: that is, if any reception happen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the ſaid planet, or he to whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
be firſt joyned to another; for then
the buſineſs comes to nothing, and will not
be perfected, though he be joyned again
to the firſt after he is ſeparated from him to
whom he would have joyned when he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from the ſaid Sign; ſince the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed
before the firſt Conjunction is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht.
Nor muſt it be forgotten that
a Corporal Conjunction forbids an Aſpect
and cuts it off, but an Aſpect cannot do ſo
by a Conjunction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:42147:21"/>
The 32 Conſideration is, If an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
be the Significator, what his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is; for if it be good, there will good
come of the thing; if bad rather evil; as
<hi>Sarviator</hi> ſays in <hi>Pentadeca, An ill planet
ſtrong in his own Houſe or Exaltation, not
joyned with any other Infortune to impede or
weaken him, is better than a Fortune Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade
afflicted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 33 Conſideration is, To ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
either of the Infortunes be the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator
of any thing, and be joyned to
another Infortune impeding him, or has
joyned to him the Lord of the Aſcendant
or the Moon, by a Square or Oppoſition;
for then this Infortune will perfect the
buſineſs: but the buſineſs will not be good,
or rather it will be deſtroyed after it ſeems
perfected. But if the Infortune that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes
be the lighter of the two, ſo that he
apply to a Conjunction with the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
it will hinder leſs than if the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
apply to the other.</p>
                  <p>The 34 Conſideration is, To mind in
Queſtions or Nativities, whether the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator
of the buſineſs be an Infortune
and Lord of the Aſcendant, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant
direct not vitiated, and in a good
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42147:21"/>
condition; for then he will both effect
the ſame and bring it to a good concluſion;
nay, although he be not Significator nor
Lord of the Aſcendant, but onely be in
the Aſcendant, and that the ſame be his
Exaltation; he lays aſide all his malice, and
is reſtrained from miſchief: but if he be
weak and afflicted, his malice and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
is increaſed, ſo as to deſtroy the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
wholly.</p>
                  <p>The 35 Conſideration is, To look whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an Infortune be in Signs like him, or
of his own nature, for that abates his ill
effects: like a croſs fellow when he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and has what he will, as <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn,
Aquary,</hi> or <hi>Libra,</hi> or in a cold
Sign, eſpecially if he have any Dignities
there: And ſo <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Aries, Scorpio, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn,</hi>
or a hot Sign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if <hi>Saturn</hi>
be in a hot Sign, or <hi>Mars</hi> in a cold Sign,
out of their Dignities, it will be bad, and
the buſineſs be no more compleated, than
Oyle will mix with water; but if ſtrong
and well diſpoſed, they will mix in good,
like Water with Wine, or Milk with
Honey.</p>
                  <p>The 36 Conſideration is, To obſerve
when the Infortunes are the Obſtructers of
a buſineſs, whether the Fortunes behold
them with a trine or ſextill Aſpect; for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42147:22"/>
then their ill nature will be allayed and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated:
but much more if theſe receive
them.</p>
                  <p>The 37 Conſideration is, To look if the
Fortunes are the Significators? whether
the Infortunes behold them with an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
or ſquare? for that will much leſſen
their kind effects, and diminiſh the good
they otherwiſe promiſed.</p>
                  <p>The 38 Conſideration is, To conſider if
the Fortunts are Significators, whether
they are cadent from Angles or from the
Aſcendant, ſo as not to behold the ſame,
and be retrograde: for under theſe Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimenrs
they will be almoſt as bad as the
Infortunes themſelves, unleſs they be in
reception.</p>
                  <p>The 39th is, To conſider if the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficator
be in reception; for if it be a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
its Signification will thereby be
much bettered, and its impediment and
miſchief much leſſened, if it be an Infortune.</p>
                  <p>The 40th is, To conſider if an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
whether he be Significator or not, be
perigrine, that is not in any of his Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for then his malice is encreaſed; but
when in his Dignities it ſomewhat abates
it: that is in his Houſe, Exaltation, or
Terms; but in his Triplicity or Face very
little, and in Haym leaſt of all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:42147:22"/>
The 41th is, If an Infortune being Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator,
be in his own Houſe or Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or in his own Terms or Triplicity, or
in Angles or ſuccedent Houſes; for by all
theſe means he is fortiſied, and ſhall be
counted ſtrong as a Fortune.</p>
                  <p>The 42th is, If a Fortune be Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,
or give vertue or aſſiſtance to any of
the Planets, and be in a Houſe where he
has none of the Lordly Dignities, then his
good ſignification will be leſſened and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and ſo on the contrary.</p>
                  <p>The 43th is, If the Fortunes and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
be together ill poſited, that is, in
ſome of the ſaid Impediments, as Houſes
where they have no Dignities Combuſt, or
the like; then whatever they ſignifie 'tis but
weakly; according to that Aphoriſm of
the Philoſopher, <hi>A planet retrograde and
combuſt, has no ſtrength in ſignification. The
Fortunes when combuſt and under the Sun
beams, ſignifie none or very little good; and
the Infortunes in like caſe have little or no
vertue to ſignifie ill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 44th is, To conſider if the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator.
Fortune or Infortune, be in his
own Houſe, Exaltation, Triplicity, Terms
or Face (but the latter being not of that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42147:23"/>
vertue with the reſt, 'tis neceſſary it ſhould
be aſſiſted with another Dignity, which
is Hays or Light) for in ſuch caſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
loſes his ſting; and being rein'd
in like a wild horſe from doing miſchief his
malice is converted into good: and though
this ſeem ſtrange, yet the Ancients affirm
and I my ſelf have often found it true by
experience.</p>
                  <p>The 45 his, To conſider if Infortunes
are in Angles of the Aſcendant (that is in
ſuch Signs as are in ſquare or oppoſition to
the Aſcendant) when they afflict any Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
by ſquare or oppoſition; for then they
afflict ſo much the worſe, and do more
miſchief, eſpecially if they be in a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
place than ſuch afflicted Planet.</p>
                  <p>The 46th is, To ſee whether the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator
be a Fortune or an Infortune, the
firſt naturally ſignifies good and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the laſt naturally evil by its malignity;
therefore conſider the Planets places from
the Aſcendant where they are: For if a
Planet be in his Light, or his Hays in any
of his Dignities, or in a good place from
the Aſcendant, it ſignifies good; and if it
be a good Planet the better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:42147:23"/>
The 47th is, To conſider whether the
Significator be in his Light or no, that
is a Diurnal planet in the day above the
earth, and in the night under the earth;
and a Nocturnal planet in the night above
the earth, and in the day under it; for this
renders ſuch planet more ſtrong. But if a
Nocturnal planet be Significator of any
thing in the day above the earth, or a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal
planet in the night, the ſame is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
weakned and under a kind of impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he can ſcarce accompliſh what
he ſignifies.</p>
                  <p>The 48th. is to conſider, When an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
is Significator and his ill effects
are mitigated, whether <hi>Jupiter</hi> behold
him, or is joyned corporally to him? for
that will wholly deſtroy his malignity and
turn his nature into good, how bad ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <p>The 49th is, to conſider, Whe<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

joyned to another, for if he ſignified a good
of himſelf, this will deſtroy or fruſtrate it;

it, or change it into ſome worſe miſchief
of another kind; as when the pain near
the Navel turns into a dry Dropſie: but if
joyned to a Fortune with a Reception on
either ſide, the evil will be converted into
good; but without a Reception it will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be allayed and abated, according to the
ſtrength of ſuch Fortune.</p>
                  <p>The 50th is, To obſerve the Lor<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of
the Aſcendant and the Moon, whether
they or either of them are afflicted by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Infortunes, by Conjunction,
Oppoſition or Square, the buſineſs will
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42147:24"/>
be ſpoiled without the aſpect of a Fortune;
but if a Fortune, that is, <hi>Jupiter, Venus,</hi>
the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon</hi> ſhall then behold him, it
ſlackens and diſſolves the rigors of ſuch
Infortune, and the party ſignified ſhall be
freed from the danger impending, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the aſpect be a ſquare, provided it
be with a Reception; but if a Fortune
without Reception by a ſquare or oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or an Infortune with a trine or ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
without Reception, ſhall behold the
ſaid Lord of the Aſcendant, 'tis poſſible
the party may be delivered from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
danger; but it will be turned into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
as great: ſo that it will not profit
him.</p>
                  <p>The 51th is, To ſee whether the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficator
be cadent from an Angle or from
the Aſcendant, and in none of his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
nor in his Joy; for then he ſignifies
nothing but doubts and miſchiefs, and
there are no hopes of good or profit from
a planet ſo diſpoſed.</p>
                  <p>The 52th is, When the three Inferiors
<hi>Venus, Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> come from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Rays of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and appear in the
l<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vening after his ſetting, for before (<hi>viz.</hi> till
they are got from him 12 degrees, they (or
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42147:25"/>
any other planets) are weak; ſo that a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
can advantage little, and an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
prejudice as much. Now if the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
came forth ſlow in motion, as with
labour, then will not the good expected be
obtained without much pains and trouble;
and if it be an Infortune, his ſignification
will appear ſlowly. But in the Superiors,
as <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> thoſe things
happen when they come from under the
Sun beams in the Morning, and ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his riſing.</p>
                  <p>The 53th Conſideration is, Whether
the Significator be under the Sun-beams,
for then he will be of a ſmall efficacy in
any thing, as aforeſaid; yet the Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
will be ſomething more ſtrong in
evil than the Benevolents in good.</p>
                  <p>Now a planet is properly ſaid to be under the
Sun beams, when there are onely 12 degrees,
or leſs, and yet above 16 minutes diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
it and the Sun; for when there is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
16 minutes diſtance, it is ſaid to be ſtrong,
being in <hi>Cazimi</hi> or the heart of the <hi>Sun;</hi> but
when there are more than 12, and leſs than 15
degrees; it is ſaid to be going from under
the Suns beams.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:42147:25"/>
The 54th is, To conſider whether a
ſuperior planet be removed 12 degrees
from the Sun going to his Morning riſing,
or an inferior is ſo much, and direct, going
to his Evening riſing, for then he is ſaid to
be fortified; but when he is got 15 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
ſo that he appears, he is more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
in every thing: like one coming out
of a battel rejoycing, having deſtroyed
and routed all his enemies. But when the
Sun follows the three ſuperiors, and there
ſhall be between them and him leſs than
15 degrees, their weakneſs is ſaid to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
until there ſhall be onely 7 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
between them, and afterward, until
they ſhall be in the heart of the Sun, they
are ſaid to be in extream debility; but
the debility of the inferiors is contrary
to them, for it is ſaid to be increaſed
when they follow the Sun, and that
there is between them and the Sun from
15 degrees to 7, and from 7 till they are
in the heart of the Sun, they are ſaid to
be in their greateſt debility.</p>
                  <p>The 55th is, To conſider whether the
Significator be perigrine, for then the
perſon whom he ſignifies, either in a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
or Queſtion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be ſubtil, craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
malicious, one that ſhall know how to
act both good and evil; but more inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the latter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:42147:26"/>
The 56th is, To conſider if the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator
of any thing ſhall commit his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition
or vertue to any other planet?
whether it be to one that is Oriental or Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental?
for if he be Oriental &amp; one of the
Inferiors and direct, or if he be Occiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and one of the Superiors, and that there
be not above 20 minutes between him and
the Sun, he will be weak, ſays <hi>Sarcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
and not perform what he ſhews, but
hinders many things; under that impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
like a ſick man whoſe diſeaſe has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
ſo far, that he is forced to lie by it,
and cannot help himſelf; or a falling houſe
which none can preſerve from ruin; and
ſo much further as ſuch planet ſhall be from
the Sun, ſo much leſs ſhall he be afflicted.
And if it be Oriental, and one of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
or Occidental and one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors,
and not retrograde, he ſhall be
ſtrong and fit to perfect what he promiſes;
as one that hath been ill, but is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
recovered; or a building which fell
and is repaired, and ſo of all other planets
ſo diſpoſed.</p>
                  <p>The 57th is, To conſider whether the
Significator be in the Eighth from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant?
for it he be there, and a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42147:26"/>
though he do not harm he will do no
good; and if he been Infortune, he will
do greater miſchief than in any other place
of the Figure; and if the Queſtion be of
going to War, adviſe not the Querent to
go then, although it be a Fortune; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſome evil is to be ſuſpected, that is
death, or at leaſt captivity, for it is a place
of darkneſs and death: but if it be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
judge death, unleſs he ſeparate
then from the Lord of the Eighth; for
then it may be onely a wound or bruiſe, or
a fall, wherein he was in danger of death,
although he may eſcape; and if it be a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
eſpecially a long one, he wil be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
priſoner, or in great dread of it; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
ſtill if he ſeparate from the Lord
of the Eighth: And alſo remember that
an Infortune ſo diſpoſed, alwayes does
more miſchief than a Fortune.</p>
                  <p>The 58th is to conſider, Whether the
Significator be fixed in that Sign where he
is found? Now <hi>Zaell</hi> ſaith, <hi>That a Planet
is not ſaid to be fixed in a ſign till be hath paſt</hi>
5 <hi>degrees thereof.</hi> But I am of opinion that
when he hath paſs'd one whole degree of
a Sign he is firmly therein, but he ſaid it
for more certinty. So likewiſe he ſays,
<hi>That a planet is not ſaid to be cadent from
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42147:27"/>
the Aſcendant, unleſs he be removed from
thence 5 degrees;</hi> as for Example the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant
is 9 degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
was in the fifth degree thereof, <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
and many other Sages affirm, <hi>That pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
to be in an Angle,</hi> with whom I agree;
yet ſome would have it, that a planet
ſhould be ſaid to be in an Angle onely, when
he is in the very degree of the Aſcendant,
or one degree before it or two after it; but
they meant in revolutions, and that they
might be ſo certain as not to be in the leaſt
deceived. But I have experimented that
a planet is in an Angle to the ſpace of 5 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
beyond the Cuſp; for as once I
ſought the revolution of a year, I found
<hi>Mars</hi> in the 5th degree beyond the Cuſp of
the Angle of the Earth in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> South
Latitude, which ſignified the killing of
the <hi>Roman Emperor;</hi> and acquainted him
with it, for his Court was at <hi>Groſsietti</hi> and
I at <hi>Forl<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rii;</hi> and it was found that <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulfus
de Farſenella</hi> and <hi>Theobaldus Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
and divers others of the Secretaries had
conſpired to ſlay him, and none of his
own Aſtrologers obſerved it, becauſe they
did not believe that <hi>Mars</hi> was in an Angle,
for he was 4 degrees beyond the Cuſp,
and 58 min. in their opinion: however af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a planet ſhall be removed from the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42147:27"/>
Cuſp or Line of any Angle full 5 degrees
or more he is to be counted cadent from
that Angle.</p>
                  <p>The 59th is to conſider, Whether the
Significator be behind the Cuſp of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
15 degrees and no more; for he ſhall
be ſaid to be in an Angle as well as he that
is exactly there, as <hi>Zaell</hi> affirms; whence
he ſaid before that it was not in an Angle,
nor had any ſtrength there beyond the 15th
degree after the Cuſp of the Angle: For
Example the Aſcendant is 4 degrees of
<hi>Taurus,</hi> and the end thereof was behind the
Angle, whatever planet is poſited from
the 4th to the 19th degree thereof, is in
the angle, but what is beyond that is not;
but <hi>Ptolomy</hi> ſeems to intimate, though he
ſays not expreſly, <hi>That every planet who
ſhall be 5 degrees before or 25 after the Cuſp,
is in the angle.</hi> Now <hi>Zaell</hi> would clear the
doubt, leaſt that great diſtance of the
planet from the angle ſhould hinder the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (from whom I cannot
diſſent) ſeems to aſſert, That no part of any
houſe remains void of vertue; and my ſelf
am of opinion, I think not idlely, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
planet that is in any houſe ſhall be ſaid to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42147:28"/>
be in that houſe where he is found, from the
beginning of the houſe even to the end thereof;
and therefore I ſay in the houſe not in the ſign,
becauſe ſometimes the ſame houſe comprehends
more than one ſign and ſometimes leſs; for it
ſeems ridiculous that any part of any houſe
ſhould continue idle, and be left void of
vertue.</p>
                  <p>The 60th is to conſider, Whether the
Significator be in a ſign fixed, common or
movable, becauſe in a fixed ſign he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
ſtability and continuance of the thing
begun or to be undertaken or inquired of.
In a common ſign, a change with a return
or repeating of it, that the ſame will once
be broken off and afterwards begun again,
or ſomething added, or other alteration
happen; for which reaſon in things that
require alteration, as buying, ſelling, or
the like, we ſhould put the Significator
and Moon, or one of them, into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſign; but in a moveable ſign it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a ſudden change, a quick diſpatch or
end, whether good or ill. And therefore
in matters where we deſire a ſudden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
we ought to put the Significator
in moveable ſigns; but in things that we
deſire ſhould be fixt and endure, we ought
to place them in fixed ſigns; where we would
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42147:28"/>
have a mean, let them be in common
ſigns, underſtand the ſame always of the
nature of the Moon, if at any time thou
canſt obſerve it.</p>
                  <p>The 61th is to behold, Whether the
Lord of the Aſcendent, or Moon, be
with the Dragons head or tail; for that is
an impediment in all affairs, and the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
or miſchief will proceed from a
cauſe ſignified by that Houſe in which ſuch
conjunction happens. But no Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Dragons head or tail hurts,
unleſs it be corporal; for they have no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
nor Oppoſition. And it is worſe
when the Significator, or Moon, goes
towards them, than when they go from
them: For in the firſt caſe is ſignified the
miſchief in its full height, like a man in
a Ship that is ſplit in the Sea, when there
is no hope. But in the laſt, 'tis like a
Ship that is only in danger, but has hopes
and probabilities of eſcaping. And note,
That when the Significator, or Moon, goes
to the Dragons head, its malice is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
for its nature is to encreaſe; and
when they go to the tail, the miſchief is
not abſolutely at the worſt, as 'tis when
they go from it; that is, within one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
for from one degree forwards 'tis
not ſo great as in that degree, although
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42147:29"/>
much; and from 1 to 3 leſs, and from 3
to 5 yet leſs, and from 5 to 7 very ſmall;
from 7 to 9 ſmaller, and from thence to
12 little or nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>The 62th is to conſider, Whether the
Moon be void of courſe? for that ſignifies
that the thing enquired after ſhall ſcarce
ever come to a good end, or not without
much labour, ſorrow and trouble, unleſs
the Lord of the Aſcendant, or Significator
of the thing, ſhall be in very good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and then it may be hindred, but not
wholly fruſtrated: yet 'tis a good time
then for drinking, bathing, feaſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and to uſe ointments for taking away of
hair, eſpecially if ſhe be in <hi>Scorpio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 63th is to conſider, Whether the
Moon be far from the Conjunction of the
Infortunes, ſo as not to caſt her beams on
theirs, for then the event will be good,
but rather if ſhe touch with her beams
thoſe of the Fortunes. And yet better, if
beſides this the Lord of the Aſcendant, or
of the buſineſs, be in a good condition;
for if they be not well diſpoſed, it may
impair the good promiſed, but not wholly
prevent it.</p>
                  <p>The 64th is to conſider, Whether the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42147:29"/>
Moon be in <hi>Cancer, Taurus, Sagittarius,</hi>
or <hi>Piſces;</hi> for it ſignifies good in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
although ſhe be joyned to the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and not to the Fortunes; nor does
ſhe, being void of courſe, prejudice ſo much
in thoſe places as elſewhere. provided ſhe
be not combuſt, for then they will advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
her little or nothing.</p>
                  <p>The 65th is to conſider, Whether the
Lord of the ſeventh is afflicted or not? for
that will be an impediment to the buſineſs,
And you ought to defer judgment, if you
can, and warily ſearch always whence ſuch
impediment ſhall ariſe, as well by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of the Lord of the ſeventh with
the Planets, as by their ſeparation; and
alſo of the Moon: ſo mayſt thou find
whence it will proceed, and afterwards
give judgment with more ſafety.</p>
                  <p>The 66th is to conſider, When the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
threaten miſchief, whether the
place on which their threats fall, be the
dignity of any of the Fortunes? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch fortune behold the ſame place
by <hi>Trine</hi> or <hi>Sextile?</hi> for then it will take
away the miſchief, and annul it wholly. If
by a Square, it will only leſſen it; if by an
Oppoſition, take away ſome part of it;
But if it caſt no Aſpect at all, the miſchiet
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42147:30"/>
will happen; but it will proceed from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
juſt perſons, and it may be the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſuffers rightfully, being caſt in a juſt
cauſe before a Judge, or the like. But if
the aforeſaid place be the Dignity of an
Infortune, the prejudice will come from
unjuſt men, falſe witneſſes, a corrupt
Judge, or ſome ſentence unjuſtly given
through a miſtake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 67th is to conſider, Whether there
be any Eclipſe near, which is leſs than 12
degrees from the Significator? for the
ſame will bring damage and miſchief to
the Querent or buſineſs, unleſs there be
there a Fortune which hath Dignities in
the ſame place, for then the ſame is abated:
but if there be no ſuch, thou oughteſt to
look what Planet beholds the ſaid place of
the Eclipſe, and how. For if the Fortunes
behold it, they do but augment the evil;
and if they are Infortunes, they leſſen and
abate it: which ſeems a kind of riddle or
wonder in Art.</p>
                  <p>The 68th Is to conſider, in queſtions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to ſick people, or decumbitures,
Whether the Lord of the ſeventh, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
houſe it ſelf, be free from imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
for if it be, the ſick may ſafely
truſt himſelf to the care of the Phyſicians,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42147:30"/>
for Medicines will do very well. But if
the ſeventh houſe and his Lord ſhall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> ſaith, The Phyſician muſt
be changed, for neither his Phyſick nor care
will do any good; for the ſeventh ſignifies the
Medicine, as <hi>Zaell</hi> ſaith; or at leaſt the
Diſeaſe grows chronical and laſting. The
like is to be expected if the ſame poſitious hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
at the beginning of any cure.</p>
                  <p>The 69th is to conſider, Whether the
Significators of the Aſcendent, and of the
houſe ſignifying the thing enquired, be of
equal ſtrength and debility? for then thou
canſt not ſafely give judgment; but in ſuch
caſe thou muſt mind the Lord of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
or Prevention (as the thing
is either conjunctional or preventional)
which was laſt before, and by that judge.
But if the Lord of the Conjunction or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
and of the thing, be ſtill equal,
thou muſt then turn to the <hi>Moon,</hi> and ſee to
whom ſhe firſt applies, and thence deduce
judgment. If ſhe joyn not to any in or
from the ſign in which ſhe is, take that
with whom ſhe joyns firſt in the next ſign,
and this is very conſiderably uſeful.</p>
                  <p>The 70th conſideration is, To mind
another ſecret not well ſearched into by
Aſtrologers, but often times doing them
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42147:31"/>
much prejudice; that is, See in all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether the Lord of the New
or Full Moon, preventional laſt before,
be in any of the Angles of the thing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after; if it be, it denotes that the
buſineſs will be accompliſhed, unleſs it be
the Querents own fault, (or that God
over-rule againſt it) though perhaps by
other ſignifications it ſeemed not likely.
But if it ſhall not happen ſo, but only
the ſame is in the Aſcendant, and the other
Significators, that is, the Lord of the
Aſcendant of the thing enquired of, and
the Moon, or any of them aſſiſt, the thing
will be done with eaſe. If it be in cadent
houſes it will ſcarce ever be, though other
Significators ſeem never ſo favourable;
and if two at leaſt of them be not ſo, take
it for certain it will never be done.</p>
                  <p>The 71th Is to conſider, Whether
the Significator falls between the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
and the twelfth, for that ſignifies
continuance or length of time, when a
thing will be done; or if done already,
how long it will continue in days or hours.
If between the twelfth and the tenth, it
notes half weeks; between the tenth and
ſeventh, months or weeks; between the
ſeventh and fourth, years; and between
the fourth and the Aſcendant, half years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:42147:31"/>
The 72th is to obſerve, That if the
Queſtions be of a journey, and the Moon
afflicted, it is not ſafe to undertake it; but
if it cannot be put off, make the Planet
that afflicts her Lord of the Aſcendant at
the time of the Querents ſetting forth.</p>
                  <p>The 73th is to mind, Whether the
Queſtion ſignifie good or evil? If good,
Whether the Fortunes behold the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator
of the Queſtion, or the Moon? for
then the good thereof will be increaſed;
but if the infortunes caſt in their beams, as
much or more diminiſhed. But if it origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
ſignifie evil, and the Infortunes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Significator or Moon, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
the evil threatned will be increaſed,
and become much worſe.</p>
                  <p>The 74th is to conſider, Whether the
Significator be in his firſt ſtation, going
to be retrograde? for that ſignifies croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and inobedience, and that the matter,
though never ſo probable, will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.
If any work or building be
then begun, it will not be finiſhed. And
if ſuch Significator, ſo aſſerted, be then
under the earth, ſuch building ſhall not be
raiſed to any purpoſe in thirty years, and
then not finiſh'd; and if it be raiſed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
then, it will be a raiſing thirty years
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42147:32"/>
more. And if not then compleated, it
will not be compleated till ninety years
after its firſt; and if not then, it will
never be finiſhed, unleſs the property be
altered, and come into the poſſeſſion of
ſtrangers from its former owners. But if
the Significator be in his ſecond ſtation,
going to be direct, it notes, that the affair
will be done, but ſlowly, intricately, and
with pains and trouble. And if any Ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſice
he then begun, it will be finiſh'd, but
not ſo ſoon as was at firſt believed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the Significator be not under the
earth; for then he that begins it ſhall
never make an end of it, nor raiſe it very
high above the earth.</p>
                  <p>And note, A Planet in this ſecond ſtation ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
an aptneſs, and the renewing and ſtrength
of every thing; but in his firſt ſtation, diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and deſtruction. Remember and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
thoſe things well, for they will often
come in practice.</p>
                  <p>The 75th is to conſider, Whether the
Moon be afflicted by any Planet? for then
whatever the queſtion be, the ſame will
ſuffer impediment. But if the Moon be in
a good place from the Aſcendant, ſo as to
behold it with a <hi>Trine</hi> or <hi>Sextile,</hi> or if the
Planet that afflicts her do behold the ſame,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42147:32"/>
either of thoſe <hi>Aſpects</hi> will mitigate the
miſchief intended, and it may be wholly
take it away, as the ſaid afflicting Planet
is diſpoſed; ſo that he be not cadent from
Angles, nor from the Aſcendant, nor in
his fall, that is with the ſeventh from
his own houſe. <hi>Zael</hi> ſeems to ſay, <hi>That
if an Infortune afflicting be cadent from the
Aſcendant, or retrograde, it cauſeth fear in
the Querent; but I alwaies fear the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Moon above all other impediments,
and ſcarce remember that I ever ſaw a good
end of any thing where ſhe was afflicted: And
in journeys, if to war, was apprehenſive of
the Querents caſe and perſon; if for trafick,
of ſtraits, quarrels, ſadneſs in his travels,
and loſs of money,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The 76th is to conſider, From what
Planet the Moon ſeperates, and which ſhe
is joyned to; he whom ſhe ſeperates from
ſignifies what hath been, the other what
is to come, as we have ſaid. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if ſhe ſeperate from an Infortune, and
applies to a Fortuue, the worſt is paſt; and
what hitherto hath been had, will end
happily to the Querents content. But if
ſhe ſeperates from a Fortune, and goes
to an Infortune, underſtand the contrary;
the thing was good in its beginning, but
proves naught in the end. If from a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42147:33"/>
to a Fortune, it was and is good, and
will have a laudable end. If from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to an Infortune, it will be an ugly
concluſion.</p>
                  <p>The 77th is to conſider, Whether the
Lord of the Aſcendant, or Moon, be in
oppoſition; that is, whether the <hi>Moon</hi> be
in <hi>Capricorn, Mercury</hi> in <hi>Sagittarius</hi> or
<hi>Piſces,</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Scorpio</hi> or <hi>Aries,</hi> the
<hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>Aquarius, Mars</hi> in <hi>Taurus</hi> or <hi>Libra,
Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Gemini</hi> or <hi>Virgo, Saturn</hi> in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
or <hi>Leo?</hi> for then ſuch Lords of the
Queſtion abhor the buſineſſ nor does he
love it ſhould be accompliſhed, but is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againſt it.</p>
                  <p>The 78th is to conſider, The Houſe
that ſignifies the thing whereof the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is ask'd. For the firſt ſignifies the
Perſon, the ſecond Subſtance, the third
Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as we before have taught;
and as it ſhall appear, ſo judge, having
duly pondered all circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>The 79th is to conſider, Whether the
Significator, or Moon, be joyned to good
or ill Planets by Conjunction or by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
which is diligently to be headed and
diſtinguiſhed; for a corporal Conjunction
with the Sun is the greateſt misfortune can
befal a Planet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:42147:33"/>
The 80th is to conſider, How the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator
is poſited in reſpect of his own
houſe, whether in the ſecond, third, or
fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſign, from it, according to
the ſignification of that ſign, ſhalt thou
judge as thou wouldeſt. Judge of any
Planet in ſuch an houſe from the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
                  <p>The 81th is to conſider, Whether the
Significator be in an angle, or in a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
or cadent houſe? for how much
any Planet is near to the cuſp of any angle,
ſo much is he the ſtronger; how much the
farther, ſo much the weake. And by how
much ſoever he ſhall be nearer the cuſp of
a cadent houſe, ſo much ſhall he be the
weaker; how much the farther, ſo much
the leſs weak.</p>
                  <p>The 82th is to conſider, Whether the
Significator receive diſpoſition or virtue
from any Planet, Fortune or Infortune.
If from a Fortune, it ſignifies good; and
the better, if ſuch Fortune be in a good
condition. If from an Infortune, the
contrary; and ſo much the worſe, by how
much the more weak and afflicted he is.</p>
                  <p>The 83th is to conſider, Whether
the Fortunes and Infortunes are equally
ſtrong in the Queſtion? for that ſignifies
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42147:34"/>
no poſitive judgment, either good or ill;
but a kind of indifferency, and that the
buſineſs will bring neither gain nor loſs.</p>
                  <p>The 84th is to conſider, Whether the
Fortunes or Infortunes are ſtrongeſt; for
if both be ſtrong, and the Fortunes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
in ſtrength, it ſignifies a kind of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity
of good; if the Infortunes in ſuch
a caſe are ſtrongeſt, a mediocrity of evil;
not in exceſs on either ſide.</p>
                  <p>The 85th is to conſider, Whether part
of Fortune fall in a good or bad place of
the Figure; that is, in a Angle, or in a
Succedent, or in a Cadent houſe; and how
the ſame is Aſpected and by whom, a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
or an Infortune? and whether it be in
reception of that Planet by whom it was
aſpected? For queſtions may ſometimes
ſeem good, but the part of fortune happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in an untoward place, weakens it much,
and renders it leſs profitable, ſo as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Qurrents hopes. And on the
contrary, a queſtion may ſeem ill, yet the
part of Fortune happening luckily, joyned
with a good Planet that receives it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
leſſeas the evil, and not ſo much happens to
the Querent as the Figure otherwiſe ſeems
to threaten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:42147:34"/>
The 86th is to conſider, Whether ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Infortunes beholds the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,
both Retrograde, Cadent, Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine,
and in Signs contrary to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
natures? for then they bring ſuch
an abſolute miſchief as cannot be avoided,
nor averted by any thing but God alone.
And if any ſhall be born under ſuch poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he will alwaies be a beggar, let him
do what he can: or if any houſe be built
then, no man ſhall ever live happily, or
get money in it; but by loſſes and croſſes
his eſtate and goods ſhall moulder away,
and come to nothing; and his moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable

unleſs the Divine Goodneſs in
mercy interpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The 87th is to conſider, <hi>(Novenarium
Lunae)</hi> which is a thing much to be heeded,
for it often hinders the Aſtrologer from
diſcovering the truth, and leads him into
errour, not knowing the cauſe that makes
him deceive.</p>
                  <p>The 88th is to conſider, The Planet
from whom not only the Moon ſeperates,
how he is diſpoſed, and next to whom ſhe
is joyned, ſo that there be not above 51
miutes diſtance between them; the firſt
ſignifying what is paſt, the ſecond what is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42147:35"/>
now preſent, as we have already ſaid;
but alſo look to whom ſhe will be next
j<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

whom ſhe is at preſent; for he will ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
(according as he is diſpoſed) the iſſue,
or what is to come.</p>
                  <p>The 89th is to conſider. The <hi>(Duede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nariam
Lunae)</hi> a thing very obſervable in
many caſes, even more than divers things
that we have ſaid; for there is greateſt
danger of miſtakes in abſtruce conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and ſuch as Aſtrologers rather
through ſloth than ignorance do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard;
whereby they often fall into diſgrace
and contempt of the rabble, rather than
take a little pains.</p>
                  <p>The 90th is to conſider, Whether he
Lord of the houſe in which the Sun is, and
of that wherein the Moon is, and alſo the
Lord of the Aſcendant, be all oriental,
and in Angles, (though that rerely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens)
and mutually behold each other from
good places with friendly Aſpects; for
theſe poſitions ſhall ſignifie the greateſt
good, and moſt ſuperlative fortune ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.
If they ſhall not be all ſo diſpſed,
the remaining part ſhall ſignifie proſperity
and ſelicity proportionably, as for as they
are able, though not in ſo vaſt a meaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:42147:35"/>
The 91th conſideration, Is to obſerve
in Queſtions or Nativities, Whether <hi>Mars</hi>
be in any of the Angles of the Figure,
eſpecially in fixed Signs; or when <hi>Scorpio</hi>
aſcends, for then he deſtroys all the good
ſignified by that queſtion, or at leaſt much
impedes and diminiſhes it, unleſs <hi>Jupiter</hi>
behold him with a <hi>Trine</hi> or <hi>Sextile;</hi> for
then his malice is mitigated: but yet as
<hi>Jupiter</hi> is either ſtrong or weak.</p>
                  <p>The 92th is to obſerve in Nativities and
Queſtions, eſpecially of death, Whether
the Lord of the houſe of death, or Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficator
of death, or Lord of the houſe in
which the Lord of the eighth is poſited,
applies to the Significator of the Native
or Querent, or he to them; becauſe a
Planet ſo affected becomes the deſtroyes
of life, and kills as well if it be a Fortune
as an Infortune, and that whether there be
a reception or not.</p>
                  <p>The 93th is to conſider, If the Queſtion
concern a thing that one would deſire of
another, or that one would get out of a
ſecret hidden place, Whether the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator
of the Querent, or thing inquired
after, behold <hi>Saturn,</hi> or is corporally
joyned to him; or whether <hi>Saturn</hi> be in
the houſe of the thing inquired after? for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42147:36"/>
then the buſineſs will hardly be done, or
not without much labour and trouble, and
more tediouſneſs than the Querent can
imagine.</p>
                  <p>The 94th Is to conſider, in Queſtions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whether the Significator of the thing
inquired about be Cadent from the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
or other Angles, or from the houſe
that ſignifies the thing or buſineſs ſought
after, or its Lord? or whether he be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde,
or in a bad condition with the
Sun; or whether there be in the ſaid houſe
ſignifying the thing inquired after, a Planet
Cadent or Retrograde, or in ſuch ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
with the Sun, or in an ill place from
him, or ill aſpected by him? for any of
theſe things ſignifie a hindrance to the
thing, although otherwiſe the queſtion
ſeem good and probable.</p>
                  <p>The 95th is, Whether the Planets ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the thing ſought, joyn mutually with
each other? for that ſignifies it will be
done; yet be not too confident to judge
ſo, till thou haſt well weighed the nature
of the Sign wherein they are joyned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be of their own nature; for then
it will be eaſie, otherwiſe difficultly, or
ſcarce at all.</p>
                  <p>The 96th Is to conſider in Queſtions
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42147:36"/>
which ſeem to ſhew, that what is enquired
after ſhall be perfected, Whether the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator
of the thing, and the Moon, are
in Angles? for if they be both above 25
degrees from Angles, it will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed;
but if one ſhall, and the other
ſhall not be ſo far off, then it may be
done, but with difficulty, unleſs it be a
journey; which will ſpeed well enough, if
the Significator be remote from Angles.</p>
                  <p>The 97th Is to conſider, In what climate
thou receiveſt the queſtion? for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
muſt be varied as the aſcenſions of
Countreys and climates differ, there being
not the order in the aſcenſions or eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Signs, in one climate as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor the ſame Aſcendant in one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
as in another. Beware therefore of a
miſtake here, for it will be very unhandſome
and blame worthy; for whatever part thou
travelleſt towards, from one Region to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whether from the Eaſt to the Weſt, from
the North to the South; or contrarily, your
Aſcendant will be changed from one degree,
from Eaſt to Weſt in longitude, and <hi>è contra;</hi>
and from the North to South, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
But ſome Gowned fools, or Monks
in their Cubs, may ariſe and ſay, If your
judgments are changed according to the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42147:37"/>
of Nations, they are falſe. But there
is no talking to ſuch Brutes, they neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

to them; yet there are ſome very learned men
amongſt them, ſuch as <hi>Conradus B ixierſis,</hi>

Art, and practiſeth it honeſtly.</p>
                  <p>Want of heeding what I have ſaid hath
made Aſtrologers to err, and I doubt doth ſo
ſtill; for right judgment cannot be given but
by the Aſcendant and other Houſes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if thoſe vary, thoſe muſt do ſo too. There fore
you ſhould have Tables of Elevation for every
Climate and Region: yet 'tis more difficult to

in any Region from Eaſt to Weſt, thou mayſt by
gueſs find the Elevation in another, which way
thou pleaſeſt either towards the Eaſt or Weſt,
according to the ſame Climate, by taking the
difference; but in divers Climates thou canſt
not ſo eaſily conjecture.</p>
                  <p>The 98th Is to obſerve, Whether if
what appears by the Sign likely to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
be ſignified by the Planets by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Conjunction, or Aſpect, or tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Light? if by either of the two firſt;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42147:37"/>
the thing will be effected by the Querent,
and the party enquired off, without any
third perſons intermedling; but if by the
laſt, it ſhall be done by Embaſſadors,
Friends, or ſome perſon interpoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and it ſhall be brought to paſs by a
perſon or thing ſignified by that Houſe,
whoſe Lords tranſlates the lights, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.
Thus if it be the Lord of the ſecond,
it will be done by expences, or a piece of
money: if by the third, by ſome brother,
or the like; if by the fourth, by the father,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the reſpective ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of each Houſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The 99th Is to conſider well in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
Nativities.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>what will certainly
come of them? for ſometimes by the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
a thing ſeems likely to be abſolutely
done; but is not wholly, but in part; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is wholly perfected, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
neither wholly nor in part; upon
which account Aſtrologers are often bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and ſcarce know how to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
not knowing how this comes to
paſs, being a difficult point, and of a moſt
ſubtle diſquiſition; ſo that the Ancients
would not meddle with it, ſave only the
moſt honoured</hi> Albumazar <hi>ſaid ſomething
more than the reſt, whoſe judgments I have
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42147:38"/>
found more efficacious and correct than
others, though</hi> Ptolomy, <hi>the great explainer
of this Science, muſt be acknowledged
more curious than the reſt. Now that
which I ſay, is the conſideration of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
fixed Stars:</hi> Note that theſe fixed Stars
are now removed many degrees forwards in
the Ecliptick than they were in <hi>Bonatus</hi> his
time, in reſpect of longitude, which ought to be
carefully conſidered by the induſtrious Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger,
which I ſhall name, whereof ſome are
of the nature of the Fortunes, and perfect
thoſe things with them not like to be perfected
by the ſignifications of the Planets; others
are of the nature of the Infortunes, which
ſuffer not things to be perfected according to
the Planets ſignifications; of which latter
there are ſome in every Sign: as in <hi>Guido
Bonatus</hi> his time there were two in the head
of <hi>Aries,</hi> that is, one in 13 degrees and 45
minutes, the other in 14 degrees and 45 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
and are ſouthern, and of the nature
of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars.</hi> In <hi>Tanrus</hi> are 6 ſtars,
the firſt in 9 degrees and 55 minutes; the
<hi>Pleiades,</hi> which yet are called and counted
but as one, and are of the nature of <hi>Mars</hi> and
the <hi>Moon;</hi> another in the 13 degeee and 2

minutes, called the <hi>Devil:</hi> another in the
15 degree, called the <hi>Devils head;</hi> another
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42147:38"/>
in the belly of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and 19 degrees and
15 minutes, called <hi>Aldeboram,</hi> which are all
of the nature of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury.</hi> In <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi>
there is one in 8 degrees, called the
<hi>Shoulder of the Dog,</hi> of the nature of <hi>Mars</hi>
and <hi>Saturn;</hi> another in 10 degrees and 15
minutes, of the nature of <hi>Mars,</hi> called the
<hi>Warrior;</hi> another in 17 degrees and 55 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes;
another in 18 degrees and 52 minutes,
called the <hi>Witch,</hi> of the nature of <hi>Sol</hi> and
<hi>Mars.</hi> In <hi>Cancer</hi> there is one in 2 degrees
and 3 minutes, called the <hi>Camel,</hi> of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Saturn</hi> and the <hi>Moon;</hi> another in 7
degrees and 55 minutes; another in 13 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
called the <hi>Weſtern Camel,</hi> of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon;</hi> another in the
ſame degree, called the <hi>Foot of the Dog,</hi> of
the nature of <hi>Saturn:</hi> and another in 17 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and 55 minutes, of the ſame nature.
In <hi>Leo</hi> there is one in 15 degrees and 55 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
of the nature of <hi>Saturn.</hi> In <hi>Virgo</hi>
two, one in 7 degrees and 11 minutes, of the
nature of <hi>Mars;</hi> the other in 15 degrees, of
the nature of <hi>Saturn.</hi> In <hi>Libra</hi> on in 26
degrees, of the nature of <hi>Saturn.</hi> In <hi>Scorpio</hi>
three, one in the firſt degree and 3 minutes,
another in the 8th degree and 7 minutes, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the 9th degree, all of the nature of
<hi>Mars.</hi> In <hi>Sagittarius</hi> two ſmall ones, one in
19 degrees and 2 minutes, the other in 21
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42147:39"/>
degrees and 2 minutes, of the nature of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi>
In <hi>Capricorn</hi> two, one in 27 degrees

<hi>Aquarius</hi> one in 9 degrees and 4 minutes,

one in 4 degrees and 7 minutes, of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe Stars are hurtful and malevolent,
hindring and deſtroying things after they ſeem
probable to be accompliſhed, and thereſooe to
be avoided as much as is poſſible. Here 'twill
not be ſuperſluous, but very convenient, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
a Table of the fixed Stars, that have
ſmall latitude, as they are now placed, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
them for ſome ſucceeding years.</p>
                  <p>The 100th Conſideration is, To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the fixed Stars aſſiſting and promoting
the accompliſhment of things; which are
thus ſcituated. In <hi>Aries</hi> there are two,
one in 5 degrees and 6 minutes, of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Jove</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> another in the 26th
degree and firſt minute, of the nature of
<hi>Jupiter.</hi> In <hi>Taurus</hi> three, one in the firſt
degree and 3 minutes, another in 8 degrees
and 7 minutes, and the laſt in 9 degrees
and 1 minute, all of the nature of <hi>Venus.</hi>
In <hi>Gemini</hi> are two Stars, one in 19 degrees
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42147:39"/>
and 2 minutes, the other in 21 degrees
and 8 minutes, both of the nature of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
and of the ſecond magnitude. In
<hi>Cancer</hi> likewiſe two, one in 2 degrees 2
minutes, the other in 29 degrees 5 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
both of the nature of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> In
<hi>Leo</hi> one, in 9 degrees 4 minutes, of the
nature of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> In <hi>Virgo</hi> one
in 4 degrees and 7 minutes, of the nature of
<hi>Venus</hi> and the <hi>Moon.</hi> In <hi>Libra</hi> two, both
of the nature of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> one in
13 degrees and 45 minutes, the other in
14 degrees and 45 minutes. In <hi>Scorpio</hi>
four, one in 9 degrees 55 minuts, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in 13 degrees 1 minute, a third in
14 degrees 45 minutes, the laſt in 19 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
15 minutes, all of the nature of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter.</hi>
In <hi>Sagittarius</hi> two, one in 10 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

and 55 minutes, both of the nature
of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> In <hi>Capricorn</hi> three, one 2 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and 3 minutes, another 7 degrees and
55 minutes, the other 7 degrees and 55 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
all of <hi>Jupiter's</hi> nature. In <hi>Piſces</hi>
two, one in 7 degrees and 11 minutes, of
the nature of <hi>Venus,</hi> the other 14 degrees
and 59 minutes, of the nature of <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
Wherefore always when thou findeſt the
Significator in a Corporal Conjunction
with any of theſe, thou mayſt pronounce
happineſs and a good end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:42147:40"/>
                     <hi>The 101ſt Coſideration is, To mark
in Nativities or Queſtions, which Planet
is the cutter off of life or years, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
of a thing from being done? for he
it is who deſtroys the life of the Native,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>who is ſtrongeſt in teſtimonies of
dignities or power. Yet</hi> Meſſahala <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
this, and diſcovered the ſame and
another uſeful ſecret onely to a certain
Scholar of his, who out of pride appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
the ſame to himſelf.</hi> Now, after
thou haſt found who is this deſtroyer, &amp;c.
then ſee to whom the Lord of the Aſcendant
or the Moon is joyned (who participates in ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of every thing, as we have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
or the Lord of the thing enquired after,
and Lord of the Houſe of the Moon, or one or
more of them; for if it be joyned to a Planet
Retrograde or Combuſt, or Cadent from the
Aſcendant, or any other Angle, or to any of
the Infortunes who doth not receive him; or
is afflicted by an Infortune, which cuts off the
light of the Significator: the thing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
and ſo the years of the Native are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed,
and he lives not long.</p>
                  <p>Further, if the Lord of the Aſcendant or
the Moon, or the Lord of thing enquired after,
be joyned to a Planet who is free from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of the Infortunes, and ſo is ſaſe as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42147:40"/>
to himſelf, but is joyned to another Planet
afflicted ſome of the aforeſaid ways, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhall be brought to naught, even after it
ſeems accompliſh'd, and the Natives life ſhall
be ſuddenly cut off, when there is all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
that may be of the contrary: And
this will alſo happen though there be no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the killing Planet, if only the
Significator, or Moon, be afflicted in manner
aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>The 102d Conſideration is, Of things
ſignified, how they ſhall be found or
known, and from what Significator they
are to be taken? which muſt be from the
Significators of the Querent, and of the
thing queſtioned or enquired after: which
two Significators, if they ſhall be joyned
together with the Moon, it ſignifies wholly
and abſolutely the effect of the thing; if
not joyned, then the contrary. And from
the Conjunction of the Significators we
ought to know why, or by what the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is made. And by the Lord of the
Houſe in which ſuch Conjunction happens,
we know of what the queſtion will be, or
the end thereof; for if that be a Fortune,
it will be good, according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ſignification of ſuch Fortune, and
the Houſe wherein he is, and ſignification
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42147:41"/>
of the Lord of that Houſe, and of the
place in which the Lord is poſited of that
Houſe wherein its ſelf is. But if it be an
Infortune, it will be bad, according to the
ſignification of the Infortune, and ſuch
other poſitions as aforeſaid. If the Lord
of the Houſe or Exaltation, or of any
two ſmaller Dignities, caſts an Aſpect, or
there be a tranſlation of Light, you may
know by that the queſtion ſhall be brought
to paſs, but if there be none of theſe, it
cannot be preciſely known, but it will be
by or from a cauſe not yet diſcovered; and
by the Aſpects of the Fortunes or Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
may be known what will be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                  <p>The 103d Conſideration is, To mind
in Nativities and general Queſtions, in
what Houſe the part of Fortune happens;
for from the things ſignified by that Houſe
will the fortune or gain of the Native or
Querent ariſe, if the ſame be well diſpoſed:
otherwiſe the ſame will be cauſe of his
misfortune and loſs.</p>
                  <p>The 104th Conſideration is, To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in Nativities and general Queſtions,
whether the Significator of the Native or
Querent be poſited in the ſeventh from his
own Houſe, or in Oppoſition to the Lord
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42147:41"/>
of the Aſcendant? for he will not in ſuch
caſe ſignifie gain from the things ſignified
by that Houſe, but rather expence and
loſs.</p>
                  <p>The 105th Conſideration is, To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in Nativities or general Queſtions,
whether that an Infortune unfortunate be
in the ſeventh? for that ſignifies that the
Native or Querent ſhall not live in peace
or any delight with his wives, ſweet-hearts,
or companions, but will perpetually have
brawls and quarrels with them; it ſeldom
happens otherwiſe from ſuch a poſition.</p>
                  <p>The 106th Is to conſider in Nativities
and general Queſtions, if a Fortune for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
and no way afflicted, be in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth?
for then the Native or Querent
ſhall be happy in good wives and aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates,
yet ſhall have many rivals and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that hate him, but rather out of
envy than cauſe, ſo that he ſhall ſeldom
bring his enterprizes and deſigns to paſs,
without much labour and trouble.</p>
                  <p>The 107th Is to conſider in Nativities
and general Queſtions, whether <hi>Mars</hi> be
in the ſecond or in the tenth, and well
diſpoſed? for it denotes that the Native
or Querent ſhall gain a Fortune or Eſtate
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42147:42"/>
by thoſe perſons that deal or work in Iron
and Fire, as Smiths, Furnace men, Glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in Victualling, or keeping
Innes, Taverns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if <hi>Mars</hi> be weak
or afflicted, loſs and damage from all thoſe.</p>
                  <p>The 108th Is to conſider, If either of
the Planets beholds two Houſes? for his
vertue and fortitude ſhall be in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he hath moſt dignities, and which is
moſt proper for him, and the thing he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies.</p>
                  <p>The 109th Is to conſider, Whether the
Lord of the fifth be in the ſeventh affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted?
for then the Native will never be
happy at Feaſts or Banquets, either be
averſe from or ſleighted at ſuch meetings,
or ſome affronts put upon him; nor will
he ever go neat in his clothes, nor get any
credit by them.</p>
                  <p>The 110th Is to conſider in Nativities,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether <hi>Scorpio</hi> aſcend? for ſuch a
Native is never like to get any great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; becauſe
<hi>Cancer,</hi> the Exaltation of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> natural
Significator of Clerks, will then be in the
ninth Houſe, which ſignifies the Church,
and <hi>Jupiter</hi> is an enemy to <hi>Mars,</hi> who is
Lord of the Aſcendant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:42147:42"/>
The 111th Is to conſider in Nativities
and Queſtions, eſpecially of Law-ſuits and
Controverſies, whether the <hi>Dragons tail</hi> be
in the ſeventh? for that ſignifies damage
or overthrow to the Natives enemies, and
proſperity to the Native or Querent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the head will then be in the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.
If it be in the eight, it denotes
the decay and loſs of their eſtate or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and increaſe of the Natives. In the
third, prejudice to the Natives Brethren.
In the fourth, to his Parents. In the fifth,
to his Children. In the ſixth, to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
In the ninth, to his Journeys. In
the tenth, to his Preferment. In the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
to his Friends. In the twelfth, to
his Cattel of the greater ſort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo
to all other things ſignified by each Houſe
reſpectively; ſo do <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> alſo,
but not ſo much. Likewiſe 'tis obſervable,
that other ill poſitions may make void the
ſaid ſignifications, but not ſo much as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>
and <hi>Mars,</hi> unleſs they themſelves are
Significators of the miſchief, and then
much of their malice is abated.</p>
                  <p>The 112th Is ſtrictly to examine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
in every Nativity or Queſtion the
Aſcendant; for whoſoever ſhall have <hi>Virgo</hi>
aſcend, and <hi>Mercury</hi> in a good condition,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42147:43"/>
or at leaſt not afflicted; if he ſtudy and
practiſe Phyſick, he ſhall have ſucceſs, and
do great cures, but ſhall be unhappy in his
ſalary or profit thereby; not being able to
get his fees of moſt of his Patients: and
beſides, ſhall be unhappy in Law-ſuits.
But if he follow the Law, he ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
in all his buſineſs, and ſlighted;
his words, though never ſo prudent, not
regarded, no not by them for whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
he ſpeaks, but a fools diſcourſe
prefer'd; and whatever he meddles in ſhall
fadge untowardly, and people be his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
without cauſe, and aſperſe and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
him they know not why. But far
otherwiſe will it be if <hi>Sagittarius, Taurus,</hi>
or <hi>Piſces</hi> aſcend, and <hi>Jupiter, Venus</hi> and
<hi>Mercury,</hi> ſhall be all in the Aſcendant, or
if <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> ſhall happen to be in
<hi>Zaminium,</hi> or the heart of the <hi>Sun,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Aſcendant be, the Native ſha<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l be
admired as a Prophet, and all his words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as Oracles, or the dictates of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny.</p>
                  <p>The 113th Is to conſider, Whether ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Infortunes be in the 9th Houſe,
and without Dignities? for then the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or Querent ſhall be often blamed and
accuſed, and that without cauſe, as much
as for one: But if Fortune be there well
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42147:43"/>
affected (eſpecially having dignity there)
he ſhall on the other ſide be praiſed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded,
and honoured, whether there be
cauſe or reaſon for it or no.</p>
                  <p>The 114th Is to conſider, Whether the
Lord of the eighth be a Fortune, and in
the ſecond? for then the Native or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſhall gain conſiderably by the goods
of people deceaſed, of his enemies, and by
his wives, eſpecially if ſuch Planet ſhall
be free from impediment, or have digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
there. But if an Infortune be there,
it ſignifies loſs and decay of the Natives
eſtate, unleſs he have dignities there,
and be otherwiſe well affected, and in
good condition, for then it will be little
or no prejudice; but without dignities,
and in an ill ſtate, it wholly and totally
deſtroys and ruins all hopes of eſtate.</p>
                  <p>The 115th Is to conſider, Whether the
eighth Ho<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe, or its Lord, be afflicted?
for then ſhall the Querent or Native he
damnified, and loſe an eſtate by the death
of a wife, which ſhe enjoyed for life, or the
like.</p>
                  <p>The 116th Is to conſider, Which of the
Hou<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es, or their Lords, are afflicted, or
under impediment? for that ſignifies, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42147:44"/>
hurt and damage will accrue to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
by reaſon of the things ſignified by
that Houſe; and ſo on the contrary, if
they are Fortunes, good and advantage
from the ſame things.</p>
                  <p>The 117th Is to conſider. If the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
tail</hi> be in the fourth; for that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
that whatever the Native or Querent
ſhall get, ſhall be ſquandred away, and
come to nothing: and wherever it is, it
ſignifies damage to the Native in and from
that Houſe repreſented.</p>
                  <p>The 118 Is to conſider, In what Houſe
a Fortune ſhall be fortunate and ſtrong,
well diſpoſed, and not afflicted; for in
and by theſe, perſons or things by that
Houſe ſignified, ſhall the Native or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
gain profit, and make his fortune;
and ſo on the contrary of a Houſe that is
afflicted.</p>
                  <p>The 119th Is to conſider, If the Lord
of the ſecond be in the ſeventh, and the
ſeventh be in <hi>Aries, Scorpio, Capricorn,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarius;</hi>
for then the Natives enemies ſhall
eaſily take away his goods and right; and
if he aſſociate himſelf with perſons, they
ſhall rob him; and his Wife, or Miſtreſs,
ſhall cheat him, and ſteal whatever ſhe can
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42147:44"/>
from him; unleſs the Lord of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
be in <hi>Trine</hi> or <hi>Sextile</hi> to the Lord of
the ſeventh, or in other Aſpects with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
                  <p>The 120th Conſideration, is to obſerve,
Whether the Lords of any of theſe eight
Houſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the third, fourth, fifth, ſixth,
ninth, tenth, eleventh, or twelfth, be in
the ſeventh? for which ſoever of them is
there, the perſon by him ſignified will
prove the Natives enemy, unleſs a perfect
Reception, and ſome good Aſpect, as <hi>Trine</hi>
or <hi>Sextile</hi> intervene. Yet a Square or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
with Reception, will abate the
enmity, but not wholly prevent it. Thus
if it be the Lord of the third, his Brethren
will prove his enemies; if of the fourth,
his Parents; if of the fifth, his Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
nor ſhall he gain of or by them ſo much as
he ſhall loſe another time; or if any of
them ſometimes appear kindly, it will be
but from the teeth outward, and for their
own ends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 121th is, Whether the Moon be in
the eighth, and the Lord of the Aſcendant
in the Aſcendant, ſecond or twelfth, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde?
for then the Native or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
will not he fortunate, nor have any
luck at playing at Dice, or any other Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:42147:45"/>
The 122th is, Whether part of Fortune
be in the firſt 10 degrees of the fourth
Houſe, with the <hi>Dragons head,</hi> the <hi>Moon,
Venus</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and they direct? for
that ſignifies that the Native ſhall be lucky
in diſcovering and finding out hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
If it be in the ſecond, 10 degrees,
or but with two of the ſaid Planets, he
ſhall find ſome, but not in ſo great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.
In the laſt, 10 degrees, and with
but one leſs, and yet a conſiderable parcel:
and if only the part of Fortune be there,
not afflicted, then a ſmall quantity. If the
<hi>Sun</hi> behold it with a <hi>Trine</hi> or <hi>Sextile,</hi> it
will be Gold uncoyned; if the <hi>Moon,</hi> Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
if <hi>Jupiter,</hi> a mixture of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> If <hi>Venus,</hi> precious stones, Lockets,
and for the moſt part Womens Ornaments.
But if they be Retrograde, he ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the treaſure, but not for himſelf,
another ſhall get the profit. If the Lord
of the eighth behold the Lord of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant
with a Square or Oppoſition, the
finder ſhall die by reaſon of it; but if it
be with a <hi>Trine</hi> or <hi>Sextile,</hi> he ſhall only
catch ſome ſmall ſickneſs or diſeaſe. If the
<hi>Dragons tail</hi> be there inſtead of the <hi>head,</hi>
he ſhall find it, but it ſhall be taken from
him; or being ignorant what it is, he
ſhall give it away almoſt for nothing, And
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42147:45"/>
if the <hi>Moon</hi> be then ſeparated from the
Lord of the Aſcendant, and joyned to an
Infortune that afflicts her, he to whom 'tis
ſo given ſhall have little profit by it. If
<hi>Mars,</hi> or the Lord of the eighth, behold
the Lord of the Aſcendant, they that take
it from him ſhall kill him. But if <hi>Mars</hi>
and <hi>Saturn</hi> ſhall be in the place of <hi>Jupiter</hi>
and <hi>Venus,</hi> the buſineſs will be only Braſs,
or Copper, or Lead. And if the Lord of
the Aſcendant be with them, the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
is wearied with it, whatever it be,
whether vile or precious.</p>
                  <p>The 123th Conſideration is, to obſerve
in Nativities or Queſtions, Whether the
Sun and Moon are in Conjunction in one
and the ſame minute, both according to
longitude and latitude, and any of the
Fortunes in the Aſcendant, that is, within
15 minutes above the Cuſp thereof, or 24
minutes below it; for that ſignifies that
the Native ſhall be happy in getting a
great eſtate and heaping up of money;
but if they be only in exact Conjunction to
longitude, and not according to latitude,
and their diſtance one from the other be
within 15 minutes, he will ſtill be fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in acquiring ſubſtance; but ſo much
the leſs, by how much the further ſuch
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42147:46"/>
diſtance is; and ſo proportionably. If
they happen to be above 15 minutes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
the ſame thou mayſt conclude if
the Moon ſhall be ill the very minute of
Oppoſition to the Sun, and a Fortune be
in the ſeventh, which ſignifies the eſtate
of the Querent or Native in reſpect of his
wives, companions, or enemies. And if at
that time of birth <hi>Taurus</hi> aſcend, and the
<hi>Moon</hi> be there, or the very minute aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or <hi>Leo</hi> aſcending, and the <hi>Sun</hi> in the
minute aſcending, not afflicted by either
of the Infortunes, it ſignifies that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſhall get much money, and come to
great preferment and honour; but if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Infortunes be in the ſaid places
inſtead of a Fortune, it denotes loſs and
deſtruction of eſtate to the Native or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
by or on the occaſions aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>The 124th Conſideration is, To regard
in Nativities and Queſtions, the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators
of the Querents and Natives eſtate,
and alſo of his preferment, calling, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
which thou mayſt take to be the
Lord of the tenth, or of the Aſcendant,
if the other ſhall not be fit to ſignifie the
ſame; for if the Lord, or Almuten of the
tonth, be with the Light of the Tyne, or
<hi>erect and tall from it,</hi> and diſtant 60 degrees
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42147:46"/>
or upwards, even to 90 degrees; if it be
one of the Superiors, or 30 degrees if it
be one of the Inferiors, and in the Angle
of the tenth, or in the Aſcendant within
30 minutes above the Cuſp, or a degree
and a half below it, and not afflicted, it
ſignifies that the Native ſhall attain to the
dignity and profeſſion of his Anceſtors, and
not exceed it, yet ſhall be more skilful,
excellent, and perfect therein than any of
them: but if there be in either of the ſaid
Angles any of the aforeſaid helping and
fortunate fixt Stars with the Planet of
Fortune, or any of the Planets, he will far
ſurpaſs all his fore-fathers in dignity. And
if ſuch fixed Stars ſhall be of the firſt
magnitude, and ſole Significators, the
Native or Querent ſhall be raiſed to vaſt
honours and riches, almoſt ineſtimable:
which if beheld by the Lord of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
then his fame and honour lies in his
own perſon; if by the Lord of the ſecond,
in his riches; if by the Lord of the tenth,
in his Offices, Command, or Empire; and
this though in never ſo poor and vile peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
the meaner their condition was, to ſo
much the greater height ſhall they arrive.
But this ſhall not endure long, for they
ſeldom go beyond twenty ſeven or thirty
years. And look how much the more
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42147:47"/>
ſublime was their fortune, by ſo much the
more grievous, miſerable, and calamitous
ſhall be their fall; for they ſhall die an
ignoble filthy death; or if they eſcape it, the
ſame ſhall happen to their next Succeſſor.</p>
                  <p>The 125th Conſideration, Is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in Nativities or Queſtions, what Sign
aſcends; if it be the Sign of a Planet that
hath two Houſes, the exerciſe or troubles
of the Native or Querent ſhall be chiefly
in thoſe things ſignified by the other houſe
of the ſaid Planet, which ſhall lightly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to him, and for the moſt part through
his own means.</p>
                  <p>As if the Aſcendant be <hi>Aries,</hi> he
ſhall be exerciſed in ſuch things as ſhall be
the cauſe of his own death or fall, becauſe
<hi>Scorpio,</hi> the other Houſe of <hi>Mars,</hi> will
be then in the eighth Houſe; but if <hi>Mars</hi>
be well diſpoſed, and part of Fortune hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the 8th, he ſhall be very fortunate
in all things ſignified by that Houſe. If
<hi>Taurus</hi> aſcend, he ſhall be exerciſed in ſuch
things as ſhall cauſe his own weakneſs;
becauſe <hi>Libra,</hi> which is the other Houſe of
<hi>Mercury</hi> will be then the ſixt Houſe. But
if <hi>Venus</hi> be well diſpoſed, and part of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in the ſixth, he ſhall be moſt lucky
in things appertaining to the ſixth Houſe.
If the Aſcendant be in <hi>Gemini,</hi> he ſhall be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42147:47"/>
exerciſed in ſuch things as ſhall occaſion
his being taken; becauſe <hi>Virgo, Mercuries</hi>
other Houſe, will be on the fourth; but
if <hi>Mercury</hi> be well diſpoſed, and part of
Fortune in the fourth, he will be proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in things belonging to the fourth
Houſe. If <hi>Virgo</hi> aſcend, he will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crciſed
in things that will gain him honour
and power, becauſe <hi>Gemini, Mercuries</hi>
other Houſe, is the tenth; if <hi>Mercury</hi> be
then in Conjunction with part of Fortune,
and in the Aſcendant, he ſhall acquire as
it were a Kings revenue. But if <hi>Mercury</hi>
be in the the tenth, with the part of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
fortunate and ſtrong, he ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
obtain a Kingdom, or ſupream
Command. And if with this part of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and the Moon be alſo in the tenth,
he will be a mighty Prince infallibly. If
<hi>Libra</hi> aſcend, he ſhall be exerciſed in things
that ſhall haſten his own death, becauſe
<hi>Taurus,</hi> the other Houſe of <hi>Venus,</hi> will
be then in the eighth. But if <hi>Venus</hi> be well
diſpoſed, and part of Fortune in the eighth,
he will be lucky in things repreſented by
the eigth Houſe; and ſo of any other Sign.
<hi>Scorpio</hi> aſcending, the Native or Querent
ſhall bring diſeaſes on himſelf, becauſe
<hi>Aries</hi> is on the ſixth. <hi>Sagittarius</hi> aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he ſhall fool himſelf into captivity,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42147:48"/>
becauſe <hi>Piſces</hi> is on the fourth. <hi>Capricorn</hi>
aſcending, he ſhall gain much by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
for <hi>Aquarius</hi> is then on the ſecond
Houſe. But if <hi>Saturn</hi> be ill diſpoſed, he
ſhall ſquander away and waſte his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
idlely, If <hi>Aquarius</hi> aſcend, he ſhall
procure himſelf many ſecret enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Capricorn</hi> will be then in the twelſth
Houſe. If <hi>Piſces</hi> aſcend, he ſhall raiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to honour, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The 126th Conſideration is, To take
notice in Nativities or Queſtions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Mercury</hi> be Significator wholly or in
part fortunate and ſtrong, and in <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi>
or <hi>Aquarius?</hi> for then the Native ſhall
be of a profound and piercing wit, and
great underſtanding; one that ſhall dive
into the bottom of things, and ſee from
the beginning what the iſſue will be; and
ſo much the more, if <hi>Saturn's</hi> fortunate
ſhall behold <hi>Mercury</hi> with a good Aſpect,
eſpecially if <hi>Mercury</hi> be in <hi>Aquarius,</hi> which
is the delight of <hi>Saturn;</hi> and ſtill more if
a Fortune ſhall be with <hi>Mercury</hi> and he
with one of the propitious fixed Stars. But
if <hi>Mercury</hi> be in <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Scorpio,</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
will be bold, perfidious, unconſtant,
arrogant, and yet quick of apprehenſion;
rather nimble to repeat or find out things
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42147:48"/>
ſaid by others, than invent them himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The 127th Conſideration is, To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in Nativities, if the Lord of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant
be <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> and ſole Lord
of the Nativity, without any Fortune per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
in the dominion, the taſte or ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Native, or his complexion,
ſhall not be like thoſe of other men, for
if it be <hi>Saturn,</hi> he ſhall delight in ſowr
or inſipid things, as <hi>Halion Ptolomy</hi> avers;
if it be <hi>Mars,</hi> in ſharp and bitter, Fleſh
half ſtinking, Wine dead, and pall'd Aloes,
ſnuffs of candles, dung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo with
filthy, dirty unhandſome women, more
than in others; or if it be a woman, in the
homelieſt men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 128th Conſideration is, In Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
whether the Aſcendant be a human
Sign, or the Lord of it in a human Sign?
for that ſignifies the Native an honeſt,
ſociable and neighbourly man, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if both happen together: But if the
Aſcendant carry the ſimilitude of ſome
creature which men uſe to labour with, as
<hi>Aries, Taurus,</hi> the laſt part of <hi>Sagittarius</hi>
and <hi>Capricorn,</hi> the Native is very ſubmiſs
and humble to men, yet very ſociable:
But if it be a Sign half feral, as <hi>Cancer</hi> and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42147:49"/>
                     <hi>Piſces,</hi> he will be yet leſs ſociable; but if it
be a feral, furious or ſalvane Sign, as <hi>Leo</hi>
and <hi>Scorpio,</hi> he will be of a bruitiſh ſavage
temper, delighting in the woods, hunting,
and living upon ſpoil and rapine; caring
not to aſſociate himſelf with men, ſo that
he ſeldom remains long with his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
or neareſt Relations.</p>
                  <p>The 129th Conſideration is, To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in Nativities, whether the <hi>Moon</hi> be
in Oppoſition to the <hi>Sun,</hi> with any of the
Stars called <hi>Cloudy,</hi> which are <hi>Althazaic,</hi>
and the Head of <hi>Gemini<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or in a place
called <hi>The Place of falling into the water,</hi>
which <hi>Aquarius</hi> ſpouts forth, or the drops
of the Lion, ſaid to be near his heart, and
others which by reaſon of their mixture
with each other do not ſhine diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>For when the <hi>Moon</hi> ſhall not be above 10
minutes diſtance from them, according to
Longitude and Latitude, it ſeems unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that the Native ſhall have diſeaſes in
his eyes, not to be remedied by any human
help or medicine. If the <hi>Moon</hi> be then acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
in an Angle, and <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi>
likewiſe accidental, nor far diſtant from her,
or oppoſing the <hi>Sun</hi> in any of the Angles, it
ſignifies that the Native ſhall be blind of both
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42147:49"/>
eyes at his death; nor does there appear any
way whereby it may be prevented: But if it
be not of Luminaries, but only one, he ſhall
loſe but one eye; if it be <hi>Sol,</hi> and a man, the
right eye; if a woman, the left eye; but if
it be the <hi>Moon,</hi> and a man, the left eye; but
if a woman, the right eye.</p>
                  <p>The 130th Conſideration is, To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
in Nativities, whether the <hi>Moon</hi> be
joyned with <hi>Mercury</hi> by Body or Aſpect,
or there be a tranſlation of light by any
Planet between them? if there be nothing
of this, and the Sign aſcending be neither
of the nature of <hi>Mercury</hi> or the <hi>Moon,</hi> and
<hi>Saturn</hi> in a Diurnal Nativity, and <hi>Mars</hi>
in a Nocturnal, and one be in an Angle,
the Native will be mad, diſtracted, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with fits, a fool, or at leaſt exceeding
forgetful, unleſs a Fortune very ſtrong
ſhall at the ſame time behold the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
<hi>Mercury</hi> or the <hi>Moon;</hi> and ſo much
the worſe, if the Angle wherein ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
is happen to be <hi>Cancer,</hi> which is
the Exaltation of <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Virgo,</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation
of <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Piſces,</hi> the Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Venus:</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the
<hi>Moon</hi> in Nativities is the general Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carix
of the Natives perſon, and the
Planet with whom ſhe is joyned, or its
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42147:50"/>
faculties and powers; and therefore it ſhe
be corporally joyned or applying to ſuch
Planet, the Native will prove of good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and very well retain his ſenſes
and intellectuals. And if <hi>Mercury</hi> be in
<hi>Capricorn</hi> or <hi>Aquarius</hi> not afflicted, but in
good condition, the Native will be of an
exceeding wit, and a great Philoſopher;
and if <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> be in <hi>(Zamini
Solis)</hi> he will prove an Hermite or kind of
Prophet, whoſe words ſhall be received as
Oracles beyond thoſe of other men.</p>
                  <p>The 131ſt Conſideration is, To take
notice in the Nativity of a man, whether
the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> be both in Maſculine
Signs, or both in one Maſculine Quarter,
or one Maſculine Sign; for if ſo, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
that the Native's acts and temper ſhall
be naturally ſuch as belongs to men: But
in a womans Nativity, the Lummaries ſo
diſpoſed make a kind of Virago, one that
ſhall diſpiſe men, and obtrude her ſelf into
their affaris; and ſuch a one, if ſhe marry,
will be ſure to wear the breeches.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> ſhall be both in Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
Signs, the Native will be moderately
affected towards the delights of <hi>Venus,</hi> and
uſe them according to Nature and Law; but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42147:50"/>
if they happen to be Oriental, he will be more
ſalacious and immoderate, inclinable to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt,
Sodomy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if they be Occidental,
and in Feminine Signs, his ſports will be
naſty and bruitiſh; and ſo much the more, if
<hi>Saturn</hi> caſt any Aſpects to them: But if it be
a woman, and <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> Oriental,
and in Maſculine Signs, ſhe will abhor mens
embraces, and take no delight therein, but
rather pleaſe her ſelf with ſome little wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with perſons of her own ſex. But if <hi>Mars</hi>
and <hi>Venus</hi> be in Feminine Signs, and Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental,
ſhe will love and take delight in mens
kindneſs. And <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in his <hi>Centilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium</hi>
affirms, That if <hi>Venus</hi> be joyned with
<hi>Saturn</hi> in a Nativity, and have Dignities in
the ſeventh, the Native ſhall be ſomewhat
faulty and untoward in his venerial careſſes.</p>
                  <p>The 132d Is to mark in Nativities, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Mars</hi> be corporally joyned with a
certain fiery Star of his own nature in
<hi>Taurus,</hi> called <hi>Agol,</hi> ſo that they are not
above 16 minutes aſunder, <hi>Mars</hi> applying
thereunto, and the Lord of the Houſe
wherein the Luminary for the time ruling
is poſited, which is called the Lord <hi>Anau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi>
or of its Exaltation, and two others of
its Dignities, and ſhall be in Oppoſition
or Square of <hi>Mars,</hi> and neither of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42147:51"/>
ſhall behold the Aſcendant, nor be
poſited in the eighth Houſe; it undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
ſignifies the Native ſhall be beheaded.
And if <hi>Mars</hi> ſhall not be diſtant from it in
Latitude above 6 minutes, it will infallibly
happen ſo, not to be avoided but by God
alone. And though a Fortune, Retrograde
or Combuſt ſhould behold the Aſcendant,
yet it will ſcarce preſerve him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading;
only in ſuch caſe it may happen
not to he occaſioned by his own fault; for
a Fortune in ſuch a caſe not impedited,
may ſave him from ſuch an ill death, and
permit him to die in his bed; but then it
will be of ſome capital diſeaſe, proceeding
from a hot houſe and this before he comes
to be fifty years of age. But if <hi>Mars</hi> ſhall
not be thus affected, yet if an Infortune
be in the eighth, the Native ſhall come to
an untimely or ignominious end; but if
a Fortune be there in good ſtate, he ſhall
expire naturally; but if ſuch Fortune be
afflicted, he ſhall die of ſome miſchance
coming upon him. Ptolomy <hi>in his</hi> Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquiam
<hi>tells us, That if the light of the Tyne
ſhall happen to be in the mid heaven (I ſay in
the conditions aforeſaid) ſuch Native ſhall
be hanged. If either of the Infortunes be in</hi>
Gemini, <hi>and the other in</hi> Piſces, <hi>his hands or
feet ſhall be cut off, according to the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42147:51"/>
of the Sign wherein the Planet is poſited,
which is moſt malevolent. If</hi> Mars <hi>be in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the Lord of the Aſcendant in
Leo, and hath no Dignities in the Aſcendant,
nor either of the Fortunes in the eighth, the
Native ſhall be burnt to death; and if</hi> Mars
<hi>be then Retrograde, Combuſt, or in his fall,
it will be for ſome crime, otherwiſe by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
or unjuſtly.</hi> Ptolomy <hi>ſaith, That if</hi>
Saturn <hi>in a Nativity be in the mid-heaven,
and the Planet to which he is</hi> Anauba <hi>a</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor
<hi>be in Oppoſition to him, and a dry Sign
on the Cuſp of the fourth, the Native ſhall
be knockt o'th' the head, and die by ſome ruins
falling on him; but if a moiſt Sign be there,
he ſhall be drowned; but if it be an human
Sign, he will be ſtrangled. If</hi> Mars <hi>or</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<hi>be in the Aſcendant at birth, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine,
the Native ſhall have a skar or mark
on his face or head; if the Infortune be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
Combuſt or Retrograde, the ſame will
be very deformed, and much disfigure him,
otherwiſe not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 133d Conſideration is, To mark
in Nativities, whether <hi>Gemini</hi> or <hi>Sagitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
aſcend, and whether its Lord be well
diſpoſed, that is, fortunate and ſtrong, and
likewiſe the Moon? for that ſignifies, that
if the Native live, he will get great riches.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42147:52"/>
If <hi>Virgo</hi> or <hi>Piſces</hi> aſcend, and its Lord, or
the Moon, be well affected, he ſhall get
money, and lay the ſame out well, and live
ſplendidly, being beloved for his genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
and bounty. But in the other caſe,
where the Aſcendant is <hi>Gemini</hi> or <hi>Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius,</hi>
he will not be ſo liberal, but very
frugal and ſparing; beſides, he who hath
<hi>Gemini</hi> or <hi>Virgo</hi> for his Aſcendant, may
loſe his eſtate, and come to want; but he
that hath <hi>Sagittarius</hi> or <hi>Piſces,</hi> ſhall never
loſe his means, nor fall into poverty. If
<hi>Aries, Scorpio, Capricorn,</hi> or <hi>Aquarius</hi>
aſcend, the Native will be miſerably co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
if <hi>Jupiter</hi> behold the Aſcendant,
he may ſomewhat mitigate the ſordid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,

it away.</p>
                  <p>The 134th Conſideration is, To mind
in Nativities, whether <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> be
in the ſixth, and otherwiſe well diſpoſed?
for that ſignifies that the Native ſhall be
not really fit for Phyſick, and grow a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Doctor in every part of the Art. If
<hi>Mercury</hi> be in Conjunction with <hi>Venus,</hi>
and ſhe Retrograde, he will make naturally
a good Singer; but if <hi>Mercury</hi> be in the
twelfth, not afflicted, he will be ſtudious
and famous in moſt Sciences, eſpecially
Philoſophy.</p>

The 135th Conſideration is, To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
in Nativities, whether the Lord of
the Aſcendant, and the <hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
and <hi>Venus,</hi> are either all in the Aſcendant,
or whether <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> behold the
Lord of the Aſcendant, and the <hi>Moon</hi> in
the Aſcendant by a <hi>Trine</hi> or <hi>Sextile,</hi> and
free from affliction? for then the Native
will prove very ſtrong and couragious, and
none will dare to diſobey his commands.</p>
                  <p>The 136th Conſideration is, To note
in the Nativities of Kings and Rich Men,
and ſuch Grandees as are fit to bear rale,
whether both Luminaries are in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of their Exaltations, or in their own
Houſes in the ſame Degree one with the
other, and free from affliction? for this
ſignifies that the Native ſhall obtain great
honours; for he ſhall be made Emperor,
or ſomething like it: ſo that he ſhall be as
it were Monarch of the World, which ſhall
continue to the fourth generation of his
poſterity. But if all the Planets below <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſhall be diſpoſed of by him, and he ſhall
receive vertue from every of them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the condition aforeſaid, and
afterwards commit both them and himſelf
to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and both he Oriental from the
Sun and in Angles, the Native will be a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42147:53"/>
perſon of great renown and power, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
perhaps not with the title of King;
but his ſame ſhall endure for a long time,
that is to ſay, all his life time; and after
his death for three revolutions of <hi>Saturn,</hi>
or longer.</p>
                  <p>The 137th Conſideration is, To ſee
whether <hi>Mercury</hi> be in Conjunction with
<hi>Saturn</hi> in the Aſcendant? for that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
that the Native is a fooliſh talkative
fellow, that would be counted wiſe; he ſhall
ſpeak ill of all, both men and women; the
greateſt wit he hath is to invent many lies;
nor doth he ever open his month, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of untruth appears intermixt with
his diſcourſe; ſo natural it will be for him
to tell lies: <hi>Saturn</hi> gives him a foul tongue,
and <hi>Mercury</hi> a ſharpneſs of malice to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it.</p>
                  <p>The 138th Conſideration is, To ſee in
Nativities, whether the two Infortunes
are in the fourth Houſe, or whether the
Angles are poſſeſt with movable Signs, and
<hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> in them? for then the
Native will be poor, wretched, and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
above all others, all his life time,

The 139th Conſideration is, To be
careful both in Nativities and Queſtions,
where the <hi>Dragons tail</hi> is? for that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the waſting and deſtruction of the
thing ſignified by that Houſe, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if it relate to gain: for in the firſt
it ſignifies expences, and loſs of gain to the
Querent, from or by reaſon of his perſon;
in the ſecond deſtruction, and loſs of money
and ſubſtance; and in the third, loſs by
means of Brethren, Siſters, Neighbours;
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the fourth, damage that one ſhall
ſuſtain by ones Grand-father, Father-in-law,
and ſuch things relating to inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
and that the Native ſhall change
houſes often, and get little by it: in the
fifth, damage from or by reaſon of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
in the ſixth, loſſes by Servants, or
ſmall Cattel; in the ſeventh, loſs by Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Companions, or open Enemies; in
the ninth, loſs by Religious men, and on
the account of Religion; in the tenth, by
or in his preferments, honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the
eleventh, loſs by his Friends, or for their
ſakes; and in the twelfth, damage ſuſtained
by great Cattel, or by means of hidden
Enemies.</p>
                  <p>The 140th Conſideration is, To ſee
whether the Significator of the thing in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42147:54"/>
queſtion, or the Moon, be ſo weak that
it cannot bring the matter to perfection?
and if they be, take the Significator of the
Querent and thing enquired after, and
ſubſtract the leſſer from the greater, and
add to the reminder the degrees of the
Sign aſcending, and project what they
amount unto from the Aſcendant, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
where it happens; for the Lord of
that Sign ſignifies what was enquired of,
and according to his condition ſhalt thou
give judgment, as thou findeſt him fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and ſtrong, or infortunate and weak:
For if the buſineſs concern a mans eſtate,
and he be placed in the ſecond, as he is
ſo ſhall the Querents eſtate prove; if in
the third, the Brethren will be diſpoſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly;
in the fourth, thoſe of greateſt
Relations; in the fifth, the Children; in
the ſixth, Servants; in the ſeventh, Wives;
in the eighth, Wives portions; in the ninth,
long Journeys; in the tenth, his Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
in the eleventh, his Friends; in

                  <p>The 141ſt Is to conſider in Nativities,
the gifts and properties beſtowed on men
by the fixed Stars, and how long they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
together with the reaſon why they
prove not laſting, as thoſe which proceed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42147:54"/>
from the Planets, ſince it ſeems a little
probable that they ſhould continus longer
than thoſe; of which I do not remember
to have met with any thing in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
ſave only that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in his <hi>Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquium</hi>
ſays, <hi>The fixed Stars ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
exceeding great benefits, but often times
they end ill.</hi> And <hi>Almanſa</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe</hi>
to the great King of the <hi>Sarazous, That
the fixed Stars beſtow notable gifts, and raiſe
from poverty to happineſs and high degree,
more than any of the ſeven Planets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon that, the gifts of the
fixed Stars to men, abide leſs with them
than thoſe given by the Phanets, is, becauſe
the fixed Stars being the Agenes, and Men
the Patients, the ſubject on which they are
to operate, are not agreeable to them, nor
are born to be able to receive their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
for it is requiſite that there ſhould
be ſome conformity and likeneſs, or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
between the Agent and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient:
but the fixed Stars a<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e moſt ſlow
in motion, and conſequently in mutation,
whence it comes to paſs that their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
require ſubjects and patients of
the ſame nature; that is to ſay, ſuch as are
the moſt laſting, and carry a conformity
with them to perfect or accompliſh their
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42147:55"/>
effects: For the revolution of the fixed
Stars is finiſht but in ſix and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years, but the <hi>Viventhipolis,</hi> or life of
man, generally exceeds not three revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Saturn,</hi> that is to ſay, the ſpace
of ninety years, very few exceed that age
(though poſſibly ſome may, by the addition
of the years of ſome Planets to the years
of the <hi>Alcocoden)</hi> in their Nativities, which
bears no conformity or proportion with
36000 years to compleat the effects of
their influences. And therefore as an Eagle
cannot exerciſe the complement of her
flight or power on a Fly, nor a Stone
coming forth <hi>(à ſunda, Trabathi)</hi> do any
great execution <hi>(in Muſciovem)</hi> no more
can the fixed Stars compleat the effects of
their impreſſion, and therefore their gifts
or the good promiſed by them, continues
no longer with men, becauſe men are of
ſo ſmall a duration, and ſubject to a ſwift
mutability in reſpect of their motion. And
upon this is that Aphoriſm grounded, that
adviſes to make uſe of fixed Stars in the
To nation of Cities, but of Planets in
the erection of Houſes; becauſe Cities
are generally of the longeſt continuance
amongſt corruptible things, and far more
durable than particular Houſes; for theſe
in reſpect of their individuals do not endure
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42147:55"/>
always, whereas Cities remain by a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
building and rebuilding of Houſes;
and therefore though Caſtles are very laft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet are they not equal in the reſpect
to Cities; ſo that although we may uſe the
ſuperior Planets in elections for building
of Caſtles, it is better to take fixed Stars;
yet ſtill becauſe Cities are of longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
than Caſtles, they are more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to the fixed Stars, whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
they are. For the impreſſions which
a ſolid thing makes in a more ſolid thing,
continues much longer than that which it
makes on a leſs ſolid thing; and far leſs in
a thing not ſolid, than a thing ſomewhat
ſolid; and yet leſs in a very ſlippery tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient
thing, than in a thing leſs lubricous
or changeable. Hence the impreſſions
which the fixed Stars make on Cities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
longer than thoſe on Caſtles; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Cities are more correlative to them
in lenght of time, and accordingly thoſe
of Caſtles more durable than thoſe of
Houſes, for the ſame reaſon proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
But bodies of men are more remote
from thoſe fixed Stars than houſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſo more corruptible; and for
that cauſe their ſignifications apply leſs to
them, or if they happen, abide but little;
the ſignifications of the fixed Stars being
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42147:56"/>
ſo great and noble, ſo high and free from
corruption and mutability, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eaſily take upon them a variable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
with things quickly corruptible
and ſuddenly changeable, unleſs it be as
oyl on water; for though it may enter
into it, yet ſuch impreſſion will not long
continue; for the fixed Lights operate
with ſo much nobleneſs, that by reaſon of
their long diſtance from thoſe vile, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
changeable bodies, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
to the ſupream Light, their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
cannot remain in or with them, when
they are lightly or ſuddenly changed and
corrupted; eſpecially in baſe people, and
mean ſpirits; for they ſeldom tranſcend
his perſon to whom they happen, and
often times leaves him whilſt he lives, and
that to his damage, ſo great that God alone
can prevent; as I affirm for the moſt
part: though 'tis poſſible they may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
terminate in good and continue
long: As it hath ſometimes happened, that
ſome have lived to the greateſt years of the
<hi>Alcocoden,</hi> of whom I never ſaw but one
in my time, who was named <hi>Richard,</hi> who
affirmed himſelf to have been a Courtier
under <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, King of <hi>France,</hi>
and that he had lived five hundred years.
At what time there was a report of one
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42147:56"/>
that had continued alive ever ſince our
Saviour's days, called <hi>Johan Buttadeus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had impuliſſed the Lord as he was
led to be crucified, <hi>Who ſaid to him, Thou
ſhalt expect, or wait for me, till I come.</hi> The
aforeſaid <hi>Richard</hi> I ſaw at <hi>Revenna,</hi> in the
year 1223; and the ſaid <hi>John</hi> is ſaid to
have paſſed through <hi>Florilivium,</hi> in his
journey to St. <hi>James</hi>'s at <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> in the
year 1267.</p>
                  <p>Nor could the ſignifications of the fixed
Stars be applied, or adhere to men, nor
ſenſibly remain in them, unleſs there were
ſome <hi>Medium</hi> by which they might act
upon them which are the Planets, which
are ſecondary Agents, as the firſt are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal;
for wherever there are diverſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in order, attributed to ſeveral Agents,
the principal act ought to be referred to
the principal Agent, which in reſpect of
the effects or corruptible things, was the
primary cauſe, and the Planets as ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary;
for that corruption which thoſe in
inferiors ſuffer, happens by reaſon of their
too great diſtance from the incorruptible
ſuperiors; yet their effects ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
long in Grandees, and perſons very
rich, who are apt for Empire, magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
and of brave and excellent ſpirits;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42147:57"/>
ſuch as in my time was the Emperor <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
the Second, who when he was indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and in great neceſſity, was arrived to
the Imperial Dignity, and brought under
his obedience all <hi>Apulia,</hi> the Kingdom of
<hi>Sicily, Jeruſalem, Cracovia, Italian,</hi> and
the whole <hi>Roman Empire</hi> (except of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy)</hi>
ſubduing all Enemies, Traitors and
Rebels, and remained in that illuſtrious
flouriſhing condition; yet at laſt died mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably,
being poyſoned by his Domeſticks
and all his Family extirpated; ſo that ſcarce
any of them remained. Such another was
<hi>Ecilinus de Romano,</hi> who when he was but
mean, was far exalted above all other <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>
for he ruled, and as it were tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
over the Marquiſate of <hi>Treves,</hi> even
to <hi>Almaine</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> and within four or
five miles of <hi>Venice,</hi> and his Tyranny con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
twenty ſix years; but at laſt all
theſe glories were overcaſt with calamity,
for when it ſeemed impoſſible to ſuppreſs
him, he fell into the hands of his Enemies
at a Battel in the Country of <hi>Mediolanenſi
apud Caſſianum,</hi> and died wretched, and all
his poſterity was deſtroy'd, not one of them
remaining. In the ſame manner there was
one in the Kingdom of <hi>Apulias,</hi> of baſe
deſcent, called <hi>Peter de Vinea,</hi> who when
he was a Schollar at <hi>Bononia,</hi> was forced
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42147:57"/>
to beg for his living, and had not bread
to eat, yet made Notary, and after that
Protonotary of the Court of the Emperor
<hi>Frederick</hi> the Second; he became a Judge,
and climed to ſuch a grandeur, that he was
happy that could obtain the leaſt of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
for whatever he did the Emperor would
confirm: but himſelf would often ſet aſide
what had been eſtabliſhed by the Emperor,
who made him Lord of <hi>Apulia:</hi> whereby
he grew ſo rich, that he had ten thouſand
pounds of Gold <hi>(Auguſtanenſium)</hi> beſides
other Treaſures almoſt ineſtimable; yet in
the end he fell, and was reduced to ſuch
miſery, that the Emperor ordered his eyes
to be put out: inraged at which, out of meer
indignation he ſtruck out his own brains
againſt a wall, as it was then commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.
Another was at <hi>Pyſa,</hi> called <hi>Smerolus,</hi>
one of the dregs of the Vulgar, who came
to be (as it is ſaid) Lord of that Province;
nor durſt any of the Nobility for a while
contend with him; yet at laſt he came to
nothing. After whom one <hi>Oddo Gualdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins,</hi>
a mean fellow, tapered up ſo high,
that he did as it were ſway the whole City,
and none would contradict him, till <hi>Galy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
a Judge, cauſed him to be chopp'd all
to pieces. The ſame happened at <hi>Flory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycium,</hi>
one called <hi>Simon Muſtaguere</hi> the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42147:58"/>
Son of obſcure Parents, who mounted ſo
high, that all the People adored him: nor
durſt any oppoſe him ſave only my ſelf, who
knew him throughly; and what miſchief
he could, he did at his pleaſure for three
years ſpace: but at laſt down he came, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
baniſht the City, which happened for
the od<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ouſneſs of his perſon and cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.
Another, being a Frier of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Order, by name <hi>John,</hi> by Nation <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centinus,</hi>
was admired as a Saint by all the
Italians that acknowledged the Roman
Chruch; but I ever thought him an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite:
he grew ſo high, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to have raiſed eighteen from the
dead, (though never one of them could be
ſeen) and to cure all Dieaſes, fright De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet could I not perceive any body
freed by him, though I made much enquiry
into his Miracles; however the whole
World ſeemed to run after him, and
thought himſelf happy that could get a
Thread of his Cap, which they eſteemed
equal with the Reliques of the Saints; and
in his Preaching he would publickly boaſt,
<hi>That he had converſe with</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the</hi>
Virgin Mary, <hi>and</hi> Angels <hi>when he liſt.</hi> By
which Tricks, the Friers of his Order at
<hi>Bononia,</hi> got more than Twenty thouſand
Marks. And his power was ſo great, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42147:58"/>
by his own will he releaſed a Souldier as
he was going to Execution for murther.
Nor durſt the Magiſtretes deny him, nor
any ſpeak ill of him but my ſelf, who knew
all his whe<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dles and cozsnages; for which
the Rabble, meerly out of fear of him,
reported me an Heretick, In which eſteem
and pomp he continued above a year, but
at laſt want out like a ſnuff of a Candle,
with a ſtink, his Devices and Hypocriſie
being diſcovered; ſo that he became as
generally, and every body was aſhamed to
be ſeen in his company.</p>
                  <p>The 142d Conſideration is, To obſerve
in Nativities and general Queſtions, the
gifts and good advantages beſtow'd on men
by the Planets; becauſe thoſe are applied
more eaſily to them, and continue longer
extended to their ſucceſſors, according as
they are diſpoſed in the Radixes of their
Nativities; but they are ſeldom exceeding
great, unleſs when applied by fortunate
fixed Stars, becauſe being of a more ſwift
mutability, they have a cloſer affinity with
them, eſpecially if proceeding from the
inferior Planets, for their conformity with
men, their correlative ſubjects. Thoſe of
the Superiors laſt not ſo long, with men,
but in building of houſes they are much
better than the other.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But the Lower Planets beſtow their gifts

Courting them. <hi>&amp;c. Mercury</hi> in

Selling Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe, I ſay, are
excellently well beſtowed by the Planets ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly
poſited, and endure longer, that
is to ſay, The Proſperities given by the
<hi>Moon</hi> may continue to the ſeventh year or
generation, becauſe ſhe is the Seventh Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
reckoning downwards; and if they paſs
the Seventh Age or Generation, they cannot
exceed the Eighth; as ſuppoſe from the
42d year to the 45th year including both
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42147:59"/>
thoſe of <hi>Mercury</hi> may endure to the ſixth

ſcarce hold out the ſeventh. Thoſe of <hi>Venus</hi>
to the fifth Age, ſhe being the fifth Planet

reach the third. And though I ſay that
they may continue ſo long, yet do I not ſay
that they ſhall not be finiſhed before. For as
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, There are terms that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

in theſe caſes. And further, When I ſay
that they cannot continue longer, I mean with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vaniſhing wholly; or ſo depreſt, that it
will be no more like what was before, than
Green or Ruſſet to a perſect White, unleſs by
chance ſomething from another cauſe happens

the Queſtion is ſerious: but
otherwiſe, if the Aſcendant ſhall be the
end of any Sign, the Queſtion is not Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical.
2. Behold the Aſcendant and his
Lord, the Moon and the Planet from
which ſhe ſeparates, and aſſign them for
Signiſieators of the Querent; the ſeventh
and the Planer with which the Moon is
joyned, ſhall repreſent the perſon inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
after: but if it be neceſſary, deſcend
to the perſons, as the things are, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Houſes, from the firſt to the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42147:60"/>
twelfth. 3. Conſider the nature of the
thing, inquire about the Houſe and Sign
whereby it is ſignified. 4. The Aſpects
of the Planets both good and malevolent
to the Significators of the things ſought
after. 5. In what place from its own
Houſe each of the Significators are; <hi>viz.</hi>
Whether in his own or the ſecond, third,
or fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in the Combuſt way, or
the like places. 6. Whether they are
found in Angles Cadent or Succedent
Houſes. 7. Diligently ſee where the
Querents aſſiſtants muſt come, <hi>viz.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from a Father, a Son, a King, a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or a Friend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 8. By the Mirth of
the Querent, as if the Lord of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
ſhall be in the fifth, or elſewhere
joyned with its Lord; free from being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
by the Infortunes, or by his ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
as if his Significator happen in the
ſixth, ſeventh, eighth, or twelfth; unleſs
the Queſtion be of things ſignified by
thoſe Houſes: and as thou findeſt judge.
9. By the Fortunes and Inforttunes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as thou findeſt them in places ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
the things about which the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is moved; and if the benevolents are
more, 'tis good, if otherwiſe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
if the teſtimonies are equal, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.
10. Whether the Lord of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42147:61"/>
Aſcendant be in the Houſe of the thing
enquired after, or with its Lord. 11. In
what Houſe the Lord of the firſt is joyned
with the Significator of the things lookt
after; for by the Significator of that
Houſe, or his occaſion, thou mayſt judge
the matter will be brought about. 12. If
the Significators are not joyned there, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any traſlation of light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them by any other Planet, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
their deſcription, thou ſhalt judge
the ſame thing. 13. By the natures of
the Significators themſelves, agreeing in
their natures and ſignifications with each
other. 14. According as the receiver of
the Significators virtue or diſpoſition ſhall
be, a Fortune or an Infortune, ſtrong or
weak, and does behold the Significator, or
the Moon, or any with Aſpects of love or
enmity, ſo ſhalt thou pronounce judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The 144th Conſideration is, To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in Queſtions, Nativities or Elections,
when the Significators ſhall not clearly
ſhew thee what thou wouldſt know, but
the ſignification remains dubious, ſo that
the mind is in ſuſpence, take the place of
the Lord of the Aſcendant, and the place
of the Lord of the Houſe of the Moon,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42147:61"/>
and ſee the diſtance of degrees between
them, beginning from <hi>Aries;</hi> of which
make Signs, and add the degree of the
Sign aſcending; and project from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant
as well by day as night; and
where the number falls, the Lord of that
Houſe ſhall be Significator, and from him
take the ſignification of the buſineſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
for according to his diſpoſition
thou mayſt judge.</p>
                  <p>The 145th Conſideration is, That thou
ſee in Diurnal Nativities, whether <hi>Cor
Leonis</hi> be in the Aſcendant, that is to ſay,
in the Oriental Line, or above it one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
or below it three degrees; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be in the tenth in like degrees,
without the Conjunction or Aſpect of any
of the Fortunes; for this alone ſignifies
that the Native ſhall be a perſon of great
note and power, too much exalted, and
attain to high perferment and honours,
although diſcended from the meaneſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
and if any of the Fortunes behold
that place alſo, his glory ſhall be the
more encreaſed: but if the Nativity be
Nocturnal, his Fortune will be ſomewhat
meaner, but not much; but if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
caſt their Aſpects there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will
ſtill be more mean; but if the Fortune
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42147:62"/>
behold it alſo, they will augment the good
promiſed a fourth part, and mitigate the
evil as much: yet ſtill whatever of all
this happens, it ſignifies that the Native
ſhall die an unhappy death; or at leaſt,
that all his honours, greatneſs and power,
ſhall at laſt ſuffer an eclipſe, and ſet in a
cloud.</p>
                  <p>The 146th Conſideration is, That thou
take the place of the Lord of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
and the place of the Lord of the
twelfth, and ſubſtracting the leſſer from
the greater, add to the remainder the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of the Sign aſcending and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
from the Aſcending; and where the
number falls, the Lord of that Sign ſhall
be Partner with the Lord of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and ſhall be called the Principal
Partner. Again, take the place of the
Lord of the ſaid Sign, and the place of
the Lord of the part of Fortune, and
ſubſtracting the leſſer from the greater,
add the degrees of the Sign aſcending;
and where the number falls, the Lord of
that Sign ſhall be another Partner, and
be called the Secondary Partner: which
if it happen to be the ſame Planet,
regard only that; but if different, then
take both, and ſubſtract the leſſer from
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42147:62"/>
the greater, and add the degrees of the
Sign aſcending, and the Planet on whoſe
Houſe the number falls ſhall be the third
Partner; and which of thoſe three is the
ſtrongeſt, ſhall be the chiefeſt ſharer in the
ſignification of the thing enquired after.
If all the remainders, or two of them,
ſhall happen on the Houſe of one Planet
that ſhall be preferred. If the Queſtion
ſeem good, and thoſe Partners are ill
diſpoſed, they will diminiſh of the good
ſignified by the Queſtion, and ſo on the
contrary: but if the Queſtion ſeem evil,
and they are well diſpoſed, they will allay
and mirigate the evil ſignified by the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and ſo likewiſe on the contrary.</p>
                  <p>There are many other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
which might be
added to theſe, but it would
render Art too perplext and
intricate; we therefore leave
them, as leſs material to the
Students induſtry, to obſerve
them in their due time and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42147:63"/>
place, as they happen; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his care and diligence will
not fail of a reward in advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
diſcoveries of truth,
worthy his pains.</p>
