            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherein I have obſerved the good <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature</hi> of the <hi>Ayre</hi>; the <hi>Fruitfulneſs</hi> of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50943:4"/>
the <hi>Soyl</hi>; the pleaſant and commodious <hi>ſeats</hi> for <hi>habitation</hi>; the ſafe and large <hi>Ports</hi> and <hi>Havens</hi> lying open for Traffick, into all the Weſt parts of the World; the long <hi>Inlets</hi> of many Navigable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſo many great <hi>Lakes,</hi> and freſh Ponds within the Land; (as the like are not to be ſeen in any part of <hi>Europe</hi>) the rich <hi>Fiſhings,</hi> and Wilde <hi>Fowl</hi> of all kinds; and laſtly, the <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Mindes</hi> of the people, endued with extraordinary abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Nature.</p>
            <p>THe obſervation whereof, hath bred in me ſome curioſity, to conſider, what were the true cauſes, why <hi>this Kingdom,</hi> whereof our Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have borne the Title of <hi>Soveraign Lords,</hi> for the ſpace of four hundred and odde years (a period of time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in divers great Monarchies have riſen from Barbariſm to Civility, and fallen again to ruine) was not in al that ſpace of time, thoroughly ſubdued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Obedience of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> although there hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a continual War between the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50943:4"/>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi>; and why the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the meer <hi>Iriſh</hi> are ſo little alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, as appeareth by the deſcription made by <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis,</hi> (who lived and wrote in that time) albeit, there have been ſince that time, ſo many <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Colonies</hi> planted in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as that, if the people were numbered at this day by the poll, ſuch as are deſcended of Engliſh race, would be found more in number than the ancient Natives.</p>
            <p>AND truly, upon conſideration of the conduct and paſſage of affairs in former times, I find, that the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ought to be cleared of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, which a vulgar errour hath caſt upon it, in one point; namely, <hi>That</hi> Ireland <hi>long ſince might have been ſubdued and reduced to</hi> Civility, <hi>if ſome States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in policy, had not thought it more fit to continue that Realm in Barbariſm.</hi> Doubtleſs, this vulgar opinion (or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) hath no true ground, but did firſt ariſe either out of Ignorance, or out of Malice. For it will appear by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50943:5"/>
that which ſhall hereafter be laid down in this Diſcourſe, that ever ſince <hi>Our Nation</hi> had any footing in this Land, the State of <hi>England</hi> did earneſtly deſire, and I did accordingly endeavour from time to time, to perfect the Conqueſt of this Kingdom, but that in every age there were found ſuch impediments and defects in both Realms, as cauſed almoſt an impoſſibility, that things ſhould have been otherwiſe than they were.</p>

               </note>BUt let us ſee the ſucceſs of King Henry the Second, doubtleſs his expedition was ſuch, as he might have ſaid with <hi>Caeſar, veni, vidi, vici.</hi> For, upon his firſt arrival, his very <hi>Preſence</hi> without drawing his Sword, prevailed ſo much, as all the <hi>Petty-Kings,</hi> or <hi>great Lords</hi> within <hi>Leinſter, Conaght,</hi> and <hi>Mounſter,</hi> ſubmitted themſelves unto him, promiſed to pay him tribute, and acknowledged him their chief and Soveraign Lord. Beſides, the better to aſſure this inconſtant Sea-Nymph, who was ſo eaſily wonne, the Pope would needs give her unto him with a Ring, <hi>Conjugio jungam stabili, propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am<expan>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50943:8"/>
Chriſt all the Kingdoms of the earth; ſo the Iriſh pretend, <hi>That by their Law, a Taniſt might do no act that might bind his ſucceſſor.</hi> But this was the beſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he could get from ſo many ſtrong Nations of people, with ſo weak a power: and yet he was ſo well pleaſed with this title of the <hi>Lordſhip of Ireland,</hi> as he placed it in his <hi>Royal Stile,</hi> before the Dutchies of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Aquitain.</hi> And ſo being advertiſed of ſome ſtirs raiſed by his unnatural Sons in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> within five months after his firſt arrival, he departed out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> without ſtriking one blow, or build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Caſtle, or planting one Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon among the Iriſh, neither left he behind him one true ſubject more than thoſe he found there at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, which were only the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Adventurers</hi> ſpoken of before, who had gained the Port Towns in <hi>Leinſter</hi> and <hi>Mounſter,</hi> and poſſeſſed ſome ſcopes of Land thereunto adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, partly by <hi>Strongbow's</hi> alliance with the Lord of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and partly, by plain invaſion and Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50943:9"/>And this is that Conqueſt of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, ſo much ſpoken of, by ſo many Writers, which, though it were in no other manner than is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſſed, yet is the entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> attributed unto him.</p>
            <p>But the troth is, the conqueſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> was made by peice and peice, by ſlow ſteps and degrees, and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral attempts, in ſeveral ages. There were ſundry revolutions, as well of the Engliſh fortunes, as of the Iriſh; ſome-whiles one prevailing, ſome-whiles the other, and it was never brought to a full period, till his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty that now is, came to the Crown.</p>
            <p>As for King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, he was far from obtaining that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy Royal, and true Soveraignty which His Majeſty (who now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) hath over the Iriſh. For the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Lords did only promiſe to become Tributaries to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. And ſuch as pay on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore, though King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond had the title of <hi>Soveraign Lord</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Iriſh, yet did he not put thoſe things in execution, which are the true marks and differences of <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</hi>

            <p>For they governed their people by the <hi>Brehon Law,</hi> they made their own Magiſtrates and Officers, they pardoned
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50943:10"/>
and puniſhed all Malefactors within their ſeveral Countries, they made war and peace one with another, without controulment, and this they did, not only during the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, but afterwards in all times, even until the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>: and it appeareth what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Subjects theſe Iriſh Lords were, by the Concord made between King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and <hi>Roderick</hi> ô <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> the Iriſh King of <hi>Conaght,</hi> in the year 1175.<note place="margin">

there was no army tranſmitted out of <hi>England,</hi> to finiſh the Conqueſt.

            <p>With theſe humilities they ſatisfied the young King, and by their bowing and bending, avoided the preſent ſtorm, and ſo brake that Army, which was prepared to break them.

for want of victuals and carriages, ſo as he performed no memorable thing in that journey; only in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanaghes</hi> Country, he cut and cleared the paces, and beſtowed the honour of Knighthood upon the Lord <hi>Henry,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lancaſters</hi> ſon, who was afterwards King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and ſo came to <hi>Dublin,</hi>

bound by Recognizance with ſureties, to continue a Loyal Subject.

            <p>BUt perhaps, the Iriſhry in former times did wilfully refuſe to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and would not be partakers of the benefit thereof, though the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did deſire; and therefore, they

            <p>THis then I note as a great defect in the civil policy of this Kingdom, in that for the ſpace of three hundred and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50943:56"/>
fifty years at leaſt after the Conqueſt firſt attempted, the Engliſh laws were not communicated to the Iriſh, nor the benefit and protection thereof allowed unto them, though they earneſtly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſought the ſame. For, as long as they were out of the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law; ſo as every Engliſh-man might oppreſs, ſpoil, and kill them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controulment, how was it poſſible they ſhould be other than Out-laws and Enemies to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>? If the King would not admit them to the condition of Subjects, how could they learn to acknowledge and obey him as their Soveraign? When they might not converſe or Commerce with any Civil Men, nor enter into any Town or City without peril of their Lives; whither ſhould they flye but into the Woods and Mountains, and there live in a wilde and barbarous manner? If the Engliſh Magiſtrates would not rule them by the Law, which doth puniſh Treaſon, and Murder, and Theft with death; but leave them to be ruled by their own Lords and Laws, why ſhould
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50943:56"/>
they not embrace their own <hi>Brehon</hi> Law, which puniſheth no offence, but with a Fine or <hi>Ericke?</hi> If the Iriſh be not permitted to purchaſe Eſtates of Free-holds or Inheritance, which might deſcend to their Children, according to the courſe of our Common Law, muſt they not continue their cuſtom of <hi>Taniſtrie?</hi> which makes all their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions uncertain, and brings Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Barbariſm, and Incivility? In a word, if the Engliſh would neither in peace Govern them by the Law, nor could in war root them out by the ſword; muſt they not needs be pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their ſides, till the worlds end? and ſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt never be brought to perfection.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50943:58"/>
can never be Unity and Concord in any one Kingdom, but where there is but one King, one Allegiance, and one Law.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Engliſh Laws were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted only in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies.</note>TRue it is, that King <hi>John</hi> made twelve ſhires in <hi>Leinſter</hi> and <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>: namely, <hi>Dublin, Kildare, Meth, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riel, Catherlogh, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, Corke, Limerick, Kerrie,</hi> and <hi>Tipperary.</hi> Yet theſe Counties did ſtretch no farther than the Lands of the Engliſh Colonies did extend.

By which Writ, and by all the Pipe-Rolls of that time it is manifeſt, that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were publiſhed and put in execution only in the Counties, which were then made and limited, and not in the Iriſh Countries, which were neglected and

            <p>Again, true it is that by the Statute of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> enacted in this Kingdom, in the fortieth year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, the <hi>Brehon</hi> Law was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and aboliſhed, and the uſe and practice thereof made High-Treaſon. But this Law extended to the Engliſh only, and not to the Iriſh: For the Law is penned in this form: Item, <hi>Foraſmuch as the diverſity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by divers Laws in one Land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Statut. de Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny. c.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>doth make diverſity of ligeance and debates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the people, It is accorded and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, that hereafter no Engliſh man have debate with another Engliſh man, but according to the courſe of the Common Law; And that no Engliſh man be ruled in the definition of their debates, by the March-Law, or the Brehon Law, which by reaſon ought not to be named a Law, but an evil Custom; but that they be ruled as right is, by the common Law of the Land, as the Lieges of our Soveraign Lord the King; And if any do to the contrary
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50943:59"/>
and thereof be attainted, that he be taken and impriſoned and judged as a Traytor: And that hereafter there be no diverſity of ligeance between the Engliſh born in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and the Engliſh born in</hi> England, <hi>but that all be called and reputed Engliſh, and the Lieges of our Soveraign Lord the KING,</hi> &amp;c. This Law, was made only to reform the degenerate Engliſh, but there was no care taken for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the meer Iriſh; no Ordinance, no proviſion made for the aboliſhing of their barbarous Cuſtoms and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Inſomuch as the Law then made for Apparel, and riding in Saddles, after the Engliſh faſhion, is penal only to Engliſh men, and not to the Iriſh.

And therefore King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, by the Statutes of 27. and 32. of his raign, did revive and recontinue that Noble work begun by King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt; and brought it indeed to full perfection; For he united the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Wales,</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and divided it into Shires, and erected in every Shire, one Burrough, as in <hi>England</hi>; and enabled them to ſend Knights and Burgeſſes to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; eſtabliſhed a Court of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and orda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50943:73"/>
undertake it not royally at their own charge; but as it was firſt begun by particular Adventurers, ſo they left the proſecution thereof, to them, and other voluntaries, who came to ſeek their fortunes in <hi>Ireland</hi>; wherein if they could prevail, they thought that in reaſon and honour they could do no leſs, than make them proprietors of ſuch ſcopes of Land as they could conquer, people, and plant at their own charge, reſerving only the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lordſhip to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

            </p>
            <p>But when King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, came in perſon with his army thither, kept his reſidence and Court there; made the reducing of <hi>Wales,</hi> an enterprize of his own; he finiſhed that work in a year or two, whereof the <hi>Lords Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> had not performed a third part, with their continual bordering war, for two hundred years before.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50943:75"/>
with whole Countries or Counties, but with particular Mannors and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips: as to <hi>Henry Lacy</hi> Earl of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> he gave the Lordſhip of <hi>Denbigh</hi>; and to <hi>Reignold Gray,</hi> the Lordſhip of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> and ſo to others. And if the like courſe had been uſed in the winning and diſtributing the lands of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Iſland had been fully conquered before the continent of <hi>Wales</hi> had been reduced. But the troth is, when Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men attempt the Conqueſt of Countries at their own charge, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly their enterprizes do periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs: as when, in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to recover the <hi>Ardes</hi>: and <hi>Chatterton,</hi> to reconquer then <hi>Fues</hi> and <hi>Orier.</hi> The one loſt his Son; and the other, Himſelf; and both their Adventures came to nothing. And as for the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> it hath had the like fortune in the Conqueſt of this land, as ſome purchaſers have; who deſire to buy land at too eaſie a Rate: they finde thoſe cheap pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes ſo full of trouble, as they ſpend

twice as much as the Land is worth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they get the quiet poſſeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>And as the beſt pollicy was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the diſtribution of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Lands; ſo as I conceive, that the firſt Adventurers, intending to make a full Conqueſt of the Iriſh, were deceived in the choiſe of the <hi>fitteſt places for their plantation.</hi> For they ſate down, and erected their Caſtles and Habitations in the <hi>Plains and open Countries</hi>; where they found moſt fruitful and profitable Lands, and turned the Iriſh into the <hi>Woods and Mountains</hi>: Which, as they were proper places for Out-Laws and Thieves, ſo were they their Natural Caſtles and Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; thither they drave their preys and ſtealths: there they lurkt, and lay in wait to do miſchief. Theſe faſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they kept unknown, by making the wayes and Entries thereunto impaſſible; there they kept their Creaghts or Heardes of Cattle, living by the milke of the Cow, without Husbandry or Tillage; there they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50943:76"/>
and multiplied unto infinite numbers by promiſcuous generation among themſelves; there they made their Aſſemblies and Conſpiracies without diſcovery: But they diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the weakneſs of the Engliſh dwelling in the open plains; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made their ſallies and retreats with great advantage. Whereas, on the other ſide, if the Engliſh had build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Caſtles and Towns in thoſe places of faſtneſs, and had driven the Iriſh into the Plains and open Countries, where they might have had an eye and obſervation upon them, the Iriſh had been eaſily kept in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in ſhort time reclaimed from their wildeneſs; there they would have uſed Tillage, dwelt together in Town-ſhips, and learned Mechanical Arts and Sciences. The woods had been waſted with the Engliſh Habitations, as they are about the Forts of <hi>Maribo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> and <hi>Philipston,</hi> which were built in the faſteſt places in <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and the wayes and paſſages throughout <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> would have been as clear and

open, as they are in <hi>England</hi> at this day.</p>
            <p>AGain, if King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">The Engliſh Lords did not reduce the woods and waſts in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and Parks <hi>Chart. de foreſt. c.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 3.</note> who is ſaid to be the King that Conquered this Land, had made For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as he did enlarge the Forreſts in <hi>England</hi> (for it appeareth by <hi>Charta de Foreſta,</hi> that he afforreſted many woods and waſts, to the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Subject, which by that Law were diſaforreſted,) or if thoſe Engliſh Lords, amongſt whom the whole Kingdom was divided, had been good Hunters, and had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Mountains, Boggs, and Woods within the limits of Forreſts, Chaſes, and Parks; aſſuredly, the very Forreſt Law, and the Law <hi>de Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factoribus in parcis,</hi> would in time have driven them into the Plains and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries inhabited and manured, and have made them yield up their faſt places to thoſe wilde Beaſts, which were indeed leſs hurtful and wilde than they. But it ſeemeth ſtrange to me, that in all the Records of this

Howbeit, notwithſtanding theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Errours, the Engliſh Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſtood and maintained themſelves in a reaſonable good eſtate, as long as they retained their own ancient Laws and cuſtoms, according to

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50943:85"/>
which did continually hang over their heads, have been the cauſe, that the Iriſh were ever the moſt inquiſitive people after news, of any Nation in the World.

            <p>This Extortion of <hi>Coigne</hi> and <hi>Livery,</hi> was taken for the maintenance of their men of War; but their Iriſh exactions extorted by the Chieftains and <hi>Taniſts,</hi> by colour of their barbarous Seignory, were almoſt as grievous a burthen as the other;<note place="margin">Coſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> namely <hi>Coſherings,</hi> which were viſitations and progreſſes made by the Lord and his followers, among his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: wherein he did eat them (as the Engliſh Proverb is) <hi>Out of Houſe and home.</hi>

            <p>But ſuch a general cuſtom in a Kingdom, in giving and taking chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Foſter, making ſuch a firm alliance as it doth in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

            <p>Now theſe two Cuſtoms, which of themſelves are indifferent in other Kingdoms, became exceeding evil and full of miſchief in this Realm, by reaſon of the inconveniences which followed thereupon.

            <p>This hapned in the tenth year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, at what time the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was weaker, and

               </note> Then did the State of <hi>England</hi> ſend over <hi>John de Hotham</hi> to be Treaſurer here, with commiſſion to call the great Lords of <hi>Ireland</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and to take of them an Oath of Aſſociation, that they ſhould loyally joyn together in life and death to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the right of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and to expel the common enemy.

               <hi>Livery</hi>; and the manifold miſchiefs it did produce, I think it fit and pertinent to inſert the preamble of the Statute of 10. of <hi>Henry</hi> ſeventh, <hi>c.</hi> 4. not printed, but recorded in Parliament Rols of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>At the requeſt and ſupplication of the Commons of this Land of</hi> Ireland, <hi>that where of long time there hath been uſed and exacted by the Lords and Gentlemen of this Land, many and divers damnable cuſtoms and uſages, which been called Coigne and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and Pay; that is, Horſe meat and Mans meat, for the finding of their Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Foot-men; and over that,</hi> 4. <hi>d. or</hi> 6. <hi>d. daily to every of them to be had and paid of the poor Earth Tillers, and Tenants, inhabitants of the ſaid Land, without any thing doing or paying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Beſides, many Murders, Robberies Rapes, and other manifold extortions and oppreſſions by the ſaid Horſemen and Footmen, daily and nightly committed and done; which been the principal cauſes of the deſolation and destruction of the ſaid Land, and hath brought the ſame into ruine and Decay, ſo as the

most part of the Engliſh Free-holders and Tenants of this Land been departed out thereof, ſome into the Realm of</hi> England, <hi>and other ſome to other ſtrange Lands; whereupon the foreſaid Lords and Gentlemen of this Land, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded into the ſaid Free-holders and Tenants inheritances; and the ſame keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and occupieth as their own inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances; and ſetten under them in the ſame Land the Kings Iriſh Enemies, to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing of Holy Churches Rites, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriſon of the King, and his obedient Subjects, and the utter ruine and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Land.

But to return to <hi>Thomas Fitz-Maurice</hi> of <hi>Deſmond</hi>; By this extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Coigne</hi> and <hi>Livery,</hi> he ſuddainly grew from a mean, to a mighty eſtate; inſomuch as the <hi>Baron Finglas</hi> in his diſcourſe of the decay of <hi>Ireland,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth; that his ancient inheritance being not one thouſand marks yearly, he became able to diſpend every way,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50943:91"/>
ten thouſand pounds, <hi>per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe poſſeſſions being thus unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gotten, could not be maintained by the juſt and honourable Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which would have reſtored the true Owners to their Land again. And therefore, this Great man found no means to continue and uphold his ill-purchaſed greatneſs, but by rejecting the Engliſh Law and Government, and aſſuming in lieu thereof, the barbarous cuſtoms of the Iriſh. And hereupon, followed the defection of thoſe four ſhires, containing the greateſt part of <hi>Munſter,</hi> from the obedience of the Law.</p>
            <p>In like manner (ſaith Baron <hi>Finglas</hi>) the Lord of <hi>Tipperary</hi> (perceiving how well the houſe of <hi>Deſmond</hi> had thrived by <hi>Coigne</hi> and <hi>Livery,</hi> and other Iriſh exactions) began to hold the like courſe in the Counties of <hi>Tipperary</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny</hi>; whereby he got great ſcopes of Land, eſpecially in <hi>Ormond</hi>; and raiſed many Iriſh exactions upon the Engliſh Free-holders there; which made him ſo potent and abſolute among
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50943:92"/>
them, as at that time they knew no other Law, than the will of their Lord. Beſides, finding, that the Earl of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> excluded the ordinary Miniſters of Juſtice, under colour of a Royal liberty, which he claimed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Kerry, Corke,</hi> and <hi>Waterford,</hi> by a grant of King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, (as appeareth in a <hi>Quo warranto,</hi> brought againſt him, <hi>Anno</hi> 12. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.) the Record whereof, remaineth in <hi>Breminghams</hi> Tower, among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Plea-Rolls there.</p>
            <p>This Lord alſo, in the third of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third, obtained a Grant of the like liberty in the County of <hi>Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perary,</hi> whereby he got the Law into his own hands, and ſhut out the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law and Juſtice of the Realm.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſee that all <hi>Munster</hi> fell away from the Engliſh law and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the end of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, his raign; and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third.

For from thenceforth they reclaimed a ſtrange priviledge, <hi>That the Earls of</hi> Deſmond <hi>ſhould never come to any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Grand Council, or within any walled Town, but at their will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:50943:98"/>
Which pretended Priviledge, <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> the Father of <hi>Girald</hi> the laſt Earl, renounced and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred by his Deed, in the Chancery of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the 32 of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth. At what time, among the meer Iriſhry, he ſubmitted himſelf to Sir <hi>Anthony Saint-Leger,</hi> then Lord Deputy; took an Oath of Allegiace, Covenanted that he would ſuffer the Law of <hi>England</hi> to be executed in his Countrey; and aſſiſt the Kings Judges in their Circuits: and if any Subſidies ſhould be granted by Parliament, he would permit the ſame to be levied upon his Tenents and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. Which Covenants, are as ſtrange as the priviledge it ſelf, ſpoken of before. But that which I conceive moſt worthy of Obſervation, upon the fortunes of the houſe of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> is this; that as <hi>Maurice Fitz-Thomas,</hi> the firſt Earl, did firſt raiſe the greatneſs of that houſe, by Iriſh exactions and oppreſſions; ſo <hi>Girald</hi> the laſt Earl, did at laſt ruine and reduce it to nothing, by uſing the like extortions.

And after his death, when the wars between the Houſes were in their heat, almoſt all the good Engliſh blood, which was left in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was ſpent in thoſe civil diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſo as the Iriſh became victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

over all, <hi>without blood or ſweat.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that little Canton of Land, called the Engliſh Pale, containing four ſmall Shires, did maintain a bordering was with the Iriſh, and retain the forme of Engliſh Government.</p>
            <p>But out of that little Precinct, there were no Lords, Knights, or Burgeſſes, ſummoned to the Parliament, neither did the Kings Writ run in any other part of the Kingdom: and yet upon the Marches and Borders, which at that time were grown ſo large, as they took up half <hi>Dublin,</hi> half <hi>Meath,</hi> and a third part of <hi>Kildare</hi> and <hi>Lowth</hi>; there was no law in uſe, but the <hi>March-Law,</hi> which in the Statutes of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> is ſaid to be no law, but a leud Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>So as upon the end of theſe civil wars in <hi>England,</hi> the Engliſh Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was well nigh baniſht out of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The courſe of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion held by Sir <hi>Edward Poynings,</hi> in the time of K. <hi>Hen</hi> 7.</note> ſo as no foot-ſtep or print was left, of any former Reformation.</p>
            <p>THen did King <hi>Henry</hi> 7. ſend over Sir <hi>Edward Poynings</hi> to be his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a right worthy ſervitor both in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50943:108"/>
war and peace. The principal end of his employment, was to expel <hi>Perkin Warbecke</hi> out of this Kingdom; but that ſervice being performed, that worthy Deputy finding nothing but a common miſery, took the beſt courſe he poſſibly could, to eſtabliſh a Common-wealth in <hi>Ireland:</hi> and to that end, he held a Parliament no leſs famous, than that of <hi>Kilkenny</hi>; and more available for the reformation of the whole Kingdom. For whereas all wiſe men did ever concur in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the readieſt way to reform <hi>Ireland,</hi> is to ſettle a form of Civil Government there, conformable to that of <hi>England:</hi> To bring this to paſs, Sir <hi>Edward Poynings</hi> did paſs an Act, whereby all the Statutes made in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> before that time, were enacted, eſtabliſhed, and made of force in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Neither did he only reſpect the time paſt, but provided alſo for the time to come. For he cauſed another Law to be made, that no Act ſhould be propounded in any Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but ſuch as ſhould be firſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50943:109"/>
tranſmitted into <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Poynings</hi> Act.</note> and approved by the King and Council there, as good and expedient for that Land, and ſo returned back again, under the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> This Act, though it ſeem <hi>Prima facie</hi> to reſtrain the liberty of the Subjects of <hi>Ireland</hi>; yet was it made at the Prayer of the Commons, upon juſt and important cauſe.</p>
            <p>For the Governors of that Realm, ſpecially ſuch as were of that Country Birth, had laid many oppreſſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Commons: and amongſt the reſt, they had impoſed Laws upon them, nor tending to the general good, but to ſerve private turns, and to ſtrengthen their particular facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This moved them to refer all Laws that were to be paſſed in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to be conſidered, corrected and allowed, firſt by the State of <hi>England,</hi> which had alwayes been tender and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the good of this people, and had long ſince made them a Civil, Rich, and Happy Nation, if their own Lords and Governors there, had not ſent bad intelligence into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:50943:109"/>
Beſides this, he took ſpecial order, that the ſummons of Parliament ſhould go into all the ſhires of <hi>Ireland</hi>; and not to the four ſhires onely; and for that cauſe ſpecially, he cauſed all the Acts of a Parliament, lately before holden by the <hi>Viſcount</hi> of <hi>Gormanston</hi> to be repealed and made void. Moreover, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of <hi>Ireland,</hi> might want no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or honorable form that was uſed in <hi>England,</hi> he cauſed a particular Act to paſs, that the Lords of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould appear in the like Parliament Robes, as the Engliſh Lords are wont to wear in the <hi>Parliaments of England.</hi> Having thus eſtabliſhed all the Statutes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſet in order the great Council of that Realm, he did not omit to paſs other Laws, as well for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Kings Revenue, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the publick peace.</p>
            <p>To advance the profits of the Crown; Firſt he obtained a Subſidy of 26 ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings eight pence out of every ſix ſcore acres manured, payable yearly for five years. Next, he reſumed all the <hi>Crownland</hi> which had been aliened (for the moſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50943:110"/>
part) by <hi>Richard Duke of York:</hi> and laſtly, he procured a Subſidy of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> out of all Merchandizes imported and exported, to be granted to the Crown in perpetuity.</p>
            <p>To preſerve the publick peace, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the Statutes of <hi>Kilkenny.</hi> He made wilful Murther High-treaſon; he cauſed the Marchers to book their men for whom they ſhould anſwer; and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the making War or Peace, without ſpecial Commiſſion from the State.</p>
            <p>Theſe Laws, and others as important as theſe, for the making of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in <hi>Ireland,</hi> were made in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Sir <hi>Edward Poynings.</hi> But theſe Laws did not ſpread their Vertue beyond the Engliſh Pale, though they were made generally for the whole <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> For the <hi>Provinces</hi> without the Pale, which during the War of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> had wholly caſt off the the Engliſh Government, were not apt to receive this ſeed of Reformation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not firſt broken and maſtered again with the ſword. Beſides, the Iriſh Countreys, which contained
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50943:110"/>
two third parts of the Kingdom, were not reduced to Shire-ground, ſo as in them the Laws of <hi>England</hi> could not poſſibly be put in execution. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe good Laws and proviſions made by Sir <hi>Edward Poynings,</hi> were like good Leſſons ſet for a Lute, that is broken and out of tune; of which Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, little uſe can be made, till the Lute be made fit to be plaid upon.</p>
            <p>And that the execution of all theſe Laws, had no greater latitude than the Pale, is manifeſt by the Statute of the thirteenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. which reciteth, that at that time, the Kings Laws were obeyed and executed in the four ſhires onely; and yet then was the <hi>Earl of Surrey Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of Ireland,</hi> a Governor much fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Kings Enemies, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly honored and beloved of the Kings ſubjects.

            <p>Theſe Ordinances of State being made and publiſhed, there were nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and appointed in every Province, certain Orderers or Arbitrators, who inſtead of theſe Iriſh <hi>Brehons,</hi> ſhould hear and determine all their Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. In <hi>Conaght,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Clonfert,</hi> Captain <hi>Wakeley,</hi> &amp; Captain <hi>Ovington.</hi> In <hi>Munſter,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Waterford,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Roſs,</hi> the Mayor of <hi>Cork,</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:50943:114"/>
and Mayor of <hi>Youghal.</hi> In <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Lowth.</hi> And if any difference did ariſe which they could not end, either for the difficulty of the cauſe, or for the obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the parties, they were to certifie the Lord Deputy &amp; Council, who would decide the matter by their Authority.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, the Iriſh Captains of leſſer Territories, which had ever been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the greater and mightier; ſome, with riſings out, others, with <hi>Bonaght,</hi> and others, with <hi>Cuttings,</hi> and ſpendings at pleaſure, did appeal for Juſtice to the Lord Deputy; who upon hearing their complaints, did always or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they ſhould all immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the King; and that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould have no dependancy upon the ſtronger.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he prevailed ſo much with the greateſt of them; namely, <hi>O Neal, O Brien,</hi> and <hi>Mac William,</hi> as that they willingly did paſs into <hi>England,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves to the King, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was pleaſed to advance them to the degree and honor of Earls, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50943:114"/>
to grant unto them their ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, by <hi>Letters-patents.</hi> Beſides, that they might learn Obedience and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of manners, by often repairing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the State, the King upon the motion of the ſame Deputy, gave each of them a houſe and lands neer <hi>Dublin,</hi> for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of their ſeveral trains.</p>
            <p>This courſe, did this Governor take to reform the Iriſhry; but withal, he did not omit to advance both the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and profit of the King. For in the Parliament which he held the 33 of <hi>Hen.</hi> the eighth, he cauſed an Act to paſs, which gave unto K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, his Heirs and Succeſſors, the Name, Stile, and Title of King of <hi>Ireland</hi>; whereas before that time, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were ſtiled but <hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi>: albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it indeed, they were abſolute <hi>Monarchs</hi> thereof, and had in right all Royal and Imperial Juriſdiction and power there, as they had in the Realm of <hi>England.</hi> And yet becauſe in the vulgar conceit the name of <hi>King,</hi> is higher than the name of <hi>Lord</hi>; Aſſuredly, the aſſuming of this Title, hath not a little raiſed
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50943:115"/>
the Soveraignty of the King of <hi>England</hi> in the mindes of this people: laſtly, this Deputy brought a great augmentation to the Kings Revenue, by diſſolving of all the Monaſteries and Religious Houſes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was done in the ſame Parliament: and afterward, by procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Min</hi> and <hi>Cavendiſh,</hi> two skilful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, to be ſent over out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Who took an exact ſurvey of all the poſſeſſions of the Crown, and brought many things into charge, which had been concealed and ſubſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for many years before. And thus far did Sir <hi>Anthony Saint Leger</hi> proceed in the courſe of Reformation; which though it were a good beginning, yet was it far from reducing <hi>Ireland</hi> to the perfect obedience of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> For all this while, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Conaght</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> and a good part of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> were not reduced to Shire-ground. And though <hi>Munſter</hi> were anciently divided into Counties, the people were ſo degenerate, as no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Aſſize durſt execute his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion amongſt them. None of the

Iriſh Lords or Tenants were ſetled in their poſſeſſions, by any Grant or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from the Crown, except the three great Earls before named; who notwithſtanding, did govern their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Followers, by the Iriſh or <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon</hi> Law; ſo as no treaſon, murther, rape, or theft, committed in thoſe Countries, was inquired of, or puniſht by the Law of <hi>England</hi>; and conſequently, no Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat, Forfeiture, or Fine; no Revenue (certain or caſual) did accrew to the Crown out of thoſe Provinces.</p>

the twelfth year of King <hi>John</hi>; at what time the Territories then poſſeſſed by the Engliſh Colonies, were reduced into twelve Shires, as is before expreſſed.</p>
            <p>This Noble Earl, having thus extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Juriſdiction of the Engliſh Law into two Counties more, was not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with that addition, but took a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to divide all the reſt of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Countries un-reduced, into ſeveral Shires; and to that end, he cauſed an Act to paſs in the ſame Parliament, authoriſing the Lord Chancellor, from time to time, to award Commiſſions to ſuch Perſons, as the Lord Deputy ſhould nominate and appoint, to view and perambulate thoſe Iriſh Territories; and thereupon, to divide and limit the ſame into ſuch and ſo many ſeveral Counties as they ſhould think meet; which being certified to the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, and approved by him, ſhould be returned and enrolled in the Chancery, and from thenceforth be of like force and effect, as if it were done by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thus did the Earl of <hi>Suſſex</hi> lay open
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50943:116"/>
a paſſage for the Civil Government into the unreformed parts of this Kingdom, but himſelf proceeded no further than is before delared.</p>
            <p>HOwbeit afterwards,<note place="margin">The courſe of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Sir <hi>Henry Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> in the time of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
               </note> during the Raign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> (who hath left behind him many Monuments of a good Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in this Land) did not only purſue that courſe which the Earl of <hi>Suſſex</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, in reducing the Iriſh Countries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Shires, and placing therein Sheriffs, and other Miniſters of the Law; (for firſt he made the <hi>Annaly</hi> a Territory in <hi>Leinſter,</hi> poſſeſſed by the Sept of <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralles,</hi> one entire Shire by it ſelf, and called it the County of <hi>Longford</hi>; and after that he divided the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Conaght</hi> into ſix Counties more; namely, <hi>Clare</hi> (which containeth all <hi>Thomond</hi>) <hi>Gallaway, Sligo, Mayo, Roſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Leytrim</hi>:) But he alſo had cauſed divers good Laws to be made, and performed ſundry other ſervices, tending greatly to the reformation of this Kingdom. For firſt, to diminiſh
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50943:117"/>
the greatneſs of the Iriſh Lords, and to take from them the dependancy of the Common people, in the Parliament which he held 11. <hi>Eliz.</hi> He did aboliſh their pretended and uſurped Captain-ſhips, and all exactions, and extortions incident thereunto. Next, to ſettle their Seigniories and poſſeſſions in a courſe of inheritance, according to the courſe of the Common law, he cauſed an Act to paſs, whereby the Lord Deputy was authoriſed to accept their Surrenders, and to regrant eſtates unto them, to hold of the Crown by Engliſh tenures and ſervices. Again, becauſe the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſort were looſe and poor, and not ameſuable to the law; he provided by another Act, that five of the beſt and eldeſt perſons of every Sept, ſhould bring in all the idle perſons of their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, to be juſtified by the law. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, to give a civil education to the Youth of this Land in the time to come, proviſion was made by another Law, that there ſhould be one Free ſchoole, at leaſt, erected in every Dioceſs of the Kingdom. And laſtly, to inure and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50943:117"/>
the people of <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght,</hi> with the Engliſh Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain (which had not been in uſe among them, for the ſpace of 200. years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:) he inſtituted two Preſidency Courts in thoſe two Provinces, placing Sir <hi>Edward Fitton</hi> in <hi>Conaght,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Perrot</hi> in <hi>Munſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To augment the Kings Revenue in the ſame Parliament, upon the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Shane O Neale,</hi> he reſumed and veſted in the Crown, more than half the Provinne of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster</hi>: He raiſed the cuſtoms upon the principal commodities of the Kingdom: He reformed the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Exchequer, by many good orders and inſtructions ſent out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and laſtly, he eſtabliſhed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Pale,</hi> in lieu of Purvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Seſs of Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Theſe were good proceedings in the work of Reformation, but there were many defects and omiſſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; for though he reduced all <hi>Conaght</hi> into Counties, he never ſent any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Aſſize to viſit that Province, but placed Commiſſioners there, who

governed it only in <hi>a courſe of diſcretion</hi>; part Martial, and part Civil. Again, in the Law that doth aboliſh the Iriſh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-ſhips, he gave way for the reviving thereof again, by excepting ſuch, as ſhould be granted by Letters Patents from the Crown; which exception did indeed take away the force of that law. For no Governor during Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Reign, did refuſe to grant any of thoſe Captain-ſhips, to any pretended <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lord, who would <hi>Deſire,</hi> and with his thankfulneſs <hi>Deſerve</hi> the ſame. And again, though the greateſt part of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> were veſted by Act of Parliament, in the actual and real poſſeſſion of the Crown; yet was there never any ſeiſure made thereof, nor any part thereof brought into charge, but the Iriſh were permitted to take all the profits, without rendering any duty or acknowledgement for the ſame; and though the Name of <hi>O Neale</hi> were damned by that Act, and the aſſuming thereof made High-Treaſon; yet after that, was <hi>Tirlagh Leynnagh</hi> ſuffered to bear that Title, and to intrude upon
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50943:119"/>
the poſſeſſions of the Crown, and yet was often entertained by the State with favour. Neither were theſe lands reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by the Act of II of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected only (for the Abbyes and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houſes in <hi>Tyrone, Tirconnell,</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managh,</hi> though they were diſſolved in the 33. of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. were never ſurveyed nor reduced into charge, but were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinualy poſſeſt by the religious perſons) untill His Majeſty that now is, came to the Crown: and that which is more ſtrange, the Donations of Biſhopricks, being a flower of the Crown (which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did ever retain in all their Dominions, when the Popes uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Authority was at the higheſt.) There were three Biſhopricks in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi>; namely, <hi>Derry, Rapho,</hi> and <hi>Clogher,</hi> which neither Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> nor any of her Progenitors did ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, though they were the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Patrons thereof. So as King <hi>James</hi> was the firſt King of <hi>England</hi> that did ever ſupply theſe Sees with Biſhops, which is an argument either of great negligence, or of great weakneſs in

the State and Governors of thoſe times. And thus far proceeded Sir <hi>Henry Sidney.</hi>

            </p>
            <q>Quae curſu interiore brevi convertitur orbe.</q>
            <p>UPon theſe Viſitations of Juſtice, whereby the iuſt and honourable Law of England was imparted and communicated to all the Iriſhry,<note place="margin">The good effects which followed the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Law through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Kingdom</hi>
               </note> there followed theſe excellent good effects:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the common people were taught by the Juſtices of Aſſize, that they were free Subjects to the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and not Slaves and Vaſſals to their pretended Lords: That the <hi>Cuttings, Coſheries, Seſſings,</hi> and other Extortions of their Lords, were unlawful, and that they ſhould not any more ſubmit themſelves thereunto, ſince they were now under the protection of ſo juſt and mighty a Prince, as both would and could protect them from all wrongs and oppreſſions: They gave a willing
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50943:126"/>
ear unto theſe Leſſons; and thereupon, the greatneſs and power of thoſe Iriſh Lords over the people, ſuddenly fell and vaniſhed, when their Oppreſſions and Extortions were taken away, which did maintain their greatneſs: Inſomuch, as divers of them, who formerly made themſelves Owners of all (by Force;) were now by the Law reduced to this point; That wanting means to defray their ordinary charges, they reſorted ordinarily to the Lord Deputy, and made Petition, that by Licenſe and Warrant of the State, they might take ſome aid and contribution from their people; as well to diſcharge their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer debts, as for competent mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in time to come: But ſome of them being impatient of this diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, fled out of the Realm to forreign Countreys. Whereupon, we may well obſerve, That, <hi>as Extortion did baniſh the old Engliſh Free-holder, who could not live but under the Law; So the Law did baniſh the Iriſh Lord, who could not live but by Extortion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, theſe Circuits of Juſtice (did
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50943:127"/>
(upon the end of the War) more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the looſe and idle perſons, than the execution of the Martial Law, though it were more quick and ſudden: and in a ſhort time after, did ſo clear the the Kingdom of Thieves, and other Capital Offendors, as I dare affirm, that for the ſpace of five years laſt paſt, there have not been found ſo many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors worthy of death in all the ſix Circuits of this Realm (which is now divided into thirty two ſhires at large) as in one Circuit of ſix ſhires; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Weſtern Circuit in <hi>England</hi>; for the truth is, that in time of Peace, the Iriſh are more fearful to offend the Law, than the Engliſh, or any other Nation whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Again, whereas the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that the Iriſh had of us in all their Rebellions, was, <hi>Our Ignorance of their Countreys, their Perſons, and their Actions</hi>: Since the Law and her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have had a paſſage among them, all their places of Faſtneſs have been diſcovered and laid open; all their paces cleared; and notice taken of every
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50943:127"/>
perſon that is able to do either good or hurt. It is known, not onely how they live, and what they do, but it is foreſeen what they purpoſe or intend to do: Inſomuch, as <hi>Tyrone</hi> hath been heard to complain, that he had ſo many eyes watching over him, as he could not drink a full Carouſe of Sack, but the State was advertized thereof, within few hours after. And therefore, thoſe allowances which I finde in the ancient Pipe Rolls, <hi>Pro guidagio, &amp; ſpiagio,</hi> may be well ſpared at this day. For the Under-Sheriffs and Bailiffs errant are better Guides and Spies in the time of Peace, than any were found in the time of War.</p>
            <p>Moreover, theſe Civil Aſſemblies at Aſſizes and Seſſions, have reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Iriſh from their Wildneſs, cauſed them to cut off their Glibs and long Hair; to convert their Mantles into Cloaks; to conform themſelves to the manner of <hi>England</hi> in all their behaviour and outward forms. And becauſe they finde a great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in moving their ſuits by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50943:128"/>
they do for the moſt part ſend their Children to Schools, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to learn the Engliſh Language: ſo as we may conceive and hope, that the next generation, will in tongue and heart, and every way elſe, become Engliſh; ſo as there will be no difference or diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the Iriſh Sea betwixt us. And thus we ſee a good converſion, and the <hi>Iriſh Game turned again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For heretofore, the neglect of the Law, made the Engliſh degenerate, and become Iriſh; and now, on the other ſide, the execution of the Law, doth make the Iriſh grow civil, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, theſe general Seſſions now, do teach the people more obedience, and keep them more in awe, than did the general Hoſtings in former times. Theſe Progreſſes of the Law, renew and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> every half year, and ſupply the defect of the Kings abſence in every part of the Realm; In that every Judge ſitting in the Seat of Juſtice, doth repreſent the perſon of the King himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:50943:128"/>Theſe effects, hath the eſtabliſhment of the Publick Peace and Juſtice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, ſince his Majeſties happy Reign began.</p>
            <p>Howbeit,<note place="margin">3. The ſetling of the ſtates and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of the Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as well as of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</note> it was impoſſible to make a Common-Weal in <hi>Ireland,</hi> without performing another ſervice; which was, the ſetling of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Poſſeſſions, as well of Iriſh, as Engliſh, thoroughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>For, although that in the twelfth year of Queen ELIZABETH, a ſpecial Law, was made, which did enable the Lord Deputy to take Surrenders, and regrant Eſtates unto the Iriſhry (upon ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Her Majeſties pleaſure in that behalf;) yet were there but few of the Iriſh Lords that made offer to ſurrender during her Reign; and they which made Surrenders of entire Countreys, obtained Grants of the whole again to themſelves onely, and to no other, and all in Demeſn. In paſſing of which Grants, there was no care taken of the Inferiour Septs of people, inhabiting and poſſeſſing

theſe Countreys under them, but they held their ſeveral portions in courſe of Taniſtry and Gavelkinde, and yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſame Iriſh Duties or Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they did before: So that upon every ſuch Surrender and Grant, there was but one Free-holder made in a whole Countrey, which was the Lord himſelf; all the reſt were but Tenants at Will, or rather Tenants in Villenage, and were neither fit to be ſworn in Juries, nor to perform any Publick ſervice: And by reaſon of the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their Eſtates did utterly neglect to build, or to plant, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Land. And therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lord were become the Kings Tenant, his Countrey was no whit reformed thereby, but remained in the former Barbariſm and Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Again, in the ſame Queens time, there were many Iriſh Lords, which did not ſurrender, yet obtained Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters-Patents of the Captain-ſhips of their Countreys, and of all Lands and duties belonging to thoſe Captainſhips:
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50943:130"/>
For the Statute which doth condemn and aboliſh theſe Captain-ries, uſurped by the Iriſh, doth give power to the Lord Deputy to grant the ſame by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents. Howbeit, theſe Iriſh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and likewiſe the Engliſh, which were made Seneſchalles of the Iriſh Countries, did by colour of theſe grants, and under pretence of Government, claim an Iriſh Seigniory, and exerciſe plain tyranny over the Common people. And this was the fruit that did ariſe of the Letters Patents, granted of the Iriſh Countries in the time of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> where before they did extort and oppreſs the people, only by colour of a lewd and barbarous cuſtom; they did afterwards uſe the ſame Extortions and oppreſſions by warrant, under the great Seal of the Realm.</p>
            <p>But now,<note place="margin">How the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and defective Titles have been p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50943:131"/>
unto them, according to the courſe of the common Law; The other, for ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of defective Titles.

            <p>Upon Surrenders, this courſe hath been held from the beginning; when an Iriſh Lord doth offer to ſurrender his Country, his ſurrender is not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately accepted, but a Commiſſion is firſt awarded, to enquire of three ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all points. Firſt, of the quantity and limits of the Land whereof he is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted owner. Next, how much himſelf doth hold in demeaſne, and how much is poſſeſt by his Tenants and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And thirdly, what cuſtoms, Duties, and ſervices, he doth yearly receive out of thoſe lands. This Inquiſition being made and returned, the Lands which are found to be the Lords proper poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in demeaſne, are drawn into a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50943:131"/>
and his Iriſh duties; as <hi>Coſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Seſſings, Rents of Butter and Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal,</hi> and the like; are reaſonably va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued and reduced into certain <hi>ſums of mony,</hi> to be paid yearly in lieu thereof. This being done, the ſurrender is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and thereupon a grant paſſed, not of the whole Country, as was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in former times, but of thoſe Lands only, which are found in the Lords poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and of thoſe certain ſums of Mony, as Rents iſſuing out of the reſt. But the Lands which are found to be poſſeſt by the Tenants, are left unto them, reſpectively charged with theſe certain Rents only, in lieu of all uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Iriſh exactions.</p>
            <p>In like manner, upon all <hi>grants,</hi> which have paſt by vertue of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, for defective Titles, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners have taken ſpecial caution, for preſervation of the Eſtates of all particular Tenants.<note place="margin">No gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Jura Regalia,</hi> or any extraordinary Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. For the beſt <hi>Brittiſh undertaker,</hi> had but a proportion of 3000. Acres for himſelf, with power to create a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and hold a Court Baron: Albeit, many of theſe undertakers, were of as great birth and quality, as the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers in the firſt conqueſt. Again, his Majeſty did not utterly exclude the Natives out of this plantation, with a purpoſe to root them ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as the Iriſh were excluded out of the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies; but made mixt plantation of <hi>Brittiſh and Iriſh,</hi> that they might grow up together in one Nation: Only, the Iriſh were in ſome places tranſplanted from the Woods and Mountains, into the Plains and open countries, that being removed (like wild fruit-trees) they might grow the milder, and bear the better and ſweeter fruit. And this truly, is the Maſter-piece, and moſt excellent part of the work of Reformation, and is worthy indeed of His Majeſties royal pains. For when this plantation hath taken root, and been fixt and ſetled but a few years, with the favour and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50943:133"/>
of God (for the Son of God himſelf hath ſaid in the Goſpel, <hi>Omnis plantatio, quam non plantavit pater meus, eradicabitur</hi>) it will ſecure the peace of <hi>Ireland,</hi> aſſure it to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> for ever; and finally, make it a civil, and a Rich, a Mighty, and a Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I omit to ſpeak of the increaſe of the Revenue of the Crown, both certain and caſual, which is raiſed to a double proportion (at leſt) above that it was, by deriving the publick Juſtice into all parts of the Realm; by ſetling all the poſſeſſions, of both of the Iriſh and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, by re-eſtabliſhing the compoſitions; by reſtoring and reſuming the cuſtoms; by reviving the Tenures in <hi>Capite,</hi> and <hi>Knights-ſervice</hi>; and reducing many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things into charge, which by the confuſion and negligence of former times, became concealed and ſubtracted from the Crown. I forbear likewiſe to ſpeak of the due and ready bringing in of the Revenue, which is brought to paſs by the well ordering of the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and the authority and pains
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50943:134"/>
of the Commiſſioners for Accompts.</p>
            <p>I might alſo add hereunto, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement that hath been given to the Maritime Towns and Citties, as well to increaſe their Trade of Merchandize, as to cheriſh Mechanical Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; in that all their Charters have been renewed, and their Liberties more inlarged by His Majeſty, than by any of his Progenitors ſince the Conqueſt. As likewiſe, the care and courſe that hath been taken, to make Civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and entercourſe between the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; newly reformed and brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Obedience, by granting Markets and Fairs to be holden in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and by erecting of corporate Towns among them.</p>
            <p>Briefly, the clock of the civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is now well ſet, and all the wheels thereof do move in Order; The ſtrings of this Iriſh Harp, which the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate doth finger, are all in tune (for I omit to ſpeak of the State Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal) and make a good Harmony in this Common-weal: So as we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a hope, that <hi>Ireland</hi> (which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50943:134"/>
might properly be called the <hi>Land of Ire,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Iraſcible</hi> power was predominant there, for the ſpace of 400. years together) will from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth prove a Land of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord.</hi> And though heretofore it hath been like the lean Cow of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Dream, devouring the fat of <hi>England,</hi> and yet remaining as lean as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it will hereafter be as fruitfull as the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>; the deſcription whereof, in the 8. of <hi>Deutronomy,</hi> doth in every part agree with <hi>Ireland</hi>; being <hi>Terra Rivorum, aquarumque &amp; fontium; in cujus Campis, &amp; Montibus, erumpunt fluviorum abyſſi; Terra frumenti, &amp; hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei; Terra lactis, &amp; mellis; ubi absque ulla penuria comedes panem tuum, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum abundantia perfrueris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have diſcovered and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the defects and Errors, as well <hi>in the managing of the Martial Affairs,</hi> as <hi>of the civil</hi>; which in former Ages gave impediment to the reducing of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the <hi>Obedience and Subjection</hi> of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obſerved, what courſes have been
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50943:135"/>
taken; to <hi>reform the Defects and Errors in Government, and to reduce the People of this Land to obedience,</hi> ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> 3. till the latter end of the raign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, I have declared and ſet forth, <hi>How all the ſaid errors have been corrected, and the defects ſupplyed under the proſperous Government of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>; So as I may poſitively conclude in the ſame words, which I have uſed in the Title of this Diſcourſe; <hi>That untill the beginning of His Majeſties Raign,</hi> Ireland <hi>was never entirely ſubdued, and brought under the Obedience of the Crown of</hi> England. But ſince the Crown of of this Kingdom, with the undoubted right and Title thereof, deſcended upon His Majeſty; The whole Iſland from Sea to Sea, hath been brought into his Highneſs peaceable poſſeſſion; and all the Inhabitants, in every corner thereof, have been abſolutely reduced under his immediate ſubjection. In which conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Subjects, they will gladly continue, without defection or adhaering to any
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50943:135"/>
other <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> as long as they may be <hi>Protected,</hi> and <hi>juſtly Governed,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> on the one ſide, or <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> on the other. For, there is no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of people under the Sun, that doth love equal and indifferent Juſtice, better than the Iriſh; or will reſt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfied with the execution thereof, although it be againſt themſelves; ſo as they may have the protection and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Law, when upon juſt cauſe they do deſire it.</p>
