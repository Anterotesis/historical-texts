            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Think me not foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for uſing Greek names: Firſt, for that I have ſo received, and I dare not deliver this otherwiſe unto thee then as I have received: Next thou alſo obſerveſt, that we have no uſuall names for theſe things: and if I had framed any by-interpretation, I ſhould be leſſe apt to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: and if I ſhould uſe any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution, I ſhould be leſſe quick and leſſe ready in diſcourſing: this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55956:19"/>
onely I intreat and beſeech thee to believe, that howſoever I may erre, I do it not out of any arrogancy or pride. The Scripture is treated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the hiſtory when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared therein what is written, or what is done: and what is not done but written onely as it were done. According to the Etiology, when it is ſhewed thereby for what cauſe any thing is either done or ſaid. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Analogy, when it is demonſtrated that the two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Old and the New, are not contrary the one unto the other. According to the Allegory, when it is read therein that certain things that are written, ought not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood according to the letter, but according to the figure. All theſe manner of wayes of alledging Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, have been uſed by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and by the Apoſtles. He cited Scripture according to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55956:19"/>
Hiſtory, when, unto thoſe that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that his Diſciples had pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ears of Corn upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, he anſwered, <hi>Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him: how he entred into the houſe of God and did eat the loaves of Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (or Shew-bread) which it was not lawfull for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but for Prieſts onely?</hi> Mat. 12. 1, 3, 4. 1 Sam. 21. 6. Exod. 29. 32. He alledged Scripture according to the Etiology, when having forbidden the diſmiſſing of wives for any cauſe but onely fornication, unto the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, who told him that <hi>Moſes</hi> had given men leave to diſmiſſe them, having firſt given them a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, he ſaid: <hi>This Moſes did for the hardneſſe of your hearts.</hi> Deut. 24. 1.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55956:31"/>
have the Manichees to tell me in which kind they place the errour (which they conceive) of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. If in the firſt it is a grievous fault indeed, but we need not ſeek farre to know how to defend it; for it is ſufficient to deny that we underſtand it, as they conceive, when they inveigh againſt it.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>grievous, but the ſame words will ſerve to confute it. If in the third, it is no fault at all. Go to then, and hereafter conſider the Scriptures themſelves: for what do they object againſt the books which are called the Old Teſtament? do they ſay that they are good, but that we do not well and rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them? but they themſelves receive them not. Do they ſay that they are neither good, nor rightly underſtood by us? but this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

underſtand them, but that the books be naught? what is this, but to acquit and abſolve their living ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, with whom they are in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and to accuſe thoſe that are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly dead, with whom they have no contention nor ſtrife?

               <p>THou ſayeſt my advice is fooliſh and ridiculous, ſeeing that all men do make it their profeſſion to embrace and deliver Catholick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. That all Hereticks do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this I cannot deny, but after ſuch a manner, that unto thoſe which they entice and allure unto them, they promiſe to give a reaſon for the moſt hidden and moſtobſcure things: and chiefly for this cauſe they blame and reprehend the Catholick Church, becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55956:45"/>
more redounding to their praiſe and commendation? It is not ſo. This they promiſe having no power nor ability to perform it, but that by the name and pretence of reaſon they may winne and allure much compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unto them; for the ſoul of man naturally rejoyceth at the promiſe of reaſon, and not having regard to her own forces and weakneſſe, by a deſire ſhe hath to eat the meats of thoſe that are in health (which are not prudently given to the infirm) ſhe haſtily falls upon the poyſon of the deceivers. But as for true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it can by no means be well and rightly received without ſome weighty command and force of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, unleſſe thoſe things be firſt believed, which every one may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards attain unto, and learn if he carries himſelf well, and be thought worthy of it. Perhaps thou requireſt ſome reaſon hereof, whereby thou
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55956:46"/>
mayſt be induced and perſwaded to believe that thou oughteſt not ſooner to be taught by reaſon, then by Faith and Belief. Which I can eaſily give unto thee, if thou wilt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and receive it from me with an equall and impartiall mind. But that it may commodiouſly be done, I would have thee as it were anſwer to ſuch queſtions as I ſhall propoſe unto thee. And firſt of all I would have thee to tell me: why doſt thou conceive that we ought not to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? Becauſe (ſayſt thou) credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it ſelf, from whence men are called credulous, ſeems unto me to be a certain vice, elſe it would not be a cuſtome to object this name by way of reproch. For if a ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man be culpable and faulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſuſpects things not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known: much more doth a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous man deſerve to be blamed, who differs herein from a ſuſpitious
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55956:46"/>
man, that he that is ſuſpitious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſome doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in unknown things, but he that is credulous makes none at all. In the mean time I admit of this opinion and this diſtinction; but thou knoweſt alſo that we do not ſay a man is curious but by way of taunt and reproch, but when we call a man ſtudious, we ſpeak it in his praiſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to be between theſe two. Thou anſwereſt, that although both be moved with a great deſire of knowing, yet in this they dif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er, that the curious man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires after the things that belong not unto him, but the ſtudious on the contrary after his own affairs. But we grant that a wife and children and their welfare do belong unto a man, and therefore if any one being gone a farre off out of his native ſoile ſhould make a diligent enquiry
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55956:47"/>
of thoſe that come from his parts, how his wife and children do, he hath certainly a great deſire to know it, and yet we call not this a ſtudious man, although he be deſirous to know, and even thoſe things which do chiefly belong and appertain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Wherefore now thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt that that definition of a ſtudious man is herein defective and imperfect: that every ſtudious man deſires to know the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him, but that every man that hath ſuch a deſire ought not to be called a ſtudious man; but he who exceedingly ſeeks after the things which belong to excellent breeding, and to the adorning of the mind, we rightly call (in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine) a Student, that is, a deſirous man, eſpecially if we adde what he deſires to hear. For we call one alſo ſtudious of his friends, that loves his friends onely: yet neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>theleſſe we
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55956:47"/>
think him not worthy of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon name of ſtudious men without any addition. But one that deſires to know how his friends do, I wonld not call him ſtudious or deſirous of hearing, unleſſe having a good fame and credit he ſhould often deſire to hear the ſame thing, but if he ſhould but once deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to hear it, I would call him a Student or deſiring man. Now reflect upon a curious man, and tell me whether if any one ſhould willingly hear a ſhort tale not conducing at all unto his profit, that is, of things not belonging unto him, and this not with great eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and often, but very ſeldome and very modeſtly, either in ſome banquet, or in ſome meeting or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, wouldeſt thou think him to be a curious man? I conceive not, but truly he that hath a care of that thing which he would willingly hear might ſeem indeed to be ſo. Wherefore
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55956:48"/>
the definition alſo of a curious man ought to be corrected by the ſame Rule as is that of a ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man. And therefore conſider alſo, whither the things former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken ought to be amended. For why is he not unworthy of the name of a ſuſpitious man, who ſometimes ſuſpecteth ſomething, and he of a credulous man that ſometimes believeth ſomething? Wherefore as there is a very great difference between one that is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of any thing, and one that is altogether ſtudious, and again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one that hath a care of a thing, and one that is curious: ſo is there between a believing man and a credulous man.</p>

               <p>BUt thou wilt ſay, Now ſee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought to believe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For neither if we grant it to be one thing to believe, another to be credulous, doth it follow, that it is no fault to believe in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: for what if it be a fault both to believe and to be credulous, as it is both to be drunk and to be a drunkard? whoſoever thinks this to be certainly true, can in my opinion have no friend at all. For if it be a thing unreaſonable to believe any thing, either he commits a foul fault that gives credit to his friend; or if he believes him not, I ſee not how he can call himſelf a friend, or the other.

diſpraiſe, but alſo with ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and praiſe; but it is not ſo, for there be two ſorts of perſons that deſerve praiſe in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: the one which hath already found out the true Religion, which we ought to judge moſt happy and bleſſed: the other which with the greateſt care, and after the righteſt manner, doth ſeek after it: the firſt ſort is now in poſſeſſion of it, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is in the way, by which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding moſt certainly they will arrive at it. There be three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinds of men which are indeed to be miſliked and deteſted. The firſt is, of thoſe that are opinative, that is, who think they know that which they know not. The ſecond is, of thoſe who truly do perceive their own ignorance, but do not ſo ſeek that they may find. The third is of thoſe that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>either think they know, nor have any will or deſire to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55956:53"/>
ſeek. There are alſo three things in the minds of men, near as it were the one unto the other, moſt worthy to be diſtinguiſhed, to underſtand, to believe, and to think. Of which, if they be conſidered by themſelves, the firſt is alwaies without offence, the ſecond ſometimes faultie, the third never without a fault; and this we ought to reſerve to the ſame beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and felicity. For in this life how much ſoever a man knows his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth not as yet make him moſt bleſſed, for that there be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more things whereof he is ignorant. For to underſtand great and worthy, and divine things it is a moſt bleſſed thing. But it is not hurt full to underſtand ſuperfluous things, but perhaps it was prejudicial to learn them, when as they took up the time of neceſſary things. Alſo it is not a miſerable thing to underſtand hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things, but to do or ſuffer them.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55956:54"/>
For if any one underſtands how his enemie may be ſlain without endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering himſelf he becomes not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by underſtanding it, if he deſires it not: yea if he be free from ſuch a deſire, who is more innocent and guiltleſſe then he? In believing a man is then to blame, when either he believes ſome unworthy thing of God, or gives too facile and eaſie credit unto the things reported of man. But in other things, if a man believes any thing, he commits no fault by believing, though he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands that he knows not the thing which he believes. For I believe that in times paſt, moſt wicked conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours were put to death by the power and authority of <hi>Cicero:</hi> but this I do not onely not know, but alſo I know aſſuredly that I can by no means attain unto the knowledge thereof, To be opinative or to be led by opinion, is for two cauſes an unſeemly

This authority, (reaſon being ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, which to underſtand to be true and ſincere, it is a very hard matter for fools to do, as I have often ſaid) doth move and excite us two manner of wayes: partly by miracles, and partly by the great number and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of followers. It is certain that a wiſe man needs none of theſe things, but now we are diſcourſing how we may become wiſe men, that is, how we may cleave and adhere unto the truth: which is a thing that doubtleſſe cannot be done with a foul and impure mind: the unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whereof, is (to expound it briefly) the love of all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beſides it ſelf and God: from which fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For if any one ſhould ſee a man fly, he would onely wonder at it, becauſe it is a thing which beſides the beholding of it, yields to the ſpectatour no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity nor profit. But if any one being afflicted with a grievous and deſperate ſickneſſe, ſhall ſo ſoon as the diſeaſe is commanded to depart, recover his health, he ſhall overcome the wonder of the cure by the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the curer.
