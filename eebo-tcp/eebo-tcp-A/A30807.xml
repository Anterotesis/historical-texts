         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Water in general.</head>
               <p>SInce I am about to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the Advantages of
Medicinal Waters, and to
ſhew how fit a Vehicle this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65922:8"/>
Element is to convey Medicine to
the inmoſt Receſſes of the Body;
I think it not beſides my buſineſs
if I a little touch upon the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of Water, which was Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Univerſal Drink of all
Creatures, and the Health and long
Life of the firſt Ages of the World,
may commend its wholeſomneſs.
But if we examine its Nature, we
ſhall find it conſiſt of thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which denote its Salubrity, as
<hi>Clearneſs, Thinneſs, Lightneſs, Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
&amp;c.</hi> which Cool, Moiſten,
Attenuate, Refreſh, Allay Thirſt,
and are a Pabulum or Recruit to
fretted Spirits, and a proper Liquor
to convey and diſtribute other Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Some of the Ancients call'd
it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. the Seed of all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65922:8"/>
things: But I ſhall not here Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the Productions from
Waters; what Vegetables, Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
and Animals are generated by
it. Neither ſhall I treat of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
kinds of Water, as River-Water,
Rain-Water, Pump, Lake, Pond-Water,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is the beſt and
moſt wholſome which is void of
Taſte or Odour, and is Clear, Pure,
moſt Light, ſoon Heated, ſoon
Cold, and in which Fleſh is ſooneſt
Boyl'd. The Living Spring I judge
moſt valuable for Drinking, and
that neareſt the Head of it the beſt.
For thoſe living Principles which
actuate all Bodies, and keep 'em not
only from Putrefaction, but qualify
'em for Recruits and Suſtenance to
other Bodies, are in proportion in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65922:9"/>
Waters, which denote 'em of
ſuch and ſuch a ſtrength and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and may be us'd in quantities
accordingly. And 'tis no ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that they are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
receiv'd in ſuch large quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
without fuming or diſturbing
the Brain, to irrigate and ſoften the
whole Body, and bedew the fiery
Spirits with their ſupple Vapours:
and when thoſe Airy brisk Particles
do extricate themſelves from theſe
ſoft Lodgments, they are again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
with more, to prevent their
leaping out, or firing one againſt
another: and ſuch a pretty buſtle
or ferment in Nature raiſes that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Effloreſcence and Vigor,
which Plumps, Exhilerates, and
makes Gay a Well-temper'd Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65922:9"/>
The diſpenſing either of Food or
Phyſick in a clear, thin, ſoft, and
gentle Vehicle, muſt make a
better Digeſtion, and a more equal
Diſtribution of it, then in a fiery
Chariot, which precipitates Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and hurries the crude parts
through thoſe ſtrait and ſlender
Paſſages beyond their natural
Emunctories, and lodges 'em
where neither Nature can expel
'em, nor Art reach 'em; and that
cauſes <hi>Gout,</hi> and other <hi>Diſeaſes.</hi>
Whenas the milder Liquors make
ſuch eaſie gradations, that Nature
can ſecern by her peculiar cleanſing
Ducts, thoſe Feces and Crudities,
which timely and orderly expel'd,
prevent innumerable Obſtructions
and Diſtempers to the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65922:10"/>
I wiſh for my own particular,
who am ſometimes afflicted with
<hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Gout,</hi> that I had earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſtudied theſe things. But what I
can't prevent in my ſelf, I'm willing
to do for others.</p>
               <p>But to ſhew how excellent a
Vehicle Water is, for the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Generous and Reſtorative
Medicines, is no difficult Task, if
its Nature be conſidered, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned: For by ſearching
out the minuteſt Paſſages of the
Body, it promotes a general diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of the deſign'd matter to all
parts of it. And I am of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that fine Chymical Medicines
ſhould be deliver'd to Bodies in ſoft
gentle Vehicles; yet I wou'd not
have 'em convey'd in their own
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65922:10"/>
Terreſtial Bodies (as <hi>Galenical</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65922:12"/>

from Subterranean Mines and

               <p>It may be conſidered that few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Waters are ſimple, I mean
impregnated only with one Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,

aſſign their Virtues to the proper
Minerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Mineral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
I place <hi>Salt, Nitre, Vitriol,

That there is a certain Hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditical
Salt of Metals, which for
want of another name is call'd an
Eſurine or Acid Salt, which is a
general ſort of Salt, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
to all Metals. So that this
Eſurine Salt, while ſuch, is no
more then Salt, and not a Vitriol:
But if it become a Vitriol, it muſt
eſpouſe a Mineral or Metalline Body.

is moſt naturally brought
forth in thoſe Mines where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath begot that Eſurine Salt,
corroding a ſtrong Vein of Copper,
becomes diſſolv'd in the gliding
Current of a Spring. But ſhould I
here inlarge in an account of Nitre,
Vitriol, Allom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
my preſent Intention, and
prevent a future Deſign. Yet I
think it neceſſary to my preſent
Buſineſs, to ſay thus much of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
and Vitriol: That the Eſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
Salt diſcover'd in the Air, if
it meet with a fat unctuous Glebe,
and be preſerv'd from Rain and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65922:14"/>
Sun, that it ſpend not its ſtrength
in the Production of Vegetables,
breeds great ſtore of Nitre: For
'tis obſerv'd that in theſe fat Earths
there is at firſt no Nitrous Taſte,
neither can any Nitre be extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from 'em: But after their
continuance a while in the Cool
Air, its Magnetick Power from a
Nitrous Principle opens the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous
Body of the fat Glebe, a
fit Receptacle for the Eſurine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and is therewith Coagulated
and Envellop'd: And after this
manner is the Nativity of Nitre.</p>
               <p>'Tis commonly obſerv'd, That
in Cold Weather the Appetite is
more keen, and the Thirſt little;
which proceeds from the great
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65922:14"/>
ſtore of Nitre that is in the
Air.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vitriol</hi> I take to be an Eſurine
Acid Salt, corroding the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
Parts of Metals or Marcaſites,
by an Acid Subterraneal Spirit,
(whereof there is great quantity in
ſome Mines) Corroding the Veins
of Iron, Copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from whence
are the Varieties of Vitriol. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
from a Vitriol Loam, or Clay
diluted with Water, and ſet in a
cold Cellar, may be gather'd an
Alluminous Effloreſcence, which
ſhews there may be a Mixture of
Allom with Vitriol. But the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
or Varieties of Impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ariſe either from the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the quantity of the Acid
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65922:15"/>
Spirit, Corroding the Veins of
Copper or Iron, or from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or leſſer Continuance of the
Courſe of the Water through thoſe
Metallick Veins.</p>
               <p>It need not ſeem ſtrange to any
that there is ſuch Acidity in Water
and Air; from whence elſe doth
Iron and Copper, being put into
Water, or ſtanding long in the Air
in a cool Cellar, contract ſuch a
Ruſt as they do? Is it not from the
Acid Spirit of Air and Water uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the Eſurine Salt in thoſe
Metals, exciting its Corroſive
Power to deſtroy the Texture of
the Metal? And this Ruſt being
boiled in Rain-water, will yield a
Vitriol.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65922:15"/>
There are many ways of making
Artificial Vitriols: But I ſhall paſs
beyond my Intentention if I now
Diſcourſe of 'em.</p>
               <p>'Tis obvious what Beds of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
lye in the Bowels of the Earth,
on which the Currents of Water
waſh in their Circulating Veins,
from which they are Impregnated
with their Medicinal Qualities.</p>
               <p>But before I diſmiſs this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I think fit to add this, That
there is a univerſal common Salt of
Nature, the firſt <hi>Ens</hi> of Salts,
which is ſpecificated according to
the diverſity of Nature, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
various forms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65922:16"/>
GOD, the Original Founder of
all Beings, hath Implanted in the
Superficies of the Earth, that great
variety of Vegetable Seeds, which
propagate themſelves in their Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
So that very Vegetable at its
proper Seaſon, by the Inſtigation
of the Heavenly Inſluences, ſetting
at work its Seminals, and by ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up its Innate Power, begins
to ſhape it ſelf a Body according
to the Laws of Creation, every
Plant in its kind, till they have
made up that wonderful Variety
which ſo richly Adorns the
Earth.</p>
               <p>In like manner are diſperſt the
Mineral and Metalline Seeds in the
Bowels of the Earth, determin'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65922:16"/>
for Specification, and to become
Prolifick by the Embryonate Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
according to the Purity or
Impurity of the Terreſtrial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix.
And thus the Metallick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is Compleated by the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Metals, while the Imperfect
and middle Minerals arrive but
ſlowly to Metallization.</p>

               <p>HAving Premis'd thus much
of <hi>Water</hi> in general and of
<hi>Mineral Waters,</hi> the better to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
my <hi>Eſſay</hi> of theſe New Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<hi>Balſamick Wells.</hi> I ſhall now
give a ſhort and plain Account of
their conſtituent Principles, which
upon a ſtrict Examen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many
ways in my <hi>Laboratory,</hi> I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
to be only theſe following,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) The firſt <hi>Ens</hi> or Mother
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65922:18"/>
of Salts, which runs thro' and is
ſhut up in all <hi>Specificated Salts;</hi>
tho' it is not eaſily made Appear:
for it requires a Laborious and
Skilful Hand to reſolve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
of a <hi>Mineral</hi> or <hi>Metal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Balſamick Principle</hi> is a <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi>
well digeſted and purified by
the <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> and retains in it a
great deal of the <hi>Embryonate Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</hi>
But 'tis brought to that
Height and Volatility in the Bowels
of the Earth, that were it not for
the Third Principle, the <hi>Vitriol of
Mars,</hi> to give 'em Fixation, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they would not have been
Retained in Water alone. But
this being of a more fixt Nature,
and a Salt, has Magnetically
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65922:18"/>
caught and entangled the Eſurine
<hi>Spirit</hi> with the firſt <hi>Ens</hi> or Mother
of <hi>Salts,</hi> and that fragrant tender
<hi>Sulphur</hi> in her <hi>Belly.</hi> So that when
the <hi>Metalick Oar</hi> is unlooſed, and
you come near to the <hi>Original of
Salts,</hi> then you'l find the tender
<hi>Sulphur</hi> cloſe Lockt up in it, which
when 'tis long digeſted by Nature
or Art, becomes moſt grateful,
and withal ſo volatile by the Uniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it with a ſublime Salt, that
it will imbody it ſelf without much
ſhew, ſave that of a pleaſing gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Smell: for all Odour is from
Sulphur. But before I paſs any
further, I think fit to Explain what
I mean by an Embryonate Sulphur,
and that is, a fragrant Gas or Breath
containing the beginnings and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65922:19"/>
of Sulphur which are not
yet Imbodyed, but like the firſt
Rayes of an Embrio in the Womb,
before it has gathered much Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Now that our Waters do
contain theſe Principles, and in ſo
great Purity, it may thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear:
For where there is no
Floating Oyl, as in One of the
Wells there is but very little,
there is nevertheleſs a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Scent from the Sulphur that
is Incorporated with the Waters.
Now wherever there is ſuch an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryonate
pure Sulphur, there muſt
be a Volatile Salt of the higheſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to Attenuate this Sulphur, and
carry it on its Wings through the
whole Body. And thus it is in
our Waters, which upon Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65922:19"/>
Experiments you'll find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
theſe Volatiles: For by Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating
ſome of the Water,
you'll perceive it loſe moſt of its
Grateful Sulphureous Odour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſo Tender and Volatile:
Nay, though you ſhou'd Diſtil
'em with never ſo much Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity,
in Glaſs Veſſels exactly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and luted, yet wou'd your
Sulphur fly away inſenſibly, and
leave no Footſteps of its preſence.</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe, we are as
forward as any other Mineral
Waters: For we have a pure
Vitriol of Iron, depurated and
cleanſed by Nature from a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<hi>Aerugo,</hi> or Ironiſh Ruſt,
which may be Precipitated in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65922:20"/>
ſome Mineral Waters. This
ſhews it ſelf to every one by
the Common Experiments made
on any Chalybeate Waters; as
by the Powder of Gauls, the
Leaves of an Oak, or Tea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Beſides the Blackiſh Colour it
leaves on the Ordure: Not to
mention here all the Excellent
Medicinal Qualities, which are a
Cloud of Witneſſes for it. This
Specificated Vitriol entangles the
fine Salt and Sulphur, whereby
it Enriches it Self, and Retards
thoſe Volatiles, and ſo become all
together Digeſted, and more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
Diſſolv'd in the Vein of a
Spring. And the further they
paſs together in the Meanders and
Sabulous or Gravelly Streiners of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65922:20"/>
the Earth, they become the more
purged from the Terreſtrial and
Sulphureous Feculencies they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
in their Solution.</p>
               <p>A Parallel to theſe Waters I
believe is not diſcover'd. The
more I Examine 'em, the more I
wonder, to ſee ſuch Life in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
from Themſelves ſo pure.
'Tis uſual, eſpecially in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of the Earth, for the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Life to Contract great
Impurities; Or at leaſt, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo heavy loaded, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearing,
that they ſeem either
not to be, or ſtifled, beyond
ſmelling of 'em out by any Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Odours. Where there are any
Sulphureous Spaws, as in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:65922:21"/>
and other Places, their Oils
(by Report) ſtink like Rotten
Eggs in the Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—But
there is no Unwholeſome
Glebe, or any dangerous Mineral
or Metal, that caſts one Unhappy
Ray into this Healing Fountain.
So that it appears to be a moſt
Excellent Compoſition, (<hi>viz.</hi>) No
leſs than the Original Purity of
Salt and Sulphur, digeſted with
the fineſt Vitriol of <hi>Mars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as I can diſcover by my
Art no other Principles in this
Water, ſo I hope there is no
other: For I can't ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
what is wanting to render
'em highly valuable, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the greateſt Benefits to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65922:21"/>
Bodies, if Rightly Uſed.
'Tis true, They are not Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetch'd,
therefore may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem'd
by ſome. But I have
ſound out a way to make 'em
Grateful even to ſuch Perſons:
Since then we can't Remove the
Wells to <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Tunbridge,</hi>
if they will but Remove Thither,
and ſo ſend for 'em, or come once
a year to 'em, that Squeamiſh

'em able, with a little help, to Recc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

and <hi>GO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T:</hi> But it muſt be by
a well-govern'd Method in the
Uſe of 'em, directed with a great
deal of Skill. By the help of the
Volatile Salt and Embryonate
Sulphur, I believe a deep-rooted
<hi>SC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RVEY</hi> may be Cur'd; in
Reſtoring thoſe Decay'd Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
which a Scorbutic Fret of
Blood has almoſt eaten out.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
'twill be neceſſary to make
a little Digreſſion of the Nature
of the <hi>SC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RVEY,</hi> and its Cure,
the better to explain other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scurvey</hi> then is, when the
due Temperament of the Blood
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65922:23"/>
is broke up by the Raging of
the Fixt Salts, and their Prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the True Sulphur or
Oleity in Man eat it out, and
ſubjugate the Pure Volatile Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to their own Dominion, and
ſo becomes a Corroſive fiery Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
While this is doing, many
Symptoms appear, as Scorbutic
Frets, and Feaveriſh Intermiſſions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But becauſe it is done by
degrees, and in ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Natural, a Man loſes a
good habit of Body he knows
not how. Now when this Fixt
Salt has in good meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
the other Vital Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
it ſets up a Corroſive ſharp
Spirit, which (for want of the
other Principles to purifie it)
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65922:24"/>
contracts a foul naſty Humour,
which by ſome is call'd <hi>Bitturn;</hi>
'twill look Blackiſh, Green, and
Yellow. By this time a Man's
come to a pretty paſs, and fit
to complain he's Ill; for every
thing about him begins to tell
him ſo: But 'twill be too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to mention Symptoms here.</p>
               <p>Now the Common Cure for
this, (after Purging and Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
is, Teſtaceous Powders,
Crabs Eyes, Pearl, Coral, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Steel, Milk-Water, Aſſes
Milk, going into the Countrey,
and then to the Grave.</p>
               <p>I ſay that no <hi>Dead Alkali</hi> will
Cure the <hi>Scurvey,</hi> when come
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65922:24"/>
to a height: It will Palliate,
that is, Obtund the ſharp Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Blood, and lick 'em
up for a while; But then the
Corroſive Scorbutic Spirit breaks
through again, unleſs ſuffocated:
Juſt as the Spirits will diſentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
themſelves from an Opiate,
unleſs over-power'd. But a <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Alkali</hi> will beget a New Maſs
of Blood; 'Twill enter into the
Fixt Salt, Open its Body, and
Raiſe a New Stock of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

theſe indeed are True Medicines,

Reſolving of Tartarous Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And that ſuch Medicines
will open Obſtructions, diſſolve
Congelations, and the manifold
Thicknings of the Juyces up and
down the Body, is equally mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
by Reaſon and fair Practice.
For <hi>Coagulums</hi> are the Common
Effect of the <hi>Scurvey:</hi> And moſt
of the Diſeaſes of the Body are
caus'd by the Acid Coroſive Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65922:26"/>
which will inſpiſſate Juyces;
juſt as Acids turn Milk to Curds
and Clottedneſs. All Impoſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
Schirrus's, Ulcers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Body and without, are
from this Scorbutick ſharp Salt.
From this Topick I could go
through with moſt Diſeaſes, and
give the beſt Account of their
Cauſe.—But I muſt forbear.</p>
               <p>Theſe Waters from their pure
Sulphur can't but be Excellent for
all inward <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> and <hi>Decayes,</hi> and
to ſupple the Spirits fretted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Diſtempers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From their Impregnation with
the Vitriol of <hi>Mars,</hi> they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for all thoſe Excellent Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65922:26"/>
which <hi>Tunbridge</hi> and other
Chalybeat Waters perform. But
becauſe they are ſo commonly
known, I will in this ſhort Lecture
omit 'em. It may therefore for
the preſent ſuffice to mention the
Virtues of theſe Waters from their
Principles United.</p>
               <p>They <hi>Cleanſe, Cool, Stimulate,</hi>
open <hi>Obstructions,</hi> diſſolve and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
all <hi>Groſs Humours,</hi> and are
abſterſive of <hi>Viſcous, Tartarous,</hi>
and other Humours in the <hi>Stomach,
Meſenteries, Hypochondries, Reins,
Womb, Bladder, Joints,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They create a great Appetite, by
Recovering and Strengthening her
Tone. They Cleanſe, Strengthen,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65922:27"/>
and Contract the Womb, which
muſt be of great uſe to ſuch as
are ſubject to Miſcarriages, Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in thoſe parts, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt
to breed. But becauſe I think
not fit here to particularize, I'll
once for all ſay, They are of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
uſe for Ladies in all their
diſtinguiſhing Circumſtances from
Men: But not to be uſed by thoſe
with Child. For particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
herein, a Phyſician ſhou'd
be Conſulted.</p>
               <p>And here (in a Parentheſis) let me
ſay, 'Tis requiſite to the Health
and Happineſs of every Perſon to
have Recourſe to a Spiritual and
Phyſical Guide, and that in times
of ſeeming Health, to provide
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65922:27"/>
againſt thoſe Evils, which the
height of a Diſtemper and the
hour of Death make unſeaſonable
for any conſiderable Miniſtration.
<hi>Principiis obſta, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Waters are powerful
in all Cachectical and Obſtinate
Diſeaſes. Like an <hi>Alkali,</hi> they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe
the Acidity and Sowerneſs of
the Blood, and conſequently dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify
the ſame: For by a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Propenſity uniting Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
with the Salts, they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
together with the Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Humours, by a ſtrong Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation
of Nature (from theſe
Waters) to expel 'em. And from
their Diuretick Nature, after they
have Attenuated, Cut, Reſolv'd,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65922:28"/>
and ſo alter'd the Mucous and
Tartarous Humours of the Body,
and prepar'd 'em for Excretion,
they then carry them off by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
which is the moſt Safe and
Effectual Conveyance (for all
ſharp and Saline Humours) of
all ſorts of Evacuation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>This Water, enrich'd by my
<hi>Tinctura Regalis,</hi> and ſome Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that are Lively <hi>Alkali</hi>'s,
ſearch ſuch Latent Paſſages, and
Abſtruſe Retirements of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as other Medicines cannot
reach; and after a Diſcovery
made, doth not only diſpoſſeſs
what is Preternatural of its Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65922:28"/>
and Reinforcing Nature,
ſo firmly intitles her to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Right of Inheritance, that
ſcarce any thing but an Act of
Hoſtility or Old Age, can cut

               <p>They ſo Correct and Amend

of theſe Waters for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of any conſiderable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
I adviſe that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
their Bodies as ſhall be thought
moſt proper by their <hi>Phyſicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To thoſe who carefully keep
their Bodies from any glut of
Humours, and deſign onely to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65922:31"/>
take 'em for Pleaſure, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
ſlighter Indiſpoſitions; or
if it be but to dilute and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
the Blood and preſerve it
from decay, or to create a good
Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I adviſe but a
ſlighter Preparation, by a gentle
Infuſion, or a few Stomach Pills,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to clear the firſt Paſſages.</p>
               <p>But what I have furniſht my
ſelf with, requiſite to be given
before and with theſe Waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
I ſhall keep at home, for ſuch
who Reſort to me. For I wou'd
willingly avoid all Offence; not
coveting any Mans Employ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65922:31"/>
And thus I hope I ſhall eaſily
demonſtrate my Care to prevent
Obloquy, and ſatisfie any I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
not to Monopolize.</p>
               <p>If Prejudice prevent not, theſe
Waters may be Preſcribed by
<hi>Phyſicians</hi> in Method to their
<hi>Patients,</hi> to the full as well as
Other Medicinal Springs: And
by their Skill may become Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Vehicles for the diſtribution
of ſuch Generous and Noble Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
as our Art directs.</p>
               <p>Theſe Waters are to be Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
alone, from One Quart to
Two; or Five Pints at moſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:65922:32"/>
The Rules to be obſerved in
the Taking of 'em, are common
to other Mineral Waters, and ſo
generally Known, that almoſt
every one can prevent me in
thoſe Few and Eaſie Directions
that are requiſite.</p>
               <p>They are to be Taken in the
Morning Faſting, and before the
Body is heated with Exerciſe:
Therefore come to theſe Wells
Early, and as Eaſily as you can.</p>
               <p>They are not to be Drank too
Quick, nor too Slow: But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Diſtances are to be allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
as once in half an Hour a
pint, or rather leſs, as your Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
can bear 'em and paſs 'em,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65922:32"/>
till you have taken the Quantity
you deſign. But to ſickly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
I adviſe but half a Pint at
a Draught; and a little warm'd
in cold Weather, by ſetting a
Bottle in a Skillet of Cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cloſe ſtopt, and ſo let it warm
with the Water.</p>
               <p>After you have taken two or
three draughts, 'tis beſt to uſe
ſome very gentle Exerciſe, to
promote 'em by Urine.</p>
               <p>Whilſt you walk, ride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
you may eat Orange-Chips, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron-Peels,
Carraway-Confects,
Elicampane-Roots Candy'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:65922:33"/>
When your Waters are almoſt
return'd, then you may increaſe
your Exerciſe <hi>ad ruborem, non ad
ſudorem</hi>; till you be pretty Warm,
but not Sweat.</p>
               <p>'Tis not fit to Dine till the
Waters are paſt; and half an
Hour before Dinner (for ſome
Perſons) a Glaſs of Rheniſh,
White-wine or Clarret, I think
not amiſs.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here preſcribe the
Quality of your Diet: Every
one knows that Mutton, Veal,
Lamb, Chickens, Rabbits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
are good Fare. My Care is to
Caution you as to Quantity,
and that the rather, becauſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65922:33"/>
theſe Waters rightly uſed, give
a great Appetite:</p>
               <p>'Tis better both to Dine and
Sup Moderately, then to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
at once.</p>
               <p>Temperance prevents and helps
to Cure many Diſeaſes. He
that deſires to Eat much, muſt
Eat little; for by Eating little
at a time, he lives long, and ſo
makes it up.</p>
               <p>All Intemperance in Drink
ſhou'd at all times be avoided;
But Exceſs in this Method may
be dangerous: Nevertheleſs I
commend to ſome Perſons, a
little good Wine towards Night
with Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:65922:34"/>
And here I think it kind to
Inſert this Note; That the Dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Cup, or Evenings Draught
ſo much in Uſe, is generally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
too late: For to fill the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with Liquor and preſently
to Bed, cauſes many Diſeaſes.
'Tis fit it ſhou'd as to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part be paſſed firſt, which
wou'd prevent <hi>Gravel, Stone,
Gouts, Dropſies,</hi> and many Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Uſe of theſe Waters is
to be continued as need ſhall
require, and as you are Adviſed
by your Phyſicians. A Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
or Three-weeks together
is long enough without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
For 'tis better to Omit
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65922:34"/>
'em Two or Three Weeks, and
then take 'em again, then to
continue one long Courſe of 'em
together; for fear of a <hi>Diabetes,</hi>
or other Injuries.</p>
               <p>Now if in this ſhort Tract I
have not given ſome Satisfactory
Account of theſe <hi>Balſamick Wells,</hi>
as to their Virtues and Uſe, I
ſhall be ready to give further
Direction to any that are pleas'd
to Require it.</p>
