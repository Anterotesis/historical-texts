            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT may ſeem adviſable to give ſome ſhort accompt of the enſuing Work to obviate ſuch Exceptions as are likely to be made againſt it in this cenſorious Age. That it is a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, is own'd, which infers no more, than that all the World ſpeak not the ſame Language; but if Senſe be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and Wiſdom not ingroſs'd by any Age or Place, then muſt it withall be concluded, that Interpretation is beneficial. This Book was never hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto made <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet in its own Tongue hath been ſtill reputed among the choiceſt Pieces of Humane Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and ſure in Diſcourſes of this Nature, the intelligent Reader doth

not value <hi>Tully</hi> by the elegancy of his Style, but ſoundneſs of Judgment, and orderly deduction of Arguments. True Philoſophy being a ray of right Reaſon, ſhines equall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in all Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages; yet is more effectual, when man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ag'd by a Maſter of Eloquution in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, as concern'd in the very Caſes which he Debates. The Author of this Treatiſe, famous for admirable Parts, had, by his induſtry and ſucceſs in pleading Cauſes, attain'd to great Wealth and Honour; but upon alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Government, was oblig'd to retire to his Seat at <hi>Tuſculum;</hi> where the Scene of his <hi>Five Days De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi> is laid. The Subject, matter of higheſt Importance, ſuitable to the gravity of his Perſon, and occaſion of the times. <hi>Cicero</hi> aged ſixty years, and beſet with many State-Enemies, put himſelf on this guard, againſt the approaches of Natural Death, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes of an Aſſaſſinate. Theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
<pb facs="tcp:60877:3"/>
ſupported him under the affliction of his Daughter <hi>Tullia</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceaſed in Child-bed. He that had formerly rul'd the Bar by the Power of his Eloquence, and ſat Prince in the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf from the Inſolence of a Victorious Army, diverts his Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly upon theſe nobler Studies. Thus diſengag'd from Noiſe and Buſineſs; from the vain Pomp of numerous, but ſpecious. Friends; he attends to his better part; enquires after a State of true Happineſs: Here adviſes with the Ancient Sages, and grave Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers of <hi>Greece.</hi> Theſe for the moſt part, eſpecially <hi>Socrates,</hi> determine it to conſiſt in a <hi>Peace of mind, through the Exerciſe of Vertue, ranging the Affections under the Obedience of Reaſon.</hi> To aſſert the Dignity of Humane Nature in its Primitive Inſtitution; the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Soul, as to its Original,
<pb facs="tcp:60877:4"/>
ſiſtence; Operations and Duration; to ſettle the Empire of Reaſon; a Liberty which no external Force can controul; and that braves the atmoſt malice of Fortune: Theſe are ſteps by which the Spirit raiſeth it ſelf up to Object, adequate to its Faculties; contemplates the Beauties of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, wonderful order of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Motions, and by the Chain of Cauſes, aſcends up to that all wiſe Power, which at firſt diſpos'd, and always governs them. An Idea of Wiſdom did in ſome meaſure appear to the diligent ſearchers after Truth; but in practice occur'd inſufficiency of Knowledge, and frailty of Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Whereupon <hi>Cicero</hi> puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon enquiry after the Cauſes of our early Depravation. Mankind muſt be govern'd by Conſcience, true; but that muſt be inform'd by a Law antecedent to poſitive Conſtitutions, which being in different Countries
<pb facs="tcp:60877:4"/>
divers, would leave the Boundaries of Good and Evil, as litigious as thoſe of Empire. We are ordain'd for Honour; but there is a vain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, the counterfeit of true Glory. Beſides, Judgment often renders to Paſſion or Intereſt; ſo that he was ſenſible how ſhort the Beſt are of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: Indeed he follows the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Doctors, rather than the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; for, to ſay the truth, as to the Particulars of a future State, what can frail man, unaſſiſted by Divine Revelation, comprehend or deliver for certain? Our Senſes make no faithful report of Things beyond their narrow Sphere: Our moſt quick-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mind hardly penetrates the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of objects lying in our way. Nor can we recover things paſt, as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Creation, beyond the help of Records, without Divine Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60877:5"/>
This uncertainty of Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the higheſt Points, whilſt it contributes to a conviction of its own preſent inſufficiency for recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end to which it was once or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd; demonſtrates the need we have of a ſafer guidance than that of our own Wiſdom, and inhances the Benefit of Supernatural Truths. From this doubtful apprehenſion, as to a future condition, and frailty of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, our Author is mov'd to reſolve all his care into an affiance in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal goodneſs of God; upon this he ſuſpends comfortable hopes, and ſeems already to breath after a Bleſſed Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Philoſophy had no mean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to repair our decai'd Natures; and advance us to the perſwaſion of a certain Immortality. This glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſe a Covenant of Grace in the Sacred Indentures ingroſs'd, doth more amply effect. Be nothing of this underſtood, to arraign at the
<pb facs="tcp:60877:5"/>
Bar of the written Law, thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whom God, through his unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Counſels, had for ſome time left to the enquiring out his Being and Will by the dim Light of Nature, and their impaired Reaſon. Only ſuffice it that we know there is no other way to Happineſs, than by complying with thoſe eaſie and honourable terms of Reconciliation offer'd. A Royal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, however full, hath been revok'd, when not receiv'd with thankfulneſs. Again, that we miſtake not Privilege for Performance; nor exalt our ſelves by looking down with ſcorn and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon others under unlike Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but rather, as in truth we ought, place our ſelves with them upon the ſame level, at the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Tribunal of Natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, common to us both; and there take an impartial Tryal, whether their attainments from Reaſon, do not aggravate our improficiency under
<pb facs="tcp:60877:6"/>
Grace, and conſign us over to a leſs tolerable doom. Can we read that <hi>Socrates</hi> by Arguments drawn from the viſible World, and the reflex acts of his own mind, could collect the Souls Immortality, a future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Rewards and Puniſhments, hear him declare, that in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation hereof, he prepar'd himſelf ſo to live, as that his Apology might find acceptance in that day; nay, further maintain, that we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſubmit to the moſt infamous Death, than quit the profeſſion of an honeſt Principle. Laſtly, can we ſee him refuſing unwarrantable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery from Priſon; ſeal this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with his Blood (aveng'd in the ſignal and ſpeedy Deſtruction of his Capital Enemies?) Can we read theſe eminent Inſtances of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Morals, and not be provok'd to call our ſelves to account; with what ready ſubmiſſion have we received
<pb facs="tcp:60877:6"/>
Truths deliver'd us upon Divine Teſtimony? Do we give them that Obedience which their Authority chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges? Are we prepar'd to contend for them, if Providence order the Tryal at the price of our Lives? If in this Scale any of us prove light, then ſhall we be found both in Judgment and Practice to come ſhort of thoſe whom we muſt exceed, if we pretend to an equal Retribution. Pardon, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader, this deſcant upon the matter of the preſent Treatiſe; though you perhaps may need no Cautions in converſing with Humane Authors, yet we ſtand upon the defenſive againſt ſuch as will ſeek ſpecious Pretences for not reading them. We do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Perfections of Nature to the ſuperſeding Grace. We are not able to lay down the Penalty to an infinite Juſtice offended; ſufficient to repair the Ruines of a laps'd Nature. That Glory be reſerv'd to the mighty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer
<pb facs="tcp:60877:7"/>
of Mankind; but we muſt act in ſubſerviency to him, as ſtanding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable, not only for infus'd Habits, but alſo natural Faculties. Therefore do not diſ-regard the ardent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Deity; much leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, without Commiſſion, to paſs hard Cenſure upon their Perſons; fearing leſt their humble Senſe of Ignorance, and diligent purſuit of Wiſdom, that is, the knowledge of their Duty to God and Man, riſe up in Judgment, and condemn our empty confidence in external Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and title of Profeſſors.</p>
            <p>But I am aware that this Lecture may be thought dull and prolix. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and Divinity require ſtrict intention of mind, which ſoon tires; therefore I fear the Gravity of the Subject may, with ſome, prejudge the choice of the Work. Hiſtories, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, are delightful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial.
<pb facs="tcp:60877:7"/>
But if a brave Action ſo much affect the Reader, ſurely that Principle of Honour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which inform'd the Actor, muſt needs create greater admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in him, when ſet forth in live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colours. Theſe Exerciſes have ſomewhat in them, ſtrangely ſuited to the Temper of the Gentry. A Sophiſter cometh, poſſeſs'd with ſome mean and vulgar perſwaſion. His Profeſſor debates the Queſtion calmly. Joyns to ſolid Argument, all the Powers of Moral Swaſion; enforces Precepts with Example. Here you have the different Opinions of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers examin'd; Characters and Paſſions quicken'd with Poetical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions. Laſtly the connate Notions of Good and Evil, ſo openly diſplay'd and narrowly apply'd, that the modeſt Youth, upon better Information, eſpouſes the more generous Principle, and goes a way for ever after rectify'd in judgment.

Of thoſe who judge that the Soul departs, ſome hold that it preſently ſcatters; ſome again, after a long ſpace; others maintain that it endures for ever. Now what it is, where ſeated, or whence it cometh, is matter of great Controverſie. Some take it to be the heart; whence men are ſaid to be without Heart, of a bad Heart, or of one Heart. And that great Stateſman <hi>Naſica,</hi> who was twice Conſul, had the Surname of Wiſe-heart.</p>

He kept to his Art, yet ſomewhat he ſaid, which ſomewhat ſuch as it was, had been long before both ſaid and explain'd by <hi>Plato. Xenocrates</hi> deny'd that the Soul hath any corporeal Figure, but ſaid it was a number, whoſe Power, as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had before held, was of great Efficacy in Nature. His Maſter <hi>Plato</hi> divided the Soul into three Parts. The Principal of theſe, which is Reaſon, he plac'd in the Head as in its Citadel, and ſeparated into two, Anger and Luſt, which he lodg'd in different Apartments, placing Anger in the Stomach, and Luſt under the Entrails. But <hi>Dicaearchus</hi> in that Diſcourſe which he held at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and put out in three Books in the Perſon of learned men, in the firſt Books brings in many Diſputants; in the two latter introduceth one <hi>Pherecrates</hi> an old man of <hi>Phthia,</hi> whom he alledgeth as deſcended of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> and there to argue that there is no ſuch being as a Soul; that it is a meer Name without a Notion, and that we ſpeak improperly in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Creatures have a living Soul; whereas in truth there is neither in Man nor Beaſt, any ſuch thing as Soul or Spirit, but all that Power which produceth in us Actions of the Mind, or Senſes is an equal Complexion of the Elements, nor can ſubſiſt in a ſeparate Eſtate, as being no ſubſtance, but plain body, which under ſuch a Figure, is by its natural Temper diſpos'd to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation and Senſe. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> who far ſurpaſſeth all others <hi>(Plato</hi> alwayes excepted) both in Parts and Induſtry, after he had computed the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which furniſh material cauſe of exiſtence to

                  <p>I would fain both might be, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but it is hard to confound them: Wherefore, if without ſcanning them at large, we may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from the Terrors of death, let that be our buſineſs; but if that cannot be obtain'd till this queſtion of the Souls nature be decided, let us now diſpatch this, and that another time.</p>

                  <p>I judge that more convenient, which I find you like better; for it will be concluded with good Reaſon, that whatſoever of thoſe Opinions which I have alledged, prove true, death muſt be either not evil, or rather good. For if the Soul be Heart, or Blood, or Brains, of a certain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Corporal, it will dye with the other Body. If it be breath, perhaps it will ſcatter into thin Air: If Fire, it will be quench'd: If it be the Harmony of <hi>Ariſtoxenus,</hi> it will be diſcompoſed. What need I mention <hi>Dicaearchus,</hi> who allows not the Soul to be any Subſtance? according to all theſe Opinions, none hath any concern after Death; for Life and Senſe are extinguiſh'd together. But what is inſenſible, hath neither intereſt in good or evil. The Judgments of the reſt open ſome door of Hope, if this may chance to pleaſe you, that our Souls, when they have eſcap'd out of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, may arrive at Heaven, as at their own Home.</p>

               <p>BUT as We conceive the Being of God by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtinct, but gather his Nature and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes by rational Deductions; ſo that Souls do ſubſiſt in a ſeparate State, we judge by the conſent of all Nations; what Manſions they inhabit, and what be their eſſential Qualities we muſt learn; by reaſon the ignorance of which hath feigned a Hell in the Center of the Earth, and thoſe bugbears which you did ſeem not without juſt Cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe. For when Bodies fell into the Earth, and were covered within the ground, from whence they are ſaid to be <hi>inhum'd,</hi> they fancied that the dead led the reſt of their Life under the Earth. Upon which opinion of theirs, great errors enſu'd; theſe the Poets improv'd. For the cram'd Seats of the Theater, in which be Women and Children, are mov'd when they hear ſuch a lofty Verſe:</p>

               </q>
               <p>And ſo far did the error prevail, which ſeems to me now taken quite away, that though they knew Corpſes to have been burnt, yet they feign'd ſuch Acts done below, as could neither be performed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60877:22"/>
without corporeal Organs, nor underſtood. For <hi>they could not comprehend</hi> the Soul's ſubſiſting in a ſeparate condition, but requir'd it to have ſome ſhape and figure. Upon this conceit depends all <hi>Homer</hi>'s Deſcent into Hell. Upon the ſame, that <hi>Necromancy,</hi> which my Friend <hi>Appius</hi> practis'd.

Earth, ſituated in the middle of the Univerſe, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the proportion of a Point, which they call the Center, in compariſon with the vaſt Orb of the Starry Heavens: and further, that ſuch is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the four Elements, that their Motions are divided by oppoſite terms; ſo that terrene and humid Bodies of their own bent and ſway, tend perpendicularly to the Earth and Sea; the two remaining parts, the one of Fire, the other of Air, as the former by their heavineſs, ſink down into the middle of the World; ſo theſe ſore up at right Angles to the heavenly Regions; whether it be their own nature to aſpire upward; <ref target="#WC4307BK1SECT17C">(c)</ref> or that the lighter parts are naturally lifted up by the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the more heavy.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60877:24"/>
muſt mount upwards; for theſe two Elements have nothing in them tending downward, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes aſcend ſo, whether they ſcatter in the Air; it muſt be far from falling to the Earth; or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they continue, and ſubſiſt in a ſeparate Eſtate, they muſt of more neceſſity mount up to Heaven, forcing their paſſage through this groſs and impure Air, which is neareſt the Earth; for the Soul is hotter, or rather more fiery than is this Air, which I juſt now call'd groſs and impure.</p>

they would do well to conſider, who ſay, they cannot conceive what a Soul ſhould be without a Body; they will find what Conception they have of it, now it is in the Body.

That only therefore which moves it ſelf, becauſe it is never deſerted of it ſelf, neither doth it ever ceaſe moving; nay, this is the Spring, this the Principle of Motion, to other things which are mov'd. Now a Principle hath no precedent ſource of being, for all things ariſe from their Principle, but it can ſpring from no other thing; for ſo it would ceaſe to be a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, if it were begotten of any thing elſe; but if it be never generated, neither will it ever corrupt; for a Principle aboliſh'd, can neither ariſe again from another, nor can it produce any other thing from it ſelf; for all things must neceſſarily ariſe from their Principle; ſo cometh it about, that the Principle of Motion, muſt be at that which moveth it ſelf; now that can neither be born, nor dye; or elſe all Heaven would tumble down, and the whole frame of Nature stop its courſe; nor have any Mover, by whoſe first impreſſion it ſhould be ſet on Motion. It being therefore plain, that what moves it ſelf, is eternal, who can deny the Nature of Souls to be ſuch; for whatſoever is ſtir'd by a foreign Impreſſion, is inanimate; but every Animal is quickened by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motion, and of its own; for that is the proper
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60877:28"/>
Nature and Power of the Soul; which if it be the only of all Subſtances, that alwayes moves it ſelf; neither was it in truth ever born, and is eternal.</p>

                  <hi>Let all the petty Philoſophers (for ſo ſhould they be call'd, in my opinion, who differ from</hi> Plato <hi>and</hi> Socrates, <hi>and that Family) let them come in to aſſiſt one another; they will not only never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs any thing ſo neatly, but alſo never be able to diſcern where the ſtreſs of the Argument lyes.</hi>

                  <hi>The Soul therefore is ſenſible that it moves, and is withall ſenſible that it moves by its own, and no foreign Impulſe; and that it can never be, that it ſhould fail it ſelf, from whence its Eternity is concluded, unleſs you have any reply to offer.</hi>
               </p>

               <head>SECT. XXIV. <hi>From the capaciouſneſs of its memory.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHat do you think of theſe other Inſtances? Take you them to be of leſs moment? which manifeſt that there is ſomewhat Divine in the Souls of men; which could I perceive how they could have been born, I might alſo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how they ſhould dye. For as to the Blood, Choler, Phlegm, Bones, Sinews, Veins, in a word, all the mould of the Limbs, and of the whole Body, methinks I could account for them, whereof they are compounded, and how they were form'd <hi>from the Soul it ſelf, if there accru'd no other advantage, but that we liv'd by it; I ſhould think the Life of man as much ſupported by Nature, as that of a Vine or other Plant;</hi> for we ſay, that they alſo live. Again, if the Soul of man had no other, Faculties, than thoſe of deſiring and avoiding; that too it would have in common with the Beaſts. For the firſt inſtance, it hath memory, and that infinite, of innumerable things; <ref target="#WC4307BK1SECT24F">(f)</ref> ſo that <hi>Plato would have it to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling to mind what was known in a former Life.</hi> For in that Book which is entitled <hi>Menon, Socrates</hi> asks a certain Youngſter ſome Geometrical que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, about the content of a Square: He anſwers them, as a Child; and yet the Interrogatories are ſo eaſie, that the anſwer proceeding, ſtep by ſtep, cometh at length to that paſs, as if he had learn'd Mathematicks; from which <hi>Socrates</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that to learn, is nothing elſe, but to refreſh
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60877:29"/>
the Memory. Which Topick he explains much more accurately; yet in that Dialogue which he held, the very day wherein he ſubmitted to the Execution of the Sentence paſs'd upon his Life; wherein he teaches, that any one, let him ſeem utterly illiterate and unexperienc'd, if he anſwer directly to one that puts apt queſtions to him, doth make it manifeſt, that he doth not then learn thoſe Matters anew, but only recollect what he had before in his memory. And that it were wholly impoſſible for us to have the Notions, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call common, of ſo many, and ſo great things, from our Childhood imprinted, and as it were regiſtred in our Souls, <hi>unleſs the Soul before it entred the Body, had been employ'd in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the World.</hi> And if it had been nothing, as is in all places diſputed by <hi>Plato</hi> (for he thinks that to be nothing, which cometh by Generation, and turns to Corruption, and that only to have being, which is ſuch always as he calls his Idea, we the Species or Kind) the Soul after it was locked up in the Body could not come to underſtand them, therefore it brought the knowledge of them with it hither; by which means all admiration of our knowing ſo many things ceaſes. <hi>Nor doth the Soul diſcern them on the ſudden, after ſhe is remov'd into ſuch a strange and confus'd habitation, till ſhe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected and recruited her ſelf, for then ſhe recovers thoſe dormant notices, by remembrance of them;</hi> ſo that Learning is nothing elſe, than a recalling to mind. Now I muſt confeſs, I do after an extraordinary manner, admire the memory; what is that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, whereby we remember? what is its force? or whence its nature? I do not demand about ſuch a memory, as <hi>Simonides</hi> is ſaid to have had; ſuch as <hi>Theodectes;</hi> ſuch as he who was ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador

you imagine that ſo great an ability of memory can be produc'd or compounded of Earth, or this groſs Region of Air? You do not ſee what is its Nature: But what are its Qualities, you do ſee; or if you do not that neither, what is its quantity, to be ſure you do ſee. How then do we conceive of it? whether do we think there is <hi>any concavity, into which, as into a Fat, we turn up the things which we remember?</hi> that is abſurd: For what bottom, or what ſuch Figure of the Soul can be imagin'd? or what Gage of ſo large a Size? <hi>Or do we take the Soul to be impreſt as Wax, and the Memory for the Prints of things ſet down in the Mind, as in a Table-book?</hi> What Prints can there be of Words? what of the things themſelves? Laſtly, what Volum ſo vaſt, as to repreſent ſuch numerous Nations? What think you ſhould that Power be, which brings to light uſeful Secrets, which is call'd Invention, or Deviſing? or that it can be compounded of this earthly, mortal and frail Nature? What judge you of him, who the firſt impos'd names on all things, which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> reckons a Work of the higheſt Wiſdom? or who drew ſcatter'd men into Communities, and incorporated them for the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Support of Life? or who couch'd the Sounds of the Voice, which ſeem'd infinite, into the marks of a few Letters? or who calculated the Courſes, Progreſſions, Stations of the Planets. All of them were great Perſonages. Thoſe of higher Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity yet, who found out Corn, who Cloathing, who Houſes, who the helps of living handſomly, who guards againſt wild Beaſts; <hi>by whom being ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliz'd and reclaim'd, we naturally proceeded from the neceſſary, to the more polite Arts?</hi> for entertainment of the Ears, was in great meaſure found out and temper'd, with variety of Notes and Voices.

               </head>
               <p>IN my judgment, I muſt ſay, even theſe more familiar and illuſtrious Inſtances, ſeem not performable, without ſome Divine Power: ſo as I ſhould think that either a Poet pours out a grave and accompliſh'd Poem, without ſome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inſtinct of the Mind; or that any Eloquence, without ſome extraordinary impulſe, can flow in a mighty Stream of lofty Words, and copious Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. And for <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> the Mother of all Arts, what is it elſe; but, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, the Gift, as I the Invention of the Gods? <hi>This</hi> firſt train'd us up to their Worſhip; next, to Juſtice towards men, which conſiſts in the Preſervation of Societies:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60877:31"/>
And laſtly to Moderation and Courage, this alſo hath diſpell'd the darkneſs from our Souls, as from our Eyes, that we can behold the Extremities of Nature; what is above, below, firſt, midſt, laſt. <hi>Truly this Power ſeems to me to be Divine, which can work ſo many,</hi> and ſo admirable Effects. For what is Memory of things and words? What is Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Certainly ſuch, as no greater Perfections can be apprehended to be in God. Now, I am not of the mind, that the Gods take pleaſure in Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> or in a Goddeſs of everlaſting Youth, to bear their Cups: Nor do I believe <hi>Homer,</hi> who ſaith, that <hi>Ganymede</hi> was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd by the Gods, for his Beauty, to fill <hi>Jupiter</hi> Drink; a Cauſe no way ſufficient, why ſuch an injury ſhould be offer'd <hi>Laomedon.</hi> This was a meer Fiction of <hi>Homer</hi>'s, who made Gods like men; I could have wiſh'd, he had rather made men like Gods. Wherein like Gods? in Activity, Wiſdom, Invention, Memory. Therefore, <hi>the Soul,</hi> which, as I ſay, <hi>is Divine;</hi> as <hi>Euripides</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to ſay, is a God; truly if God be either Spirit, or Fire, the ſame is mans Soul; for as that heavenly Nature is free both from Earth and moiſture; ſo the humane Soul partakes of neither of them. But if it be a fifth Nature, firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> the ſame is common both to the Soul and God.

               <p>NOW what elſe do we, when we call of our mind from following Pleaſure, that is, the Body? from minding our Eſtate, that is, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Body? when we withdraw it from managing State-Affairs, and all buſineſs?

Suppoſe the Soul ſo to periſh, as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60877:38"/>

No body ſaith ſo; although <hi>Epicurus</hi> chargeth that on <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,</hi> his Followers deny it; neither is there any ſenſe therefore left in the Soul; for that it ſelf is no where; where then is the Evil; for there is no third Subject; is it becauſe the parting of the Soul from the Body, paſſeth not without pain? Should I believe it to be ſo, <hi>how ſmall a buſineſs is that? and I take it to be untrue, for it happens fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently without Senſe, nay ſometimes with Pleaſure.</hi> And that whole concern, make the moſt of it, is of ſmall import, for it indureth but a Moment. <hi>That conſideration perplexeth, or rather torments, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from all thoſe things which are good in this Life.</hi> Look whether it may not more truly be ſaid from the Evils thereof. Why ſhould I now bewail mans Life? I might truly, and have title to do ſo; but what needs it, when I am labouring to take off the opinion, that we ſhall be miſerable after death, to make even Life more miſerable, by bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it? We have done this in that Book wherein we comforted our ſelves, as much as we could. Therefore, to ſtate the queſtion aright, Death withdraws us from Evils, not from Goods. This Point was ſo largely debated by <hi>Hegeſias</hi> the <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naick,</hi> that he is reported to have been prohibited by King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to diſpute publickly on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, becauſe many upon the hearing it, made themſelves away. <hi>Callimachus</hi> hath an Epigram upon <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> the <hi>Ambraciote;</hi> who, ſaith he, had no misfortune befell him; but upon reading <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dialogue, threw himſelf from the Wall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea.

               <p>THESE accidents are eſcap'd by dying, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they never actually befall us, yet becauſe of their poſſibility: But men do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider themſelves liable to theſe chances; every one hopes for <hi>Metellus</hi>'s Fortune: <hi>As though either there were more fortunate than unhappy; or there were any certainty in man's Eſtate; or it were more prudent to hope than fear.</hi> But be this granted, that men are depriv'd of their good things, by death, is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſequent, that the Dead lack the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of Life, and that it is a miſerable thing ſo to do? To be ſure they muſt ſay ſo. Can he that hath no Being, be in want of any thing? the very name of want is ſad, becauſe it imports thus much. The man had ſomething, hath it not; deſireth, looketh after, needeth it. Theſe are, I take it, the Inconveniencies of want. One wants Eyes; to be blind is diſcomfortable: Another Children; ſo is it to be Childleſs. This holds in the Living; but none of the Dead want any comforts of Life;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60877:40"/>
no, nor Life it ſelf. I ſpeak of the Dead, which have no Being; we who have a Being, though we are without Horns or Wings, would any one of us ſay he wanted them? None, I trow. For <hi>if one have not that which is neither for his uſe, nor agreeable to his Nature; he doth not want it, though he is ſenſible he hath it not.</hi> This Argument is to be urged over and over, when that is made out, which is unqueſtionable upon ſuppoſition of the Souls mortality; but that there is ſo total an Abolition in death, as that there is not left the leaſt Suſpition of any Senſe. This therefore being fully reſolv'd, it muſt be ſtrictly ſearch'd, to find what it is to want, that ſo there be no ambiguity left in the Term. <hi>Want</hi> therefore, is the being without that, which one deſireth to have; for deſire is imply'd in miſſing, unleſs in ſuch caſe, as when we ſpeak of having miſs'd the Fit of an Ague, in a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd notion of the word. The term of wanting is farther uſed in another Senſe, when one is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a thing, and ſenſible that he is without it, and yet not much concern'd about it; but to want any evil, is not properly ſpoken, for that would import no ſorrow for it. The oppoſite is properly ſaid <hi>to want good, which is evil;</hi> but neither doth the Living want what he doth not need. Yet it may be underſtood, of a living man, that he wants a Kingdom; now this cannot, with any Logical Truth, be ſaid of you; it might of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> when he was depos'd and baniſh'd from his Kingdom; but the term can by no means be underſtood of a dead man; for <hi>want is proper to one that hath Senſe; but the Dead have no Senſe;</hi> therefore neither do the Dead want. Though what need we ſyllogize on this Point; ſince we ſee the matter ſtands in no ſuch great need of Logic?</p>

Wherefore, whether all Senſe be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd, and death be like that ſleep, which ſometimes giveth a moſt ſweet reſt, undiſturb'd by Dreams; good God? what gain is it to dye? or how many days can be found, preferrible to ſuch a night as the perpetual Duration of the following time ſhall preſent? Who then ſo happy as I? but if, what is ſaid, be true, that death is a removal into thoſe Coaſts, which thoſe, who are hence departed, inhabit, that is yet far more happy, when you have paſs'd thorough pretended Judges, to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore real ones, ſuch as are <hi>Minos, Rhadamanthus, Aeacus, Triptolemus,</hi> and to conſort with thoſe who have liv'd juſtly, and with integrity.

For my part, if it were poſſible, I could be content to dye many times over, if I could find what I now mention.

As by that Diſputation which I lately held in my Houſe at <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> there ſeem'd to have been wrought a great contempt of Death, which is of no ſmall influence to free the Soul from the fear of it. For he who is continually afraid of that which cannot be avoided, can by no means have any quiet of his Life; but he that doth not fear death, not only becauſe he muſt of neceſſity dye, but becauſe death hath nothing dreadful in it, that man hath gain'd good intereſt towards the enſuring a happy Life. Although we are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that many will earneſtly contradict theſe things which we could no ways prevent, unleſs we would write nothing at all; for if our very Orations, which we deſir'd ſhould be approv'd to the judgment of the Multitude (for the Faculty is popular, and the Approbation of the Auditors, is the work that Eloquence hath to do) but <hi>if there were ſome men in the World, who would commend nothing, but what they were confident themſelves could imitate,</hi> and made their own hope the Standard of their good words, and when they were born down with copiouſneſs of words and ſenſe, would ſay they had rather have Barrenneſs and Poverty, than Plenty and Riches; from whence <ref target="#WC4307BK2SECT1O">(o)</ref> a ſort of <hi>Attick</hi> Speakers took their Riſe, who knew not themſelves what it was they pretended to follow; and who are now ſilenc'd, being almoſt laugh'd out of Court: what do we think would become of us, when we ſee we cannot now have the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple any longer our abettor, as we had before; for <hi>Philoſophy is contented to have but few judges; and ſtudiouſly avoids the multitude, as being ſuſpected by it, and hated of it.</hi> So that if a man would ſpeak againſt Philoſophy in general, he might have the People on his ſide; or if he would go about to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack

And indeed <hi>the Praiſe of Orators among us hath been ſo advanc'd from a mean condition, till it is come to the higheſt pitch, that now according to the courſe of Nature, in almoſt all things, declineth and ſeemeth ready, within a very ſhort time, to dwindle into nothing.</hi> Let the Birth of Philoſophy in <hi>Latin,</hi> bear date from theſe times, and let us be helping to it; and be contented to be diſprov'd and confuted, which they take impatiently, who are as it were pre-engaged, and <ref target="#WC4307BK2SECT2Q">(q)</ref> have eſpouſed certain Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of the Doctors of their reſpective Sects, and ſo lye under a neceſſity, to maintain them for Honors ſake, though they are often in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences

not convinc'd of their Truth. We who purſue after probabilities, and pretend not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance farther, than to what carrieth with it the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Truth, are ready both to diſprove without confidence, and to be diſprov'd without paſſion. Now if theſe Studies ſhall be tranſlated to our Country-men, we ſhall not ſo much as need <hi>Greek</hi> Libraries, in which there is an infinite number of Books, by reaſon of the multitude of Writers. For <hi>the ſame things are ſaid over and over again by diverſe Perſons, whereupon they have fill'd the World with Books.</hi> Which ill conſequent will attend our People alſo, if the generality ſhall break in upon theſe Studies. But let us, if we can incite thoſe, who to an ingenuous Education have added a Practice of polite Diſcourſe, and do handle Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Queſtions <ref target="#WC4307BK2SECT2R">(r)</ref>  in an orderly way, with proper and concluſive Arguments.</p>

                  <p>No wonder at that, for this is the proper work of Philoſophy, it healeth the Diſtempers of the mind, removeth vain Diſquiets, ſets free from impetuous Deſires, baniſheth Fears; but this its Vertue is not of equal Efficacy with all.

on a generous mind. But do you think the ſame Arguments would prevail with thoſe very men, bating ſome few of them, by whom they have been invented, diſputed, and compiled. For where is there one Philoſopher of a thouſand to be found, of ſuch a Temper and Converſation, as Reaſon requires? who maketh uſe of his Doctrine not for Oſtentation of Knowledge, but a Rule of Life? who believes himſelf, and obſerves his own Precepts?

In the next place, <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> prov'd Scholar apt enough in this laſh and unmanlike Leſſon. After him <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Rhodes</hi> ſaid, That freedom from Pain was the chiefeſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; ſo much Evil did he apprehend in Pain. The other Philoſophers, <ref target="#WC4307BK2SECT6W">(w)</ref> beſides <hi>Zeno, Ariſto, Pyrrho,</hi> commonly maintain the ſame, as you late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, That it is Evil; but there are other things worſe. Therefore what nature it ſelf, and an in-bred Gallantry of Spirit doth inſtantly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor, that you ſhould call Pain the greateſt Evil, and diſhonour being match'd with it, you ſhould quit the miſtake; in that Point, <hi>Philoſophy the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtreſs of Life,</hi> is for ſo many Ages peremptory. What Duty, what Praiſe, what Honour can be ſo valuable, as that he ſhould be content to purchaſe at the rate of bodily Pain, who hath taken up the Perſwaſion, That Pain is the greateſt Evil? Again, what Ignominy, what Baſeneſs will not any one ſubmit to, that he may eſcape Pain, if he have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd that to be the greateſt Evil? Nay, who is not miſerable, not only at the time when he ſhall

Poetry muſt conform to the Age upon which it depends, and pleaſeth for its likeneſs. But Comedy ſtill reſembleth the moſt miſguided part of Mankind. So that the wiſeſt Philoſophers have preſcrib'd the Poets to be read with more than ordinary caution, and ſtrong correctives of the ill qualities lurking in them.</p>

It is one thing, I ſay, to be in Pain, another to take Pains. <hi>C. Marius</hi> was in Pain, when his ſwellings in the Veins of his Feet were cut.

                  <p>Whether therefore Pain be evil or not, let the <hi>Stoicks</hi> look to that; who by certain captious and nice Arguments, ſuch as no ways reach home to the Senſes, would ſeem to demonſtrate that Pain, is not evil. Be it what it will for Quality, I think it is not for quantity ſo great as it ſeems to be; and I do affirm, that men are more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtruck with the falſe appearance and concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, than they reaſonably ought to be; and <ref target="#WC4307BK2SECT18B">(b)</ref> that its whole ſmart is tolerable.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60877:71"/>
and conquering the World, to bear Pain patiently. Nor was there ever any who did not eſteem him who did thus bear it, worthy of Praiſe. What therefore is both requir'd of the Valiant; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in them when it is perform'd; either to fear that when it is coming, or to faint under it when it is come; how can that otherwiſe choſe, than be baſe and diſhonourable? Now conſider, when all right Diſpoſitions of the mind be called Vertues, whether that be not a name improperly appliable to all: but whether all be not nam'd from that one diſpoſition which excells the reſt: For manlineſs is call'd from man; but <hi>fortitude is the moſt manly Vertue,</hi> whoſe two principal Offices are a contempt of Death and Pain: let us therefore put theſe in Practice, if we would be vertuous or rather Men; for Manlineſs, which denominateth the other Vertues, hath borrowed its name from man.</p>

cunning Fellow, but rather very honeſt man, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to the beſt of his Skill; <hi>ſlight Pain,</hi> ſaith he. Now who is it that ſaith this? Why he that affirms Pain to be the greateſt Evil: not very conſiſtently: let us hear on. <hi>If Pain be at the higheſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it muſt needs be ſhort.</hi> Say me thoſe words over again, for I do not underſtand what you mean by the higheſt, nor what by being ſhort. <hi>The higheſt, than which nothing is higher; ſhort, than which nothing is ſhorter.</hi> I deſpiſe the greatneſs of that Pain, from which the ſhortneſs of time will releaſe me almoſt as ſoon as it ſhall come; but if the Pain be ſo great as was that of <hi>Philoctetes,</hi> it ſeems to me conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably great, but yet not at the higheſt; for nothing aketh but the Feet; the Head, the Sides, the Lungs might, all the Parts might. Therefore it is far from the higheſt Pain: <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>long Pain hath more pleaſure in it than trouble.</hi> Now cannot I ſay, that a man of his Reputation is without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, but I think we are mock'd by him: The Pain which is at the higheſt (and I ſuppoſe it at the higheſt, although there may be one ten Atomes greater) I do not preſently affirm it muſt be ſhort, and can inſtance in many ſufficient men, that for very many years have been tormented with the Gout; but this wary Perſon never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth either the greatneſs of the Pain, or ſhortneſs of Time; ſo that I may come to know what he means by the higheſt in Pain, what ſhort in Time. Let us therefore leave him, ſaying nothing to any purpoſe, and let us oblige him to confeſs, that the remedy againſt Pain, is not to be expected from him, who ſhall hold Pain to be the greateſt of Evils. Let the ſame Perſon in his Collick, Stone, and Strangury, ſet never ſo good a Face on the matter. Elſewhere therefore muſt Cure be ſought,

               </head>
               <p>FOR as it falls out in Battle, that the Coward and timorous Souldier, as ſoon as he ſees the Face of an Enemy, flingeth away his Shield, and ſets on running as faſt as ever he can; and for that very reaſon, ſometimes is loſt before he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd any wound; when no ſuch thing befalls him who keeps his ground. So they who cannot abide the appearance of Pain, caſt away themſelves, and ſo grown heartleſs, ſink under Affliction; whereas they who have reſiſted it, moſt commonly come off with Victory. Now there are certain reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of the Soul with the Body. As Burdens are more eaſily borne, whilſt Bodies bear upright, if theſe give way, they overwhelm them: Juſt in like manner, <hi>the Soul, by putting forth its utmost Efforts, doth bear off all the preſſure of thoſe grievances which burthen it; but, upon ſhrinking, is ſo follow'd, that it can never raiſe it ſelf up.</hi> And to ſpeak the truth, an intention of the whole mind, is to be uſed in the Proſecution of all Offices of Life, for it is the ſole guard of Duty. But, in Pain chiefly, we muſt watch that we do nothing deſpondingly, nothing after a Cowardly, Slaviſh, effeminate manner; and eſpecially that the yelling out, like that of <hi>Philocte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> above, be diſapproved, and utterly rejected. Sometimes it may be allowable for a man to ſigh, and that but ſeldom; roaring out is not ſo, no not to a Woman. And this, indeed, is that lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60877:76"/>
which the twelve Tables prohibited the uſe o in Funerals. Nor will a valiant and wiſe man, ever ſo much as let a groan eſcape, unleſs it be in ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to put forth greater ſtrength. As Runners for a Prize. ſhout as loud as ever they can in the Race: So do Wreſtlers, whilſt they are in the Exerciſe; but Cuffers, even then when they give their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary a Blow, as they fetch their Whorle-bats round, let go a ſigh; not that they are grieved, or out of heart, but becauſe the ſtreſs of their whole Body vents it ſelf in an audible voice, and the Blow is ſet on with greater vehemency.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WHAT? they that would ſpeak louder than ordinary, are they contented to ſtrain their Sides, Throat and Tongue, out of which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, we ſee the voice raiſed and poured plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully forth? They force their whole Body, and as it were, ſtand on Tip-toes (as the Proverb is) to promote the earneſtneſs of their utterance. I ſpeak no untruth, <ref target="#WC4307BK2SECT24G">(g)</ref> I ſaw <hi>Mark Antony,</hi> when he made his earneſt defence, being impeach'd upon the <hi>Varian</hi> Law, touch the very ground with his Knee. <ref target="#WC4307BK2SECT24H">(h)</ref> For as Croſs-Bows, wrought up with Cap-ſtones, ſhoot forth their Stones, <ref target="#WC4307BK2SECT24I">(i)</ref> and other Engines their reſpective Darts, with ſo much the more violence, as they are ſtrain'd and skrew'd higher, ſo the Voice, ſo the Running, ſo the Blow falls heavier, with the greater Spring it is ſet on.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60877:77"/>
Now, ſince there is ſo great force of this ſtraining, if a groan in Pain ſhall any way conduce to force the Soul, we ſhall do well to vent it; but if that ſigh ſhall be lamenting, if feeble, if baſe, if whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he that ſhould render himſelf to ſuch low Paſſion, I ſhould hardly allow for a man. Which ſighing too, if it did Adminiſter any real relief, yet it were, for all that, to be conſider'd, what were the part of a gallant and couragious man; but ſince it abateth nothing of Pain, why do we chuſe to diſgrace our ſelves to no purpoſe? For <hi>what is more diſcreditable to any man, than crying like a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> Now this Rule, which is given about Pain, is of larger extent, for we muſt reſiſt all Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; not only Pain, with the like intention of Spirit. Paſſion burſts forth; Luſt diſturbeth. We muſt fly for refuge into the ſame Fortreſs; muſt ſtand to the ſame Arms; but becauſe our preſent Diſcourſe is of Pain, let us wave theſe Particulars. It is therefore of main advantage towards the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and calm enduring of Pain, to conſider with our whole heart, as goes the word, how honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it is. For we are naturally, as I ſaid before, (and oft'ner it muſt be ſaid) moſt eager and zealous upon Honour; if we ſee any twinkling of that, though but thorough a Crevis, there is nothing which we are not ready to bear, and go thorough with, that we may obtain it. It is from this race and eagerneſs of our Souls, after true praiſe and Honour, that thoſe dangers in Battle are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. Men of Valour feel not their wounds in the Field; or feel them they do, but chooſe rather to dye, than to part with the leaſt punctilio of their Honour. The <hi>Decii</hi> beheld the glittering Swords of their Enemies, when they charg'd upon their main Body; but <hi>the nobleneſs of their death, and</hi>

Since he left his Country in command over the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> which he had found in ſubjection to them.

               </head>
               <p>BUT eſpecially let us inure our ſelves to this, that our Patience, (which, I have often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, we muſt confirm with a ſturdy Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of mind) be uniform, as to all ſorts of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; for oftentimes many, who, out of deſire of Victory or Glory, or elſe to maintain their own Rights and Liberty, have received Wounds cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly, and bore them in quiet; yet the ſame Perſons having relax'd the bent of their Reſolution, cannot endure the anguiſh of a Diſeaſe; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they, out of Reaſon or Principles of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, endure that Pain which they did endure, but rather out of Heat and Gallantry. Therefore ſome Barbarous and Savage People can Fight ſtoutly, but cannot bear Sickneſs manfully: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the <hi>Grecians,</hi> not over-valiant, <ref target="#WC4307BK2SECT27T">(t)</ref> but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough in their way, cannot look an Enemy in the Face, yet the ſame Perſons take Diſeaſes patiently, and with a Moderation, becoming Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

                  <ref target="#WC4307BK2SECT27W">(w)</ref> and <hi>Celtiberians</hi> ſhout in Battle, lament in Sickneſs. For <hi>nothing can be even, that doth not proceed from a ſteady Principle of Reaſon;</hi> but when you behold thoſe that are led by deſire or opinion, not to be deterr'd by Pain from the Proſecution and acquiring of their propos'd object; you muſt either conclude that Pain is not evil; or although we ſhould agree, that whatſoever is rough and diſagreeable to Nature, be call'd evil, yet <hi>it is ſo little, that it is ſwallow'd up by valour, ſo that it appeareth not at all.</hi> Meditate on theſe things, I beſeech you, day and night. For this conſideration will extend it ſelf farther, and take up more room, than to be reſtrain'd only to this Point, about Pain; for if in all our Actions, we ſhall have regard to the avoiding baſeneſs, and acquiring Honour, we may then out-brave, not only the Diſciplines of Pain, but alſo the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps of Fortune; eſpecially having at hand <ref target="#WC4307BK2SECT27X">(x)</ref> that refuge-provided by our yeſterdays Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

by the Body? So it happens that the Soul does not paſs judgment of it ſelf, <ref target="#WC4307BK3SECT1B">(b)</ref> till that which is to give the judgment be diſtemper'd. Now if Nature had brought us into the World with an Original Ability, to look into, and clearly diſcern her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; and that under her ſureſt conduct we might paſs the courſe of our Life; there would be no reaſon, why any ſhould have uſe of Logick or Philoſophy.

               <p>WHEREAS, in truth, there are more and more dangerous Diſeaſes of the Soul, than of the Body: For even theſe latter, are therefore vexatious, becauſe they reach the Soul, and afflict it. <hi>Now the Soul vex'd, is</hi> (as ſaith <hi>Ennius) to all quiet loſt: Stays no where long; by new Luſts ſtill is toſs'd.</hi> Now what Bodily Diſeaſes, in the whole World, can be more grievous than thoſe two Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes (to paſs over the reſt) I ſay, than Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

and Luſt? But how can it be prov'd, that it ſhould be able to cure it ſelf; when it was the Soul that invented the Art of curing the Body?

In truth, there is a faculty of curing Souls, even Philoſophy; whoſe ſuccor is not, as in bodily Diſeaſes, to be fetch'd from abroad; but we muſt, with our whole might, and by all means, labour that we may cure our ſelves.

Now the Philoſophers ſtyle all Paſſions Diſeaſes, and ſay, that no Fool is free from theſe Diſeaſes; but they that are not in Temper, are Diſtempered. Now the Souls of all unwiſe men are not in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, therefore all unwiſe men are Diſtempered. Now this Temper of Souls, they judg'd to be plac'd in a calmneſs and conſtancy of mind; a mind deſtitute of theſe things, they called Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or Madneſs; becauſe in a diſturb'd Mind, as well as Body, there can be no good Temper.</p>

               <p>NOR was that leſs ingenuous, when they term'd ſuch habit of the mind, as is withdrawn from the conduct of Wiſdom, being out of the Wits, or beſides ones ſelf. Whence we may perceive, that thoſe who gave theſe Names to things, were of the ſame judgment as <hi>Socrates</hi> deliver'd, and the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi> have firmly maintain'd, that all unwiſe men, are not ſound in their Principle. Now the Soul that is any ways Diſeas'd, (and the Philoſophers, as I lately ſaid, term theſe inordinate Motions Diſeaſes) is no more ſound, than the Body when it is Diſeas'd.

Therefore nothing can be better expreſs'd, than the <hi>Latin</hi> Phraſe, when we ſay of men, that they are broke looſe from Government, when they are tranſported with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled Luſt or Anger; although Anger it ſelf be but a ſort of Luſt; for Anger is defin'd to be a Luſt of Revenge. They, therefore, that are ſaid not to be their own Maſters, are therefore ſaid ſo to be, becauſe they are not under the Government of their Underſtanding; to which Faculty the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of the whole Soul is by Nature given. Now whence the <hi>Greeks</hi> derive their name for Madneſs, I cannot eaſily gueſs; but we are more diſtinct in our Terms than they; for we ſeparate this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind, which is joyn'd with Folly, and of larger extent from diſtractedneſs.

               <p>IT is further likely, that he who is Temperate; whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> call Sober, and name the Vertue it ſelf Sobriety, which I am wont ſometimes to term Temperance, other times Moderation, and another while Modeſty; which yet I know not but it may be rightly called Integrity; this is more narrowly expreſs'd among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who call men of Integrity only uſeful men; but the Term is of larger extent, for it is all ſort of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, all ſort of innocence; this hath no uſual Name in <hi>Greek,</hi> but might be call'd by a word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting harmleſſneſs; for Innocence is ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of mind, as to harm no Body. Integrity comprehends alſo all the other Vertues; which unleſs it were ſo great, and had it been confin'd within the narrow bounds of Frugality or Thrift, as ſome conceive, the Sirname of <hi>L. Piſo</hi> had never been ſo honourable; but becauſe neither he that, through Fear, hath quitted his Garriſon, which is an act of Cowardiſe; nor he, who for covetouſneſs, hath deny'd to reſtore a Truſt ſecretly committed to him, which is an act of Injuſtice; nor he, who through raſhneſs, hath miſcarried in any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, which is a piece of Folly; becauſe none of theſe are wont to be call'd honeſt men, or men of Integrity: Therefore Integrity comprehends three of the Vertues, Fortitude, Juſtice, and Prudence;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60877:88"/>
and if it do ſo, it is common to all the Vertues; for all the Vertues are link'd and faſten'd inſeparably to one another. Therefore Integrity muſt needs be the remaining and fourth Vertue; for it ſeemeth to have this Property, to regulate and compoſe the Affections, always to repreſs the Enormity of the Will, and to preſerve a conſtant Moderation in all things. The contrary Vice to which, is called Naughtineſs. <hi>Frugality</hi> is, as I ſuppoſe, from Fruit, than which, nothing better ſprings out of the Earth. Naughtineſs is hence, (though, perhaps it may be ſomewhat hard, however let us aſſay, though it paſs but for an Alluſion, if there ſhould be nothing more) it is hence deriv'd from, that ſuch a man hath not ought in him, whereupon he is alſo ſaid to be nothing worth.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60877:91"/>
the one of which is a fond Pleaſure, that is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated beyond the due meaſure, from an opinion of any great Good, whereof we have the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the other may be rightly call'd, either a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting or Luſt; which is an immoderate purſuit after ſome conceiv'd great Good, not obeying Reaſon. Theſe two ſorts therefore, fond Pleaſure, and Luſt, are diſorderly upon a conceit of Good; as the other two, Fear and Diſcontent, of Evil. For both Fear is an Opinion of ſome great evil impending; and Diſcontent is an Opinion of ſome great Evil incumbent; and further a freſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of ſuch Evil, as that it is juſt to be diſquieted at it; which cometh to this, that the Party grieving, thinks he ought to grieve.

               <p>NOW ſince <hi>Terence</hi> hath ſo aptly inſinuated this Notion borrow'd from Philoſophy; ſhall not we, out of whoſe Fountains it is drawn, both ſay the ſame thing better, and more firmly hold it? for this is that countenance always the ſame, which <hi>Xanthippe</hi> is reported to have uſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that her-Husband <hi>Socrates</hi> had, and that ſhe ſaw him have one and the ſame when he went forth, and when he return'd home again. Nor was it that brow which <hi>M. Craſſus</hi> the Ancient bore, of whom <hi>Lucilius</hi> reports, that <hi>he laugh'd but once all his life-time;</hi> but it was calm and ſerene, for ſo have we receiv'd by Tradition. And well might it be always the ſame countenance, when there was no alteration in the mind, by which the looks are faſhion'd. Wherefore I receive from the <hi>Cyrenaicks,</hi> theſe Arms againſt contingent Events, whereby their approaching inſults, may, through long Premeditation, be rebated; and withall I judge, that their Evil is from conceit, and not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For if it were in that object, why would they be alleviated by being foreſeen? but there is ſomewhat more accurately to be ſpoken on this matter after we have look'd into the opinion of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who judgeth that they muſt all of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be Diſcontented, who conceive themſelves to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60877:94"/>
be under Evils, whether theſe Evils have been foreſeen and expected; or whether they are grown old; for that <hi>neither are Evils abated by long time, nor yet alleviated by foreſight of them;</hi> and that the poring on Evils not yet come, and perhaps that never will come, is fooliſh. For that all Evil is Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enough, when it is come; but he that is always thinking that ſome Adverſity may poſſibly befall him, to him it becometh an everlaſting Evil; but if it ſhall never actually come upon him, a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Diſquiet is taken up on falſe grounds; ſo the mind is always vex'd, either with enduring, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting Evil. But the relief of Diſcontent he placeth in two things, a taking of the mind from conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its troubles, and ſetting it on the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pleaſures; for he judges the Soul in capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to obey Reaſon, and to follow whether that leads: therefore Reaſon forbids to dwell upon the Cauſes of its Trouble: it fetcheth off from anxious thoughts, the ſight of the mind dim'd with poring upon its Miſeries; and when it hath ſounded a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from them, it puſheth it forward again, and provoketh it to look on, and with the whole fancy taſt variety of Pleaſures; with which he thinks the life of a wiſe man is fill'd, both through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the paſt, and hope of following ones.

Firſt, that he hath long conſider'd that ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents might come; which conſideration alone doth moſt weaken and allay all Afflictions. Then he cometh to learn, that all Tryals common to men, ſhould be born, as ſuch, patiently. Laſtly, that he perceiveth there is no Evil, but where is blame; but there is no blame, when that falls out, the Prevention of which, was not in man to warrant; for that ſounding a retreat, which <hi>Epicurus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth, when he calleth us off from looking upon our Evils, is null. For not to take notice, or to

put out of memory, is not in our Power, when thoſe things gore us, which we conceive to be Evil. They Tear, Fret, Spur-gall, apply Torches for Torture, allow no breathing time. And you bid us to forgo what is againſt Nature; what remedy is by Nature given, would you wring away, that of a grief worn old? True, <hi>it is a ſlow Proceſs, yet of great Efficacy which length and time do effect.</hi> You bid me conſider the good, and forget the bad; you would ſay ſomewhat and worthy a great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, if you held thoſe things to be good, which were moſt ſuitable to the Dignity of man.</p>

               <p>SOME will object. How now? do you think <hi>Epicurus</hi> meant any ſuch thing, or that his Doctrine was licentious? I think ſo? by no means. For I ſee many things ſpoken by him ſeverely; many excellent well Therefore the Controverſie is, as I have often ſaid, about his Logick, not his Morals. Let him never ſo much undervalue thoſe Pleaſures which he lately magnified; yet I ſhall keep in memory, what he judgeth to be the chiefeſt good; for he not only put it in the ſimple term Pleaſure, but hath explain'd what he meant. <hi>Taſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and the embracing of Bodies, and Plays, and Muſick, and beautiful Objects, with which the Eyes are entertain'd.</hi> Is this any Fiction of mine? Is it a Lye? I would fain be diſprov'd; for what other Intereſt have I, but that the Truth may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in every queſtion? Ay, but he alſo ſaith, when Pain is once remov'd, Pleaſure admits of no farther increaſe; and to be free from Pain, is the height of Pleaſure. A few words, but three groſs Abſurdities: One is, that he contradicts himſelf; for but lately, having affirm'd that he could not imagine any good, but whereby the Senſes are, as it were, tickled with Pleaſure; he now ſuppoſeth,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60877:99"/>
that Freedom from Pain, is the height of Pleaſure. Can he utter more palpable Contradictions? A ſecond Abſurdity is, that whereas in Nature there are three Conditions, one of Joy, another of Pain, a third neither of Joy nor Pain; he taketh the firſt and third for the ſame, and confounds Pleaſure, with not being in Pain. A third Abſurdity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him, with ſome other; that whereas <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is moſt deſirable, and Philoſophy was ſought out for the acquiring of it;</hi> he hath ſeparated the chief good from Vertue. Ay, but he commends Vertue, and that often. So did <hi>C. Gracchus</hi> all the while that he dealt forth great Largeſles, and exhauſted the Treaſury, yet in words defend the Treaſury. What tell you me of Words, when I ſee Actions? <hi>Piſo</hi> ſir-nam'd the Frugal, always voted againſt the Bill for Corn-Tickets. When the Bill was paſt into a Law, he that had been Conſul came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Dividend. <hi>Gracchus</hi> perceiv'd <hi>Piſo</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Aſſembly, and asks of him, in the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, with what conſiſtency to himſelf, he could Plead the Priviledge of that Law, the paſſing of which; he had by Speech diſſwaded? <hi>I would not,</hi> Gracchus, ſaith he, <hi>it ſhould be your Pleaſure to divide my Goods among the People, man by man; but if you do it, I will put in for my ſhare.</hi> Did not that grave and wiſe man ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the publick Revenue was ſquander'd away by the <hi>Sempronian</hi> Law? Read the Orations of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> you will ſay he was an Advocate for the Treaſury. <hi>Epicurus</hi> denys there can be any living pleaſantly, without living vertuouſly. He denys <hi>that Fortune hath any Aſcendent over a wiſe man.</hi> He preferreth a ſlender Diet before a ſumptuous one. He denys there can be any time wherein a wiſe man is not alſo happy. All Notions worthy a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60877:100"/>
Philoſopher, but oppoſite to Pleaſure. He doth not mean that Pleaſure. Let him mean what Pleaſure he will, to be ſure he means that which hath no ſhare in Vertue. Well, if we do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Pleaſure, do we not Pain neither?

A Debate about the <hi>Punick</hi> War? yet in a Council of War about that, when <hi>M. Cato</hi> was of one opinion, and <hi>L. Lentulus</hi> of another, it never came to any heats.

But I ſhall have occaſion to deal with them elſewhere; yet with this intention, not to make any formal Conteſt.

               <p>He deny'd that Arguments of this ſort, had any influence at all to the abating Sorrow: for, ſaid he, that is the very matter of our grief, to be caught in ſuch a cruel neceſſity; and a Diſcourſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſal of other mens Sufferings, only to be ſuited to the Conſolation of ill-natur'd Perſons. But I am clear of a differing judgment, for both the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of conforming to that condition, whereunto we were ordain'd, doth with-hold us from fighting, as it were, againſt God, and minds us that we are but men. Which conſideration doth greatly allay Sorrow; and the recounting Examples is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to give content to the malitious, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the judgment of him that is in trouble, that he is well able to bear what he ſeeth many have born before him, with Moderation and Patience:

               <p>NOW what can be of more importance to the laying down Sorrow, than a Senſe that there is no advantage by it; and that it is admitted upon a pure miſtake? And if it can be laid down, it can alſo not be admitted. It muſt therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, that Diſcontent is admitted by Will, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Choice. Now this is evident by their Patience, who having often gone thorough many Adventures, bear more patiently whatever befalls them, and ſuppoſe they are harden'd againſt all Senſe of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; as he in <hi>Euripides.</hi>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60877:106"/>
Evils of this ſort have not annex'd to them, that it is fit and reaſonable, our Duty to be troubled for ones not being wiſe; which yet we do annex to that trouble of mind, which implys Mourning, and is the greateſt of all. Therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> accuſing the Ancient Philoſophers, who thought that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, through their Wits, was perfected; ſaith, <hi>They were either great Fools, or very Vain; but that he ſaw, within few years, there was made a great Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſo that in ſhort time it would come to be compleat. Theophraſtus</hi> alſo lying on his Death-bed, is ſaid to have accus'd Nature, for giving <ref target="#WC4307BK3SECT28F">(f)</ref> Rooks and Ravens a long life, who have no occaſion for it; when men, whom it moſt imported, were ſo ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd, whoſe Age, if it might have been of a longer Duration, the Conſequence would have been, that through the Complement of all Arts, mens life would have been poliſh'd in every part of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Therefore he complain'd that he muſt be taken away as ſoon as he had but begun to have ſight of this. What? among the other Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, do not the beſt and graveſt, confeſs their ignorance in many things? and that after the greateſt proficiency, they have ſtill more to learn? and yet are not diſcontented at the Senſe of that Folly which remaineth in them, though nothing be more Evil; for there is no opinion mingled of an officious Grief. What ſay we of them, <ref target="#WC4307BK3SECT28G">(g)</ref> who do not think it ſuitable for men to mourn? Such was <hi>Q. Maximus</hi> at the burial of his Son, a man that had borne the Conſulſhip. <hi>L. Paulus</hi> after the loſs of two Sons within few days. Such <hi>M. Cato</hi> at the death of his Son <hi>Praetor</hi> Elect. Such the reſt whom we have collected in our Book of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What elſe pacify'd them, but only a Senſe that Sorrow and Lamentation were not proper for
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60877:107"/>
men? Therefore, what ſome having taken for Duty, are wont to abandon themſelves to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly; that theſe men judging diſhonourable, have repell'd Sorrow; from whence is evident, that Diſcontent is not in the Nature of the thing, but from our own opinion.</p>

Nature brings Grief; which, ſay they, <ref target="#WC4307BK3SECT29H">(h)</ref> your <hi>Crantor</hi> owns, muſt be given way to; for it puſheth on, and follows hard, nor can be any ways reſiſted; therefore that <hi>Oileus</hi> in <hi>Sophocles,</hi> who had but a little before comforted <hi>Telamon</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of his <hi>Ajax,</hi> when he came to hear <ref target="#WC4307BK3SECT29I">(i)</ref> of his own, broke forth into Paſſion; upon whoſe change of mind, is this ſaid.</p>

               <p>BUT of this Point elſewhere; it ſerves our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent turn that we do not impute our Miſery to the loſs of our Friends, leaſt we be thought to love them more than they would have us, if they be ſenſible, to be ſure, more than we do our ſelves; for as to what they ſay, that very many find no eaſe upon Suggeſtions of Comfort; and that the Comforters themſelves confeſs they are miſerable, when the tide of Fortune turns againſt them; both Arguments are anſwerable; for thoſe are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Defaults, but perſonal Failures.

length of time, but in long conſideration; for if the Suffering be the ſame, and man the ſame; how can there be any change in the Grief, if there be no change neither in the Object, nor the Subject of it. Therefore a long conſideration that there is no Evil in the misfortune cureth the Grief, not the bare length of time. <ref target="#WC4307BK3SECT30M">(m)</ref> Here they come in with their Moderations, which if they be Natural, what need is there of Verbal Conſolation?

               <p>FOR there are certain Common places which are ſaid about Poverty, about an inambitious and obſcure Life; and ſeverally certain Eſſays upon Baniſhment, upon the Captivity of our Country, upon Bondage, upon Maimes, upon Blindneſs, and upon every other Misfortune, to which the name of Calamity is appliable: The <hi>Greeks</hi> divide theſe into diſtinct Diſputations, and ſeparate Tracts: For <hi>they lack work,</hi> although their Diſputations are full of delight; and yet as Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in carrying on the Cure of the whole Body, apply Remedies to the leaſt affected part: So Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy having taken away trouble of mind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; yet if any Error ariſeth from Particulars, if Poverty bites, if Diſgrace pinches, if Baniſhment caſts us under a Cloud, or if any of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Calamities befall us: although every Affliction hath its proper Conſolation; to which you ſhall hear diſcours'd when you pleaſe; but ſtill we muſt recur to the ſame Spring-head, that <hi>all Diſcontent is ſtranger to a wiſe man,</hi> becauſe it is idle; becauſe it is admitted to no purpoſe; becauſe it ariſeth not from Nature, but Judgment, but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, but a kind of drawing our ſelves on to Grieve, after we have determin'd that it is our duty ſo to do. Remove this which is wholly depending on our Will, and all that fretful Diſcontent will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60877:112"/>
away; yet ſome Gripes and Reſentments will remain in the Mind. Let them call this Natural, if they pleaſe; ſo the name of Diſcontent be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born; a name grievous, vexatious, deadly, which can by no means be; and, as I may ſay, dwell with Wiſdom. But how many, and how bitter are the Suckers of Diſcontent, which muſt all be pluck'd up; when the Body of it is fell'd down; and if need ſhall require, at ſeveral times; <ref target="#WC4307BK3SECT34O">(o)</ref> for we abound in this leaſure, ſuch as it is. But the Form of all Paſſions is one, the Names diverſe; for both Envy is a Paſſion, and Emulation, and Detraction, and Pitty, Anxiety, Mourning, Fretting, Melancholly, Lamentation, Sollicitude, Grief, Uneaſineſs, Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Deſperation; all theſe the <hi>Stoicks</hi> define; and the words which Irehears'd, have ſeveral No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and do not, as they ſeem, ſignifie the ſame things, but differ ſomewhat, which perhaps we ſhall treat of elſewhere. Theſe are the Fibres and Tendrels of the Suckers, firſt mention'd; which muſt be ſearch'd out and torn aſunder, that not one of them may ever ſhoot up. A great and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Work; who denys it? But <hi>what is there excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which is not alſo hard?</hi> yet Philoſophy profeſſeth to effect it, would we but admit its Cure. Now thus much for this Point; the reſt ſhall be ready for you as often as you will, both at this, and any other place.</p>

               <p>AS in many other Inſtances, moſt worthy <hi>Brutus,</hi> I am wont to admire the Parts and Perfections of our Country-men, ſo eſpecially in theſe Studies which they have but of very late time regarded, and brought over from <hi>Greece</hi> to this State. For whereas from the firſt Foundation of the City, Divination, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, Common-Councils, Appeals, Court of Senators, Train'd-bands of Horſe and Foot, the whole order of the Militia, were, from a Wiſdom almoſt more than Humane, eſtabliſh'd upon the Regal Conſtitutions, and ſome of them upon their Laws; ſo when the Common-wealth was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from the Oppreſſion of Tyranny, <ref target="#WC4307BK4SECT1P">(p)</ref> 
                  <hi>an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable advance, and incredible carriere was made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:60877:113"/>
                  <hi>all excellency.</hi> Now this is not the proper place to dilate upon the Cuſtoms and Ordinances of our Anceſtors, upon the Diſcipline and Temper of our Government; this hath been with ſome diligence, treated of by us elſewhere; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe ſix Books which we have written of a Common-wealth. At the preſent, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Study of Arts and Sciences, I meet with many Circumſtances whereupon to frame an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that they alſo were imported hither from abroad, nor invited only, but follow'd alſo, and cheriſh'd; for they had almoſt in ſight, <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> a man excellent and renowned for Wiſdom, who was in <hi>Italy</hi> at the very time when <hi>L. Brutus</hi> the noble Founder of your honourable Family, ſet his Country at Liberty. Now the Learning of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> ſpreading far and near, ſeems to me to have reach'd even to this State. This is probable to conjecture; ſo may it be trac'd by ſome ſigns. For who can imagine, when there flouriſh'd In <hi>Italy, Greece</hi> which was call'd the Great, having very large and powerful States; and the renown of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> firſt, and then of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> was ſo great in them, that our Country-men ſhould ſtop their Ears againſt their moſt learned Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. Nay, I ſuppoſe it was from the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> that King <hi>Numa</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by thoſe of later Ages, to have been a <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean;</hi> for they knowing the Diſcipline and Rules of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> and having receiv'd from their Fore-fathers, the Equity and Wiſdom of that King; but being ignorant of Chronology, to adjuſt the Times and Ages proper to each one, by reaſon of the great Antiquity, thought that he who ſo much excell'd in Wiſdom, was the Auditor of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>

               <p>NOW thus much for conjecture; as for the ſteps of <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> although many may be trac'd, yet we ſhall content our ſelves with a few, becauſe that is not the proper enquiry on this occaſion. For whereas thoſe Philoſophers are ſaid to have deliver'd ſome Symbolical Precepts in Verſe; and <hi>to have relax'd their minds with ſuitable Notes of Muſick from a ſerious intention of thought to a ſtaid compoſure. Cato,</hi> a moſt grave Author, ſaid in his Book of <hi>Origens,</hi> that this was the Cuſtom at Feaſts among the old <hi>Romans,</hi> that as they ſat at Table, they Sung, in order to the ſound of the Pipe, the Praiſes and Atchievements of renowned Perſons; from whence it is manifeſt, both that Songs were compos'd to Tunes and Verſes; which thing the twelve Tables farther declare, that Verſe was ſo early in uſe, in that they make a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it ſhould not be made to defame another; this alſo is ſome Argument of Learning in thoſe days, that Muſick plays before the Cuſhions of the Gods, and the Feaſts of the Magiſtrates, which was a Property of that Education, whereof I am now ſpeaking. In my judgment that Verſe of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> the Blind, which <hi>Panaetius</hi> much commends in

               <head>SECT. VI. <hi>The Definition of the Paſſions.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS therefore is <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Definition, that a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,</hi> which he calls a Paſſion, <hi>is a Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind, oppoſite to right Reaſon, and contrary to Nature.</hi> Some more ſuccinctly, that a <hi>Paſſion</hi> is an over-vehement Affection, but they mean it over-vehement when it flys out beyond the due bounds of Natural Conſtancy. Now they will have the particular Paſſions to ariſe from two conceiv'd Goods, and two conceiv'd Evils, and ſo to be four. From the Goods they judge do ſpring <hi>Luſt</hi> and <hi>Mirth: Mirth</hi> is of Goods preſent; <hi>Luſt</hi> of future. From the Evils, <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Diſcontent.</hi> Fear from
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60877:117"/>
future; Diſcontent from preſent. For thoſe things which are fear'd, when Imminent; when Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent produce Diſcontent. Now <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Luſt</hi> reſpect a conceit of Good things. Since <hi>Luſt</hi> upon the appearance of Good, being inveigled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd, is imported after it. <hi>Mirth,</hi> when it hath once acquir'd what was coveted after, is elevated and exults. For <hi>all men naturally purſue, what things appear Good, and avoid the contrary.</hi> Wherefore ſo ſoon as any object is ſet before the mind, which carrieth in it ſome appearance of good Nature it ſelf, puſheth us on to the acquiring of it. When this is manag'd with Conſtancy and Prudence, ſuch Deſire the <hi>Stoicks</hi> call a Willingneſs, we may a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>Will;</hi> this they think is in the wiſe man only, which they thus define. A regular <hi>Will</hi> is that which deſireth a thing according to Reaſon; but that which is hurried on violently, in oppoſition to Reaſon, that is Luſt and unbridled Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which is ſound in all Fools. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when we are ſo affected, as being in the Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of ſome good that falls out to be after two ſorts; for when the mind beats gently, and in an even temper according to reaſon, then it is call'd <hi>Joy:</hi> but when the Soul is fluſh'd without cauſe, and beyond due bounds, that may be call'd tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, or exceſſive Mirth; which they thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine an Elevation of the Mind, without reaſon. And becauſe, <hi>as we naturally affect good, ſo we naturally decline Evil;</hi> which declining, if it be according to reaſon, ſhould be call'd <hi>Caution,</hi> and underſtood to be in the wiſe man only. But if it be without reaſon, and with a baſe and ſordid Dejection of Spirit, ſhould be call'd <hi>Fear. Fear</hi> therefore is a Caution contrary to Reaſon. As for a preſent Evil, the wiſe man hath no concern about it; but
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60877:117"/>
a Fool hath that wherewith men are affected in conceited Evils, and let their Spirits ſink, and are Melancholly, not obeying Reaſon. Therefore this is the firſt Definition, that Diſcontent be a dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind, contrary to Reaſon, ſo there are four Paſſions, three ordinate Affections; becauſe there is no ordinate Affection oppos'd to Diſcontent.</p>

               <p>BUT they determine that all theſe Paſſions have their Cauſes, in the judgment and Opinion. Therefore they define them cloſer, ſo that it may be underſtood, not only how culpable they are, but alſo how much under our Power. Thus <hi>Diſcontent</hi> is a freſh opinion of a preſent Evil, under which it ſeems our Duty to be dejected and troubled in mind. <hi>Mirth</hi> a freſh opinion of a preſent Good, upon which it ſeems our Duty to be elevated. <hi>Fear</hi> an opinion of an impending Evil, which ſeems intolerable. <hi>Luſt</hi> an opinion of an approaching Good, the preſence and Fruition of which, would be beneficial to us. Now as to thoſe Opinions and Judgments, which I ſaid were Ingredients of the Paſſions, they do not ſay that only the Paſſions have their ſubſiſtence from them, but alſo the Effects of thoſe Paſſions; ſo that Diſcontent cauſeth a certain painful remorſe. Fear a withdrawing of the Soul, and a kind of flight. Mirth, an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Jolity: Luſt an unbridled Concupiſcence. Again they interpret that opinion, which we have
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60877:118"/>
inſerted into the Definitions above-mention'd, to be a weak aſſent. But under each of theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Paſſions, there are certain particular ones of the ſame ſort diſtributed, as under Diſcontent, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying (for we muſt ſerve our ſelves of a leſs uſual word, in order to the clearneſs of Explication, ſince the word Envy, eſpecially in <hi>Latin,</hi> is taken not only actively, as it refers to him that Envys, but paſſively as to him that is envy'd for the Odium that is caſt upon him,) Emulation, Detraction, Pitty, Anguiſh, Mourning, Bemoaning, Diſtreſs, Sorrow, Lamentation, Anxiety, Uneaſineſs, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afflicting, Deſpair, and whatever elſe be of the ſame Nature. Again ſubordinate to Fear, are Sloth, Shame, Terrour, Timorouſneſs, Diſmay, Confuſion, Diſtraction, Cowardiſe; under Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Malice, rejoycing at anothers Miſchief, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, Boaſting and the like. Under Luſt, Anger, Wrath, Hatred, Enmity, Diſcord, Want, Deſire, and the reſt of that kind. Now theſe they define after this manner.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THEY ſay that <hi>Envying</hi> is a Diſcontent, admitted upon anothers good Succeſſes, being no ways prejudicial to him that envieth; for if any one be troubled at the Proſperity of one who hurts him, he is not properly ſaid to Envy; as if <hi>Agamemnon</hi> ſhould be ſo at <hi>Hectors:</hi> But he who is griev'd that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60877:118"/>
another ſhould enjoy thoſe advantages which are no ways prejudicial to himſelf, he in truth is envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. <hi>Emulation</hi> again hath a twofold importance, ſo as to be taken both in a good and a bad Senſe; for the imitation of Vertue is alſo call'd Emulation; but we have nothing to do with it here in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, for that is praiſe-worthy. And there is an Emulation, a Diſcontent, if another enjoy, and one go himſelf without that which he hath eagerly coveted after. <hi>Detraction</hi> is now what I would have underſtood to be Jealouſie, a Diſcontent that another ſhould ſhare in that which one hath eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coveted. <hi>Pitty</hi> is a Diſcontent ariſing from the Miſery of another ſuffering wrongfully; for no Body is touch'd with pitty, at the puniſhment of an Aſſaſſine or Traytor. <hi>Anguiſh</hi> is a ſore Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. <hi>Mourning</hi> is a Diſcontent at the untimely death of one who was dear to us. <hi>Bemoaning</hi> is a Diſcontent with Tears. <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> a toilſome Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. <hi>Grief</hi> a tormenting Diſcontent. <hi>Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> a Diſcontent with wailing. <hi>Sollicitude</hi> a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with penſiveneſs. <hi>Uneaſineſs</hi> a perſevering Diſcontent. <hi>Self-afflicting</hi> a Diſcontent with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions upon the Body. <hi>Deſpair</hi> a Diſcontent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any expectation of better condition. But what are ſubject to Fear they thus define. <hi>Sloth</hi> to be a Fear of enſuing Labour. <hi>Terrour</hi> an aſtoniſhing Fear: Whence it cometh to paſs, that bluſhing followeth ſhame; paleneſs, and trembling, and gnaſhing of Teeth, Terrour. <hi>Timorouſneſs</hi> to be a Fear of approaching Evil. <hi>Diſmay</hi> a Fear that puts the mind beſides it ſelf; whence that of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>

               <p>AGAIN, the particular Branches from Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they thus deſcribe; that <hi>Malice</hi> ſhould be a Pleaſure taken in anothers harm, without any advantage to onesſelf. <hi>Delight,</hi> a Pleaſure charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mind, with the ſweetneſs of the hearing; and ſuch as is that of the Ears, ſuch are thoſe of the Eyes, the Touching, the Scent, and Taſt; which are all of one kind, as it were Pleaſures melted down to gratifie the Soul. <hi>Boaſting</hi> is a Pleaſure naturally Impertinent, and which exalts it ſelf with ſome Inſolence. But what Paſſions are ſubjected to Luſt, they thus define; ſo that <hi>Anger</hi> is a Luſt of puniſhing him who appears to have injur'd us <hi>Wrath</hi> is Anger breaking forth, and newly ariſen which is in <hi>Greek</hi> call'd Heat. <hi>Hatred</hi> is an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Anger. <hi>Enmity,</hi> an Anger watching the time of taking Revenge. <hi>Heart-burning</hi> is a deadly feud conceiv'd with inward rancor of Spirit. <hi>Worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> an inſatiable Luſt. <hi>Expectation,</hi> a Luſt of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one who is not yet come. They further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh this, that Luſt is of thoſe things which are affirm'd of one or more (which the Logicians call Predicates) as having Riches, bearing Offices <hi>Want</hi> is a Luſt after the things themſelves, as Mony
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60877:119"/>
as Honours. Again they ſay the Spring of all Paſſions is <hi>Intemperance,</hi> which is a defection from the whole Underſtanding, and from right Reaſon. At ſuch Averſion to the Orders of Reaſon, that its Affections can by no means be regulated nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd. As Temperance therefore moderates the Affections, and cauſeth them to obey right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſo its oppoſite habit Intemperance Fires, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds, puts into an Uproar the whole State of the Mind; therefore both Diſcontents and Fears, and all the other Paſſions take their Riſe from it.</p>

All which Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Mind, ſpring from a certain Fear of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60877:120"/>
thoſe things which men avoid and hate. Now they define an Indiſpoſition of Mind, a ſtrong conceit cleaving to the Soul, and deeply rooted in it, about a thing not truly deſir'd, as though it were greatly to be deſir'd. But as to that which ariſeth from Averſion, they thus define it to be a ſtrong conceit, cleaving to the Soul, and deeply rooted in it, about a thing not truly to be avoided, as though it were to be avoided. Now this conceit is an Opinion that one knows, what he doth not know. But under this Indiſpoſition, ſuch like Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits are compris'd, Covetouſneſs, Ambition, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Love of Women, Wrangling, Liquoriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, exceſs of Wine, Daintineſs, and any other ſuch-like things. Now Covetouſneſs is a ſtrong conceit about Mony, as though it were greatly to be deſir'd, cleaving to the Soul, and deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it; ſo the Definition of other ſuch Diſtempers is of like Form. Again the Definitions of Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are of ſuch ſort, as that Inhoſpitality is a ſtrong conceit, that a Stranger ſhould be greatly avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which conceit cleaveth to the Soul, and is deeply implanted in it.

Whereupon carefulneſs is nam'd to be in ſome men, when they are call'd careful or worldly men; in others Haſtineſs, which differs from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and it is one thing to be Haſty, another to be Angry; for neither are all thoſe careful men, who have ſometimes Care upon them; nor have all careful men at all times Care upon them; as there is difference between being Drunk, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Drunkard; and it is one thing to be a Bully, another a Suitor. Thus this Propenſion of ſome to one Diſeaſe, others to another, is of large extent; for it is applicable to all Paſſions; it is alſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in many Vices; but the Notion hath not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Denomination: Therefore men are ſtil'd both Envious, and Malitious, and Dirty, and Timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Compaſſionate, becauſe they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to ſuch Paſſions, not becauſe they are always actually imported by them.

Since ſome are more ready to one good Quality, and others to another; in bad things a proneneſs; to connote a Propenſion to fall; in indifferent things it may have the former name.

               <p>THEY call a Diſeaſe, a Corruption of the whole Maſs. An Indiſpoſition, a Diſeaſe with Infirmity. A Blemiſh, a Diſproportion in the order of the Parts of the Body, from whence ariſe a crookedneſs of Limbs, Diſlocation, Deformity. So that the formet two, Diſeaſe and Indiſpoſition, grow from the Concuſſion and Diſturbance of the Health of the whole Body. But a Blemiſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Impeachment of Health, is diſcernable of it ſelf; but in the Soul, we can diſtinguiſh the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe from the Indiſpoſition, by thought only. But the Blemiſh of the Soul is an Habit or Quality of a Mind wavering all its Life, and at Diſcord with it ſelf; ſo it cometh to paſs, that in the one, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and Indiſpoſition, is cauſed by Corruption of Opinions; in the other by Inconſtancy and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; for <hi>every Blemiſh hath not incongruous Parts, as</hi>

                  <hi>that of thoſe who are not far remov'd from Perfection.</hi> It is indeed a Quality jarring with it ſelf, ſo far as it is ſhort of Perfection, but not diſlocated nor crooked. Now Diſeaſes and Indiſpoſitions are Parts of being blemiſh'd. But whether Paſſions be parts of it, is a queſtion; for Blemiſhes are Perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Qualities, but Paſſions moving ones, ſo that they cannot be parts of the Permanent Qualities. And as the reſemblance of the Body approacheth the Nature of the Soul in bad, ſo alſo in good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; for Bodily Excellencies are Beauty, Strength, Health, a good Conſtitution, Swiftneſs, the like are alſo in the Soul. That Temper of the Body, wherein the parts of the Body hold a right Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, is a State of Health; ſo is it call'd ſoundneſs of mind, when its Judgments and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions thereof, are at accord one with annother; and that is the Vertue of the Soul, which ſome call Temperance it ſelf; others a Quality obeying the Rules of Temperance, and conſequent upon it, nor having any particular Denomination of its own; but whether it be this, or that, they ſay it is found in the wiſe man only. Though there be a certain ſoundneſs of mind, whereof an unwiſe man is alſo capable, when he hath been diſtracted, and cured by the Phyſicians. And as there is a juſt Simmetry of parts, together with a freſhneſs of colour, and that is call'd Beauty; ſo in the Soul, an even Temper and Conſtancy of Opinions and Judgments, with Reſolution and Stedfaſtneſs; following upon Vertue, or making up the very Nature of it, is call'd its Beauty. Likewiſe from a Similitude to the Strength of the Body, its Sinews and Activity; the Strength of the Soul is nam'd in like Terms.

                  <p>Since we both have in our places, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten muſt ſpeak about Vertue (for moſt queſtions which concern Life and Manners, are deriv'd from Vertue as their Fountain) ſince then Vertue is a Quality of the mind conſtant and uniform, making thoſe commendable in whom it is; and <hi>is it ſelf upon its own account commendable, abſtracting from any profit thence to grow;</hi> from it do proceed honeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, Expreſſions, Action, and all right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; although Vertue it ſelf may moſt compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly be call'd right Reaſon. The oppoſite then of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60877:123"/>
this Vertue, is Vitiouſneſs, for I had rather ſo call it, than Malice, for Malice, in <hi>Latin,</hi> is the name of a certain Vice; Vitiouſneſs of all. From hence are gather'd the Paſſions, which are, as we ſaid a little before, boiſterous and violent Motions of Souls, averſe to Reaſon, and the greateſt Enemies of the Underſtandidg, and the quiet of Life. For <hi>they bear in upon us anxious and bitter Troubles, and afflict and diſable our Souls with Fear.</hi> The ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame us with too eager Deſire, which we call ſometimes Coneupiſcence, and ſometimes Luſt; an unrulineſs of Mind, ſet at the greateſt diſtance from Temper and Moderation; which if it have at any time obtain'd what was luſted after, then doth it bring a cheerfulneſs; ſo that its whole work appears to be empty and unprofitable, according to his judgment who thinks immoderate <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of the Mind, to be the greateſt Errour. The Cure therefore, of theſe Evils, lyes in Vertue only.</p>

Why do you then call in anger hither? <hi>Hath Valour no Efforts of its own, unleſs it turn out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious?</hi> What ſay we to <hi>Hercules,</hi> whom the very Valour, which you call Wrath, exalted to Heaven? do you think he was angry when he encountred the <hi>Erymanthian</hi> Boar, or <hi>Nemeaean</hi> Lyon? or was <hi>Theſeus</hi> angry when he caught the <hi>Marathonian</hi> Bull by the Horns; <hi>Look well to it, whether Fortitude be not far from being outragious; and Wrath wholly compos'd of levity;</hi> for that is no Fortitude, which is deſtitute of Reaſon.</p>

               <p>THE World muſt be deſpis'd, Death ſlighted, all Pains and Labours reputed tolerable; when theſe things are our determinate Judgment and Senſe; then is that ſtout and ſtedfaſt Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; unleſs perchance we ſuſpect, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is done with earneſtneſs, vigour, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, is done in anger; in my judgment even <hi>Scipio</hi> that High Prieſt, who verify'd the <hi>Stoical</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, that a wiſe man is never angry, was not angry with <hi>Tib.

               <p>LET us therefore ſay, that Madneſs is uſeful; examine well the Definition of Fortitude, you will perceive that it ſtands not in need of Wrath. <hi>Fortitude</hi> therefore is a Diſpoſition of the mind, ſubmitting to the Supream Law, in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient enduring what it inflicts on us, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a ſteady judgment in the undergoing and repelling thoſe things which ſeem terrible; or the knowledge of ſuſtaining; or wholly ſlighting things terrible; and contrary to our Natures, preſerving a ſtedfaſt judgment concerning them: or ſhorter, as <hi>Chryſippus;</hi> for the former Definitions were <ref target="#WC4307BK4SECT24H">(h)</ref> of <hi>Sphaerus,</hi> one who had a ſingular good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in defining, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> think; for they are all in a manner alike; but they declare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions one more than another. How then doth <hi>Chryſippus</hi> define it? <hi>Fortitude</hi> is, ſaith he, the Knowledge of enduring things, or a Diſpoſition of mind in ſuffering and perſevering to bear, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Supream Law, without Fear. We may inveigh againſt theſe men as much as we will, as <hi>Carneades</hi> was wont to do; I fear they will prove
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60877:130"/>
the only Philoſophers. For which, of all thoſe Definitions, doth not open our Notion of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which all of us have of it cover'd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated; which being unfolded, who is there that would fetch from abroad any aid either for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, or General, or Orator, and doth not think they can act couragiouſly without being in a rage. What mean the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who ſay that all unwiſe men are Mad, do they not conclude theſe things? Remove the Paſſions, eſpecially Anger; they will be taken to hold monſtrous Opinions. But now they thus argue, that <hi>they affirm all Fools to be Mad, in ſuch manner, as all mire ſtinks.</hi> But it doth not ſo always. Stir it, you will be ſenſible whether it do or not. So a haſty man is not always angry; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him, you will preſently ſee him in a rage. What of that Military Wrath? when it is return'd home, how doth it demean it ſelf with Wife? with Children? with Servants? is it then alſo uſeful? is there then any thing that a mind in confuſion can do better, than it can when it is ſettled? or can any one be angry without diſorder of mind? our Country-men therefore, although all Vices were in the rank of Diſeaſes, becauſe none was more foul than wrathfulneſs, did well name only wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perſons, as it were craz'd and diſtracted.</p>

To which ſhe hath been ſo much the more kind, as that the aids of Bodies are fetch'd from without, the relief of Souls is inclos'd in themſelves. But the greater and diviner Excellency is in them the greater Diligence do they need. On this account <hi>reaſon well conſulted, behold what is the beſt, when neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, is entangled in many Errors.</hi> Therefore my whole diſcourſe is to be turn'd to you; for you put the caſe, as of a wiſe man, but perhaps you enquire about your ſelf. There are then diverſe cures of thoſe Paſſions, which I have laid down; for every Diſcontent is not aſſwag'd the ſame way, for there is one method to be taken with him who Mourns, another with him that Pitties, another again with him who Envieth.

Again, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that particular object, which occaſions our Diſcontent, be to be taken hainouſly; or whether we ſhould be diſcontented upon any occaſion at all. As if one ſhould be troubled that he is Poor, whether you ſhould diſpute with him that <hi>there is no evil in Poverty;</hi> or that a man ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in every condition; clearly this is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, leaſt, if you ſhould not perſwade in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Poverty; way muſt be given to Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but if Diſcontent be remov'd by the proper Arguments which we uſed yeſterday, the evil of Poverty is alſo in ſome ſort remov'd.</p>

endure the chances incident to Humane Life, without breaking forth into Paſſion; which alſo is the caſe of thoſe who think theſe Afflictions to be Evils, but ſuch as are to be born patiently.

Again there are ſome Diſcontents which that Application can no way relieve; as if one ſhould be troubled in mind, that he hath in him no Vertue, no Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, no Conſcience, no Honour, he is in truth afflicted for Evils, but a Remedy of another Nature is to be apply'd to him, and ſuch wherein all Philoſophers, though otherwiſe diſagreeing, do conſent; for all of them muſt accord in this, that ſtirrings of the Soul averſe to right Reaſon, are faulty; ſo that whether thoſe things which cauſe Fear and Diſcontent, be not Evil; or thoſe which move Luſt or Mirth be not Good; yet the ſtirring it ſelf is faulty; for <hi>by him, whom we call a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and Gallant man, we mean one Conſtant, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, Grave, and undervaluing all Contingencies of Humane Life.</hi> But neither can one who Mourns, or Fears, or Covets, or Vaunts be ſuch; for theſe are the Deportments of ſuch as count the Events incident to Humane Life, to have an aſcendent over their Souls.</p>

               <p>WHerefore it is the univerſal method of cure, as I ſaid before, of all Philoſophers not to deſcant of what nature is the object which moveth our Paſſion, but to diſcuſs the Paſſion it ſelf. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt as to concupiſcence it ſelf, it being only propos'd to remove it, we muſt not enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the object of that Luſt be good or not, but the Luſt it ſelf muſt be remov'd. So that whether honeſty be the chiefeſt Good, or Pleaſure, or both of them jointly, or the three ſorts of good; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ordinate be the affection, yet if it become immoderate, the ſame addreſs by way of dehorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be made to all. Now Humane Nature brought into view, infers all motives of appeaſing the Spirit; which that it may be the more plainly diſcern'd in its colours, the common condition and terms of life, are to be explain'd in our Diſcourſe. Therefore <hi>Socrates</hi> upon good grounds, when <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi> firſt brought upon the Stage his Tragedy of <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> is ſaid to have bid repeat him again the three firſt Verſes.</p>

Now towards the perſwading that ſuch misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes both may and ought to be born; the recital of ſuch as have born the like is uſeful; although the means of allaying Diſcontent have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd both in yeſterdays Diſpute, and in our Treatiſe of Conſolation, which we writ in the midſt of our Mourning and Sorrow, (for we were not of them who had attain'd to Perfection) and what <hi>Chryſippus</hi> forbids <hi>the applying remedy, as it were, to the green Sores of the Soul,</hi> that did we, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd violence to Nature, that ſo the Plaiſter might be as broad as the ſwelling that it was to diſcuſs.</p>

               <p>THIS fifth day, moſt worthy <hi>Brutus,</hi> will put an end to our <hi>Tuſculan</hi> Diſputations, on which day was debated, that which of all Subjects you moſt approve; for I perceive by that Book which you writ to me with great exactneſs, and your many Diſcourſes, that you are zealouſly of the opinion that <hi>Vertue is ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to Happineſs;</hi> which though it be hard to demonſtrate, by reaſon of the many and diverſe Tortures by Fortune inflicted; yet is it of ſuch moment, that it deſerves all pains to be employ'd, in order to the clearing of it up; ſince there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing treated of in all Philoſophy, which is more Grave and Gallant to maintain; for whereas that was their Motive, who firſt apply'd to the Study of Philoſophy, to caſt all their other buſineſs aſide,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60877:141"/>
and put themſelves wholly upon ſearching out the beſt State of Life; certainly they laid out ſo much care and pains in that Study, out of hopes to live happily. Now if Vertue have been by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly ſtated, and if an intereſt in Vertue be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to happineſs of Life, who is there but muſt think that the Pains in ſtudying Philoſophy, was to excellent purpoſe both laid out by them, and undertaken by us; but if Vertue expos'd to diverſe and uncertain hazards, be the handmaid of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and not of Power enough to defend it ſelf; I fear we muſt rather pray for happineſs, than aſpire to it in any aſſurance of Vertue. And in truth when I conſider within my ſelf thoſe changes wherein Fortune hath greatly exercis'd me; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to call this opinion into ſome queſtion; and at times to dread the weakneſs and frailty of Mankind; for I fear, as Nature hath given us feeble Bodies, and faſten'd to them both incurable Diſeaſes, and intolerable Pains; ſo leaſt ſhe have given us Souls alſo, both jointly ſympathizing with bodily Pains, and ſeverally incumber'd with Diſquiets and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes of their own. But herein I correct my ſelf, that I judge of the ſtrength of Vertue, by the ſoftneſs of others, and perhaps my own, not by Vertue it ſelf. <hi>For that,</hi> if any ſuch thing there be as Vertue (<ref target="#WC4307BK5SECT1B">(b)</ref> which, <hi>Brutus,</hi> your Uncle put out of doubt) <hi>counts all things incident to man beneath it ſelf, and looks down upon the changes of Humane Life with contempt; for, being utterly blameleſs, it chargeth it ſelf with no other concern, than to preſerve its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</hi> But we both increaſing all future Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities with Fear, and preſent ones with Vexation, chooſe rather to condemn Nature, than acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our own Error. </p>

                  <p>But that is the way in Mathematicks, not Philoſophy, for when Geometricians would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate any thing, if there be ſomewhat in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prove the matter in queſtion, amongſt what they have before demonſtrated, that they take for granted and prov'd; they only make out what hath not been propos'd before: Philoſophers, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever matter they have in hand, heap up all that which is agreed upon in common, towards the eviction of that matter, however they have been elſewhere debated. Were it not ſo, why ſhould a <hi>Stoick</hi> need to ſay much, if it ſhould be propos'd whether Vertue be ſufficient to Happineſs of Life; it would be enough for him to anſwer, he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore demonſtrated, nothing to be good, but what was honeſt; this being prov'd, it to be conſequent that Happineſs of Life is contented with Vertue;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60877:147"/>
and as this is to that, ſo that to be conſequent to this, that if Happineſs of Life be contented with Vertue, nothing elſe is good but what is honeſt. But they do not proceed after this ſort; for their Books of Honeſty, and of the chief Good, are apart; and although it be rightly deducible thence, that there is ſufficiency in Vertue, to render the Life happy; yet they treat ſeverally of it; for every matter is to be handled by its proper and natural Arguments and Motives; eſpecially one of ſo great Importance; for you are much miſtaken if you think any expreſſion in all Philoſophy more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or that there is any promiſe of Philoſophy either more profitable or honourable; for what doth ſhe profeſs? O wonderful! <hi>that ſhe will make good,</hi> whoever obeys her Laws, ſhall always be arm'd againſt Fortune, ſhall have all warranties in himſelf, of a good and happy Life; in a word, ſhall ever be bleſſed. But let me adviſe with my ſelf, what ſhe performs. However in the mean time I much value what ſhe undertakes; for <hi>Xerxes</hi> being cram'd with all the Bribes and Gifts of Fortune, yet not being contented with Cavalry, nor Infantry, nor multitude of Shipping, nor an infinite quantity of Gold propounded a reward to him that ſhould find out any new Pleaſure.

Can I then, after I have granted one, that bodily Pains are Evils, that Shipwracks of Eſtate are Evils; can I be angry with that man, for ſaying that all good men are not Happy, when all good men are liable to thoſe things which he accounts Evils? the ſame <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus</hi>

               <p>They ſay never came more laſche word out of the mouth of Philoſopher; and true it is, what they ſay, yet I do not underſtand how any thing could have been more conſiſtent; for if there are ſo many good things belonging to the Body, ſo many extrinſick to it, all under the Power of chance and Fortune, is it not naturally conſequent upon this Principle, that <hi>Fortune,</hi> who is <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> both of <hi>external</hi> Circumſtances, and <hi>corporal</hi> endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould have a larger Empire, than Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Counſels? or had we better imitate <hi>Epicurus?</hi> who oftentimes ſpeaks many excellent things, but careth not how agreeable they are, or conſiſtent with his Principles. <hi>He commends a ſlender Diet:</hi> Done like a Philoſopher; but if <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> had ſaid it, not he who maintains Pleaſure to be the chiefeſt Good.

couch'd under this word, when we ſay a Happy man, but an Accumulation of all Goods, without the mixture of any Evils. Vertue cannot attain to this, if there be any thing good beſides it ſelf.

Laſtly, a Wiſe man may be in theſe ſo many and ſo great Evils, and thoſe many more which may happen; for chance inflicts them, which may fall foul on a Wiſe man.

               <p>THE Gravity of this Opinion, is to be fetch'd from the Authority of <hi>Plato;</hi> in whom often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this expreſſion is found, that nothing is to be call'd Good but Vertue, as in his Dialogue call'd <hi>Gorgias.

No other; then you cannot tell of the Great King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> whether he be Happy? Can I do it, when I know not how he is for Learning, how for Juſtice? What? do you think Happineſs of Life conſiſts in that? I am clear of the mind, that the Good are Happy, the Wicked Miſerable. Is <hi>Archelaus</hi> then miſerable? Certainly, if he be unjuſt.

               <p>FROM this therefore, as it were Holy and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Fountain of <hi>Plato,</hi> ſhall our whole enſuing Diſcourſe take its ſource. And now whence can we more orderly begin, than from Nature our common Parent, who hath taken care that all her Productions, not only the living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but alſo the very Plant which ſo Springs from the Earth, as to abide firm on its Stock and Root, <ref target="#WC4307BK5SECT13U">(u)</ref> ſhould be every one in their reſpective kind perfect. Therefore both Trees and Vines, and thoſe Plants which are lower, nor can advance themſelves to any height from the Earth, ſome of them are ever Green, others ſtand bare all Winter, but warm'd in the Spring, ſhoot forth Leaves afreſh; nor is there any one which hath not ſuch an inward Vegetation, that it bears either Bloſſoms, or Fruits, or Berries with Seeds lock'd up in all, after their proper kind. So that every thing in all, as far as in them lyes, if no external Violence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach, are perfect. The Power of Nature may yet more eaſily be diſcern'd in Brutes, becauſe Senſe is given them by Nature; for ſhe deſign'd ſome of theſe Creatures for Swimming, which were to be Inhabitants of the Water; others for flying, which were to ſport in the open Air; ſome
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60877:153"/>
to creep, others to go; and of theſe laſt, ſome to range alone, others to herd together; ſome wild, and others tame: Laſtly, ſome to dwell in holes and caverns under ground. Now every one of theſe having its proper work allotted, cannot paſs over into the life of another Creature, but abides in the Ordinance of its own Nature. And as one advantage is given by Nature to one Beaſt, and another to another, which peculiar it holds faſt, nor ſwerves from it; ſo hath man ſomewhat far more excellent; (although <hi>thoſe things may be ſaid to excell, which admit of ſome compariſon;)</hi> but <hi>the Soul of man being deriv'd from the Divine Spirit, with all Humility be it ſpoken,</hi>

But the Wiſe man is always ſo diſpos'd, therefore the Wiſe man is always Happy. Further every thing that is good is joyous, and what is joyous, is to be proclaim'd and avow'd; and what is ſo, is alſo to be glory'd in; but if it be glorious, to be ſure it muſt be praiſe-worthy; but what is praiſe-worthy, is alſo truly honourable; what therefore is good is honourable.

                  <hi>like his Facts.

Therefore a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conſtant man, without Fear, without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, without any Jollity, without Luſt, can he be other than Happy? But a wiſe man is always ſuch, therefore always Happy.

But will a wiſe man dread Pain? for that is the greateſt Adverſary to this opinion; for we ſeem enough fortified and prepared by the former days Diſputes againſt our own Death, and that of our Friends; as alſo againſt Diſcontent, and the other Paſſions of the Mind. Pain ſeems to be the moſt violent Adverſary againſt Vertue, that thruſts out his burning Torches at us; that threatens to vanquiſh
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:60877:166"/>
Fortitude, Magnanimity, and Patience. Shall Vertue then fall under this? Shall the Bleſſed Life of a Wife and Conſtant man render to this.

Now it had been an old Cuſtom in <hi>India,</hi> that young Men and Maids married, without asking their Parents Conſent, but as they fancied one another. This raſh judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Youth, was often follow'd with ſpeedy Repentance; ſo that many Women were debauch'd, and fell in Love with others, but finding no colour of leaving them, begun to take them out of the way. <hi>India</hi> is a Country ſtor'd with many Simples and Drugs of ſuch a deletory Nature, as ſome of them kill inſtantly if the Diſh or Cup be but touch'd with them. This Practice of poyſoning prevail'd, and many men were thus taken off; nor could any rigor of Juſtice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reſt from the like attempts. At length a Law was made, that ſuch Women as ſurviv'd their Husbands, and had no Children, nor were with Child, ſhould be burnt; which if they refus'd, they ſhould not Marry again, but be for ever excommunicated, as impious. This quite alter'd their Inclinations, for the greatneſs of the Diſgrace, made them contented to dye rather, and they both grew tender in Preſervation of their Husbands Life, as their own; and alſo took a Glory to be Conſorts with him in death. As it fell out at this time, for the Law being expreſs, that one muſt be burnt with her ſlain Husband, both of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves at his Funeral, ſtanding for the Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him in death, as for a glorious prize. A Council of War was call'd; here the latter Wife alledg'd, that the former was by her Belly debar'd from dying in the expreſs terms of the Law. But the other pleaded that ſhe ought to have the priority of Honour, as ſhe had of time; for in all other Inſtances the Elder have in Matters of Priviledge, title to precedency. The Souldiers being inform'd by a Jury of Women, that the Elder was indeed with Child, gave<pb n="318" facs="tcp:60877:167"/> the cauſe for the Younger. Upon which, ſhe that was caſt, with loud ſhrieks went out of the Court, her attire and hair torn, as at the hearing of ſome doleful news. But the other, joyful for having carried the day, was dreſs'd up by her acquaintance, with Ribbins and rich attire; then led to the Funeral Pile, as to a Wedding, by her neareſt kindred, who, as they went, ſung the praiſes of her Vertue. When they were come to the Stake, ſhe diveſted her ſelf, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed her Ornaments amongſt her Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as a Token of her laſt Affections. Thus was her attire; many Rings on her Fingers gliſtering with pretious Stones of diverſe ſorts; on her Head a Sky of Golden Stars, ſet with radiant Sparks of ſeveral Gems; about her Neck many Neck-laces of Pearl, increaſing in ſize each above the other; at laſt having taken leave of all her acquaintance, ſhe was by her Brother help'd up the Pile, where, to the admiration of all that had come from the parts round about to the ſight, ſhe ended her Life in an heroical manner; for the whole Army march'd in Arms thrice round the Funeral Pile, before Fire was put to it; and ſhe lying down by her Husbands ſide, when the heat grew more and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſenſible, let no voice paſs which might diſcover any meanneſs of Spirit; ſo that the Spectators ſome were touch'd with Compaſſion; others magnified her beyond any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

               </head>
               <p>YOU ſee, I preſume, how <hi>Epicurus</hi> hath divided the ſorts of Deſires, perhaps not over cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, yet uſefully; that they are, part, natural and neceſſary; part, natural and not neceſſary; part, neither; that the neceſſary may be ſatisfy'd with next to nothing, for the Riches of Nature are low-priz'd; that the ſecond ſort is neither difficult to compaſs, nor to refrain. The third becauſe they are wholly empty, and do not concern not only neceſſity, but ſo much as Nature, he thought were wholly to be caſhiered. Upon this Head much is diſputed by the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and theſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are in particular depreſs'd; which in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral they do not diſ-eſteem; but they are ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd for matter; for they tell us that obſcene Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures alſo, upon which they hold much diſcourſe, are eaſie, common, and at hand; and they think them if Nature require, not to be meaſur'd by
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60877:171"/>
their Birth, or Quality, or Rank; but their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Age, and Shape; and that it is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to abſtain from them, if either Health, or Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Reputation require; and in the whole, that this ſort of Pleaſures is deſirable, if it do no hurt; that it never doth good. And this whole Leſſon about Pleaſure, he hath ſo laid down, that he thinks Pleaſure of it ſelf, becauſe it is Pleaſure always deſirable, and to be purſu'd; and by the ſame reaſon, Pain upon that very account, becauſe it is Pain, always to be avoided. Therefore that a wiſe man would ſtill hold this Ballance, to avoid Pleaſure, if it would work greater Pain; and to embrace Pain, working a greater Pleaſure; and that all delights, however they are judg'd, by bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Senſe, yet are reſolv'd into the mind. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Body rejoyceth only ſo long as it feels the preſent Pleaſure; the Soul both perceives the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent together with the Body, and foreſeeth it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; nor ſuffers it to depart when paſt. Thus that there will always be cloſe and uninterrupted Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the wiſe man; when the memory of thoſe enjoy'd, is continu'd with the expectation of thoſe hoped for. Arguments alſo of like Nature are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to Diet.

Now he, what would be hardly credible, exercis'd himſelf in Philoſophy, rather much more diligently than before, plaid on Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtruments, after the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> uſage, had Books read to him day and night; in which Studies he needed not Eyes. Above all this, what ſcarce ſeems poſſible without Eyes, he ſupported the Office of a Geometry Lecture, directing his Scholars by word of mouth, from what Point, to what Point they ſhould draw every Line. They report of <ref target="#WC4307BK5SECT39G">(g)</ref>  
                  <hi>Aſclepiades</hi> a not obſcure <hi>Ereirian</hi> Philoſopher, when one ask'd what alteration Blindneſs had brought upon him; that he ſhould anſwer, <hi>To carry one Servant more about with him;</hi> for as even the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt Poverty would be tolerable, if one might <ref target="#WC4307BK5SECT39H">(h)</ref> what ſome <hi>Greeks</hi> do every day; ſo Blindneſs could eaſily be born, if it have ſufficient Succors againſt its Infirmities. <hi>Democritus</hi> having loſt his Eyes, could not diſtinguiſh, I grant, between white and black; but now, good and evil, juſt and unjuſt, honourable and baſe, profitable and diſprofitable, great and ſmall he could; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out variety of colours, might live happily; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcerning of Natures could not. Nay this man thought that the intention of his mind was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:60877:177"/>
diſtracted by the ſight of his Eyes; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others oftentimes could not ſee what block lay in their ways, he rang'd over all infinity, ſo that no extream could ſet bounds to his further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. There is a Tradition too, that <hi>Homer</hi> was Blind. But we ſee his Picture more like than Poem. What Country, what Coaſt, what place of <hi>Grcece,</hi> what ſort of Subject, what Skirmiſh, what pitch'd Field, what Gally, what motion of Men, what of Beaſts, is not ſo drawn to the Life, as that he hath brought us to ſee, what himſelf ſaw not? What then, do we think, could either <hi>Homer,</hi> or any other Scholar, ever want to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the delight and pleaſure of the Soul? or if the Matter were not ſo, would <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> or this very <hi>Democritus,</hi> have left their Lands and Eſtates, and have given up themſelves, with their whole Soul, to this Divine delight of learning and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring. Therefore the Poets never bring in <hi>Tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> the Sooth-ſayer, whom they feign to be a wiſe man, bemoaning his Blindneſs. But now <ref target="#WC4307BK5SECT39I">(i)</ref> 
                  <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> having fram'd <hi>Polyphemus</hi> of an inhumane and ſavage Character, makes him to hold diſcourſe with his Ram, and praiſe its Fortunes that it could go whether it would, and graze upon what it would. He, indeed, did it well; for the <hi>Cyclops</hi> himſelf was never a whit wiſer than his Ram.</p>
