         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some Cautions offered to the Consideration
of those who are to Chuse MEMBERS
to serve in the Ensuing PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>I Will make no other Introduction, than <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it is
hoped the Counties and Burroughs will remember
in general, That besides other Consequences, they
will have the Credit of a good Choice, or the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
that belongeth to an ill one.</p>
            <p>The Creators will be thought like their Creatures; and
therefore an ill Choice will either be a disparagement of
their Understanding, or their Morals.</p>
            <p>There cannot be a fuller Approbation of a thing, than
the Chusing of it; so that the fault of the Members cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
if known before-hand, will be judged to be of the
growth of that County or Burrough, after such a solemn
Approbation of them.</p>
            <p>In short, those who send up their Representatives to
<hi>Westminster,</hi> should take care they may be such as will
do them Right, and their Countrey Honour.</p>
            <p>Now to the particulars.</p>
            <p>I. A very extraordinary earnestness to be chosen, is no
very good Symptom: A desire to serve the Nation in
Parliament, is an <hi>English</hi> Man's Ambition; always to be
Encouraged, and never to be Disapproved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94343:3"/>
A Man may not only be willing to stand, but he may
declare that willingness to his Friends, that they may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him, and by all the means becoming a modest and
prudent Man, he may endeavour to succeed, and prevent
the being disappointed in it.</p>
            <p>But there is a wide difference between this and the
raising a kind of a petty War in the County or Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
entring the Lists rather for a Combat than an
Election; throwing Fire-balls to put Men into a heat,
and omitting to spread no Reports, whether true or false,
which may give an advantage by laying a Blemish upon
Competitor.</p>
            <p>These Methods will ever be suspicious; it will never
be thought a Natural thing for Men to take such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Pains for the meer sake of doing good to others.</p>
            <p>To be content to suffer something for a good end, is
that which many would do without any great repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
But where a Man can honestly propose nothing
to himself, except Troubles, Charge and Loss, by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from his own Affairs, to be so violent in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of so ill a Bargain, is not at all suited to the languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Virtue of Mankind so corrupted.</p>
            <p>Such a self-denying Zeal in such a self-seeking Age, is
so little to be imagin'd, that it may without injury be
suspected.</p>
            <p>Therefore when these blustring Pretenders come upon
the Stage, their natural Temper and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
ought to be very well consider'd, before Men
trust them with the disposal of their Money, or their
Liberty.</p>
            <p>And I am apt to believe, there could hardly be found
one single Man whose other Qualifications would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
the Objections that lye against such importunate
Suitors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94343:3"/>
II. Recommending-Letters ought to have no effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Elections.</p>
            <p>In this I must distinguish; For tho in strictness perhaps
there should be no Exception; yet in compliance with long
practice, and out of an Indulgence that is necessary in a
time when Mankind is too much loosened from severe
Rules, to be kept close up to them, Letters sent only from
Equal Men, doing Good men right by giving Evidence in
their behalf, offering them as fitly qualified, when they
really are so, and freeing them from unjust Aspersions,
may be still allowed.</p>
            <p>The Letters I mean, are from Men of Power, where it
may be beneficial to comply, and inconvenient to oppose.</p>
            <p>Choice must not only be free from Force, but from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
which is a degree of Force: There must be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
no apprehension that a Refusal will be ill taken, or
resented.</p>
            <p>The Freeholders must be Freemen too; they are to
have no Shackles upon their Votes in an Election; and
the Men who stand, should carry their own Letters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
about them, which are their good Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
and Behaviour in the world, without borrowing
Evidence, especially when it cometh from suspected hands.</p>
            <p>Those who make use of these Epistles, ought to have
no more advantage from them, than the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have
from the Letters put into their hands when they are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
to recommend them to St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The First should as little get admittance for Men into
the Parliament, as these Letters can introduce the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
into Heaven.</p>
            <p>The Scandal of such Letters lieth first in the arrogant
imposing of those that write them, and next in the
wretched Meanness of those that need them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94343:4"/>
Men must be fallen very low in their Credit, who upon
such an occasion have a recourse to Power to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it: Their Enemies could not give stronger Evidence
of their not being fit for that which they pretend to. And
if the Electors judge otherwise, they will be pretty sure
in a little time to see their Mistake, and to repent it.</p>
            <p>III. Non-Attendance in former Parliaments ought to
be a Bar against the Choice of Men who have been guilty
of it.</p>
            <p>It is one of the worst kinds of Non-Residence, and the
least to be excused: It is very hard that men should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
a Duty, which perhaps is the only ground of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that is paid to them.</p>
            <p>It is such a piece of Sawciness for any one to press for
the Honour of Serving in Parliament, and then to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in Attending it, that in a House where there were so
many Officers, the Penalty had not been improper to have
Cashier'd them for not appearing at the General Muster.</p>
            <p>If men forbear to come out of Laziness, let them be
gratified by taking their Ease at Home without Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
If out of small Cunning to avoid Difficulties, and to
escape from the Inconvenience of Voting in Critical Cases,
let them enjoy that despicable pitch of Wisdom, and never
pretend to make a Figure where the Publick is to be
served.</p>
            <p>If it would not be thought advisable to trust a man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after he hath been drawn out of a Gaol, it
may be as reasonable to look upon one who for his Non-attendance
in the House hath been sent for in Custody, as
a kind of Bankrupt, which putteth him upon unequal
terms with those who have been assiduons in the discharge
of their Duty.</p>
            <p>They who thought fit in one Session to neglect the
Publick Business, may be justly suspected, by their stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in the next to intend their own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94343:4"/>
Besides these more deliberate Offenders, there are some
who do not Attend even when they are in the House; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in their Thoughts for want of Comprehending the
Business that is doing, and therefore diverted from it by
any thing that is Trivial.</p>
            <p>Such Men are Nusances to a serious Assembly; and
when they are Numerous, it amounteth almost to a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution;
it being scarce possible for good sence to be heard,
whilst a noise is made by the buzzing of these Horse-flies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Censors who degraded a Senator for yawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whilst there was a Debate, would have much more
abundant matter here upon which they might exercise
their Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Head, There are so few that ever
mended in these Cases, that after the first Experiment
it is not at all reasonable to take them upon a new
Trial.</p>
            <p>IV. Men who are unquiet and busy in their Natures, are
to give more than ordinary proofs of their Integrity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Electing them into a Publick Trust can be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
As a hot Summer breedeth greater swarms of Flies,
so an active time breedeth a greater number of these shine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>It is pretty sure, That men who cannot allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be at rest, will let no body else be at quiet. Such
a perpetual Activity is apt by degrees to be applied to the
pursuit of their private Interest. And their thoughts
being in a continual motion, they have not time to dwell
long enough upon any thing to entertain a scruple.</p>
            <p>So that they are generally at full liberty to do what is
most convenient for them, without being fettered by any
Restraints.</p>
            <p>Nay further; Whenever it happeneth that there is an
Impunity for Cheating, these nimble Gentlemen are apt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94343:5"/>
to think it a disparagement to their Understandings not to
go into it.</p>
            <p>I doubt it is not a wrong to the present Age, to say,
That a Knave is a less unpopular Calling than it hath been
in former times. And to say truth, it would be ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in some Men to turn Honest, when they owe all
they have to their Knavery.</p>
            <p>The People are in this respect unhappy; they are too
many to do their own business; their numbers, which
make their strength, are at the same time the cause of their
weakness; they are too unweildy to move; and for this
reason nothing can ever redeem them from this incurable
Impotency: So that they must have Solicitors to pursue
and look after their Interests; who are too often disposed
to dispense with the Fidelity they owe to those that trust
them; especially if the Government will pay their Bills
without Abatement.</p>
            <p>It is better these Gentlemen's dexterity should be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
any where than in Parliament, where the ill
consequence of their being Members is too much diffused,
and not restrained to the County or Burrough who
shall be so unwary as to Chuse them.</p>
            <p>V. Great Drinkers are less fit to Serve in Parliament
than is apprehended.</p>
            <p>Men's Virtue, as well as their Understanding, is apt to
be tainted by it.</p>
            <p>The appearance of it is Sociable and well-natur'd, but
it is by no means to be reli'd upon.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more frail than a Man too far engaged in
wet Popularity.</p>
            <p>The habit of it maketh Men careless of their business,
and that naturally leadeth them into Circumstances that
make them liable to Temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94343:5"/>
It is seldom seen, That any Principles have such a
root, as that they can be proof against the continual
droppings of a Bottle.</p>
            <p>As to the Faculties of the Mind, there is not less Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
the vapours of Wine may sometimes throw out
sparks of Wit, but they are like scattered pieces of Ore,
there is no Vein to work upon.</p>
            <p>Such Wit, even the best of it, is like paying great
Fines; in which case there must of necessity be an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the constant Rent.</p>
            <p>Nothing sure is a greater Enemy to the Brain, than too
much moisture; it can the least of any thing bear the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
continually steeped: And it may be said, that Thought
may be resembled to some Creatures which can live only
in a dry Country.</p>
            <p>Yet so arrogant are some men, as to think they are so
much Masters of Business, as that they can play with it;
they imagine they can drown their Reason once a day, and
that it shall not be the worse for it; forgetting, that by too
often diving the Understanding at last groweth too weak
to rise up again.</p>
            <p>I will suppose this fault was less frequent when <hi>Solon</hi>
made it one of his Laws, That it was Lawful to Kill a
Magistrate if he was found Drunk. Such a Liberty taken
in this Age, either in the Parliament or out of it, would
do terrible Execution.</p>
            <p>I cannot but mention a Petition in the year 1647, from
the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> to the House of Commons, against
the undue Election of Burgesses, who are strong in Wine
and weak in Wisdom.</p>
            <p>The cause of such Petitions is to be prevented by Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such as shall not give handle for them.</p>
            <p>VI. Wanting-Men give such cause of suspicion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they deal, that surely the Chusers will be upon their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94343:6"/>
guard, as often as such dangerous pretenders make their
application to them.</p>
            <p>Let the behaviour of such Men be never so plausible
and untainted, yet they who are to pitch upon those they
are to trust with all they have, may be excused, if they
do not only consider what they are, but what they
may be.</p>
            <p>As we pray our selves we may not be led into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we ought not by any means to thrust others into it;
even though our own Interest was not concerned; And
sure when it is, the Argument hath not less force.</p>
            <p>If a man hath a small Estate, and a numerous Family;
where it happeneth that a Man hath as many Children as
he hath Tenants, It is not a Recommending Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
for his Election.</p>
            <p>When it cometh to be the Question with such a Man,
Whether he shall be Just to the Publick, or Cruel to his
Family? It is very possible the decision may be on the side
of Corrupted Nature.</p>
            <p>It is a Compliment to this Age, which it doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
to suppose Men are so ty'd up to Morality, as that
they cannot be pinched out of it; especially now when
it is called Starving not to be Embroidered, or served in
Plate.</p>
            <p>The Men Chosen to serve their Countrey, should not
be loaden with Suits that may tempt them to assume Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges;
much less under such Necessities as may more
immediately prepare them for Corruption.</p>
            <p>Men who need a Parliament for their own particular
Interest, have more reason to offer their Service than
others have to accept of it. And though I do not doubt,
but there may be some whose Virtue would triumph
over their Wants, let them be never so pressing; yet to
expose the Publick to the hazard of being deceived, is
that which can never be justifi'd by those that Chuse.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94343:6"/>
And tho it must be allow'd possible for a wanting-Man to
be honest, yet it is impossible for a Man to be wise that
will depend upon it.</p>
            <p>VII. There is a sort of Men that have a Tinsel-wit,
which make them shine among those who cannot
judge.</p>
            <p>Club and Coffee-house Gentlemen, Petty Merchants
of small Conceits, who have an Empty habit of prating
without meaning; They always aim at Wit, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
make false Fire.</p>
            <p>Their business is less to learn, than to set themselves
out; which makes them chuse to be with such as can only
be Witnesses of their small Ingenuity, rather than with
such as might improve it.</p>
            <p>There is a subordinate Wit, as much inferior to a Wit
of business, as a Fidler at a Wake is to the lofty Sound of
an Organ.</p>
            <p>Men of this Size are in no degree suited to the business
of redressing Grievances, and making Laws.</p>
            <p>There is a Parliament-Wit to be distinguish'd from all
other kinds; those who have it, do not stuff their heads
only with Cavils and Objections.</p>
            <p>They have a deliberate and an observing Wit, a Head
turned to Publick things; Men who place a greater
pleasure in mending a Fault, than in finding it out.</p>
            <p>Their Understanding directeth them to object in the
right place, and not like those who go by no other Rule,
than to conclude, That must be the best Counsel which
was not taken.</p>
            <p>These Whole-sale Judges shew such a gross and peevish
Ignorance, that it appeareth so openly in all they say or
do, That they give loud warning to all considering Men,
not to chuse them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:94343:7"/>
VIII. The dislike of slight Airy Men must not go so
far, as to recommend heaviness in opposition to it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
where men are convicted of it by Experience in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Sessions.</p>
            <p>As a lively Coxcomb will seldom fail to lay in his
claim for Wit; so a Blockhead is apt to pretend, That his
heaviness is a proof of his Judgment.</p>
            <p>Some have an universal Lethargy spread upon their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
without exception; others have an Insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
<hi>quo ad hoc,</hi> as in some Cases men have <hi>quo ad hanc;</hi>
These last can never so turn their thoughts to publick Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
as to give the attention that is necessary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it.</p>
            <p>There are those who have such a thick Shell upon their
Brains, that their Ignorance is impenetrable, and maketh
such a stout resistance against Common Sense, that it will
never be subdu'd by it: True Heart of Oak, Ignorance
that will never yield, let Reason beat never so hard upon
it; and though their kind Neighbours have at several
Elections sent them up to School again, they have still
return'd the same incurable Dunces.</p>
            <p>There is a false Gravity that is a very ill symptom; and
it may be said, That as Rivers, which run very slowly,
have always the most Mud at the bottom; so a solid stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the constant course of a man's Life, is a sign of a
thick bed of Mud at the bottom of his Brain.</p>
            <p>A dull Man is so near a dead Man, that he is hardly to
be ranked in the List of the Living; and as he is not to be
buri'd whilst he is half alive, so he is as little to be imploy'd
whilst he is half dead.</p>
            <p>Parliaments are now grown to be quite other things
than they were formerly.</p>
            <p>In Ancient Times they were little more than Great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sizes;
A Roll of Grievances; <hi>Magna Charta</hi> confirmed;
Privileges of Holy Church preserved; so many Sacks of
Wool given, and away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94343:7"/>
Now there are Traps and Gins laid for the well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Countrey-Gentlemen; he is to grapple with the Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Men in Town, which is not a little improv'd by
being rewarded and encourag'd.</p>
            <p>So that men whose good Intentions are not seconded
and supported by some degree of Ability, are as much the
more dangerous, as they are less criminal than Cunning
Knaves. Their honest Mistakes, for want of distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either give a Countenance to, or at least lessen the
Scandal of the injurious things that are done to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
and with leave ask'd for so odd an expression,
Their Innocent Guilt is as mischievous to the Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
as the most deliberate Malice of those that would
destroy them.</p>
            <p>IX. There is an Abuse which daily increaseth, of
sending such to Parliament, as are scarce old enough to be
sent to the University.</p>
            <p>I would not in this restrain the Definition of these Boys
to the Age of Twenty One: If my Opinion might take
place, I should wish that none might be chosen into the
House of Commons under Thirty; and to make some
Equality, I should from the same Motives think it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
That no Lord should have a Vote in Judicature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Age.</p>
            <p>But to leave this Digression; I cannot see why the
Chusers should not at least make it a Rule among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
Not to send any Man to Represent them under the
Age of Twenty five, which is the time of Majority in
most other places of the world.</p>
            <p>Surely it is not that we are Earlier Plants than our
Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Such supposition could neither be justifi'd by our Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
nor by the degree of Latitude in which we are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
I must therefore attribute it to the haste our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94343:8"/>
had (and not without reason) to free themselves
from the Severity of Wardships.</p>
            <p>But whether this, or any thing else, was the cause of
our earlier stepping into Man's Estate; so it is now, that
according to our Laws, Twenty one is the Age of Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and the Young Man is then vested with a Legal,
how defective soever he may be in his Natural Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p>With all this, there ought to be a difference made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
coming out of Pupilage, and leaping into Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislatorship.</p>
            <p>It is perhaps inconvenient enough that a man should be
so soon let loose to destroy his own Estate; but it is yet
worse, that he should then have a Power of giving away
other men's.</p>
            <p>The Law must make General Rules, to which there
always will be some Objections.</p>
            <p>If there were Tryers appointed to judge when Leading-Strings
should be left off, many would wear them a very
great while, and some perhaps with their Gray Hairs;
there being no small number of Old Boys in all times, and
especially in this.</p>
            <p>It is necessary therefore to make Exceptions to this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rule, where the Case so much requireth it, as it doth
in the matter in question.</p>
            <p>The ground of sending these <hi>Minors</hi> to Parliament
ought not to recommend the Continuance of it to those
who are Lovers of Liberty; since it was by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Influence of Great Men, that their Stripling Sons
were first receiv'd by the humble depending Boroughs, or
the complying Counties.</p>
            <p>They called it, as many do still, the best School for
Young Men. Now Experience hath shew'd us, that it is
like a School only in this respect, That these Youngsters
when they are admitted, deserve to be whipp'd in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94343:8"/>
If the House of Commons is a School, it must be
for Men of riper Age; these are too young to learn
there, and being elevated by a mistaken smattering in
small Politicks, they grow too supercilious to learn any
where else; so that instead of improving young promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Plants, they are destroy'd by being misplac'd.</p>
            <p>If then they do themselves hurt by it, it is surer yet
that they do the House no good by coming into it.</p>
            <p>They were not Green Geese that are said to have sav'd
the Capitol; they were certainly of full Age, or else their
Cackling could not have been heard, so as to give
warning.</p>
            <p>Indeed it look'd of late, when the Fashion was to
have long continu'd Parliaments, as if we might plant a
Boy in the House with a Prospect that he might continue
there till he had Grey Hairs: And that the same Sapling
might have such a Root, as that he might grow up to be
Timber without being remov'd.</p>
            <p>If these Young Men had skill enough to pitch upon
some Body in the House, to whom they might resign
their Opinion, and upon whose Judgment they might
lean without Reserve, there might be less Objection.</p>
            <p>But to speak Truth, they know as little how to chuse,
as those did who elected them; so that there is no other
Expedient left, than the letting them alone.</p>
            <p>One may say, generally speaking, That a young Man
being too soon qualifi'd for the serious Business of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
would really be no good Symptom.</p>
            <p>It is a sign of too much Phlegm, and too little Fire in
the beginning of Age, if Men have not a little more
heat than is convenient; for as they grow older they
will run a hazard of not having so much as is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, The vigour of Youth is soften'd and
misappli'd, when it is not spent either in War or close
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94343:9"/>
Studies; all other Courses have an idle Mixture that
cometh to nothing, and maketh them like Trees, which
for want of Pruning run up to Wood, and seldom or
never bear any Fruit.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Head, it must be own'd, That there
is no Age of our Life which doth not carry Arguments
along with it to humble us; and therefore it would be
well for the Business of the World if young Men would
stay longer before they went into it, and old Men not so
long before they went out of it.</p>
            <p>X. Next to these may be rank'd a sort of superfine
Gentlemen, Carpet-Knights, Men whose Heads may be
said to be only Appurtenances to their Perukes, which
intirely ingross all their Care and Application.</p>
            <p>Their Understanding is so strictly appropriated to their
Dress, that no part of it is upon pain of their utmost Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
to be diverted to any other use.</p>
            <p>It is not by this intended to recommend an affected
Clown, or to make it a necessary Qualification for a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Parliament, that he must renounce clean Linen
or good Manners; but surely a too earnest Application
to make every thing sit Right about them, striketh too
deep into their small stock of Thoughts to allow it Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for any thing else.</p>
            <p>To do Right to the these fine-spun Gentlemen, Business
is too course a thing for them, which maketh it an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Hardship upon them to oppress them with it;
so that in tenderness to them, no less than out of care to
the Publick, it is best to leave them to their Taylors with
whom they will live in much better Correspondence,
when the Danger is prevented of their falling out about
Privileges.</p>
            <p>

XI. Men of Injustice and Violence, in their private
Dealings, are not to be trusted by the People with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to treat for them in Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. The King Commandeth in his
Writs not to chuse any Knights who had been Guilty of
Crime, or Maintenance.</p>
            <p>These warm Men seldom fail to run into Maintenance,
taken in a larger Extent.</p>
            <p>It is an unnatural Sound to come from a Man that is
Arbitrary in his Neighbourhood, to talk of Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
at <hi>Westminster;</hi> he is not a proper Vehicle for
such Words, which ought never to be prophaned.</p>
            <p>An habitual Breaker of the Laws, to be made one of
the Law-makers, is as if the Benches in <hi>Westminster-hall</hi>
should be filled with Men out of <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those who are of this Temper cannot change their
Nature out of respect to their Countrey.</p>
            <p>Quite contrary, they will less scruple to do Wrong
to a Nation where no Body taketh it to himself, than to
particular Men to whose Resentments they are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
exposed.</p>
            <p>In short, they lye under such strong Objections, that
the over-ballance of better Men cannot altogether purify
an Assemby where these unclean Beasts are admitted.</p>
            <p>XII. Excessive Spenders and unreasonable Savers are
to be Excluded, being both greedy from differing Causes.</p>
            <p>They are both of them Diseases of Infection, and for that
Reason are not to be admitted into publick Assemblies.</p>
            <p>A prodigal Man must be greedy, because he thinketh
he can never spend enough.</p>
            <p>The Wretch must be so, because he will never think
he can hoard enough.</p>
            <p>The World first admireth Men's Wisdom for getting
Money, and then raileth at them if they do not throw it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94343:10"/>
away; so that the Prodigal Man is only the less unpopular
Extreme; he is every jot as well prepared as the Miser
to fall out with his Morals, when once a good Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is offered him to lay them aside.</p>
            <p>On the other side, some rich Men are as eager to
overtake those that are Richer, as a Running-horse is to
get to the Race-post, before the other that contendeth
with him.</p>
            <p>Men often desire to heap, rather because others have
more, than that they know what to do with that which
they covet with so much Impatience.</p>
            <p>So that it is plain, the Fancy hath as great a share in
this imaginary Pleasure of Gathering, as it hath in Love,
Ambition, or any other Passion.</p>
            <p>It is pretty sure, that as no Man was ever the Richer
for having a good Estate, if he did not look after it; so
neither will he be the Honester if he hath never so much.</p>
            <p>Want of Care will always create want of Money; so
that whether a Man is a Beggar because he never had any
Money, or because he can never keep any, it is all one to
those who are to trust him.</p>
            <p>Upon this head of Prodigality, it may be no unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Caution to be afraid of those who in former Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
have been extravagantly Liberal of the Publick
Money.</p>
            <p>Trusting is so hazardous a thing, that it should never
be done but where it is necessary; so that when Trustees
are found upon Trial to be very Lavish, even without
examining into the Causes of it, (which are generally
very suspicious) it is a reasonable part of Preventing-Wit
to change Hands, or else the Chusers will pay the
Penalty that belongeth to good Nature so misplaced, and
the Consequences will be attended with the Aggravation
of their not being made Wiser by such a severe and costly
warning.</p>

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:94343:10"/>
XIII. It would be of very great use to take a general
Resolution throughout the Kingdom, That none should
be chosen for a County but such as have either in Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or Reversion, a considerable Estate in it; nor for a
Burrough, except he be Resiant, or that he hath some
Estate in the County, in present, or Expectancy.</p>
            <p>There have been Eminent Men of Law who were of
opinion, That in the Case of a Burgess of a Town not
Resiant, the Court is to give Judgment according to the
Statute, notwithstanding Custom to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But not to insist now upon that, the prudential part is
Argument enough to set up a Rule to abrogate an ill
Custom.</p>
            <p>There is not, perhaps, a greater Cause of the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Parliaments, than by adopting Members, who may
be said to have no title by their Births.</p>
            <p>The Juries are by the Law to be <hi>Ex vicineto;</hi> And
shall there be less care that the Representatives of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be so too?</p>
            <p>Sure the Interest of the County is best placed in the
hands of such as have some share in it.</p>
            <p>The Outliers are not so easily kept within the pale of
the Laws.</p>
            <p>They are often chosen without being known, which is
more like chusing Valentines, than Members of Parliament.
The Motive of their standing is more justly to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that they may redress their own Grievances which they
know, than those of the Countrey, to which they are
strangers.</p>
            <p>They are chosen at <hi>London</hi> to serve in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> &amp;c.
and are often Parties, before they come to be Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:
One would think the Reproach it is for a County
not to have Men within their own Circle to serve them in
Parliament, should be Argument enough to reject these
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94343:11"/>
Trespassers, without urging the ill Consequences in other
Respects of their being admitted.</p>
            <p>XIV. As in some Cases it is adviseable to give a total
exclusion to Men not fitly qualified; so in others it is more
proper to lay down a general Rule of Caution, with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of some Exceptions, where Men have given such
proofs of themselves, as create a Right for them to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished.</p>
            <p>Of this nature is that which I shall say concerning
Lawyers, who, by the same Reason that they may be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
may be also very dangerous.</p>
            <p>The Negligence, and want of Application in Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
hath made them to be thought more necessary than
naturally they are in Parliament.</p>
            <p>They have not only ingrossed the Chair of the Speaker,
but that of a Committee is hardly thought to be well fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
except it be by a Man of the Robe.</p>
            <p>This maketh it worthy of the more serious reflection of
all Gentlemen, that it may be an Argument to them to
qualify themselves in Parliamentary Learning, in such a
manner, as that they may rely upon their own Abilities,
in order to the serving their Countrey.</p>
            <p>But to come to the point in question; It is not without
Precedent, that Practising-Lawyers have been excluded
from serving in Parliament; and, without following those
Patterns strictly, I cannot but think it reasonable, that
whilst a Parliament sitteth, no Member of Parliament
should plead at any Bar.</p>
            <p>The Reason of it is in many respects strong in it self,
and is grown much stronger by the long sitting of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
of late; but I will not dwell upon this: The
matter now in question being concerning Lawyers being
Elected, which I conceive should be done with so much
circumspection, that probably it would not often happen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94343:11"/>
If Lawyers have great Practice, that ought to take
them up; if not, it is no great sign of their Ability;
and at the same time giveth a suspicion, that they may be
more liable to be tempted.</p>
            <p>If it should be so in Fact, That no King ever wanted
Judges to soften the stiffness of the Laws that were made,
so as to make them suit better with the Reason of State,
and the Convenience of the Government;</p>
            <p>It is no Injury now to suppose it possible for Lawyers in
the House of Commons, so to behave themselves in the
making of New Laws, as the better to make way
for the having their Robes lined with Fur.</p>
            <p>They are Men used to argue on both sides of a Question;
And if ordinary Fees can inspire them with very good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in a very ill Cause, that Faculty exercised in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where it may be better encouraged, may prove
very inconvenient to those that chuse them.</p>
            <p>And therefore, without arraigning a Profession, that it
would be scandalous for a man not to honour; one may,
by a Suspicion, which is the more excusable when it is
in the behalf of the People, imagine that the habit of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Money for their Opinion, may create in some such
a forgetfulness to distinguish, that they may take it for
their Vote.</p>
            <p>They are generally Men who by a laborious study hope
to be advanced: They have it in their Eye as a Reward
for the Toil they undergo.</p>
            <p>This maketh them generally very slow, and ill disposed
(let the Occasion never so much require it) to wrestle
with that Soil where Preferment groweth.</p>
            <p>Now if the Supposition be in its self not unreasonable,
and that it should happen to be strengthen'd and confirm'd
by Experience, it will be very unnecessary to say any more
upon this Article, but leave it to the Electors to consider
of it.</p>

XV. I cannot forbear to put in a Caveat against Men
ty'd to a Party.</p>
            <p>There must in every body be a Leaning to that sort of
Men who profess some Principles, more than to others
who go upon a different Foundation; but when a man is
drowned in a Party, plunged in it beyond his depth, he
runneth a great hazard of being upon ill terms with good
Sense, or Morality, if not with both of them.</p>
            <p>Such a man can hardly be called a Free Agent, and for
that reason is very unfit to be trusted with the Peoples Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
after he hath given up his own.</p>
            <p>It is said, That in some part of the <hi>Indies</hi> they do so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
little Feet, that they keep them squeezed while they
are Children, so that they stay at that small size after they
are grown Men.</p>
            <p>One may say something like this of Men lock'd up in a
Party; They put their Thoughts into such a Narrow
Mould, that they can never be enlarged nor released
from their first Confinements.</p>
            <p>Men in a Party have <hi>Liberty</hi> only for their <hi>Motto;</hi> in
reality they are greater Slaves than any body else would
care to make them.</p>
            <p>A Party, even in times of Peace, (tho against the
Original Contract, and the Bill of Rights) sets up and
continues the exercise of Martial Law: Once inrolled,
the Man that quitteth, if they had their will, would be
hanged for a Deserter.</p>
            <p>They communicate Anger to one another by Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
And it may be said, that if too much Light
dazzleth the Eye-sight, too much Heat doth not less
weaken the Judgment.</p>
            <p>Heat reigneth in the Fancy; and Reason, which is a
colder Faculty of the Brain, taketh more time to be
heard, than the other will allow.</p>
            <p>The Heat of a Party is like the Burning of a Feaver,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94343:12"/>
and not a Natural Warmth, evenly distributed to give
Life and Vigor.</p>
            <p>There was a time indeed when Anger shew'd a good
sign of Honesty; but that Evidence is very much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Instances we have seen since the Days of Yore:
And the Publick-spirited Choler hath been thrown off
within time of Memory, and lost almost all its Credit
with some People, since they found what Governments
thought fit to make their so doing a step to their Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>A strong blustring Wind seldom continues long in one
Corner.</p>
            <p>Some men knock loud only to be let in; the Bustle they
make is animated by their private Interest. The outward
Blaze only is for Religion and Liberty: The true lasting
Fire, like that of the Vestals which never went out, is an
eagerness to get somewhat for themselves.</p>
            <p>A House of Commons composed of such Men, would
be more properly so many Merchants incorporated in a
Regular Company, to make their particular Adventures,
than Men sent from the People to serve and represent
them.</p>
            <p>There are some Splenetick Gentlemen who confine
their favourable Opinion within so narrow a compass, that
they will not allow it to any man that was not hanged in
the late Reigns.</p>
            <p>Now by that rule one might expect they should rescue
themselves from the disadvantage of being now alive;
and by abdicating a World so little worthy of them, get
a great Name to themselves, with the general satisfaction
of all those they would leave behind them.</p>
            <p>Amongst the many other ill consequences of a stated
Party, it is none of the least, that it tempteth low and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant
men to come upon the Stage, to expose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to spoil Business.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:94343:13"/>
It turneth a Cypher into a Figure, such a one as it is:
A man in a Party is able to make a noise, let it be never so
empty a sound.</p>
            <p>A weak man is easily blown out of his small senses, by
being muster'd into a Party; he is flatter'd till he liketh
himself so well, that he taketh it extremely ill if he
hath not an Employment.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more in fashion, than for men to desire
good Places, and I doubt nothing is less so than to deserve
them.</p>
            <p>From Nobody to Somebody is such a violent stride,
that Nature, which hath the Negative Voice, will not
give its Royal Assent to it: So that when insufficient Men
aim at being in business, the worst of their Enemies might
out of malice to them, pray for their Preferment.</p>
            <p>There could be no end, if one did not stop till this
Theme had no more matter to furnish. I will only say,
Nothing is more evident, than that the Good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath been sacrificed to the Animosities of the several
Contending Parties; and without entring into the dispute
which of them are more or less in the right, it is pretty
sure, that whilst these Opposite Sets of Angry Men are
playing at Foot-ball, they will break all the Windows, and
do more hurt than their pretended Zeal for the Nation
will ever make amends for.</p>
            <p>In short, a man so engaged is retained before the people
take him for their Council; he hath such a Reserve for his
Party, that it is not advisable for those who would chuse
him, to depend upon his Professions. All Parties assuming
such a Dispensing Power, that by their Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
they cancel and dissolve any Act or Promise that they
do not afterwards approve.</p>
            <p>These things considered, those who will chuse such
men deserve whatever followeth.</p>

XVI. Pretenders to Exorbitant Merit in the late Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
are not without Objections against them, when
they stand to serve in Parliament. It would not only be a
low, but a criminal kind of Envy, to deny a distinguishing
Justice to Men who have been instrumental and active,
when the Service of their Countrey requir'd it. But
there ought to be Moderation in men's Claims, or else it
is out of the power of our poor Island to satisfy them. It
is true, Service of all kinds is grown much dearer, like
Labourer's Wages, which formerly occasioned several
Statutes to regulate them.</p>
            <p>But now the men who only carried Mortar to the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when it is finished, think they are ill dealt with if
they are not made Master-Workmen.</p>
            <p>They presently cry out, The Original Contract is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
if their Merit is not rewarded, at their own Rate too.</p>
            <p>Some will think there never ought to be an end of their
Rewards; when indifferent Judges would perhaps be
puzzled to find out the beginning of their Merit.</p>
            <p>They bring in such large Bills, that they must be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind':
Some bounds must be put to men's Pretensions;
else the Nation, which is to pay the Reckoning, will
every way think it a scurvy thing to be undone, whether
it be by being over run by our Enemies, or by the being
exhausted by our Friends.</p>
            <p>There ought therefore to be deductions where they are
reasonable, the better to justifie the paying what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.</p>
            <p>For example, if any of these passionate Lovers of the
Protestant Religion should not think fit, in their manner
of Living, to give the least evidence of their Morality,
their claims upon that Head might sure be struck off
without any Injustice to them.</p>
            <p>If there are any who set down great Sums as a Reward
due to their Zeal for rescuing Property from the Jaws
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94343:14"/>
of Arbitrary Power; their pretensions may fairly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
if now they are so far from shewing a care and
tenderness of the Laws, that they look rather like Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
retained on the other side.</p>
            <p>It is no less strange, than I doubt it is true, that some
Men should be so in Love with their dear Mistress, <hi>Old
England,</hi> with all her wrinkles, as out of an Heroick
Passion to Swim over to rescue her from being Ravish'd;
and when they have done the Feat, the first thing after
Enjoyment is, that they go about to Strangle her.</p>
            <p>For the sake of true Love, it is not fit that such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentile
Gallants should be too much encourag'd; and
their Arrogance for having done well at first, will have
no right to be excused, if their doing so ill at last doth not
make them a little more modest.</p>
            <p>True Merit, like a River, the deeper it is, the less
noise it makes.</p>
            <p>These loud proclaimers of their own Deserts, are not
only to be suspected for their truth, but the Electors are
to consider that such meritorious Men lay an Assessment
upon those that Chuse them.</p>
            <p>The Publick Taxes are already heavy enough without
the addition of these private Reckonings. It is therefore
the safer way not to employ Men, who will expect more
for their Wages, than the mistaken Borough that sendeth
them up to Parliament could be sold for.</p>
            <p>XVII. With all due regard to the noblest of Callings,
Military Officers are out of their true Element when
they are misplaced in a House of Commons.</p>
            <p>Things in this World ought to be well suited. There
are some Appearances so unnatural, that men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
by them without any other Argument.</p>
            <p>The very Habit in some Cases, recommendeth or
giveth Offence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:94343:14"/>
If the Judges upon the Bench should, instead of their
Furrs, which signify Gravity, aud bespeak Respect, be
Cloathed like the Jockeys at <hi>New-Market,</hi> or wear Jack-Boots
and <hi>Steenkirks;</hi> they would not in reality have less
Law, but Mankind would be so struck with this unusual
Object, that it would be a great while before they could
think it possible to receive Justice from Men so Accouter'd.</p>
            <p>It is to some degree the same thing in this Case; such
Martial Habits, Blew-Coats, Red Stockings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make
them look very unlike Grave Senators. One would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
swear they were Creatures apart, and of a differing
Species from the rest of the Body.</p>
            <p>In former times, when only the Refiant Shopkeeper
was to Represent his Corporation (which by the way is the
Law still at this day) the Military Looks of one of these
Sons of <hi>Mars,</hi> would have stared the Quaking Member
down again to his Burrough.</p>
            <p>Now the number of them is so encreased, that the
Peaceable part of the House may lawfully swear they are
in fear of their Lives, from such an Awful Appearance
of Men of War.</p>
            <p>It maketh the Room look like a Guard-house by such an
ill-suited mixture. But this is only the out-side, the bark
of the Argument; the root goeth yet deeper against
Chusing such Men, whose Talents ought to be otherwise
applied.</p>
            <p>Their two Capacities are so inconsistent, that Mens
undertaking to serve both the Cures, will be the cause in
a little time, that we shall neither have Men of War,
nor Men of Business, good in their several kinds.</p>
            <p>An Officer is to give up his Liberty to obey Orders;
and it is necessarily incident to his Calling that he should
do so.</p>
            <p>A Member of Parliament is originally to be tender of
his own Liberty, that other Men may the better trust
him with theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:94343:15"/>
An Officer is to enable himself by his Courage, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Skill and Experience, to support the Laws (if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded)
when they are made; but he is not supposed to
be at leisure enough to understand how they should be
made.</p>
            <p>A Member of Parliament is to fill his thoughts with
what may best conduce to the Civil Administration;
which is enough to take up the whole Man, let him be
never so much raised above the ordinary Level.</p>
            <p>These two opposite Qualifications, being placed in one
Man, make him such an ambiguous divided Creature,
that he doth not know how to move.</p>
            <p>It is best to keep Men within their proper Sphere; few
Men have Understanding enough exactly to fill even one
narrow Circle, fewer able to fill two; especially when
they are both of so great compass, and that they are so
contrary in their own Natures.</p>
            <p>The Wages he hath as a Member, and those he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
as an Officer, are paid for Services that are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering;
and in the doubt which of them should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferably
performed, it is likely the greater Salary may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
him, without the further inducements of complying
most, where he may expect most advantage by it.</p>
            <p>In short, if his dependance is not very great, it will
make him a scurvey Officer; if it is great, it will make
him a scurvier Member.</p>
            <p>XVIII. Men under the scandal of being thought pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Pensioners, are too fair a mark to escape being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
in reference to the point in Question.</p>
            <p>In case of plain Evidence, it is not to be suppos'd, possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that Men convicted of such a Crime should ever
again be Elected.</p>
            <p>The difficulty is in determining what is to be done in
case of suspicion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:94343:15"/>
There are suspicions so well grounded, that they may
pretend to have the force of proofs, provided the penalty
goeth only to the forbearing to Trust, but not extending
it so far as to Punish.</p>
            <p>There must be some things plain and express to justify
the latter, but Circumstances may be sufficient for the
former: As where Men have had such sudden Cures of
their ill Humours, and opposition to the Court, that it is
out of the way of ordinary methods of recovery from such
Distempers, which have a much slower progress; it must
naturally be imputed to some Specifick that maketh such
a quick alteration of the whole Mass of Blood.</p>
            <p>Where Men have raised their way of Living, without
any visible means to support them in it, a suspicion is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd,
even by the Example of the Law, which in cases of this
kind, though of an inferior nature, doth upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
not only raise Inferences, but inflict Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Where Men are immoral, and scandalous in their
Lives, and dispense familiarly with the Rules by which
the World is Govern'd, for the better preserving the
bonds of human Society; it must be a confidence very ill
placed, to conclude it impossible for such Men to yield
to a Temptation well offer'd and pursu'd; when, the
truth is, the habit of such <hi>Bons vivants,</hi> which is the
fashionable word, maketh a suspicion so likely, that it is
very hard not to believe it to be true.</p>
            <p>If there should be nothing but the general Report, even
that is not to be neglected.</p>
            <p>Common Fame is the only Lyar that deserveth to have
some Respect still reserv'd to it; tho she telleth many an
Untruth, she often hits right, and most especially when
she speaketh ill of men.</p>
            <p>Her Credit hath sometimes been carried too far, when
it hath gone to the divesting men of any thing of which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94343:16"/>
they were possess'd, without more express evidence to
justify such a proceeding.</p>
            <p>If there was a doubt whether there ever was any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of this kind, it would alter the Question; but sure
that will not bear the being controverted.</p>
            <p>We are told, That <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth sent over into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
1200000 Crowns to be distributed amongst the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men, to encourage them to carry on Elections.</p>
            <p>Here was the Protestant Religion to be bought out for
a valuable Consideration according to Law, though not
according to Gospel, which exalteth it above any Price that
can be set upon it.</p>
            <p>Now, except we had reason to believe that the Vertue
of the World is improv'd since that time, we can as little
doubt that such Temptations may be Offer'd, as that they
may be Receiv'd.</p>
            <p>It will be owned, that there is to be a great tenderness
in Suspecting; but it must be allow'd at the same time,
that there ought not to be less in Trusting, where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are so much concern'd; especially, when the Penalty
upon the Party suspected goeth no further than a suspension
of that Confidence, which it is necessary to have in those
who are to represent the Nation in Parliament.</p>
            <p>I cannot omit the giving a Caution against admitting
Men to be chosen, who have Places of any value.</p>
            <p>There needeth the less to be said upon this Article, the
truth of the Proposition being supported by such plain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p>Sure no Man hath such a plentiful spring of Thought,
as that all that floweth from it is too much to be appli'd
to the Business of Parliament.</p>
            <p>It is not less sure, that a Member of Parliament, of all
others, ought least to be exempted from the Rule, That
no man should serve two Masters.</p>
            <p>It doth so split a man's Thoughts, that no man can know
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94343:16"/>
how to make a fitting distribution of them to two such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Capacities.</p>
            <p>It exposeth Men to be suspected, and tempted, more
than is convenient for the Publick Service, or for the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
good Opinion of one another, which there ought to
be in such an Assembly.</p>
            <p>It either giveth a real dependance upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is inconsistent with the necessity there is,
that a Member of Parliament should be disengaged; or
at least it hath the appearance of it, which maketh them
not look like Freemen, though they should have vertue
enough to be so.</p>
            <p>More Reasons would lessen the Weight of this last,
which is, That a Bill to this effect, commonly called the <hi>Self-Denying
Bill,</hi> pass'd even this last House of Commons.</p>
            <p>A greater demonstration of the irresistible strength of
Truth cannot possibly be given; so that a Copy of that
Bill in every County or Burrough, would hardly fail of
discouraging such Pretenders from Standing, or at least it
would prevent their Success if their own Modesty should
not restrain them from attempting it.</p>
            <p>XX. If Distinctions may be made upon particular
Men, or Remarks fix'd upon their Votes in Parliament,
they must be allow'd in relation to those Gentlemen, who
for Reasons best known to themselves thought fit to be
against the <hi>Triennial Bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Liberty of Opinion is the thing in the World that
ought least to be controll'd, and especially in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But as that is an undoubted Assertion, it is not less so,
That when Men Sin against their own Light, give a Vote
against their own Thought, they must not plead Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of Parliament against the being Arraigned for it by
others, after they are Convicted of it by themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:94343:17"/>
There cannot be a Man, who in his definition of a
House of Commons, will state it to be an Assembly, that
for the better redressing of Grievances the People feel,
and for the better furnishing such Supplies as they can
bear, is to continue, if the King so pleaseth, for his
whole Reign.</p>
            <p>This could be as little intended, as to throw all into
one Hand, and to renounce the Claim to any Liberty, but
so much as the Sovereign Authority would allow.</p>
            <p>It destroyeth the end of Parliaments, it maketh use of
the Letter of the Law to extinguish the Life of it.</p>
            <p>It is, in truth, some kind of Disparagement to so
plain a thing, that so much has been said and written upon
it; and one may say, It is such an Affront to those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Understandings to censure this Vote only as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
that, as the Age goeth, it is less Discredit to them
to call it by its right Name; and if that is rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by those who are to chuse them, I suppose they
will let them Exercise their Liberty of Conscience at
home, and not make Men their Trustees, who in this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Instance have such an unwillingness to surrender.</p>
            <p>It must be own'd, That this Bill hath met with very
hard Fortune, and yet that doth not in the least diminish
the value of it.</p>
            <p>It had in it such a Root of Life, that it might be said,
It was not Dead but Sleeped; and we see that the last
Session, it was revived and animated by the Royal
Assent, when once fully inform'd of the Consequence,
as well as of the Justice of it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, after having told my Opinion, Who
ought not to be Chosen:</p>
            <p>If I should be ask'd, who ought to be, my Answer must
be, Chuse <hi>Englishmen;</hi> and when I have said that, to
deal honestly, I will not undertake that they are easy to
be found.</p>
