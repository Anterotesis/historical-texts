            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>There is nothing more substantial, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable in Greatness, than the power it gives to oblige; for by doing benefits we in some measure are like to <hi>Him,</hi> who is the Lover of Men, and causeth his Sun to shine upon the good, and upon the evil: Nor doth God Himself glory in the absoluteness of his Power, and uncontroulableness of his Soveraign Will, as he doth in the displays of his Goodness: This, my Lord, is the right, and honourable use of that Greatness he is pleased to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe unto Men; and this is that which makes it amiable, and truly illustrious: Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship knows <hi>this,</hi> and are as much by Nature as by Judgment, formed to live according to such measures: And I think there was never Person of your Lordship's rank, whose gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I know 'tis ufually <hi>indecent</hi> to commend Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to themselves; but the custome of Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations will excuse this, which even <hi>severity</hi> and ill nature cannot impeach of flattery, or extravagance.</p>
            <p>And as I owe this Testimony to the merits whereby you serve and oblige the Age, so I should acknowledg the Obligations your Lordship hath conferr'd on my self: but this will be a great duty, and business of my Life; for such empty expressions as these verbal ones, are very unsuitable returns for real and great favours; and if ever better acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments are in my power, I shall still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what I owe your Lordship.</p>
            <p>I now most humbly present you with a <hi>Collection</hi> of some <hi>Essays</hi> upon subjects of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. The design of them is to lay a foundation for a good habit of thoughts, both in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>Theology.</hi> They were some of them written several years ago, and had trial

of the World in divers Editions: Now they come abroad together (with some things that are <hi>new</hi>) reduced to such an Order, as is most agreeable to my present judgment. I could have added much upon such fertile, and useful Arguments; but I am willing to believe, I have said enough for the capable and ingenious, and I doubt too much for others. If your Lordship shall pardon their imperfections, and accept of the devotion where-with they are offer'd you, it will be the greatest honour, and satisfaction to,</p>

But the truth is, I am not grown so much wiser yet, as to have alter'd any thing in the main of those conceptions. If I had thought it worth the while, I might have been more exact in new modelling, and could perhaps have given them a turn that would have been more agreeable to some phancies, but my Laziness, or my Judgment made me think there was no need of that trouble.</p>
            <p>The <hi>FIRST</hi> Essay against <hi>Confidence</hi> in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> is quite changed in the way of Writing, and in the Order. Methought I was somewhat fetter'd and tied in doing it, and could not express my self with that case, freedom, and fulness which possibly I might have commanded amid fresh thoughts: Yet 'tis so al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The <hi>SECOND</hi> of <hi>Scepticism,</hi> and <hi>Certainty,</hi> was written when I was warm in the Consideration of those matters, for the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a particular Friend; what I say was enough for his use, though the Subject is capable of much more; and I had inlarged on it, but that I am lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Discourse was written violently against by one, who was wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd. The interest be pretended, was the defence of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty against a Passage, wherein he would have me say, That the ancient Physicians could not cure <hi>a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>I have further to advertise concerning this <hi>Essay,</hi> That whereas I mention several Discourses of Mr. <hi>Boyl's,</hi> as intended for the Publick, 'tis likely that some of them by this may be extant, though my privacy and retirement hath not afforded me the notice of their publication.</p>
            <p>The <hi>FOURTH</hi> Essay of the <hi>Usefulness</hi> of <hi>Philosophy</hi> to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> was Printed under the Title of <hi>Philosophia Pia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> I was commanded to reprint it by a Person of Honour, and great Fame, for whose Learning and universal Accomplishments I have high and just venerations. This put into my thoughts the design of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising of some of my other Writings, and bringing them together into a small Collection, which I have here done.</p>
            <p>The <hi>FIFTH</hi> of the <hi>Agreement</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> was at first a <hi>Visitation Sermon,</hi> twice Printed before; I have now only cast it into the form of a Discourse. It contains the substance of many thoughts and anxieties about that important matter, in a little compass. My chief care was to state, and represent the whole affair <hi>clearly;</hi> which I think I have done. The subject <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>b been written on by divers since, who some of them have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext the matter again; others have added no one thought. They have written a great deal, I wish I could say, <hi>to purpose.</hi> I know this freedom is capable of a wrong interpretation, but I am urged to it by a little vexa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The <hi>SIXTH</hi> Essay was one of the first written, and printed four times already. It stands in this place because it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>The <hi>SEVENTH</hi> is entirely new. 'Tis a description of such a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius in <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Philosophy,</hi> as I confess I my self like and I believe some others may. But I blame no Mans differen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> I have done now: But I make thee no promise that I will not write again; for I perceive that those promises are hardly kept. To appear often in the Press I know is censur'd; but I see not why that should be a fault, whilst the Books themselves have not greater. If a Man write well, he may deserve excuse at least; if otherwise, by use he may mend; or if there be no hopes of that, his writing often is not worth objecting. Nor hath any one need to complain, since no one is concern'd about what another Prints, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than himself pleaseth: And since Men have the liberty to read our Books, or not: Methinks they might give us leave to write, or forbear. This I say, because I know this ill-natur'd humour, puts restraint upon the Pens of some great Men; and tempts others to make promises, and excuses, which I think do not become them. For my part I have as little leasure to write Books as other Men, for I have that to do which may be reckoned an Imployment; but every Man hath some va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ancies, and I love now and then in this manner to imploy mine. 'Tis an innocent way of entertaining a Mans self, to paint the image of his thoughts, and no better a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than my self may happen to divert, if not to instruct, some others by it.</p>

Light: others have thought it an extract from the <hi>Vniversal Soul:</hi> Some fancied, it descended from the Moon; others from the Stars, or vast spaces of the <hi>Aether</hi> above the Planets, some teach, That God is the immediate Author of it; some that it was made by Angels; and some by the Parents. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>Created</hi> or <hi>Traduced,</hi> hath been the great Ball of contention to the <hi>latter</hi> Ages, and after all the stir about it, 'tis still as much a question as ever, and perhaps may so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till the great Day, that will put an end to all Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Disputes. The Patrons of <hi>Traduction</hi> accuse their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of affronting the <hi>Attributes</hi> of God; and the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of <hi>Immediate Creation</hi> impeach them of violence to the <hi>nature of things:</hi> And while each of the Opinions strongly opposeth the other, and feebly defends it self, some take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion thence to say, That both are right in their Oppositions, but both mistaken in their Assertions. I shall not stir in the Waters that have been troubled with so much contention: The Famous St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and others of the celebrated Antients, have been content to sit down here in a profest Neutrality, and I will not endeavour to urge Confessions in things that will be acknowledged; but shall note some Difficulties, that are not so usually observed; which perhaps have more darkness in them, than <hi>these</hi> so much controverted Doctrines.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I begin with the <hi>Vnion</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body:</hi> In the <hi>Vnions</hi> that we <hi>understand,</hi> there is still, either some <hi>suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and likeness of Nature in the things united, or some <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, participating</hi> Being by which they are joyn'd; but in this there is neither. The natures of Soul and Body, are at the most extream distance; and their essential Attributes most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite: To be <hi>impenetrable, discerpible</hi> and <hi>unactive,</hi> is the nature of all <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> as such: And the properties of a <hi>Spirit</hi> are the direct contrary, to be <hi>penetrable, indiscerpible,</hi> and <hi>self-motive:</hi> Yea, so different they are in all things, that they seem to have nothing but <hi>Being,</hi> and the <hi>Transcendental</hi> Attributes of <hi>that,</hi> in common: Nor is there any appearance of <hi>likeness</hi> between them: For what hath <hi>Rarefaction, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation, Division,</hi> and the other properties and modes of Matter, to do with <hi>Apprehension, Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> which are the proper acts of a Spiritual Being? We cannot
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53288:11"/>
then perceive any <hi>congruity,</hi> by which they are united: Nor can there be any <hi>middle</hi> sort of Nature that partakes of each, (as 'tis in some Unions) their Attributes being such <hi>extreams:</hi> or, if there is any such Being, or any such possible, we know nothing of it, and 'tis utterly unconceivable. So that, what the <hi>Cement</hi> should be that unites <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth, Light</hi> and <hi>Darkness, viz.</hi> Natures of so diverse a make, and such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing Attributes, is beyond the reach of any of our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: We can as easily conceive how a thought should be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Statue, or a Sun-beam to a piece of Clay: how words should be frozen in the Air, (as some say they are in the remote North) or how Light should be kept in a Box; as we can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the <hi>manner</hi> of this <hi>strange Vnion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And we can give no better account how the <hi>Soul moves the Body.</hi> For whether we conceive it under the notion of a <hi>Pure Mind,</hi> and <hi>Knowledg,</hi> with Sir <hi>K. Digby;</hi> or of a <hi>Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Substance,</hi> with <hi>Des-Cartes;</hi> or of a <hi>penetrable, indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible, self-motive</hi> Being, with the <hi>Platonists;</hi> It will in all these ways be unconceivable how it gives motion to unactive matter: For how that should <hi>move a Body,</hi> whose nature it is to <hi>pass through</hi> all Bodies without the least <hi>jog</hi> or <hi>obstruction,</hi> would require something more than we know, to help us to conceive. Nor will it avail to say, that it moves the Body by its <hi>vehicle</hi> of corporeal Spirits; for still the difficulty will be the same, <hi>viz. How it moves them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We know as little, How the <hi>Soul so regularly directs the Animal Spirits,</hi> and Instruments of Motion which are in the Body; as to stir any we have a will to move: For the passages through which the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rits are convey'd, being so numerous, and there being so many others that cross and branch from each of them, 'tis wonderful they should not lose their way in such a Wilderness: and I think the wit of Man cannot yet tell how they are directed. That they are conducted by some <hi>knowing</hi> Guide, is evident from the <hi>steadiness</hi> and <hi>regularity</hi> of their motion: But <hi>what</hi> that should be, and <hi>how</hi> it doth it, we are yet to seek: That all the motions within us are not dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the meer mechanick frame of our Bodies, is clear from experience, by which we are assured, that those we call <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the <hi>determination</hi> of the Spirits into <hi>such</hi> or such passages, is from the <hi>Soul,</hi> whatever we hold of the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eyances after; and <hi>these,</hi> I think, all the Philosophy in the World cannot make out to be <hi>purely mechanical.</hi> But though this be gain'd, that the <hi>Soul</hi> is the <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>Direction,</hi> yet the difficulty is no less than it was before: For unless we allow it a kind of inward sight of every Vein, Muscle, Artery, and other Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of its own Body; of the exact site and position of them, with their several Windings, and secret Chanels, it will still be as unconceivable, how it should direct such intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Motions, as that one that was born blind should manage a Game at Chess, or marshal an Army: And if the <hi>Soul</hi> have any such knowledg, we are not aware of it; nor do our minds attend it: Yea, we are so far from this, That many times we observe not any method in the outward performance, even in the greatest variety of interchangable motions, in which a steady Direction is difficult, and a Miscarriage easie: As we see an Artist will play on an Instrument of Musick without minding it; and the Tongue will nimbly run divisions in a Tune without missing, when the Thoughts are engaged else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: which effects are to be ascribed to some <hi>secret Art</hi> of the Soul (if <hi>that</hi> direct) to which we are altogether stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But besides the Difficulties that lie more deep; we are at a loss even in the knowledg of our <hi>Senses,</hi> that seem the most <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>obvious</hi> of our Faculties. Our eyes that see other things, see not themselves; and the <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Knowledg</hi> are <hi>unknown.</hi> That the <hi>Soul</hi> is the <hi>percipient,</hi> which alone hath <hi>animadversion</hi> and <hi>sense,</hi> properly so call'd; and that the <hi>Body</hi> is only the <hi>receiver,</hi> and <hi>conveyer</hi> of corporeal <hi>Motions,</hi> is as certain as Philosophy can make it. <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in that Maxim, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: And <hi>Plato</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That the Soul hath life and sence; but that the <hi>Body</hi> in strictness of speaking, hath neither the one nor other: Upon which position all the Philosophy of <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> stands: And it is so clear, and so acknowledg'd a Truth, among all consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Men, that I need not stay to prove it: But yet, what are the <hi>Instruments</hi> of sensitive Perception, and <hi>particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> of outward Motions to the seat of Sense, is difficult to find;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53288:12"/>
and how the <hi>pure Mind</hi> can receive information from things that are not like it self, nor the objects they represent, is, I think, not to be explain'd. Whether <hi>Sensation</hi> be made by <hi>corporeal Emissions,</hi> and <hi>material Images;</hi> or by <hi>Motions</hi> that are convey'd to the common sense, I shall not dispute: the <hi>latter</hi> having so generally obtain'd among the Philosophers: But, How the Soul by <hi>mutation,</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> in <hi>matter,</hi> a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of an <hi>other</hi> kind, should be excited to action; and how <hi>these</hi> should concern it, that is of so divers a nature, is hardly to be conceiv'd. For <hi>Body</hi> cannot act on any thing, but by <hi>Motion; Motion</hi> cannot be receiv'd but by <hi>Matter,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> is altogether <hi>immaterial;</hi> and therefore, how shall we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it to be subject to <hi>such Impressions?</hi> and yet <hi>Pain,</hi> and the <hi>unavoidableness</hi> of our Sensations evidently prove, That it is subject to them.</p>
            <p>Besides, How is it, and by what <hi>Art</hi> doth the Soul read, That <hi>such</hi> an <hi>Image,</hi> or Motion in matter, (whether that of her Vehicle, or of the Brain, the case is the same) <hi>signifies such an Object?</hi> If there be any such Art, we conceive it not: and 'tis strange we should have a Knowledg that we do <hi>not know.</hi> That by diversity of <hi>Motions</hi> we should spell out <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, Distances, Magnitudes, Colours;</hi> things not <hi>resembled</hi> by them, we must ascribe to some <hi>implicit inference,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; but <hi>what</hi> it <hi>should be;</hi> and by what <hi>Mediums</hi> that Knowledg is advanced, is altogether <hi>unintelligible.</hi> For though the Soul may perceive <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> by simple <hi>sense,</hi> yet it seems unconceivable it should apprehend what they <hi>signifie,</hi> and represent, but by some secret Art and way of inference: An illiterate Person may see the Letters, as well as the most Learned, but he knows not what they mean; and an Infant hears the sounds, and sees the motion of the Lips, but hath no conception convey'd to him, for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the signification of them: such would be our case, not-withstanding all the motions and impressions made by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, if the Soul had not some unknown way of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by them the quality of the Objects. For instance, <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> and <hi>Motions</hi> have but very <hi>small</hi> room in the Brain, where they are receiv'd, and yet they represent the <hi>gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Nor will the Philosophy of <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> help us here; For the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>divers Filaments</hi> in the Brain, cannot make us perceive such modes as Distances are, unless some such Art and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be allow'd, of which we understand nothing.</p>

               </gap>'d. There are four principal Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by which an account hath been attempted; The <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> the <hi>Cartesian,</hi> the <hi>Digbaean,</hi> and the <hi>Hobbian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. According to the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Schools, <hi>Objects</hi> are conserv'd in the memory by certain <hi>Intentional Species</hi> (as they call them) a sort of Beings, that have a necessary dependance upon their Subjects; but are not material in their formal Constitution and Nature. I need not say much against these arbitrary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious Creatures, that have no foundation in any of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: Or be that how it will, They are utterly <hi>unintelligible;</hi> neither <hi>bodily,</hi> nor <hi>spiritual;</hi> neither produc'd out of <hi>any</hi> thing, as the <hi>matter</hi> of their production; nor out of <hi>nothing,</hi> which were <hi>Creation,</hi> and not to be allow'd to be in the power of every, or any finite Being. And though there were no such contradictious contrivance in the framing these Species, yet they could not serve any purpose, as to the Memory, since 'tis against the nature of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>native</hi> Effects, such as these are, to subsist but by the continual influence of their Causes; and so, if this were the true Solution, we could remember nothing longer than the Object was in presence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The account of <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> is to this purpose; The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are sent about the Brain, to find the <hi>tracks</hi> of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> we would call to mind; which Tracks consist in <hi>this, viz, That the Pores through which the Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>the Objects past, are more easily open'd,</hi> and afford a more ready passage to those others that seek to enter; whence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a <hi>special motion</hi> in the <hi>Glandule,</hi> which signifies <hi>this</hi> to be that we would remember.</p>
            <p>But if our <hi>Remembrance</hi> arise from the <hi>easie motion</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> through the <hi>opened</hi> passages (according to this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis)? How then do we so distinctly remember such a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Objects, whose Images pass the <hi>same</hi> way? And how the <hi>Distances</hi> of Bodies that <hi>lie in a Line?</hi> Why should not the impell'd Spirits find <hi>other</hi> open passages, besides those made by the thing we would remember? When there are such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motions through the Brain from numerous other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? Yea, in such a pervious substance as that is, why should not those subtile Bodies meet, every where an easie passage? It seems to me that one might conceive as well, how every Grain of Corn in a Sieve should be often shaken through the same holes, as how the Spirits in the repeated acts of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory should still go through the same Pores: Nor can I well apprehend but that those supposed open'd passages, would in a short time be stopt up, either by the natural gravity of the parts, or the making new ones near those; or other alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Brain.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> is next, <hi>viz.</hi> That things are preserv'd in the Memory by <hi>material Images</hi> that flow from them, which having imping'd on the common sense, rebound thence into some vacant Cells of the Brain, where they keep their ranks, and postures, as they entred, till again they are stirr'd, and then they appear to the Fancy as they were first presented.</p>
            <p>But how is it conceiveable, That those active Particles which have nothing to unite them, or to keep them in any order, yea which are continually justled by the occursion of other minute Bodies, (of which there must needs be great store in this Repository) should so long remain in the same state and posture? And how is it that when we turn over those Idaea's that are in our memory, to look for any thing we would call to mind, we do not put all the Images into a disorderly floating, and so make a Chaos of confusion there, where the exactest Order is required: And indeed according
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53288:13"/>
to this account, I cannot see but that our Memories would be more confused than our Dreams: and I can as easily conceive how an heap of Ants can be kept to regular and uniform Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> attempts another way; there is nothing in us, according to this Philosopher, but <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion:</hi> All <hi>Sense</hi> is <hi>Reaction</hi> in <hi>Matter</hi> [<hi>Leviath.</hi> Chap. 1.] the <hi>decay</hi> of that <hi>Motion,</hi> and <hi>Reaction,</hi> is <hi>Imagination;</hi> [Chap. 2.] And <hi>Memory</hi> is the same thing, <hi>expressing that decay.</hi> [<hi>Ib.</hi>] So that according to <hi>M. H.</hi> all our <hi>Perceptions</hi> are <hi>Motions,</hi> and so is <hi>Memory:</hi> Concerning which, I observe but two things;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Neither the <hi>Brain,</hi> nor <hi>Spirits,</hi> nor any other <hi>material</hi> Substance within the Head, can for any considerable time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Motion. The <hi>Brain</hi> is such a <hi>clammy</hi> Consistence, that it can no more retain it than a <hi>Quagmire;</hi> The <hi>Spirits</hi> are more <hi>liquid</hi> than the Air, which receives every Motion, and loseth it as soon: And if there were any <hi>other corporeal</hi> part in us, as fitly temper'd to keep Motion as could be wisht; yet (2.) the <hi>Motions</hi> made in it would be quickly <hi>deadned</hi> by <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Motions;</hi> and so we should never remember any thing, longer than till the next Impression: and it is utterly impossible that so many Motions should orderly succeed one another, as things do in our Memories; For they must needs, ever and anon, thwart, interfere, and obstruct one another, and so there would be nothing in our Memories, but Confusion and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole we see, that this seemingly plain Faculty, the <hi>Memory,</hi> is a Riddle also which we have not yet found the way to resolve.</p>
            <p>I might now add many other difficulties, concerning the <hi>Vnderstanding, Fancy, Will,</hi> and <hi>Affections:</hi> But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies that concern <hi>these,</hi> are so hotly managed by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Sohools, and so voluminously handled by disputing Men, that I shall not need insist on them: The only Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties about the <hi>Will,</hi> its <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>following</hi> the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> &amp;c. have confounded those that have enquired into it; and shewn us little else, but that our Minds are as <hi>blind,</hi> as that <hi>Faculty</hi> is said to be by most Philosophers. These Controversies, like some Rivers, the further they run, the

more they are hid: And perhaps after all our Speculations and Disputes, we conceive less of them now, than did the more plain, and simple Understandings of former times. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we comprehend or not, is not my present business to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, since I have confined my self to an Account of some great Mysteries, that do not make such a noise in the World: And having spoken of some that relate to our <hi>Souls;</hi> I come now to some others that concern</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>BODIES:</hi> I begin with our <hi>Own;</hi> which though we <hi>see,</hi> and <hi>feel,</hi> and have them <hi>nearest</hi> to us, yet their inward Constitution and Frame, is hitherto an undiscovered Region: And the saying of the Kingly Prophet, that <hi>we are wonderfully made,</hi> may well be understood of that <hi>admiration,</hi> that is the Daughter of Ignorance.</p>
            <p>For, 1. There hath no good account been yet given, how our <hi>Bodies</hi> are <hi>formed:</hi> That there is <hi>Art</hi> in the contrivance of them, cannot be denied, even by those that are least beholden to Nature: and so elegant is their composure, that this very Consideration saved <hi>Galen</hi> from being an <hi>Atheist:</hi> And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that the branded <hi>Epicurus, Lucretius</hi> and their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows were in earnest, when they resolv'd this Composition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>fortuitous range of Atoms:</hi> 'Twere much less absurd to suppose, or say, that a Watch, or other curious <hi>Automaton,</hi> did perform divers <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> Motions, by <hi>chance;</hi> than 'tis to affirm, or think, that this admirable <hi>Engine,</hi> an <hi>Humane Body,</hi> which hath so many Parts, and Motions, that <hi>orderly</hi> cooperate for the good of the whole, was framed without the Art of some knowing Agent: But who the skilful, particular <hi>Archeus</hi> should be; and by <hi>what</hi> Instruments, and <hi>Art</hi> this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick is erected, is still unknown. That God hath <hi>made us,</hi> and <hi>fashion'd</hi> our Bodies in <hi>the nethermost parts of the Earth,</hi> is undoubted; But he is the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>universal</hi> Cause, who transacts things in Nature by <hi>secondary</hi> Agents, and not by his own <hi>immediate hand:</hi> (The supposal of <hi>this</hi> would destroy <hi>all Philosophy,</hi> and enquiry after Causes) So that <hi>He</hi> is still <hi>supposed;</hi> but the Query is of the <hi>next,</hi> and <hi>particular Agent,</hi> that forms the Body in so exquisite a manner; a Question that hath not yet been answered. Indeed by some 'tis thought enough to say, That it is done by the <hi>Plastick Faculty;</hi> and by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53288:14"/>
others 'tis believ'd that the <hi>Soul</hi> is that that forms it. For the <hi>Plastick Faculty,</hi> 'tis a <hi>big word,</hi> but it conveys nothing to the Mind: For it signifies but <hi>this,</hi> that the Body is <hi>formed</hi> by a <hi>formative Power;</hi> that is, 'tis <hi>done,</hi> by a <hi>power of doing it.</hi> But the doubt remains still, what the <hi>Agent</hi> is that hath <hi>this power?</hi> The other Opinion of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> hath two Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: some will have it to be the particular Soul, that fashions its own Body; others suppose it to be the general Soul of the World: If the former be true, By what <hi>knowledg</hi> doth it do it? and <hi>how?</hi> The <hi>means,</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> are still <hi>occult,</hi> though that were granted. And for the <hi>other</hi> way, by a <hi>general Soul;</hi> That is an <hi>obscure</hi> Principle, of which we can know but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and how that acts (if we allow such a being) whether <hi>by knowledg,</hi> or <hi>without,</hi> the Assertors of it may find difficulty to determine. The former makes it little less than <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and the <hi>latter</hi> brings us back to <hi>Chance,</hi> or a <hi>Plastick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</hi> There remains now but one account more, and that is the <hi>Mechanical; viz.</hi> That it is done by <hi>meer Matter</hi> moved after <hi>such,</hi> or <hi>such</hi> a manner. Be that so: It will yet be said, that <hi>Matter</hi> cannot move <hi>it self;</hi> the question is still of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> The Motions are <hi>orderly,</hi> and <hi>regular;</hi> Query, <hi>Who guides? Blind Matter</hi> may produce an elegant effect for once, by a great Chance; as the Painter accidentally gave the Grace to his Picture, by throwing his Pencil in rage, and disorder upon it; But then <hi>constant</hi> Uniformities, and Determinations to a <hi>kind,</hi> can be <hi>no Results</hi> of <hi>unguided Motions.</hi> There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a <hi>Mechanical Hypothesis</hi> to this purpose; That the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Vegitables</hi> are formed out of <hi>such</hi> particles of Matter, as by reason of their Figures will not lie together, but in the order that is necessary to make <hi>such</hi> a Body; and in <hi>that</hi> they naturally concur, and rest; which seems to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the <hi>artificial Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> of which <hi>Chymists</hi> speak, and by the regular Figures of Salts, and <hi>Minerals;</hi> the <hi>hexagonal</hi> of <hi>Chrystal,</hi> the <hi>Hemi-spherical</hi> of the <hi>Fairy-Stone,</hi> and divers such like. And there is an experiment mentioned by approved Authors, that looks the same way; It is, That after a decoction of Herbs in a frosty Night, the shape of the Plants will appear under the Ice in the Morning: which Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are supposed to be made by the congregated <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>uvia</hi> of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53288:15"/>
Plants themselves, which loosly wandring up and down in the Water, at last settle in their natural place and order, and so make up an appearance of the Herbs from whence they were emitted. This account I confess hath something ingenious in it; But it is no solution of the Doubt. For how those <hi>hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogenous</hi> Atoms should hit into their proper places, in the midst of such various and tumultuary Motions, will still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a question: Let the <hi>aptness</hi> of their <hi>Figures</hi> be granted, we shall be yet to seek for something to <hi>guide</hi> their <hi>Motions:</hi> And let their <hi>natural Motion</hi> be what it will, <hi>gravity</hi> or <hi>levity, direct</hi> or <hi>oblique,</hi> we cannot conceive how <hi>that</hi> should carry them into every particular place where they are to lie; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering they must needs be sometimes diverted from their course by the occursion of many other Particles. And as for the <hi>Regular Figures</hi> of many <hi>inaminate</hi> Bodies, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration doth but <hi>multiply</hi> the doubt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi> is a thing as difficult as any of the former: There is no account that I know, hath yet appear'd worth considering, but <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Des-Cartes; viz.</hi> That they are <hi>united</hi> by <hi>juxta-position,</hi> and <hi>rest.</hi> And if this be all, Why should not a bag of Dust be of as firm a Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, as Marble or Adamant? Why may not a Bar of Iron be as easily broken as a pipe of Glass; and the Aegyptians <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids</hi> blown away, as soon as those <hi>inverst ones</hi> of smoke. The only reason of difference pretended by some, is, that the Parts of <hi>solid</hi> Bodies are held together by natural <hi>Hooks;</hi> and <hi>strong</hi> ones, by <hi>such</hi> Hooks as are more <hi>tough</hi> and <hi>firm:</hi> But how do the parts of these <hi>Hooks</hi> stick together? Either we must suppose <hi>infinite</hi> of them <hi>holding each other;</hi> or come at last to parts united by <hi>meer juxta-position,</hi> and <hi>rest.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is very absurd, for it will be necessary, That there should be <hi>some,</hi> upon which the <hi>Cohesion</hi> of <hi>all the rest</hi> should <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend;</hi> otherwise, all will be an heap of Dust. But in favour of the Hypothesis of <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> it may be said, That the <hi>closeness</hi> and <hi>compactness</hi> of the parts resting together, makes the <hi>strength</hi> of the <hi>Vnion:</hi> For, (as that <hi>Philosopher</hi> saith) <hi>Every thing continues in the state wherein it is, except something more powerful alter it;</hi> and therefore the Parts that rest close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether will so continue, till they are parted by some other stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53288:15"/>
Body: Now the <hi>more</hi> parts are pent together, the <hi>more</hi> able they will be for <hi>resistance;</hi> and what hath best <hi>compactness,</hi> and by consequence <hi>fewer parts,</hi> will not be able to make any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in a Body that hath <hi>more.</hi> According to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, what is <hi>most dense,</hi> and <hi>least porous,</hi> will be <hi>most</hi> cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and <hi>least</hi> discerpible; which yet is contrary to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For we find the most <hi>porous, spongy</hi> Bodies, to be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the most <hi>tough</hi> of Consistence. We easily break a Tube of Glass or Chrystal; when one of Elm, or Ash, will hardly be torn in pieces: and yet as the <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>former</hi> are <hi>more,</hi> so are they more at <hi>rest;</hi> since the <hi>liquid</hi> Juice diffused through the Wood is in continual agitation, which in <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his <hi>Philosophy</hi> is the cause of <hi>fluidity;</hi> so that according to his Principles, the <hi>dryest</hi> Bodies should be the most <hi>firm;</hi> when on the contrary, we find that a <hi>proportionate humidity</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes much to the <hi>strength</hi> of the <hi>Vnion.</hi> (Sir <hi>K. Digby</hi> makes it the <hi>Cement</hi> it self) and the <hi>driness</hi> of many Bodies is the cause of their <hi>fragility,</hi> as we see 'tis in <hi>Wood,</hi> and <hi>Glass,</hi> and divers other Things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are as much at a loss about the <hi>composition</hi> of <hi>Bodies,</hi> whether it be out of <hi>Indivisibles,</hi> or out of parts always divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: For though this question hath been attempted by the subtilest Wits of all Philosophick Ages; yet after all their <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,</hi> and <hi>shifts,</hi> their new-invented words, and <hi>modes,</hi> their <hi>niceties</hi> and tricks of <hi>subtilty,</hi> the Matter stands yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolv'd. For do what they can, <hi>Actual, Infinite extension every where; Equality</hi> of all <hi>Bodies, Impossibility</hi> of <hi>Motion,</hi> and a world more of the most palpable Absurdities, will press the Assertors of <hi>Infinite Divisibility:</hi> Nor on the other side, can it be avoided, but that all <hi>Motions</hi> would be equal in <hi>velocity:</hi> That the <hi>Lines</hi> drawn from side to side in a <hi>Pyramid,</hi> would have <hi>more Parts</hi> than the <hi>Basis:</hi> That <hi>all Bodies</hi> would be <hi>swallowed</hi> up in a <hi>Point;</hi> and many other Inconsistencies will follow the Opinion of <hi>Indivisibles.</hi> But because I have confined my self to the Difficulties that are not so usually no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; I shall not insist on <hi>these,</hi> but refer the Reader, that hath the humour, and leisure, to inquire into such Speculations, to <hi>Oviedo, Pontius, Ariaga, Carelton,</hi> and other Jesuites, whose management of this Controversie, with equal force on either
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53288:16"/>
side, is a considerable Argument of the unaccountableness of this Theory, and of the weakness of our present Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.</p>
            <p>I might now take into consideration the Mysteries of <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Gravity, Light, Colours, Vision, Sounds,</hi> and infinite such like, (things <hi>obvious,</hi> yet <hi>unknown</hi>) but I insist no further on Instances, but descend to the second thing I propounded to treat of, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>CAVSES</hi> of our <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and Mistakes; And in them we shall find further evidence of the imperfection of our Knowledg. The Causes to be consider'd, are either, 1. The <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Depth</hi> of <hi>Science:</hi> Or, 2. The <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent temper of our Faculties.</hi> Science is the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of things in their <hi>Causes;</hi> and so 'tis defined by the Pretenders to it. Let us now enquire a little into the difficulties of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Knowledg.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We know no Causes by <hi>Simple Intuition,</hi> but by <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> and <hi>Deduction;</hi> and there is nothing we so usually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from, as <hi>Concomitancy;</hi> for instance, We <hi>always</hi> feel <hi>heat</hi> when we come near the <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>still</hi> perceive <hi>Light</hi> when we see the <hi>Sun;</hi> and thence we conclude, that these are the Causes respectively of <hi>Heat,</hi> and <hi>Light;</hi> and so in other things. But now in this way of inference there lies great uncertainty: For if we had never seen more Sun, or Stars, than we do in cloudy weather, and if the Day had always broke with a Wind, which had increast and abated with the Light; we should have believed firmly that one of them had been the cause of the other; and so Smoke had been undoubtedly thought the efficient of the Heat, if nothing else had appeared with it. But the Philosophy of <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> furnisheth us with a better Instance; All the World takes the Sun to be the Cause of Day, from this Principle of Concomitance: But that Philosopher teacheth, That Light is caused by the <hi>Conamen,</hi> or endeavour of the Matter of the Vortex to recede from the Centre of its Motion; so that were there <hi>none</hi> of <hi>that fluid Aether</hi> in the midst of our World, that makes up the <hi>Sun,</hi> yet the <hi>pressure</hi> of the <hi>Globuli</hi> (as he calls those Particles) upon our Eyes, would not be considerably less: and so according to this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, there would be <hi>Light</hi> though there were no <hi>Sun,</hi> or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53288:16"/>
               <hi>Stars;</hi> and <hi>Evening,</hi> and <hi>Morning</hi> might <hi>naturally</hi> be <hi>before,</hi> and <hi>without the Sun.</hi> Now I say not that this Opinion is true and certain; but 'tis <hi>possible,</hi> and I know no absurdity in it; and consequently, our concluding a <hi>Causality</hi> from <hi>Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitancy, here,</hi> and in <hi>other</hi> Instances may deceive us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our <hi>best natural</hi> Knowledg is <hi>imperfect,</hi> in that, after all our confidence, <hi>Things still are possible to be otherwise: Our Demonstrations</hi> are raised upon <hi>Principles</hi> of our <hi>own,</hi> not of <hi>Vniversal</hi> Nature; And, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> notes, we judg from the <hi>analogy</hi> of our <hi>selves, not the Vniverse:</hi> Now many things are <hi>certain,</hi> according to the <hi>Principles</hi> of one Man, that are <hi>absurd</hi> in the apprehensions of many others: and some appear <hi>impossible</hi> to the <hi>vulgar,</hi> that are <hi>easie</hi> to Men of more improved Understandings. That is extravagant in one Philosophy, which is a plain truth in another: and perhaps what is most impossible in the apprehensions of Men; may be otherwise in the <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> and <hi>Physiology</hi> of Angels. The sum is, We conclude <hi>this</hi> to be <hi>certain,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> to be <hi>impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> from our own narrow Principles, and little Scheams of Opinion. And the <hi>best Principles</hi> of <hi>natural</hi> Knowledg in the World, are but <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> which <hi>may be,</hi> and <hi>may be otherwise:</hi> So that though we may <hi>conclude</hi> many things upon such and such Suppositions, yet still our Knowledg will be but fair, and hopeful <hi>Conjecture:</hi> And therefore we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that things are <hi>this</hi> way, or <hi>that,</hi> according to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy that we have espoused; but we strangely forget our selves when we plead a <hi>necessity</hi> of their being so in Nature, and an <hi>impossibility</hi> of their being otherwise. The <hi>ways</hi> of God in <hi>Nature</hi> (as <hi>in Providence</hi>) are not as <hi>ours</hi> are: Nor are the Models that we frame any way commensurate to the vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and profundity of his Works; which have a <hi>depth</hi> in them greater than the <hi>Well</hi> of <hi>Democritus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We cannot properly and perfectly know any thing in Nature without the knowledg of its <hi>first Causes,</hi> and the Springs of Natural Motions: And who hath any pretence to <hi>this?</hi> Who can say he hath seen Nature in its <hi>beginnings?</hi> We know nothing but <hi>Effects,</hi> nor can we judg at their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Causes, but by proportion to the things that do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; which no doubt are very <hi>unlike</hi> the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53288:17"/>
We see there is no resemblance between the <hi>Seed,</hi> and the <hi>Herb,</hi> and the <hi>Flowre;</hi> between the <hi>Sperm,</hi> and the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal;</hi> The <hi>Egg,</hi> and the <hi>Bird</hi> that is hatcht of it; And since there is so much <hi>dissimilitude</hi> between <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> in these <hi>apparent</hi> things, we cannot think there is <hi>less</hi> between them and their <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>invisible</hi> Efficients: Now had not our Senses assured us of it, we should never have suspected that <hi>Plants,</hi> or <hi>Animals</hi> did proceed from such <hi>unlikely Originals;</hi> never have imagined, that <hi>such Effects</hi> should have come from <hi>such Causes,</hi> and we can conceive as little now of the nature and quality of the Causes that are beyond the prospect of our Senses: We may frame Fancies and Conjectures of them, but to say that the <hi>Principles</hi> of Nature are <hi>just</hi> as <hi>our Philosophy</hi> makes them, is to set bounds to Omnipotence, and to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe infinite Power, and Wisdom, by our narrow Thoughts and Opinions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Every thing in Nature hath <hi>relation</hi> to divers others; so that no one Being can be perfectly known without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of many more: Yea, every thing almost hath relation to all things; and therefore he that talks of <hi>strict Science,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to a kind of <hi>Omniscience.</hi> All things are linkt together; and every Motion depends upon many prerequired Motors; so that no one can be perfectly known singly. We cannot (for instance) comprehend the cause of any Motion in a Watch, unless we are acquainted with other dependent Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and have insight into the whole mechanical contexture of it; and we know not the most contemptible Plant that grows in any perfection, and exactness, until we understand those other things that have relation to it; that is, almost every thing in Nature. So that each Science borrows from all the rest, and we attain not any single one, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the whole Circle of Knowledg.</p>
            <p>I might say much more on this Subject, but I may have further occasion of speaking to it, under the <hi>second</hi> General, <hi>viz.</hi> The Consideration</p>
            <p n="2">II. Of the Imperfection of our present Faculties; and the malign Influence our <hi>Senses</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> have upon our Minds. I begin with the <hi>SENSES;</hi> and shall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53288:17"/>
1. Of their <hi>Dulness;</hi> and 2. of their <hi>liableness</hi> to <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> and <hi>Mistake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Our <hi>Senses</hi> are very <hi>scant</hi> and <hi>limited;</hi> and the <hi>Operations</hi> of Nature <hi>subtil,</hi> and <hi>various.</hi> They are only its <hi>grosser</hi> Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ways of working that are <hi>sensible;</hi> the <hi>finer</hi> Threads, and <hi>immediate</hi> Actions are out of reach; Yea, it's <hi>greatest</hi> works are perform'd by <hi>invisible, insensible</hi> Agents.</p>
            <p>Now most of our <hi>Conceptions</hi> are taken from the <hi>Senses,</hi> and we can scarce judg of any thing but by the help of <hi>material</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, that are <hi>thence</hi> convey'd to us. The <hi>Senses</hi> are the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>natural</hi> Knowledg; and the <hi>surest</hi> and <hi>best Philosophy</hi> is to be raised from the <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> as <hi>they</hi> present them to us: when we leave <hi>these,</hi> and retire to the <hi>abstracted notions</hi> of our minds, we build Castles in the Air, and form <hi>Chymerical Worlds,</hi> that have <hi>nothing real</hi> in them. And yet when we take our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts from those <hi>best</hi> Informers, we can learn but very little from their Discoveries. For we see but the <hi>shadows,</hi> and <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides</hi> of things; like the men in <hi>Plato's</hi> Den, who saw but the <hi>Images</hi> of external Objects, and but <hi>so many</hi> as came in through the narrow entrance of their Cave. The <hi>World</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> no doubt, is an other thing, than the <hi>World</hi> of <hi>Sense</hi> is; and we can judg but little of its <hi>amplitude</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> by the imperfect Idea we have of it. From this narrowness of our Senses it is, that we have been so long ignorant of a World of Animals that are with us, and about us, which now at last the <hi>Glasses,</hi> that in part cure this imperfection, have discover'd; and no doubt, there is yet a great variety of living Creatures that our <hi>best</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments are <hi>too gross</hi> to disclose: There is <hi>Prodigious fineness,</hi> and <hi>subtilty</hi> in the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> which are too <hi>thin</hi> for our <hi>Senses,</hi> with all the advantages Art can lend them: And many, the greatest, and the best of its Objects are so <hi>remote</hi> that our Senses reach them not by any <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Artificial</hi> helps: So that we cannot have <hi>other</hi> than <hi>short</hi> and <hi>confufed</hi> apprehensions of those works of Nature: And I sometimes fear, that we scarce yet see any thing as it is. But this belongs to an other consideration, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Senses</hi> extremely <hi>deceive us</hi> in their <hi>reports,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations; I mean, they give occasion to our minds to deceive themselves. <hi>They</hi> indeed represent things <hi>truely</hi> as they <hi>appear</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:53288:18"/>
to <hi>them,</hi> and in <hi>that</hi> there is <hi>no deception;</hi> but then, we <hi>judge</hi> the <hi>exterior Realities</hi> to be <hi>according</hi> to those <hi>appearances,</hi> and <hi>here</hi> is the Error and Mistake. But because the <hi>Senses</hi> afford the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>occasion,</hi> and we naturally judg according to <hi>their</hi> impressions, therefore the <hi>Fallacies</hi> and <hi>Deceits</hi> are imputed to <hi>their misinformations.</hi> This I premise, to prevent a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical mistake, but shall retain the common way of speaking, and call <hi>those</hi> the <hi>errors</hi> of the <hi>Senses.</hi> That <hi>these</hi> very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently misreport things to us, we are assured even from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: a <hi>straight</hi> stick seems <hi>crooked</hi> in the <hi>Water,</hi> and a <hi>square</hi> Towre <hi>round</hi> at a <hi>distance;</hi> All things are <hi>Yellow</hi> to those that have the <hi>Jaundice,</hi> and all Meats are <hi>bitter</hi> to the <hi>disaffected</hi> Palate: To which vulgar Instances it will presently be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, that the Senses in those cases, are not in their <hi>just cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances;</hi> but want the fit <hi>medium,</hi> due <hi>distance,</hi> and <hi>sound disposition:</hi> which we know very well, and learn there was somewhat amiss; because our Senses represent those things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise at othertimes: we see the stick is <hi>straight</hi> when it is <hi>out</hi> of the Water; and the Tower is <hi>square</hi> when we are <hi>near</hi> it. Objects have <hi>other Colours,</hi> and Meats <hi>other tastes,</hi> when the Body, and its Senses are in their usual temper. In such cases, <hi>Sense</hi> rectifies its own mistakes, and many times one the errors of another; but if it did not do so, we should have been <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes deceived even</hi> in <hi>those</hi> Instances: and there is no doubt, but that there are many other <hi>like deceptions,</hi> in which we have no contrary evidence from them to disabuse us; not in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of common Life, but in things of <hi>remoter speculation,</hi> which this state seems not to be made for. The Senses must have their due <hi>medium,</hi> and <hi>distance,</hi> and <hi>temper;</hi> if any of <hi>these</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, they represent their Objects <hi>otherwise</hi> to us than they <hi>are:</hi> Now <hi>these,</hi> we may suppose they generally have, in the <hi>necessary</hi> matters of Life, if not to report things to us as they are in themselves, yet to give them us <hi>so,</hi> as may be for our accommodation, and advantage: But how are we assur'd, that they are <hi>thus rightly disposed,</hi> in reference to things of <hi>Speculative</hi> Knowledg? What <hi>medium,</hi> what <hi>distance,</hi> what <hi>temper</hi> is necessary to convey Objects to us just <hi>so,</hi> as they are in the <hi>realities</hi> of Nature? I observ'd before that our Senses are <hi>short, imperfect,</hi> and uncommensurate to the vastness and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53288:18"/>
profundity of things, and therefore cannot receive the <hi>just</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of them: and yet we judg all things according to those <hi>confused,</hi> and <hi>imperfect Idaeas,</hi> which must needs lead us into infinite errors, and mistakes.</p>
            <p>If I would play the <hi>Sceptick</hi> here, I might add, That no one can be sure that any Objects appear in the same manner to the Senses of other men, as they do to his: Yea, it may seem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that they <hi>do not?</hi> For though the <hi>Images, Motions,</hi> (or whatever else is the cause of Sence) may be <hi>alike</hi> as from them; yet the <hi>representations</hi> may be much varied according to the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>recipient:</hi> we find things look other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to us through an <hi>Optick</hi> Tube, then they do when we view them at a distance with our <hi>naked</hi> eyes: the same Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject appears <hi>red,</hi> when we look at it through a Glass of <hi>that</hi> Colour, but <hi>green</hi> when we behold it through one of <hi>such</hi> a Tincture. Things seem <hi>otherwise</hi> when the Eye is <hi>distorted,</hi> then they do, when it is in its <hi>natural, ordinary,</hi> posture; and some <hi>extraordinary alterations</hi> in the Brain <hi>double that</hi> to us, which is but a <hi>single</hi> Object: Colours are <hi>different,</hi> according to different <hi>Lights,</hi> and <hi>Positions;</hi> as 'tis in the necks of Doves, and folds of Scarlet: Thus <hi>difference</hi> in <hi>circumstances alters</hi> the <hi>sensation;</hi> and why may we not suppose as <hi>much diversity</hi> in the Senses of <hi>several</hi> men, as there is in those <hi>accidents,</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of <hi>one?</hi> There is <hi>difference</hi> in the <hi>Organs</hi> of Sense, and <hi>more</hi> in the <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>configuration</hi> of the <hi>inward</hi> parts of the Brain, by which motions are convey'd to the seat of Sense; in the <hi>Nerves, Humours</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> in respect of <hi>tenuity, liquidity, apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> for <hi>motion,</hi> and divers other circumstances of their nature; from which it seems that great diversity doth arise in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of receiving the <hi>Images,</hi> and consequently in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of their Objects. So then, though every man knows, <hi>how</hi> things appear to <hi>himself,</hi> yet <hi>what</hi> impressions they make upon the so <hi>different</hi> Senses of another, <hi>he only knows</hi> certainly, that is <hi>conscious</hi> to them And though all men agree to call the <hi>impression</hi> they feel from <hi>such,</hi> or <hi>such</hi> an Object, by the <hi>same</hi> name; yet no one can assuredly tell but that the <hi>Sentiment</hi> may be <hi>different;</hi> It may be one man hath the impression of <hi>Green</hi> from <hi>that,</hi> which in another begets the Sense of <hi>Yellow;</hi> and yet they both call it <hi>Green,</hi> because from their infancy they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53288:19"/>
were wont to join <hi>that</hi> word to <hi>that</hi> Sentiment, which such an Object produc'd in their <hi>particular</hi> Sense; though in <hi>several</hi> men it were a very divers one. <hi>This</hi> I know some will think hard to be understood; but I cannot help that: Those that <hi>Consider</hi> will find it to be very plain; and therefore I shall spend no more words about it.</p>
            <p>The Sum is, Our Senses are good Judges of <hi>Appearances,</hi> as they concern us: but how things <hi>are</hi> in themselves, and how they <hi>are</hi> to others, it should seem, we cannot <hi>certainly</hi> learn from them: And therefore when we determine that they <hi>are,</hi> and <hi>must</hi> be according to the representations of our <hi>individual</hi> Senses, we are very often grosly deceiv'd in such sentences; to which yet we are exceeding prone; and few but the most exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised minds, can avoid them. Of this I'le give a <hi>great</hi> Instance or two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is almost <hi>universally</hi> believ'd (at least by the vulgar,) that the <hi>Earth rests</hi> on the <hi>Centre</hi> of the World; and those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philosophers have been extreamly hooted at, and derided, that have taught the contrary doctrine: For my part, I shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm nothing of the main question; but this I say, That the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon inducement to believe it stands still, viz, the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> is no argument of it: And whether the opinion of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Copernicus, Des-Cartes, Galilaeo,</hi> and almost all late Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, of the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> be <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>false;</hi> the belief of its <hi>Rest,</hi> as far as it ariseth from the <hi>presum'd evidence</hi> of <hi>Sence,</hi> is an error.</p>
            <p>That there is some common motion that makes the day, and night and the varieties of seasons, is very plain and sensible; but whether the <hi>Earth,</hi> or the <hi>Sun</hi> be the Body mov'd, none of our Senses can determine; To <hi>Sense</hi> the <hi>Sun stands still</hi> also; <hi>and no</hi> Eye can perceive its <hi>Actual</hi> motion. For though we find, that in a little time it hath <hi>chang'd</hi> its <hi>Position,</hi> and <hi>respect</hi> to us; yet whether <hi>that change</hi> be caus'd by <hi>its translation</hi> from <hi>us,</hi> or <hi>ours</hi> from <hi>it,</hi> the <hi>Sense</hi> can never tell: and yet from <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> only, the greatest part of mankind believes its motion. On the other side, The standing still of the <hi>Earth</hi> is concluded the <hi>same</hi> way; and yet, though it did move, it would appear <hi>fixt</hi> to us as <hi>now</hi> it doth, since we are carried with it, in a <hi>regular</hi> and most <hi>even</hi> course, in which case <hi>motion</hi> is not <hi>perceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d;</hi> as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53288:19"/>
we find sometimes in sailing in a Ship, when the <hi>Shores</hi> feem to <hi>move,</hi> and not <hi>that;—Littus, Campi<expan>

                  </expan> recedunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I give another Instance of a like deception; It is, 2. The <hi>translation of our own passions</hi> to <hi>things without us:</hi> as we judg <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi> to be <hi>formally</hi> in the <hi>Sun, Fire,</hi> and <hi>Air;</hi> when as indeed they are but <hi>our own perceptions.</hi> As they are in those external Subjects, they are nothing, but <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such configurations and motions</hi> in matter; but when they <hi>work</hi> on <hi>us,</hi> they produce different <hi>sentiments,</hi> which we call <hi>Heat,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> &amp;c. This will appear to be true to any one that can <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>attentively</hi> consider it; and yet it will be thought so strange and absurd by the generality of men, that they will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon believe with <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> that <hi>Snow is black,</hi> as him that affirms, that the <hi>Fire</hi> is not <hi>formally hot;</hi> that is, that the <hi>very thing</hi> we <hi>feel,</hi> and call <hi>Heat</hi> in our selves, is not <hi>so</hi> in <hi>that body:</hi> when as <hi>there,</hi> it is but a <hi>violent agitation</hi> of the <hi>subtile,</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> parts of matter, that in it self is nothing <hi>like</hi> what we perceive from it, and call <hi>Heat:</hi> That we are <hi>hot</hi> our selves, we <hi>feel;</hi> but that the <hi>Fire</hi> hath any such <hi>formal</hi> quality as is in our Sense, <hi>no Sense</hi> can inform us; and yet from its supposed evidence men generally <hi>so</hi> conclude. Which is an other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Instance of the <hi>false</hi> judgments we make on the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Senses.</p>
            <p>And now, It is not only <hi>common</hi> understandings that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, and deceiv'd by their Senses; but even the most advanc'd Reasons are many times missed by them: And since we live the Life of <hi>Beasts</hi> before we grow up to Men, and our minds are <hi>Passive</hi> to the impressions of Sense, it cannot be, that our first knowledg should be other, than heaps of Errour, and misconception; which might be rectified by our <hi>after-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> but that 'tis another unhappiness of our natures, that those early impressions stick by us, and we are exeedingly apt pertinaciously to adhere to them: And though our improving understandings do in part undeceive us, and destroy some <hi>gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> errours; yet <hi>others</hi> are so fastned, that they are never after remov'd, or dissetled. So that we are not quite weaned from our <hi>Child-hood</hi> till we return to our <hi>second Infancy,</hi> and even our Grey-Heads out-grow not those errors, which we learnt before the Alphabet. And therefore since we contracted so
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53288:20"/>
many prejudices in our tender years, and those Errors have as plausible an appearance, as the most genuine truths, the best way to attain true Knowledg is to <hi>suspend</hi> the giving our confirm'd assent to those Receptions, till we have looked them over by an impartial inquiry; To reckon of them all as false, or uncertain, till we have examin'd them by a <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>unpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest</hi> Reason; and to admit nothing but what we <hi>clearly,</hi> and <hi>distinctly perceive.</hi> This is the great <hi>Rule,</hi> in the excellent Method of <hi>Des-Cartes;</hi> but the practise of it requires such a <hi>clear, sedate</hi> and <hi>intent</hi> mind, as is to be found but in a very few rare tempers; and even in <hi>them, prejudices</hi> will creep in, and spoil the <hi>perfection</hi> of their <hi>Knowledg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might discourse next of those Errors that do arise from the <hi>fallacies</hi> of our <hi>Imaginations,</hi> whose unwarrantable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and <hi>applications,</hi> do very frequently abuse us: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the <hi>Reason</hi> of the greatest part of mankind is nothing else but <hi>various Imagination;</hi> Yea, 'tis a hard matter for the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>freest</hi> minds to deliver themselves from the <hi>Prejudices,</hi> of Phancy; which, besides the numerous lesser Errors they betray us into, are great occasions (particularly) of those many mistakes we are guilty of in speculating <hi>Immaterial</hi> Natures, &amp; inquiring into the <hi>Attributes</hi> of God; and we are much entangled, and puzled by them, in all things we think, or say about <hi>Infinity, Eternity</hi> and <hi>Immensity,</hi> and most other of the sublime Theories both of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> or <hi>Theology.</hi> But <hi>these</hi> all arise, either from the <hi>false Images</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> and the undue compositions, and wrong inferences that we raise from them; and therefore I shall not need make <hi>this</hi> a distinct head from the other, of which I have just treated.</p>
            <p>I come now, II. To consider the evil Influence our <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> have over our Understandings, by which they are great Reasons of our <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Mistakes. Periit Judicium ubi res transiit in affectum.</hi> That <hi>Jupiter</hi> himself can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>Wise,</hi> and in <hi>Love,</hi> was a saying of the Ancients, and may be understood in a larger Sense then They meant. <hi>That</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>only</hi> is capable of passing a just Sentence, that is, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith of the <hi>Law,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; but where the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> have the casting voice, the cause of Truth is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53288:20"/>
Now this is the present unhappy state of Man; our <hi>lower</hi> powers are gotten <hi>uppermost,</hi> and we see like Men <hi>on their Heads,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> observ'd of old, <hi>That on the right hand, which indeed is on the left.</hi> The <hi>Woman</hi> in us still prosecutes a deceipt like <hi>that</hi> begun in the Garden; and we are wedded to an <hi>Eve,</hi> as fatal as the Mother of ous Miseries. The <hi>Deceiver</hi> soon found this soft place in <hi>Adam,</hi> and Innocency it self did not secure him from <hi>this</hi> way of seduction: We now scarce see any thing but through our passions, that are wholly blind, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable: So that the Monsters that story relates to have their <hi>Eyes</hi> in their <hi>Breasts,</hi> are pictures of us in our <hi>invisible selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, all things being double-handed, and having <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances</hi> both of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Falshood,</hi> the ingaged affection magnifieth the <hi>shews of Truth,</hi> and makes the belov'd opinion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as <hi>certain;</hi> while the <hi>considerations</hi> on the <hi>otherside</hi> being <hi>lessened</hi> and neglected, seem as nothing, though they are never so <hi>weighty</hi> and considerable. But I shall be more particular in the account of these Deceptions.</p>
            <p>Our Affections ingage us, by our <hi>love</hi> to <hi>our selves,</hi> or <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> the former in the Instance of, 1. <hi>Natural disposition,</hi> 2. <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Education,</hi> and 3. <hi>Interest:</hi> the latter, in our over-fond <hi>Reverence</hi> to 4. <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a certain <hi>congruity</hi> of <hi>some</hi> opinions to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular tempers of some men: For there is a <hi>complexion,</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament</hi> in the <hi>mind,</hi> as well as in the <hi>body:</hi> And the doctrines that are suited to the genius, and special disposition of the understanding, find easy welcom, and entertainment: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, <hi>those</hi> that are <hi>opposite</hi> to it, are rejected with an invincible contempt and hatred. On this account we find men taking in some particular Opinions with strange pleasure and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, upon their first proposals; when they are incurably barred up against others, that have the advantage of more reason to recommend them. And I have observ'd often, that even some Theories in Philosophy will not lie in some minds, that are otherwise very capable and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: of which I take this to be a considerable Instance, That divers learned men profess, They cannot conceive a <hi>Spirit</hi> (or any being) without <hi>extension;</hi> whereas others say, They cannot conceive, but that whatever is <hi>extended</hi> is <hi>impenetrable,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53288:21"/>
and consequently <hi>corporeal;</hi> which diversity I think, I have reason to ascribe to some difference in the natural temper of the mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But another very fatal occasion of our mistakes, is the great prejudice of <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Education:</hi> which is so unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily prevalent, that though the Soul were never so truly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as the Philosopher call'd it) an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written table in it self; yet this doth very often so scribble on it, as to render it incapable of other impressions: we judg all things by those <hi>Anticipations;</hi> and condemn, or applaud them, as they differ, or agree, with our first Opinions. 'Tis on this account that almost every Country censures the <hi>Laws, Customs,</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>every other,</hi> as <hi>absurd,</hi> and <hi>unreasonable,</hi> and are confirm'd in their <hi>own</hi> follies beyond possibility of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. Our first Age is like the melted wax to the prepared Seal, that receives any impression; and we suck in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Clime and Country, as we do the common Air, without thought, or choice; and which is worse, we usually sit down under those Prejudices of Education and Custom all our Lives after: For either we are loth to trouble our selves to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Doctrines we have long taken for granted, or we are scar'd from inquiring into the things that Custom and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Belief have made Venerable and Sacred. We are taught to think, with the <hi>Hermit,</hi> that the <hi>Sun</hi> shines no were but in our Cells, and that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> are confin'd within that Belief, in which we were first instructed. From whence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract an obstinate adherence to the conceits in which we were bred, and a resolv'd contempt of all other Doctrines: So that what <hi>Astrologers</hi> say of our <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and the events of common life, may as well be said of the opinions of the most, that they are written in their Stars, having as little freedom in them as the effects of Destiny. And since the <hi>Infusions</hi> of <hi>Education</hi> have such interest in us, are so often appeal'd to as the dictates of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> Reason; 'tis no wonder we are so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deceiv'd, and are so imperfect in our Knowledg. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other cause of which is,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The power that <hi>Interest</hi> hath over our Affections, and by them over our <hi>Judgments.</hi> When men are ingag'd by <hi>this,</hi> they can find Truth <hi>any where;</hi> and what is <hi>thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53288:21"/>
to be true, will at last be <hi>believed</hi> to <hi>be so Facilè credimus quod volumus.</hi> So that I do not think, that the learned As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors of vain, and false Religions, and Opinions, do always profess against their Consciences; rather their Interest brings their Consciences to their Profession; for this doth not only corrupt Mens Practise, but very often pervert their Minds also, and insensibly mislead them into Errours.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But our <hi>Affections</hi> misguide us by the respect we have to <hi>others,</hi> as well as by that we bear to our selves: I mentioned The Instances of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> We look with a superstitious Reverence upon the accounts of past Ages, and with a supercilious Severity on the more deserving products of our own: a vanity that hath possest all times as well as ours; and the <hi>golden</hi> Age was <hi>never present.</hi> For as an inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Weight by vertue of it's distance from the Centre of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance will out-weigh much heavier bodies that are nearer to it; so the most light, and vain things that are far off from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age, have more Esteem, and Veneration then the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, and substantial that bear a modern date: and we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>that</hi> nothing worth, that is not fetcht from a far off; in which we very often deceive our selves as that Mariner did, that brought home his Ship Fraught with common Pebbles from the Indies. We adhere to the Determinations of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as if their Opinions were <hi>entail'd</hi> on us; and our Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were <hi>ex-Traduce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus while every Age is but an <hi>other shew</hi> of the <hi>former,</hi> 'tis no wonder that humane science is <hi>no more</hi> advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it's <hi>ancient</hi> Stature: For while we look on some admired Authors as the Oracles of all Knowledg, and spend that time, and those pains in the Study and Defence of their Doctrines, which should have been imploy'd in the search of Truth, and Nature; we must needs stint our own Improvements and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Advancement of Science Since while we are Slaves to the Opinions of those before us. Our Discoveries, like water will not rise higher then their Fountains; and while we think it such Presumption to endeavour beyond the <hi>Ancients,</hi> we fall short of <hi>Genuine Antiquity,</hi> Truth: unless we suppose them to have reach't perfection of Knowledg in spight of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of Ignorance.</p>
            <p>

And now whereas it is observ'd, that the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> and <hi>Mechanick</hi> Arts have considerably advanc'd, and got the start of other Sciences; this may be considered as a chief cause of it, That their Progress hath not been retarded by this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential awe of former Discoveries: 'Twas never an Heresie to out-limn <hi>Apelles,</hi> or to out-work the <hi>Obelisks: Galilaeu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>'Tis true, we owe much reverence to the Ancients, and many thanks to them for their Helps and Discoveries; but <hi>implicitly</hi> and <hi>servilely</hi> to submit our Judgments to all Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is inconsistent with that respect that we <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to have to the <hi>freedom</hi> of our our own <hi>Minds,</hi> and the <hi>dignity</hi> of <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> And indeed (as the great Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath observ'd) we have a wrong apprehension of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> which in the common acception is but the <hi>nonage</hi> of the World. <hi>Antiquitas seculi est juventus M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53288:22"/>
elder Philosophers, of any that ever had that Name: And therefore there is the less reason why Men should make his Writing <hi>Textuary,</hi> and as it were <hi>infallible,</hi> without daring to use the liberty that he taught by his practice.</p>
            <p>It was from this servile humour of idolizing some fortunate and fam'd Authors, that arose that silly vanity of <hi>impertinent Citations,</hi> and alledging <hi>Authorities</hi> in things, that neither require nor deserve them. The Man, no doubt, thought the saying to be Learning, and an Elegancy, <hi>That Men have Beards, and that Women have none;</hi> when he had quoted <hi>Beza</hi> for it: and that other aim'd to be accounted no mean Clerk, that could say, <hi>Pax res bona est,</hi> saith St. <hi>Austin:</hi> This folly, as ridiculous as it is, was once very common among those that courted the reputation of being Learned; and it is not quite worn out of use yet among the Vulgar of Scholars, though all the wiser have outgrown, and do despise it; And the rest will do the same, when they come to consider, how vain and inglorious it is, to have our Heads and Books laden, as Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Campeius</hi> his Mules were, with old and useless Luggage. And if the magnificence of many Pretenders to Knowledg were laid open, it would amount to no more, than the old Boots and Shooes of that proud and expos'd Ambassadour. Methinks it is but a poor easie Knowledg that can be learnt from an Index; and a mean ambition to be rich in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of an others Treasure. <hi>Authorities</hi> alone make no <hi>number,</hi> unless evidence of Reason stand before them, and all the <hi>Ciphers</hi> of <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> are no better than a <hi>single no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I return to the consideration of <hi>Antiquity:</hi> If we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially look into the <hi>Remains</hi> of <hi>ancient</hi> days, we shall find but little to justifie our so slavish a veneration of them: For if we take an account of the state of Science from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and follow the History of it through the most famous Times, we shall find, that though it hath often changed its Channel, removing from one Nation to another; yet it hath been neither much <hi>improved,</hi> nor <hi>altred,</hi> but as Rivers arc in passing through different Countries, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod:</hi> For the succeding Times subscribing to, and copying out those that went before them, with little more than verbal
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53288:23"/>
Diversity, Knowledg hath still been <hi>really</hi> the same poor and mean Thing, though it hath appeared in pompous Cloathing, and been dignified by the services of many great and renowned Names. The <hi>Grecian</hi> Learning was but a Transcript of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> and <hi>Aegyptian;</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> of the <hi>Grecian.</hi> And though those former Days had, no doubt, many great Wits, and <hi>those</hi> that made noble Discoveries; yet we have reason to think that the most considerable and most worthy of them, have perisht and are forgotten. For as the forementioned great Man, the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath observ'd, <hi>Time,</hi> as a <hi>River,</hi> brings down to us what is more <hi>light</hi> and <hi>superficial,</hi> while the Things that are more <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>substantial</hi> are sunk and lost.</p>
            <p>And now after <hi>all this,</hi> it will be requisite for me to add, That I intend not these Remarques in favour of any <hi>new</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits in <hi>Theology,</hi> to gain credit to <hi>such</hi> by disparaging Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Antiquity: No, <hi>Here</hi> the <hi>old</hi> Paths are undoubtedly <hi>best, quod verum id prius:</hi> And I put as much difference between the pretended <hi>New Lights,</hi> and <hi>Old Truths,</hi> as I do between the <hi>Sun</hi> and an evanid <hi>Meteor:</hi> Though I confess in <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> I am a <hi>Seeker. Divine Truths</hi> were most pure in their <hi>Beginnings;</hi> they were born in the <hi>fulness</hi> of time; and, (as some say the Sun was Created) in their <hi>Meridian</hi> Strength and Lustre: But the <hi>Beginnings</hi> of <hi>Philosophy</hi> were in a very <hi>obscure Dawn,</hi> and perhaps 'tis yet <hi>scarce Morning</hi> with it. And therefore what we cannot find among former Inquirers, we are to seek in the Attempts of more <hi>Modern Men,</hi> and in the Improvements of nearer Ages: And not be discouraged by the Old Law, <hi>Nil dictum quod non dictum prius.</hi> For as to <hi>Knowledg,</hi> there is no doubt but there are many things <hi>new</hi> under the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> Age hath shewn many <hi>Novelties</hi> even in the Heavens above, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I have thus shewn thee How our <hi>Senses</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead our Understandings, and so are great occasions of our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Errors; to which I may add,</p>
            <p n="3">III. That the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> more immediately contributes to <hi>its own</hi> Deceptions, through its <hi>Precipitancy,</hi> and <hi>hast</hi> in <hi>concluding. Truth</hi> is not to be attained, without much <hi>close</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:53288:23"/>
and <hi>severe</hi> inquiry: It is not a <hi>wide Superficies,</hi> easie to be seen, but like a <hi>Point</hi> or <hi>Line</hi> that requires <hi>Acutness</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> to discover it; which is the more difficult, because it is so mingled with <hi>Appearances</hi> and <hi>specious</hi> Errors, like the <hi>Silver</hi> in <hi>Hiero</hi>'s Crown of Gold; or rather like the Grains of <hi>Gold</hi> in a <hi>Mass</hi> of <hi>baser</hi> Mettals; It requires much <hi>Care,</hi> and <hi>nice Observation</hi> to extract and separate the <hi>precious Oar</hi> from so much <hi>vile Mixture;</hi> so that the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> must be <hi>patient,</hi> and <hi>wary,</hi> and <hi>thoughtful</hi> in seeking Truth; It must go step by step, and look every way, and regard many Things: It must distrust Appearances, and be shy of Assent, and consider again and again before it fixeth. This Method is necessary to the attainment of Knowledg; but the <hi>Mind</hi> is <hi>generally</hi> indisposed to so much Labour and Caution. It is <hi>impatient</hi> of <hi>suspence,</hi> and <hi>precipitant</hi> in concluding; <hi>averse</hi> to <hi>deep</hi> Meditation, and ready to <hi>catch</hi> at every <hi>Appearance:</hi> And hence also it is that we embrace Shadows of Fancy and Opinion, and miss of true and substantial Knowledg.</p>
            <p>Having now given <hi>Instances</hi> of the <hi>Imperfection</hi> of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Knowledg, and shewn some of its Causes, which are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence of it; I come to offer a few Considerations on the whole, against <hi>Dogmatizing,</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> in uncertain Opinions. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Confidence</hi> in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and Matters of <hi>Doubtful Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation</hi> betrays a grosser, and more stupid sort of <hi>Ignorance;</hi> For 'tis the first step of Knowledg to be sensible that we want it: The most exercised Understandings are most conscious to their Imperfections; and he that is sensible of the frequent failings of his Judgment, will not lean with much trust, and assurance on that which hath so often deceived him, nor build the Castle of his <hi>intellectual</hi> Security in the Air of Opinions: But on the other side, the shallow, unthinking Vulgar, are sure of all things, and bestow their <hi>peremtory, full</hi> assent on every slight appearance. <hi>Knowledg</hi> is always <hi>modest</hi> and <hi>wary;</hi> but <hi>Ignorance</hi> is <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>presuming,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath observ'd of the <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>forwardness</hi> of Youth. Thus those that have always liv'd at home, and have never seen any <hi>other</hi> Country, are confidently perswaded that their <hi>own</hi> is the <hi>best;</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:53288:24"/>
whereas they that have travel'd, and observ'd other Places, speak more coldly and indifferently of their native Soils; and so those confined Understandings that never looked beyond the Opinions in which they were bred, are excedingly assur'd of the Truth, and comparative excellency of their own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; when as the <hi>larger</hi> Minds that have travail'd the divers Climates of Opinions, and consider'd the various Sentiments of inquiring Men, are more <hi>cautious</hi> in their <hi>Conclusions,</hi> and more <hi>sparing</hi> in <hi>positive</hi> Affirmations. And if the Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist could be perswaded to weigh the <hi>Appearances</hi> of Truth and Reason, that are in many other Opinions that he counts <hi>unreasonable</hi> and <hi>absurd,</hi> this would be a means to <hi>allay,</hi> if not to <hi>cure</hi> his Confidence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Dogmatizing</hi> in things uncertain, doth commonly inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit with <hi>untained Passions,</hi> and is usually maintain'd upon the <hi>obstinacy</hi> of an <hi>ungover'd</hi> Spirit. For one of the first Rules in the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Self-Government,</hi> is, to be <hi>modest</hi> in Opinions: And <hi>this Wisdom</hi> makes Men <hi>considerate</hi> and <hi>wary,</hi> distrustful of their own Powers, and jealous of their Thoughts: He that would <hi>rule</hi> himself, must be <hi>circumspect</hi> in his Actions; and he that would be <hi>so,</hi> must not be <hi>hasty,</hi> and over-confident in his Conclusions. 'Tis <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Presumption</hi> of ones self that causeth such forwardness and assurance; and where those <hi>reign,</hi> there is neither <hi>Vertue</hi> nor <hi>Reason;</hi> No <hi>regular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but a miserable <hi>Tyranny</hi> of <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Self-will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Confidence</hi> in Opinions, is the great disturber both of our <hi>own Peace,</hi> and of the <hi>quiet</hi> of other Men. He that <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms</hi> any thing <hi>boldly,</hi> is thereby ingaged against every one that opposeth it; He is <hi>concern'd,</hi> and <hi>undertakes</hi> for his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and must <hi>fight</hi> his way: He confronts every different Judgment, and quarrels all Dissenters; He is angry that others do not see <hi>that,</hi> which he presumes is so clear; he clamours and feviles; He is still <hi>ditrating,</hi> and still in a storm: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear a <hi>Contraction,</hi> nor scarce a <hi>Suspence</hi> of Judgment. So that his Peace is at every ones Mercy, and whoever will cross his saying, throws him into the Fire, and destroys his Quiet: And such a Man need not be more miserable. On this account the <hi>Stoicks</hi> affected an <hi>indifferency</hi> and <hi>neutrality</hi> in all Things, as the only means to that <hi>freedom</hi> from <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Disturbance,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:53288:24"/>
which they sought: and if there be any repose attainable by the Methods of Reason, there is nothing so like to afford it, as <hi>unconcernment</hi> in doubtful Opinions. The <hi>contrary</hi> Zeal and assurance, as it robs every Man of his <hi>private</hi> happiness, so hath it destroyed the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Mankind:</hi> It hath made the World an <hi>Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed us. Every vain <hi>Opiniator</hi> is as much <hi>assured</hi> as if he were <hi>infallible;</hi> His Opinions are <hi>Truths, certain Truths, Fundamental</hi> Ones; and the <hi>contrary</hi> Doctrines <hi>Heretical</hi> and <hi>Abominable.</hi> Hence arise <hi>Disputes, Hatreds, Separations, Wars,</hi> of which we have seen, and yet see very much; and God knows how much more we may: Of all which Mischiefs here is the Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> Mens <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions</hi> of the <hi>certainty</hi> of their <hi>own Conceits</hi> and <hi>Ways:</hi> and could they but be induced to be <hi>modest</hi> in them, and to look on them with the eye of less assurance, it would abate their <hi>Heats</hi> and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Confidence</hi> in <hi>Opinions</hi> is <hi>ill Manners,</hi> and an affront to all that differ from us; For the Dogmatist chargeth every one with <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi> that subscribes not his Saying. In effect, he gives the lie to whosoever dares dissent from him; and declares that his Judgment is fittest to be the <hi>Intellectual</hi> Standard. This is that Spirit of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Rudeness,</hi> that faith to every different Apprehender, <hi>Stand off,</hi> I am more <hi>Orthodox</hi> than thou art; a Vanity that is worse than any simple Error.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Dogmatizing,</hi> and Confidence in doubtful Tenents, holds the Opiniator fast in his Misconceits and Errors. For he that is confident of all things, is unavoidably deceiv'd in most; and he that <hi>assures</hi> himself he <hi>never</hi> errs, will always err: His Presumptions will defeat all attempts of better Information. We never seek for <hi>that</hi> which we think we <hi>have already,</hi> but reject those Aids that make promise and offer of it. And he that huggs <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Falshood,</hi> in the confidence of undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53288:25"/>
that should rectifie his Judgment. <hi>Ignorance</hi> is far foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cured, than <hi>false conceit</hi> of <hi>Knowledg:</hi> and he was a very wise Man that said, <hi>There is more hope of a Fool, than of him that is wise in his own Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Dogmatizing shews <hi>Poverty,</hi> and <hi>narrowness</hi> of Spirit: There is no greater <hi>Vassallage,</hi> than that of being enslaved to Opinions. The <hi>Dogmatist</hi> is pent up in his Prison, and sees no Light but what comes in at those Grates. He hath no <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> of <hi>Thoughts,</hi> no <hi>prospect</hi> of various <hi>Objects:</hi> while the <hi>considerate</hi> and <hi>modest</hi> Inquirer, hath a <hi>large</hi> Sphere of Motion, and the satisfaction of more <hi>open</hi> Light; He sees <hi>far,</hi> and injoys the pleasure of surveying the <hi>divers</hi> Images of the Mind. But the <hi>Opiniator</hi> hath a <hi>poor shrivel'd</hi> Soul, that will but just hold his little Set of Thoughts: His Appetite after Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, is satisfied with his few <hi>Mushromes,</hi> and neither knows nor thinks of any thing beyond his Cottage and his Rags.</p>
            <p>I might say a great deal more to the shame of this folly, but what I have writ will be <hi>enough</hi> for the Capable and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious; and much <hi>less</hi> would have been <hi>too much</hi> for others.</p>
            <p>And now when I look back upon the main Subject of these Papers, it appears so <hi>vast</hi> to my Thoughts, that me-thinks I have drawn but a <hi>Cockle-shell</hi> of Water from the <hi>Ocean:</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I look upon, within the <hi>Amplitude</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> is evidence of Humane <hi>Ignorance:</hi> For all things are a <hi>great Darkness</hi> to us, and we are <hi>so</hi> to our selves: The <hi>plainest</hi> things are as <hi>obscure,</hi> as the most <hi>confessedly mysterious;</hi> and the <hi>Plants</hi> we tread on are as much <hi>above</hi> us, as the <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens:</hi> The things that <hi>touch</hi> us, are as <hi>distant</hi> from us as the <hi>Poles,</hi> and we are as much <hi>Strangers</hi> to <hi>our selves,</hi> as to the People of the <hi>Indies.</hi> On review of which, me-thinks I could begin anew to represent the <hi>imperfection</hi> of our <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> and the <hi>vanity</hi> of <hi>bold Opinions,</hi> which the Dogmatists themselves <hi>demonstrate,</hi> while each Disputer is <hi>confident,</hi> that the <hi>others confidence</hi> is vain, from which a third, with more reason, may conclude the <hi>same</hi> of the confidence of <hi>both:</hi> And one would think there should need no more to bring those assured Men to modest Acknowledgments, and more becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Temper than <hi>this,</hi> That there is nothing about which the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53288:25"/>
Reason of Man is capable of being employed, but hath been the Subject of <hi>Dispute,</hi> and <hi>diverse</hi> apprehension: So that the Lord <hi>Montaigne</hi> hath observ'd, <hi>Mankind is agreed in nothing, no not in this, That the Heavens are over us;</hi> Every Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most differs from another, yea and every Man from himself; and yet every one is assured of his own <hi>Schemes</hi> of conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, though he cannot hold that Assurance but by this <hi>proud</hi> Absurdity, That <hi>he alone is in the right, and all the rest of the World mistaken.</hi> I say then, there being so much to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced both from the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> World, to the <hi>shame</hi> of <hi>boasting Ignorance;</hi> I cannot reckon of what I have said but as an <hi>imperfect</hi> Offer at a Subject, to which I could not do right, without discoursing all Things: On which account I had resolv'd once to suffer this Trifle to pass out of Print and Memory: But then considering, that the <hi>Instances</hi> I had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of humane <hi>Ignorance</hi> were not only <hi>clear</hi> ones, but <hi>such</hi> also as are not <hi>ordinarily</hi> suspected; from whence to our short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in other things, 'tis an easie Inference; I was thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to think it might be useful to promote that temper of Mind that is necessary to true Philosophy and right Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>

               <p>I Here send you a Supplement to the former Essay. About two years after my <hi>Vanity</hi> of <hi>Dogmatizing</hi> was first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there appeared a Book written in Latin against it, which had this Title, <hi>SCIRI, sive scepties &amp; scepticorum a jure Disputationis exclusio.</hi> The Author was that Learned Man, who hath publisht so many Writings, and is so highly celebrated by Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby;</hi> especially famous for his Tract <hi>de Mundo:</hi> He calls himself sometimes <hi>Thomas ex Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biis East Saxonum;</hi> in other Writings, and particularly in <hi>this, Thomas Albius:</hi> His English Name is <hi>Thomas White,</hi> a Roman Catholick, and famed Writer for that Church, though cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured for some of his Doctrines at <hi>Rome.</hi> I writ a civil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to his Book, which was annext to the <hi>Vanity of Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,</hi> reprinted 1665.</p>
               <p>That Answer was in English, because the Discourse it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended was so; and I did not think the Matter worth the Universal Language: Besides, I was induced to reply in that

Tongue, by the Example of a Noble Philosopher, one of the great Ornaments of his Age, and Nation, who had then newly answer'd a Latin Book, written by one <hi>Linus</hi> against him, in English. About the same time that my Reply was printed, his <hi>SCIRI</hi> came forth again in our Language, whether translated by himself, or any Disciple of his, I do not know; The Title was, <hi>An Exclusion of Scepticks from all title to Dispute: being an Answer to the Vanity of Dogmatizing: by Tho. VVhite.</hi> Now because there was nothing of Reply in that new Edition of his Book, I thought to have concerned my self no more about it: but having made you a promise of some Notes concerning <hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>Certainty,</hi> I have thought fit to treat of those Matters by way of further Answer to that Learned Man.</p>
               <p>He principally insists on three things. (1.) The Charge of <hi>Scepticism.</hi> (2.) The Accountableness of those Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Difficulties I have mention'd, as things <hi>not yet resolv'd.</hi> And, (3.) The Defence of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for which I stand ingag'd to you; and the <hi>second</hi> belongs to it, and will be a very seasonable, if not necessary Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Essay against <hi>Confidence in Philosophy.</hi> But for the <hi>third,</hi> I shall refer you to what I have said in my other Answer, and in my Letter concerning <hi>Aristotle;</hi> being not willing to meddle any further in Affairs of that nature.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The charge of <hi>Scepticism</hi> seems to be the main thing: For, besides that it makes up the Title, the Author hath been pleas'd to write a solemn Warning to the Youth of the Universities, on the occasion of my Book, which he calls <hi>Vleus Glanvillanum,</hi> in the first page of his Preface; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares this pretended <hi>Scepticism</hi> of mine to be the occasion of his ingagement, in the first paragraph of his Discourse.</p>
               <p>Now because a great and celebrated Philosopher, with whom I am not fit to be nam'd, is brought in as the Reviver of this deadly Scepticism, which I am supposed to endeavour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance after him; I shall repeat the whole Passage, that I may the better vindicate both him and my self against this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; and treat a little of this so common Imputation, which is almost every where alledg'd against all <hi>Free Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:53288:28"/>
who dare think or say any thing that <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath not taught. The Learned Man Objects thus, <hi>p.</hi> 1.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scepticism</hi> born of old by an unlucky miscarriage of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for her own credit carried off the Tongues of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, where it had long been foster'd and buried by the steadiness of Christian Faith; this Monster snatcht from the Teeth of Worms, and Insects, <hi>Peter Gassendus,</hi> a Man of a most piercing Sagacity, of neat and copious Eloquence, of most pleasing behaviour and wonderful diligence, by a kind of Magick, hath endeavour'd to restore again to Life. He, a Person (which is the strangest of all) most tenacious of Catholick Faith, and never suspected guilty of mischievous Tenents: whereas, yet, this scepticism is the Mother of infinite Errors, and all Heresies, and that very <hi>seducing Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and vain Fallacy</hi> which the Saints warned by the Apostles have taught us to beware of. Her this Man, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise eminent, in his paradoxical Exercitations against the Aristotelians, hath dared to expose, not vailed as before, and wandring like a Quean in the dark, but bold-fac'd, and painted, to the Multitude, and Market place.</p>
                  <p>By his example, the Author of the <hi>Vanity</hi> of <hi>Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,</hi> hath produc'd her amongst us, beauteously trickt up, in English: He too a great Master of Wit and Eloquence; nor indeed are vast Mischiefs to be dreaded from vulgar Heads. <hi>This is the occasion of my undertaking.—</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>This is the Charge; but the severe imputation is sweetned by many very kind words of commendation, which are most justly due to the renowned <hi>Gassendus,</hi> but given <hi>gratis,</hi> and undeservedly to the Author of the Vanity of Dogmatizing. In answer to this charge, I shall set down my Thoughts of <hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>Certainty,</hi> Subjects well worth considering.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53288:29"/>
his <hi>Philosophy</hi> was worse than his <hi>Painting.</hi> He seems to me, according to the account we have of him, to have been a gross and humoursome Fanatick; especially if that be true that is related by <hi>Laertius,</hi> That he shun'd and heeded nothing, and would not step aside out of the way for Waggons, Precipices, or Dogs, so that he was follow'd and look'd after like an Ideot, and a Child, then whom his Actions were more stupid: Besides which testimony, we have a worse character of him from <hi>Aristocles,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—, <hi>viz.</hi> That he neither inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor writ any thing that was good, but railed both at Gods and Men. And yet it should seem, by the honour his Country did him, that he was not so very a Sot as some thought, and as divers Passages in the Story of his Life speak him: For he was made High Priest, and great Immunities and Priviledges given to Philosophers for his sake. But I have nothing to do with the Story of his Life: His Disciples were many, the most eminent of them reckon'd by <hi>Laertius;</hi> but none hath left so exact an account in writing of the <hi>Sceptick Doctrines,</hi> (if they may be so call'd) as <hi>Sextus Empiricus,</hi> one much later than those Sectators of <hi>Pyrrho.</hi> The chief ground of <hi>Scepticism</hi> he saith, is this, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, That every reason hath an equal one opposite to it: So that they gave no assent to any thing. They allow'd <hi>Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,</hi> but would not grant, that things <hi>really</hi> are in themselves as they appear to our Senses: or that we can by our Reasons judg any thing truly, and certainly of them: That there is nothing <hi>fair</hi> or <hi>foul, just</hi> or <hi>unjust,</hi> nothing <hi>true</hi> or <hi>real</hi> in any thing; as <hi>Laertius</hi> speaks of the belief of <hi>Pyrrho.</hi> And therefore their Phrases were, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53288:29"/>
of things: and <hi>Cicero</hi> in <hi>Licullus</hi> saith thus of <hi>Empedocles; Empedocles, ut interdum mihi furere videatur, abstrusa esse om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, nihil nos sentire, nihil cernere, nihil omnino quale sit posse reperire. Sextus Empiricus</hi> mentions divers others, who it seems were thought to be <hi>Scepticks,</hi> or very near them; as <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> because he taught that Contraries are in the same thing: <hi>Democritus,</hi> for denying Hony to be sweet or bitter: The <hi>Syrenaick</hi> Sect, holding that only the Affections are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended: <hi>Protagoras,</hi> for making the Phaenomena <hi>particular</hi> to every single Person. But all these he shews to have been <hi>Assertors,</hi> and very different from the <hi>Pyrrhonian</hi> Sect. He inquires also of the <hi>Academick</hi> Philosophy, how it agreed with, or disagreed from the <hi>Sceptick.</hi> These Philosophers were reputed anciently, and by some ever since thought to be too much addicted to that way. But <hi>Sextus</hi> clears them from it, beginning with <hi>Plato</hi> the Founder of the first School, of whom he saith, That though in his <hi>Gymnasticks,</hi> where <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> is brought in deriding the Sophists, he hath the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, uncertain Character; yet in declaring his Opinion, he was a <hi>Dogmatist;</hi> particularly in his Doctrines of <hi>Idaeas, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> the <hi>preference</hi> of a <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Vertue:</hi> Which if <hi>Plate</hi> assent to as existent, he affirms <hi>dogmatically;</hi> if as <hi>probable,</hi> he differs from the <hi>Sceptick,</hi> in preferring one Opinion before another. Those of the <hi>New Academy</hi> say all things are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible,</hi> in which, saith <hi>Sextus,</hi> they differ from us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they <hi>assert this;</hi> but we <hi>do not know</hi> but that they may be comprehended. They differ also in asserting Good, and Evils, and that some things are credible, others not; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> count all to be equal. To this purpose he speaks of them: But for the <hi>middle Academy</hi> founded by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesilaus</hi> he saith, that <hi>that</hi> Philosopher's <hi>Institution,</hi> and <hi>theirs</hi> were almost the same, in that <hi>Arcesilaus</hi> asserted nothing of the <hi>existence,</hi> or <hi>non-existence</hi> of things, not preferring one Opinion before another, but in all things <hi>suspending.</hi> Which he did to make tryal of his Discipl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> whether they were capable of the Doctrine of <hi>Plato,</hi> which he taught to his Friends.</p>
               <p>Thus that famous Sceptick doth honour to the memory of those Ancients, by endeavouring to take what he thought to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53288:30"/>
be credit from them, which indeed was ever a disgrace, and ought to be so esteemed still. For those <hi>Pyrrhonians,</hi> that were of the right strain, seem to me to have been a sort of <hi>concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Humorists,</hi> that took a pride in being singular, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting strange things; opposing all knowledg, that they might be thought to have the most, and to have found out that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>uncertainty,</hi> which others could not see far enough to descry. Which way of pretended Philosophy, as it gratified their pride, so it serv'd their malice and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature, which delights much in the Spirit of Contradiction, and contempt of other Men. This they shew'd in great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree according to <hi>Laertius,</hi> who saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; They accounted all Fools that were not of their own Party. So that they were in no wise to be reckon'd as Philosophers; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Aristocles</hi> speaks in <hi>Eusebius;</hi> For they pluckt up the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Philosophy by the Roots. And indeed their <hi>doubting</hi> and <hi>suspension</hi> was not in order to the forming a <hi>surer</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a resolution to sit down for ever in despair of Knowledg: And therefore they were very improperly call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Sookers,</hi> since their great Principle was, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was to be found. Upon the whole, it was not without cause that <hi>Cicero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>, Aristocles,</hi> and other sober Philosophers spoke of their way as down-right madness; and we have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe so of the Founder of the Sect, if that be true which is related by <hi>Laertius,</hi> and others, of his washing a Sow, and running into the <hi>Forum</hi> with a Spit of Meat in his hand after the Cook that had offended him; a thing very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming the Professor of the so much talk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>themselves;</hi> but I incline to think, that they were only <hi>humoursom,</hi> and <hi>conceited</hi> Fellows; rather than I will say that they were absolutely distracted.</p>
               <p>Thus you see I could revile against the <hi>Scepticks,</hi> as well as my Antagonist; but letting further censure of them pass, I might take notice on this occasion, what odd extravagant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have of old had the name of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> as if <hi>those</hi> Ages (as the Turks <hi>now</hi>) had a reverence for Madmen: For many of their Actions and Opinions were very wild freaks of Fancy and Humour, and would gain Men in these days (as foolish and bad as they are) no better name, than that of <hi>Lunaticks,</hi> or <hi>Bedlams.</hi> This will appear to any one that shall imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally survey the Histories of their Lives, if those Accounts were true that are given of them. But indeed there is reason enough to doubt <hi>that:</hi> For the Relations we have of old times are usually very <hi>fabulous</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> and where the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were concern'd as much as any where, for they had the same Character given them, that the Apostle bestows upon the <hi>Cretians; Graecia mendax.</hi> Which among other things shews, how little reason there is we should be superstitiously fond of the broken, dublous, imperfect Remains of those days. But methinks those Philosophers should be greater Men, than they were made in those Histories of their Lives and Doctrines, or else one may justly wonder how their Names come down to us with so much Renown and Glory. But to return to more particular Discourse of the <hi>Scepticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides Those anciently, that had <hi>that</hi> name without just ground sometimes affixt on them, several worthy <hi>Moderns</hi> have suffer'd under the imputation: and indeed by some all Men are accounted Scepticks, who dare dissent from the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelian</hi> Doctrines, and will not slavishly subscribe all the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of that <hi>Dictator</hi> in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which they esteem the only true and certain Foundations of Knowledg: This lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Man seems to be one of those, for the great <hi>Gassendus</hi> is charged with so much Scepticism on this account, that he writ an Exercitation against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> p. 2. and <hi>those that slight</hi> Aristotle's <hi>Grounds</hi> (saith our Author in his Preface to the Universities) <hi>must of necessity, being always in quest of Principles, ever fall short of Science. Aristotle</hi>'s Works it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53288:31"/>
seems are the infallibe <hi>Canon</hi> of Truth and Certainty; in him are hid all the Treasures of natural Wisdom and Knowledg; and there is no name given under Heaven, by which we can be saved from <hi>Scepticism,</hi> and everlasting <hi>uncertainty,</hi> but <hi>his.</hi> If this be <hi>so,</hi> all the <hi>modern Free</hi> Philosophers must be <hi>Scepticks,</hi> and there is no help: and the Author of the <hi>Vanity</hi> of <hi>Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing</hi> hath no way to <hi>escape</hi> the imputation; nor indeed, (if this be all) hath he any concern to avoid it. But the Learned Man may be remembred, that in one respect they are not <hi>Scepticks,</hi> being <hi>confident</hi> in this belief, that the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi> are not such <hi>Certainties,</hi> but that 'tis possible, succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mankind may sometime or other find error and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them; and discover (if it have not been done already) that they are not the infallible Measures of Truth and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Free Philosophers</hi> are by others accounted <hi>Scepticks</hi> from their way of enquiry, which is not to continue still po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon the Writings and Opinions of Philosophers, but to seek Truth in the Great Book of Nature; and in that search to proceed with wariness and circumspection without too much forwardness in establishing Maxims, and positive Doctrines: To propose their Opinions as <hi>Hypotheseis,</hi> that <hi>may probably</hi> be the true accounts, without peremptorily affirming that <hi>they are.</hi> This, among others, hath been the way of those Great Men, the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> and <hi>Des-Cartes;</hi> and is now the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> whose Motto is, <hi>Nut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in Verba.</hi> This is <hi>Scepticism</hi> with some; and if it be so indeed, 'tis such Scepticism, as is the only way to sure and grounded Knowledge, to which confidence in uncertain Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions is the most fatal Enemy. Nor doth the Learned Man accuse me of any more than <hi>this,</hi> in his Preface, in which he thus speaks. <q>I am not angry with the Man, who with a great deal of Wit, and an unfordable stream of Eloquence (<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive courtesie</hi>) which will ripen with his years, prosecutes what he proposeth to himself, and takes for a truth, not without some savour of modesty: For neither doth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from Faith the power of teaching its Tenents, nor disclaim all hopes of attaining Science hereafter through a laborious amasement of Experiments.</q>—Here I am ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53288:31"/>
from being a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> in the ill sense; For I neither derogate from Faith, nor despair of Science: and the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of those of that character are directly destructive of the one, and everlasting discouragements of the other. Or, if I should affirm that I despair of Science, strictly and properly so call'd, in the Affairs of Philosophy and Nature; If I should say, we are to expect no more from our Experiments and Inquiries, than great likelyhood, and such degrees of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, as might deserve an hopeful assent; yet thus much of diffidence and uncertainty would not make me a <hi>Sceptick;</hi> since <hi>They</hi> taught, That no one thing was <hi>more probable</hi> than an <hi>other;</hi> and so with-held assent from all things.</p>
               <p>So that upon the whole I cannot but wonder, that this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, who seems to be so concern'd for the advancement of Knowledg, should oppose me in a Design that hath the same end: only we differ in the Means and Method; For he thinks it is best promoted by perswading, that <hi>Science</hi> is not <hi>Vncertainty;</hi> and I suppose that Men need to be convinc'd, that <hi>Vncertainties</hi> are not <hi>Science.</hi> Now the progress of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg being stopt by extreme Confidence on the one hand, and Diffidence on the other; I think that both are necessary, though perhaps one is more seasonable: For to believe that every thing is certain, is as great a disinterest to Science, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that nothing is so: Opinion of Fulness being, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> notes, among the Causes of Want. So that after all, we differ but in this, That the Learned Man thinks it more sutable to the necessities of the present Age, to depress <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism;</hi> and it may be, I look on <hi>Dogmatizing,</hi> and confident Belief as the more dangerous and common Evil: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed between the Slaves of Superstition and Enthusiasm, Education and Interest, almost all the World are <hi>Dogmatists;</hi> while Scepticks are but some more desperate Renegado's, whose Intellects are either debauched by Vice, or turn'd out of the way by the unreasonable Confidence of vain Opiniators. In opposing whose Presumptions, I designed also against the neutrality of the Scepticks; and did not conceited Scioluts ascribe so much to their Opinions, there would be no need of <hi>SCIRI'S,</hi> or Perswasives to easie and peremptory Assents; which indeed have more need of Restraints than Incentives;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53288:32"/>
since 'tis the nature of Man to be far more apt to confide in his Conceptions, than to distrust them; and 'tis a question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any Scepticks in good earnest. So that I am so far from deserving Reproof from the Adversaries of Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Diffidence, that were there reason for either, I might expect Acknowledgments: For Confidence in Uncertainties is the greatest Enemy to what is certain; and were I a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> I would plead for <hi>Dogmatizing;</hi> the way to bring Men to stick to nothing, being confidently to perswade them to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all things. For among a multitude of things carelesly receiv'd, many will be false, and many doubtful: and consequently a mind not wholly stupid will some time or other find reason to distrust and reject some of its Opinions: Upon review of which, perceiving it imbraced Falshoods for great Certainties, and confided in them as much as in those it yet retains, it will be in great danger of staggering in the rest, and discarding all promiscuously: Whereas if a Man proportion the degree of his Assent, to the degree of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, being more sparing and reserv'd to the more difficult, and not throughly examin'd Theories, and confident only of those that are distinctly and clearly apprehended; he stands upon a firm bottom, and is not mov'd by the winds of Fancy and Humour, which blow up and down the conceited Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists: For the Assent that is difficultly obtain'd, and sparingly bestow'd, is better establish'd and fixt, than that which hath been easie and precipitant.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole Matter it appears, that this Learned Person had no cause to write against me as a <hi>Sceptick:</hi> And I some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the more wonder at it, because I find such things attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to those, he is pleas'd to call by that name, that no way agree with the Way and Spirit of those Philosophers, whose genius I recommend and desire to imitate: On which account I thought he had some other notion of Sceptick than was usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and casting mine eye over his late <hi>Purgation</hi> presented to the <hi>Cardinals</hi> of the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> I found that <hi>his Scepticks</hi> were some of the <hi>Modern, Peripatetical Disputers:</hi> These, it seems by their many complaints against his Writings, had obtain'd a general condemnation of them from the Pope and Consistory of Cardinals; whom therefore in his Appeal to the said Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53288:32"/>
he accuseth of Ignorance, Corruption of the <hi>Aristote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Doctrines, and Tendency to Heresie and Atheism: And that these are the Scepticks he means, appears from the Preface against me, and divers other Passages of his Book: So that 'tis yet more wonderful, that <hi>Gossendus,</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> of the Vanity of Dogmatizing, should be call'd by a Name, which he bestows upon those of so different a temper.</p>
               <p>And thus of that charge of <hi>Scepticism,</hi> with which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins as the occasion of his writing: Having premised which, he endeavours to lay the sure Foundations of Science, and to establish Certainty in Knowledg. But what-ever imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there are in that pretended demonstration, I shall not for the present take notice of them; but only observe, that this Gentleman is the Author of that <hi>Science, Demonstration,</hi> and <hi>Self evidence,</hi> of which <hi>M. Sargeant,</hi> a late controvertial Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Roman Church, makes such boasts of; and here are his Grounds: Which those learned Men, that are concern'd with him, may if they please, when they have nothing else to do, examine.</p>
               <p>Having said thus much of <hi>Scepticism,</hi> and the <hi>Scepticks,</hi> I shall enquire a little into the matter of <hi>Certainty,</hi> a subject of both difficulty and importance.</p>
               <p>It is taken either (1.) for a firm Assent to any thing, of which there is no reason of doubt; and this may be call'd <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable</hi> Certainty; or (2.) for an absolute Assurance, that things are as we conceive and affirm, and not possible to be otherwise, and this is <hi>Infallible</hi> Certainty.</p>
               <p>In the first of these <hi>Des Cartes</hi> lays his Foundations: I cannot doubt, but <hi>I think,</hi> though nothing should be as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; and there I cannot suspect neither, but that I <hi>my self, that think, am.</hi> I am as sure that I have Idaeas, and Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of other things without me, as of God, Heaven, Earth, &amp;c. Thus far that Philosopher is safe, and our Assent is sull; and it is so in this likewise, That <hi>we can compound,</hi> or disjoin those Images by affirming, and denying; and that we have a faculty of <hi>Reasoning,</hi> and inferring one thing from another: So much as this we clearly perceive, and seel in our selves, what-ever uncertainty there may be in other matters. To these we give a resolv'd and firm Assent, and we have not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53288:33"/>
the least reason of doubt here. Besides which Principles we find others in our minds that are more general, and are us'd and supposed by us in all our Affirmations and Reasonings, to which we assent as fully, such are these: <hi>Every thing is, or is not:</hi> A thing <hi>cannot be and not be, in the same respects: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath no Attributes: What we conceive to belong, or not to belong to any thing, we can affirm, or deny of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the Principles of all Propositions, and Ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatsoever: and we assent to them fully, as soon as we understand their meaning, to which I add this great one more, <hi>That our Faculties are true, viz.</hi> That what our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings declare of things <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>distinctly perceiv'd</hi> by us, is truly so, and agreeing with the realities of things themselves. This is a Principle that we <hi>believe</hi> firmly; but <hi>cannot prove,</hi> for all proof, and reasoning supposeth it: And therefore I think <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> is out in his method; when from the <hi>Idaea's</hi> he endeavours to prove that <hi>God is,</hi> and from <hi>his</hi> Existence that our <hi>Faculties are true:</hi> When as the <hi>truth</hi> of our <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> was presupposed to the proof of God's Existence; yea, and to that of our own also. So that, that great Man seems to argue in a Circle. But to let that pass; This we constantly assent to without doubting, That our Faculties do not always delude us, That they are not mere Impostors and Deceivers, but report things to us as they are, when they distinctly and clearly perceive them. And so this may be reckon'd one of the prime certain Principles, and the very Foundation of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in the first sense of it.</p>
               <p>These and such like Principles result out of the nature of our Minds: But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are other Certainties arising from the evidence of Sense: As, That there is <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> in the World: That Matter is <hi>extented divisible</hi> and <hi>impenetrable:</hi> That Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>direct,</hi> or <hi>oblique:</hi> That Matter, and Motion, are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of great variety of <hi>Modifications</hi> and <hi>Changes.</hi> We learn that <hi>these,</hi> and many other such things are so, from <hi>Sense,</hi> and we nothing doubt here; although the Theory and Speculative consideration of those Matters be full of difficulty, and seeming contradiction. In these our Assent is <hi>universal</hi> and <hi>indubitable:</hi> But in many particular cases, we are not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53288:33"/>
assured of the report of our Senses; yea, we dissent from, and correct their Informations, when they are not in their due Circumstances, of <hi>right Disposition, Medium, Distance,</hi> and the like: and when they pronounce upon things which they cannot judg of: on which account, though our Senses, and the Senses of Mankind do represent the Earth as <hi>quiescent:</hi> Yet we cannot from thence have assurance that it doth <hi>Rest,</hi> since Sense cannot judg of an even and regular Motion, when it self is carried with the movent; so that though it should be true that the Earth moves, yet to Sense it would appear to rest, as now it doth; as I have discours'd elsewhere. But when the Senses are exercised about their right Objects, and have the other Circumstances that are requisite, we then assent without doubting. And this fullness of assent is all the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty we have, or can pretend to; for after all, 'tis possible our Senses may be so contrived, that things may not appear to us as they are: But we fear not this, and the bare possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth not move us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are Certainties arising from the <hi>Testimony</hi> of others. This in ordinary cases is very doubtful, and fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but again in some it is <hi>indubitable.</hi> As when the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is general, both as to time and place uninteressed, full, plain, and constant, in matters of Sense and of easie Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg: In such circumstances as these, the evidence of Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is no more doubted, than the first Principles of Reason or Sense. Thus we believe, without the least scruple about it, That there are such places as <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and such Countries of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> though we never saw them; and many other Historical Matters, which our selves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew. The Foundation of which assurance is this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, That <hi>Mankind cannot be supposed to combine to deceive, in things, wherein they can have no design or interest to do it.</hi> Though the thing have a remote possibility, yet no Man in his Wits can believe it ever was, or will be so: and therefore we assent to such Testimonies with the same firmness, that we would to the clearest Demonstrations in the World.</p>
               <p>The second sence of Certainty is that, which I call'd <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty Infallible;</hi> when we are assured that 'tis impossible things should be otherwise, than we conceive and affirm of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53288:34"/>
them: This is a sort of Certainty, that humanely we cannot attain unto, for it may not be absolutely impossible, but that our Faculties may be so contrived, as always to deceive us in the things which we judg most certain and assured: This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we do not suspect, and we have no reason to do it; which shews that we are certain in the former Sense: But we may not say 'tis utterly impossible; and consequently we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the certainty of this latter sort: which perhaps is proper only to Him, who made all things what they are; and discerns their true natures by an infallible and most perfect knowledg.</p>
               <p>The sum of which is, that though we are certain of many things, yet that Certainty is no absolute Infallibility; there still remains the possibility of our being mistaken in all matters of humane Belief and Inquiry. But this bare possibility (as I said) moves us not, nor doth it in the least weaken our assent to those things, that we clearly and distinctly perceive: but we believe with as much firmness of assurance the Matters that our Faculties do so report to us, as if there were no such possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and of greater Certainty than this there is no need. It is enough for us, that we have such Principles lodged in our minds, that we cannot but assent to; and we find nothing to give us occasion to doubt of the truth of them.</p>
               <p>This is Humane Certainty, and let vain and affected Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks talk what they will, they cannot in earnest doubt of those first Principles which I have mention'd. They are universal, and believ'd by all Mankind; every one knows, every one useth them: For though they do not lie in the minds of all Men in the formality of such Propositions, yet they are <hi>implicitly</hi> there; and in the force and power of them every Man reasons, and acts also. These are the Seed of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and all the Conclusions (at never so great a distance) that are truly deduc'd from those first Certainties, are as true and certain as they are; and both together make up what we call <hi>Reason.</hi> So that this is not so various and giddy a thing as some vain inconsiderate Men talk; but 'tis one steady Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and the same all the World over. Fancies, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Humors, that mistaken Men call Reason, are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely divers, and fallacious; But those Principles and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53288:34"/>
that are clearly and distinctly perceiv'd by our minds; those that are immdiately lodg'd in them, and the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that truly arise from <hi>those,</hi> and the right informations of Sence, they are one, and certain, without variety or deceit. Now all Men partake of Reason in some degree (of the prime Principles at least, and the Faculty of deducing one thing from another); But the most use that little perversly, and to their own deception, arguing from prejudices of Sense, Imagination, and customary Tenents, and so filling up their minds with false and deceitful Images, instead of Truth and Reason. 'Tis the office and business of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> to teach Men the right use of their Faculties, in order to the extending and inlarging of their Reasons; and one principal Rule it gives is, To be wary and diffident, not to be hasty in our Conclusions, or over-confident of Opinions; but to be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our assent, and not to afford it but to things clearly and distinctly perceiv'd: And this was the aim and design of that Discourse, which this Learned Man accuseth as such a piece of Scepticism, and discouragement of Science.</p>
               <p>I have now said what I intended concerning the first thing, on which my Assailant insists, The <hi>charge of Scepticism,</hi> and I suppose I have sufficiently shewn the injustice of it.</p>
               <p>I proceed to the <hi>second</hi> main Business of his Book, which is to give an account of those <hi>difficulties</hi> which I have mention'd, as yet <hi>unresolv'd:</hi> Concerning those I affirm not, that they are impossible to be unridled, but that they have not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by any yet extant <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> a sad Argument of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual deficience, that after so much talk of Science and endeavour after Knowledg, we should be yet to seek, and that in those Matters which we have the greatest advantages to understand. But this learned Man thinks he can resolve them; and I have so great a kindness for any ingenious attempts of this sort, and so great a desire to be satisfied about those Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that I am ready to entertain any good probability that shall be offer'd, even by a prosest Antagonist; for Truth is welcome to me from any hand that brings it. I have therefore candidly, and impartially consider'd this Gentleman's Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but cannot satisfie my self with them. The Reasons of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53288:35"/>
my Dissatisfactions I shall now give in an examination of his Accounts.</p>
               <p>He takes occasion from my waving the difficulties of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netism,</hi> and the <hi>flux</hi> and <hi>reflux</hi> of the Sea, to give his solution of them, But I am not concern'd here, they are none of the things on which I insist, yea I professedly decline them; and intimate that these are better known, than less-acknowledg'd Mysteries; <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his Hypothes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But I shall not trouble my self to remarque on Matters, with which my Discourse hath nothing to do. My business is with the pretended Answers to the Difficulties I mention, as not well resolv'd by any yet known Hypothesis: On which the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Man enters, <hi>Plea</hi> 5th, and in order begins with those about the SOUL, in these words.</p>

'Tis notoriously known, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and his Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors held the Doctrine of <hi>Transmigration,</hi> which supposeth <hi>Preexistence,</hi> and both, that the Soul is a Substance, which can <hi>come,</hi> and be <hi>join'd to another thing.</hi> Some Pythagoreans write, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himself after 216 years <hi>Transanimation</hi> returned to Life again. Now this Opinion being so universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imputed to this Philosopher, and his School, I shall not need to insist on it as far as it concerns <hi>them:</hi> but I take notice, that both <hi>Jews, Persians, Indians, Arabians,</hi> and divers other Nations, &amp;c. did of old, and do still hold the same Doctrine.

                     </gap>en Israel</hi> ascribes the Opinion of <hi>Transmigration</hi> to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and the Cabalists teach, that every Soul is succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively join'd to three Bodies: So the same Soul they say, was in <hi>Adam, David,</hi> and the <hi>Messias;</hi> and the same in <hi>Seth, Shem,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> according to <hi>R. Simeon,</hi> who (as the Cabalists generally do) stops the course in the third Transmigration: as is noted from him by a Learned Man of our own. There are at this day great Sects among the Indians of the East, that retain this Doctrine of Transanimation, believing that the Souls of some descend again into Humane Bodies; but that others pass into the Bodies of Beasts: So did some of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Pythagoreans, who taught, that good Men returned to their former blessed and happy Life; but that the wicked in their first Transmigration chang'd their Sex; in the second they descended into Beasts: yea, some supposed them at last to go into Trees, and other Vegetables.</p>
               <p>Now all these committed the great Error in Philos phy, of which I am accused, in supposing the Soul to be a <hi>certain Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> which may <hi>directly be made, come, and be join'd to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing,</hi> and so, according to our Author, They could none of them <hi>discern the opposition of one and many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, (2.) This pretended important Error in Philosophy of the <hi>Soul's</hi> being <hi>a Thing,</hi> and <hi>Substance;</hi> and one <hi>distinct</hi> from the <hi>Body,</hi> must be held by all, that believe its <hi>natural Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality:</hi> for <hi>Separability</hi> is the greatest Argument of <hi>real distinction;</hi> especially <hi>that</hi> which the Schools call <hi>Mutual.</hi> Now the Soul's Immortality hath had a general Reception from the wiser and better part of Mankind: The <hi>Egyptians, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Indians, Jews, Greeks,</hi> and universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all that had a name for Wisdom among the Ancients, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it. And the same hath been the apprehension of latter Ages. A Councel of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self hath defin'd it, and recommended the demonstrating of it to all Christian Philosophers. And if the Soul lives after the dissolution of the Body, 'tis certainly a Substance distinct from it; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can subsist without it self: and real separability cannot consist with <hi>Identity</hi> and <hi>Indistinction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Mosaical</hi> Philosophy supposeth the Soul to be a Substance that <hi>can come,</hi> and <hi>be join'd to another:</hi> For
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53288:37"/>
it tells us, That God <hi>breathed into</hi> Adam's <hi>Nostrils the Breath of Life;</hi> by which generally is understood his infusing a Soul into him: And all the Arguments, that are alledg'd from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to prove its <hi>immediate Creation,</hi> do strongly conclude it to be a distinct Substance from the Body.</p>
               <p>And, (4.) The same Doctrine is more than once affirm'd by <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, for saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, It remains that the Mind (or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The Mind is <hi>separate,</hi> &amp;c. a thing apart from the Body. For elsewhere he saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The Operations of the Body do not communicate with its (the Soul's) Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. He calls it, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Subsistence;</hi> for supposing which I am reprehended by our Philosopher: And affirms further, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; The Mind is a Divine and Impassible Thing. It appears then from the Testimonies (and I could alledg more, if there were occasion) that <hi>Aristotle</hi> taught the real Distinction which I suppose, and so, according to our Author, is one of them that <hi>understands not the opposition of one and many.</hi> Yea,</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Our Philosopher's learned Friend and Admirer Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> is another, for that ingenious Gentleman af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in his <hi>Immortality,</hi> That the <hi>Soul is a Substance,</hi> and a <hi>Substance besides the Body:</hi> and almost all that Discourse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on that supposal.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) This Author himself affirms as much in his <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Institutions,</hi> as ever I suppos'd: For he saith, ['Tis most evident, that the Mind is something of another kind from <hi>Quantity</hi> and <hi>Matter;</hi> That 'tis a <hi>substantial Principle</hi> of Man, and <hi>no mode</hi> or <hi>determination</hi> of divisibility, and that there is nothing common to Body and Spirit]. Besides which in the fifth Book of the same Institutions he discourseth of the Soul's <hi>separation</hi> from the Body, and asserts it to be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that it perisheth not with it, because it hath Actions that belong not to a Body, but hath of it self the Nature of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and its power of Existence is not taken away, when the Body fails, the Soul being apart from, and besides it; and that matter is not necessary to the Soul's Existence: Many
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53288:37"/>
other Expressions there are in that Discourse to like purpose, which speak the Soul's <hi>Real Distinction</hi> from the Body, in as <hi>great variety</hi> of Phrase, as Diversity and Distinction can be spoken. But all this is forgotten, and now 'tis a <hi>most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Error in Philosophy</hi> to suppose the Soul to be a <hi>certain Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which may directly be made, come, and be join'd to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and of this <hi>none can doubt that understand the Opposition of one and many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think now by all this 'tis pretty clear, that my supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Soul's</hi> being <hi>a distinct Substance</hi> from the <hi>Body,</hi> is not peccant, except all the wiser World, both Ancient and Modern, have been mistaken, and our Author himself.</p>
               <p>But besides all, (2.) It seems to me evident even from the nature of the things, abstracting from Authority. And I think it appears,</p>

The former I suppose no Man in his wits will affirm, since then all our Conceptions will be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53288:38"/>
non-sense and confusion; Chance being the Cause of nothing that is orderly and regular: But if there be a knowledg in us of that directs the Motions that make every distinct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; I demand, concerning that Knowledg, whether it be in like manner directed by some other; or is it the Effect of mere Casual Motion? If the former, we must run up in <hi>infinitum</hi> in our inquiry; and the latter admits the alledg'd Absurdities. There is no way then of defending the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Souls being Matter, or any modification of it, but by affirming with Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> a certain connection between all our Thoughts, and a necessary fate in all things, which whoever affirms, will find Difficulties enough in his Assertion to bring him to mine, that there is a <hi>Vanity</hi> in <hi>Dogmatizing,</hi> and Confidence is unreasonable.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53288:40"/>
matter will be apprehended in the formation of living things?</q>
               </p>
               <p>You may remember Sir, that once, when you and I were talking of the wonderful discoveries of the <hi>Microscope,</hi> and the many compleat Animals it discloseth, which lay hid from our unaided sight, we fell thence into a discourse of the strange and incredible subtilty of Nature in forming so many distinct Parts, and Members, and Passages in those invisible Creatures; and of the grosness of our Senses in comparison of the fineness and tenuity of those works: I then made an offer to you of this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the <hi>Formation</hi> of <hi>Organical</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which I exprest to this effect: That <hi>the Seeds of things are certain, and are the things themselves in little: having all that is in the compleated Body in smallest and invisible parts; and so generation is but accretion, and growth to greater bulk and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence.</hi> To this purpose our Author here speaks; and the Hypothesis receives probability, and advantage from the late discoveries of the ingenious <hi>Malpeghius,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> in his Anatomy of Plants: Nor is it unlikely but that Vegetables are folded up in their Seeds; and that their Vegetation is only the expanding and unfolding of them. But in Animals the thing is of more difficult conception, since the immediate matter of many, if not of most, Generations is an <hi>homogeneous</hi> fluid. To which I know it will be said, that the <hi>organiz'd</hi> Body is in it, though it be so small as to be <hi>invisible:</hi> But it is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, that an invisible Atome of a Creature should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand it self into the vastness of a Whale or Elephant; or that the Original Bodies of those immense Creatures, should be undecernable by the acutest sight, when the <hi>seminal</hi> Body (if I may so call it) of very small Plants are plainly visible. And if this be so, that the Seed of Animals actually contains the formed Bodies of the Animals themselves, those little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies must either be supposed created by God, in the form and consistence in which they are, from the foundation of the World; or they are produc'd after, in an orderly course of Nature: If the former be said, some will be apt to ask, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this will not destroy all <hi>Philosophy,</hi> being so immediate a recourse to Creation, and the infinite Power of God? And the <hi>manner</hi> of those Formations is never the more intelligible
<pb facs="tcp:53288:40"/>
for being resolv'd into the immediate efficiency of incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible Power and Wisdom. But if they are produc'd in a <hi>natural</hi> way, we are then as much a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> a loss to find by what Agent, and what direction those Corpuscles are form'd, as we are to understand the way and manner of it in greater Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Or, be they produc'd how they will, by <hi>Creation,</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> yet still the Trouble and Doubts will be as many and great in the conception of their growth to their visible Bulk, which we call their Generation: For still must be a Director of the Matter by which each part is increast, that must sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, dispose, guide, and proportion it <hi>so,</hi> as that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>o part may exceed, none may want: and so the Queries, and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that concern the Generation of Organical Bodies, are unanswered notwithstanding this Hypothesis.</p>
               <p>Our Author's <hi>second</hi> Solution concerns only the <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>material</hi> Ingredients in the formation of Bodies, of which he pretends some account. But this is nothing at all to our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, which was to enquire after the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Direction</hi> of those various and methodical Motions that are requisite to the formation of an Animal, or other Organical Body. And the Chymical Processes, and Elementary Solutions of which he speaks <hi>p.</hi> 43. signifie no more to the Matter, than if a Man should answer an enquiry about the Art and Method of the Motions of a Watch, by saying, They are perform'd by Steel, Iron, Brass, or Silver, wherein the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is declar'd, but not the <hi>Artifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Learned Man comes next to the Solution of two diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties I propose about Matter, the <hi>Vnion</hi> of its <hi>Parts,</hi> and the <hi>composition</hi> of <hi>Quantity, p.</hi> 45. His answer in short is, That <hi>there are no actual parts in quantity before division:</hi> Which if it be so indeed, there is then no ground for the Questions <hi>how they are united;</hi> or of <hi>what compounded.</hi> But I shall shew; 1. That there are <hi>actual Parts;</hi> and, 2. That the Grounds of the contrary Assertion are weak and insufficient.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The formal nature of <hi>Quantity</hi> is <hi>Extention,</hi> in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Schools; and <hi>divisibility</hi> in the Philosophy of Sir <hi>K. Digby,</hi> and our Author; both which <hi>suppose parts,</hi> and parts <hi>actual:</hi> for to be <hi>extended,</hi> is to have <hi>partes extra partes</hi> (as the School Phrase is); and if the Extension be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53288:41"/>
the Parts must be so: for it is not conceivable how a thing can be extended but by parts, which are really <hi>distinct</hi> from one another, though not <hi>separate:</hi> Nor can a thing be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, except we suppose the Parts preexistent in the divisible; for <hi>Divisibility</hi> is founded upon <hi>real distinction,</hi> and 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to divide that which is one without any diversity. (2.) Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there are parts in Matter <hi>before Division,</hi> there are <hi>none</hi> at all: For <hi>after</hi> they are divided they are <hi>no parts,</hi> but have a <hi>compleatness</hi> and integrality of their own, especially if their Subject were an <hi>Homogeneous</hi> Body. (3.) If there are not <hi>actual</hi> Parts in Quantity, <hi>Contradictions</hi> may be verified <hi>de eodem</hi> in all the Circumstances, which the <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> teach to be impossible: For the same Body may be seen, and not seen, black and white, hot and cold, moist and dry, and have all other the most contrary Qualities. To this Sir <hi>K. Digby</hi> answers, [<q>That it is not one part of the thing that shews it self, and another that doth not, one that is hot, and another cold, &amp;c. But it is the same thing, shewing it self according to one possibility of Division, and not another.</q>] To this I say first, These distinct Possibilities are founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on distinct Actualities, which are the parts I would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd: and such a capacity of receiving things so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cannot be in the same Subject without the supposal of parts actually distinct and divers. 2. The Subjects of these contrary Qualities are things <hi>actual,</hi> whereas <hi>Possibilities</hi> are but <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Notions; and these Subjects are distinct, or Contradictions will be reconcil'd: from which the Inference seems necessary, that Quantity hath Parts, and Parts Actual; and distinct Possibilities will not salve the Business. And, 3. why must the common Speech of all Mankind be altered? and what all the World calls <hi>Parts</hi> be call'd <hi>Possibilities</hi> of <hi>Division?</hi> Which yet, if our Philosopher will needs name so, they be acknowledg'd <hi>distinct,</hi> and prov'd <hi>actual,</hi> or at least founded immediately upon things that are so; my Questions will as well proceed this way as in the common one, <hi>viz.</hi> How the things that answer to these distinct Possibilities are united, and of what compounded?</p>
               <p>There is another Answer which I find in our Author's <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetical Institutions;</hi> the sum of which is, [<q>That the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53288:41"/>
Contradictions have only a notional repugnance in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as 'tis in our Understandings; and since the parts have a distinct Being in our understanding, from thence 'tis that they are capable to sustain Contradictions</q>]. Which answer, if I understand, I have reason to wonder at, for certainly the Subject sustains the Contradictories as it is <hi>in re;</hi> and I never heard of a <hi>Notion, black</hi> or <hi>white, hot</hi> or <hi>cold,</hi> but in a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor:</hi> 'Tis the real Substance is the Subject of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties, which were impossible, if it had not divers Realities answering to the Qualities that so denominate: and therefore 'tis not the Understanding that makes the divers Subjects of these Accidents, as our Author suggests: but their being such is the ground that we so apprehend them. This I think is enough to shew that there are <hi>actual Parts</hi> in <hi>Quantity.</hi> To which I must add,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That the Grounds of Sir <hi>K. Digby,</hi> and our Author, on which they build their Paradox, are insufficient. The Reasons are; <hi rend="sup">1</hi>. <hi>Quantity</hi> is <hi>Divisibility;</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>. <hi>Divisibility</hi> is <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi> of <hi>Division;</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>. What is only <hi>capable</hi> of division, is not <hi>actually</hi> divided; <hi rend="sup">4</hi>. Quantity is not <hi>actually</hi> divided, and therefore hath no <hi>parts actual.</hi> To which I say,</p>
               <p>(1.) That Quantity is <hi>divisibility,</hi> is presumed; but <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension</hi> is before it, in Nature, and our Conception; and it is the receiv'd Notion, though I think <hi>Impenitrability</hi> is the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. (2.) <hi>Division</hi> supposeth <hi>Vnion,</hi> and Vnion <hi>parts united.</hi> (3.) What is only <hi>capable</hi> of Division in a <hi>mechanical</hi> Sense, may, and ought to be divided in a <hi>Metaphysical:</hi> That is, they ought to be divers in their Being, before they can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and distinct in their Quantity; for <hi>Separability</hi> must suppose <hi>Diversity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, (2.) It is pleaded against <hi>Actual Parts</hi> in Quantity; that if we admit them, we cannot stop till we come down to <hi>Indivisibles;</hi> of which to suppose Quantity compounded, is said to be absurd and impossible. In answer to which, I grant the Inference, and have acknowledg'd the Hypothesis of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible; to be full of seeming Inconsistencies, as is the other also: and therefore I reckon both among the things that are <hi>unconceivable:</hi> of which there can be no greater Argument, than their having driven such great and sagacious wits upon
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53288:42"/>
an Assertion, that is contrary to our Senses, and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of all the World: <hi>That there are no parts in Quantity.</hi> And, (2.) 'Tis no good method of reasoning to deny what is plain and obvious, because we cannot conceive what is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse and difficult: To say that Quantity hath no actual Parts, contrary to the suffrage and senses of Mankind, because we cannot untie the Difficulties that arise from its being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of <hi>Indivisibles,</hi> a nice and intricate Theory.</p>
               <p>Sir, I crave your pardon for this <hi>Spinose</hi> and <hi>dry</hi> Discourse, which I could not well avoid, it being one of the main things of Sir <hi>K. Digby</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>White's Philosophy,</hi> and pretended by the latter, as <hi>such</hi> a Solution of the Doubts I propounded, as renders them <hi>scarce any Difficulties at all:</hi> For the other things he objects, they are smaller Matters; and if you have leisure for such Trifles, I refer you to the discussion of them in my larger Answer, annext to my <hi>Scepsis Scientifica:</hi> in which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so you will find what concerns his justification of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his <hi>Philosophy.</hi>

               <p>NOtwithstanding the shew of Science that the World of Books makes, it must be confest by considerate Men, that Knowledge is capable of far greater Heights and Improvements, than it hath yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; and there is nothing hath stinted its Growth, and hindred its Improvements more, than an over-fond, superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinion of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the <hi>Ancients,</hi> by which it is presumed that their Books are the <hi>Ne Vltra's</hi> of Learning, and that little or nothing can be added to their discoveries: So that hereby a stop hath been put upon Inquiry, and Men have contented themselves with studying their Writings, and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about their Opinions, while they have not taken much notice of the great Book of Nature, or used any likely Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for further acquaintance with it. <hi>This,</hi> whoever will consider, and speak impartially, must confess: and yet in spight of the evil Instuence of this Humour, there have been some in all Ages, who have freely search'd into the Creatures of God as they are in <hi>his</hi> World, without vainly spending of their time in playing with those Images of them that the phansies of Men have fram'd in <hi>theirs.</hi> And perhaps no Age hath been more happy in liberty of Enquiry, than this, in

FOr the FIRST, <hi>CHYMISTRY,</hi> it hath indeed a pretence to the great <hi>Hermes</hi> for its <hi>Author</hi> (how <hi>truly,</hi> I will not dispute): From <hi>him</hi> 'tis said to have come to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and from <hi>them</hi> to the <hi>Arabians:</hi> Among <hi>these</hi> it was infinitely roingled with <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>superstitious Devices:</hi> But not at all in <hi>use</hi> with <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his <hi>Sectators.</hi> Nor doth it appear, that the <hi>Grecians,</hi> or the <hi>disputing Ages,</hi> were conversant in these <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>lueiferous Processes,</hi> by which <hi>Nature</hi> is <hi>unwound,</hi> and <hi>resolv'd</hi> into the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of its <hi>Composition;</hi> and by the <hi>violence</hi> of those <hi>Fires</hi> it is made <hi>confess</hi> those <hi>latent</hi> parts, which, upon <hi>less provocation,</hi> it would not <hi>disclose.</hi> Now, as we cannot understand the <hi>frame</hi> of a <hi>Watch,</hi> without taking it into pieces; so neither can Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be well <hi>known,</hi> without a <hi>resolution</hi> of it into its <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> which certainly may be best of all done by <hi>Chymical Methods:</hi> By those Enquiries <hi>wonderful discoveries</hi> are made of their Natures; and <hi>Experiments</hi> are found out, which are not only full of <hi>pleasant surprise</hi> and <hi>information,</hi> but of <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable use,</hi> especially in the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Physick;</hi> For It directs <hi>Medicines</hi> less <hi>loathsome</hi> and far more <hi>vigorous,</hi> and freeth the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and <hi>purer</hi> parts, from the <hi>clogging</hi> and <hi>noxious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices</hi> of <hi>grosser</hi> Matter, which not only <hi>hinder</hi> and <hi>disable</hi> the <hi>Operation,</hi> but leave hurtful <hi>Dregs</hi> in the Body behind them. I confess, that among the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Paracelsians,</hi> and some other <hi>Moderns, Chymistry</hi> was very <hi>phantastick, unintelligible,</hi> and <hi>delusive;</hi> and the <hi>boasts, vanity,</hi> and <hi>canting</hi> of those <hi>Spagyrists,</hi> brought a <hi>scandal</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Art,</hi> and exposed it to <hi>suspicion</hi> and <hi>contempt:</hi> but its late <hi>Cultivators,</hi> and particularly the <hi>ROYAL SOCIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY,</hi> have refin'd it from its <hi>dross,</hi> and made it <hi>honest, sober,</hi> and <hi>intelligible,</hi> an excellent <hi>Interpreter</hi> to <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>help</hi> to <hi>common Life.</hi> For <hi>they</hi> have laid aside the <hi>Chrysopoie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> the <hi>delusory Designs,</hi> and <hi>vain Transmutations,</hi> the <hi>Rosie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crucian Vapours, Magical Charms,</hi> and <hi>Superstitious Suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and form'd it into an <hi>Instrument,</hi> to know the <hi>Depths</hi> and <hi>Efficacies</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> And this is no small advantage that we have above the <hi>old Philosophers</hi> of the <hi>Notional Way.</hi> And we have another,</p>

Tettullian</hi> severely censures an inquisitive Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of his time for this <hi>practice,</hi> saying, That <hi>he hated Man, that he might know him.</hi> Yea, one of the <hi>Popes</hi> (I take 'twas <hi>Boniface</hi> 8.) threatens to <hi>Excommunicate</hi> those, that should do any thing of this <hi>(then) abominable</hi> nature. And <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was fain to excuse his <hi>Dissection</hi> of <hi>Beasts,</hi> even to the great <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> Nor does it appear by any thing extant in the Writings of <hi>Galen,</hi> that <hi>that</hi> other <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Physicians</hi> ever made any <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>humane</hi> Bodies. Thus <hi>shie</hi> and unacquainted was <hi>Antiquity</hi> with this excellent <hi>Art,</hi> which is one of the most <hi>useful</hi> in humane Life, and tends mightily to the <hi>eviscerating</hi> of Nature, and disclosure of the <hi>Springs</hi> of its <hi>Motion.</hi> But now in these <hi>later</hi> Ages, <hi>Anatomy</hi> hath been a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>general Practice;</hi> and particularly in <hi>this,</hi> It hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>wonderful Improvements</hi> from the Endeavours of several worthy Inquisitors, some of them Ingenious Members of the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY,</hi> as Sir <hi>George Ent,</hi> Dr. <hi>Glisson,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Willis.</hi> I instance in the most <hi>remarkable</hi> of their <hi>Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries</hi> briefly; And those I take notice of are, The <hi>Valves</hi> of the <hi>Veins,</hi> discover'd by <hi>Fabricius ab Aquapendente;</hi> The <hi>Valve</hi> at the entrance of the <hi>gut Colon,</hi> found, as is generally thought, by <hi>Bauhinus;</hi> The <hi>Milkie Veins</hi> of the <hi>Mesentery,</hi> by <hi>Aselli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi> The <hi>Receptacle</hi> of the <hi>Chyle,</hi> by <hi>Pecquet;</hi> The <hi>Ductus Virsungianus,</hi> by <hi>Jo.

were of old supposed to arise out of the substance of the <hi>Brain,</hi> but are found by late <hi>Anatomists</hi> to proceed from the <hi>Medulla Oblongata.</hi> And though the <hi>Succus Nutritius</hi> be not yet fully agreed upon by <hi>Physicians,</hi> yet it hath so much to say for it self, that it may not unreasonably be mentioned among the <hi>New Inventions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But of all the <hi>Modern Discoveries, Wit</hi> and <hi>Industry</hi> have made in the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> the noblest is that of the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> which was the Invention of our deservedly-famous <hi>Harvey.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>envy</hi> of <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> Contemporaries, would have robb'd him of the glory of <hi>this Discovery,</hi> and pretend it was known to <hi>Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle,</hi> and others among the Ancients: But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever considers the Expressions of those Authors, which are <hi>said</hi> to respect the <hi>Circulation,</hi> will find, that those who form the <hi>Inference,</hi> do it by a <hi>faculty</hi> that makes all <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Deductions,</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> that assists the <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> of our days, to see so clearly all our Alterations of <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> to the <hi>minutest Particulars,</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John.</hi> And perhaps it may be as well concluded from the <hi>first Chapter of Genesis,</hi> as from the <hi>Remains</hi> of those <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; who,</hi> if they had known this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>general Theory,</hi> how chance they spake no more of a thing, which no doubt they had frequent occasions to mention? How came it to be <hi>lost</hi> without memory among their Followers, who were such <hi>superstitious porers</hi> upon their Writings? How chance it was not shewn to be lodg'd in those Authors, before the days of Dr. <hi>Harvy,</hi> when <hi>Envy</hi> had <hi>impregnated</hi> and determined the <hi>Imaginations</hi> of those, who were not willing any thing should be found anew, of which themselves were not the <hi>Inventors?</hi> But 'tis not only the <hi>remotest</hi> Ancients, whom time hath <hi>consecrated,</hi> and <hi>distance</hi> made <hi>venerable,</hi> whose <hi>Ashes</hi> those fond Men would honour with <hi>this Discovery:</hi> But even much <hi>later</hi> Authors have had the Glory fastned upon them. For the <hi>Invention</hi> is by some ascribed to <hi>Paulus Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi> by others, to <hi>Prosper Alpinus;</hi> and a third sort give it to <hi>Andreas Caesalpinus.</hi> For <hi>these,</hi> though either of them should be acknowledged to be the Author, it will make as much for the design of my Discourse, as if <hi>Harvy</hi> had the credit; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53288:46"/>
therefore here I am no otherwise concerned, but to have <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> for that Excellent Man: And the World hath now done <hi>right</hi> to his <hi>Memory, Death</hi> having overcome that <hi>Envy</hi> which <hi>dog's living Virtue</hi> to the <hi>Grave;</hi> and his <hi>Name</hi> rests quietly in the Arms of <hi>Glory,</hi> while the <hi>Pretensions</hi> of his <hi>Rivals</hi> are <hi>creeping</hi> into <hi>darkness</hi> and <hi>oblivion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, I have done with the <hi>Instances</hi> of <hi>Anatomical Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements,</hi> unless I should hitherto refer the late Noble <hi>Experiment</hi> of <hi>Transfusion of the Blood</hi> from one <hi>living Animal</hi> into <hi>another,</hi> which I think very fit to be mention'd; and I suppose 'tis not improper for this place: Or however, I shall rather venture the danger of <hi>impropriety</hi> and <hi>misplacing,</hi> than omit the taking notice of so excellent a Discovery, which no doubt future <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> will improve to purposes not yet thought of; and we have very great likelyhood of Advantages from it in <hi>present prospect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is concluded, That the greatest part of our Diseases arise either from the <hi>scarcity,</hi> or <hi>malignant temper</hi> and <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our <hi>Blood;</hi> in which cases <hi>Transfusion</hi> is an <hi>obvious Remedy;</hi> and in the way of this Operation, the <hi>peccant Blood</hi> may be drawn out, without the danger of too much <hi>enfeebling</hi> Nature, which is the grand inconvenience of <hi>meer Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> So that <hi>this Experiment</hi> may be of excellent use, when <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Acquaintance</hi> have hardned Men to permit the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, in <hi>Pleurisies, Cancers, Leprosies, Madness, Vlcers, Small-Pox, Dotage,</hi> and all such-like Distempers. And I know not why <hi>that</hi> of <hi>injecting prepared Medicines</hi> immediately into the Blood, may not be better and more efficacious, than the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary course of Practice: Since this will prevent all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of frustration from the <hi>loathings</hi> of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and the disabling, clogging mixtures and alterations they meet with <hi>there,</hi> and in the <hi>Intestines,</hi> in which no doubt much of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> is <hi>lost.</hi> But in the way of <hi>immediate inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> they are kept <hi>intire,</hi> all those inconveniences are avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the <hi>Operation</hi> is like to be more <hi>speedy</hi> and <hi>succesful.</hi> Both these <hi>noble Experiments</hi> are the late <hi>Inventions</hi> of the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY,</hi> who have attested the <hi>reality</hi> of the former, <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Transfusion</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> by numerous Tryals
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53288:46"/>
on several sorts of <hi>brute Animals.</hi> Indeed the <hi>French</hi> made the <hi>Experiment first</hi> upon <hi>humane Bodies,</hi> of which we have a good account from <hi>Monsieur Dennis:</hi> But it hath also since been practiced with fair and encouraging success, by our <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Society.</hi> The <hi>other</hi> of <hi>Injection,</hi> if it may be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as a different Invention, was also the product of the same <hi>Generous Inventors;</hi> though indeed more <hi>forward Foreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> have endeavoured to <hi>usurp</hi> the <hi>credit</hi> of <hi>both. This latter</hi> likewise hath succeeded to considerable good effects, in some <hi>new</hi> Tryals that have been made of it in <hi>Dantzick,</hi> as appears in a Letter written from Dr. <hi>Fabritius</hi> of that City, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Philosophical Transactions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I proceed now to my <hi>THIRD Instance</hi> of <hi>ARTS,</hi> (if I may take leave to use the word in this large sense) which are <hi>Advantages</hi> for <hi>deep</hi> search into Nature, and have been consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably advanc'd by the <hi>Industry</hi> and culture of <hi>late</hi> Times, above their <hi>ancient Stature.</hi> And the Instance was,</p>
               <p n="3">(III.) The <hi>MATHEMATICKS.</hi> That these are mighty helps to <hi>Practical</hi> and <hi>Vseful Knowledge,</hi> will be <hi>easily</hi> consest by all, that have not so much <hi>ignorance</hi> as to render them <hi>incapable</hi> of information in these Matters: The Learned <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard Vossius</hi> hath proved it by <hi>induction</hi> in Particulars: And yet it must be acknowledged, that <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the <hi>disputing Philosophers</hi> of his School, were not much addicted to those <hi>noble Inquisitions:</hi> For <hi>Proclus</hi> the <hi>Commentator</hi> upon <hi>Euclide,</hi> though he gives a very particular Catalogue of the <hi>Elder Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians,</hi> yet hath not mentioned <hi>Aristotle</hi> in that number: And though <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> takes notice of a Book he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: Yet it appears not that these were things of very great value; and <hi>Aristotle's Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical procedure,</hi> even in <hi>Physical Theories,</hi> the <hi>genius</hi> and <hi>humour</hi> of his <hi>Principles,</hi> and the <hi>airy contentions</hi> of his <hi>Sect,</hi> are great presumptions that <hi>this Philosopher</hi> was not very <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical:</hi> And his numerous succeeding Followers, were certainly very little conversant in those Studies.

For there were many <hi>affected Aequations</hi> (as they call them) that did not <hi>equally ascend</hi> in the <hi>Scale</hi> of <hi>Powers,</hi> that could not be <hi>solv'd</hi> by the <hi>elder Methods;</hi> whereas the acute <hi>Vieta,</hi> a <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician</hi> of this last Age, affirms, he could <hi>resolve</hi> any <hi>Problem</hi> by his <hi>own Improvements.</hi> Besides him, our excellent <hi>Ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi> another, lately mentioned, did much in this way.

               </p>
               <p>The Result of which is, We must expect the Advantages of this Science, from the declining of <hi>his</hi> and <hi>their Empire;</hi> and I need not say <hi>expect</hi> it, they are both in present view.

               <p>I note then from the celebrated <hi>Vossius,</hi> That <hi>Euclide</hi> was the <hi>first</hi> that brought <hi>Geometry</hi> into a <hi>Method,</hi> and more <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately demonstrated</hi> those Principles, which before were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and not so <hi>cogently</hi> or <hi>carefully</hi> proved.

The Performances also of <hi>Ctesibius,</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Ptolomeus Physcon,</hi> are much celebrated by <hi>Plivy.</hi> He invented many things in <hi>Hydraulicks,</hi> and according to <hi>Atheneus,</hi> he was the first <hi>Contriver</hi> of <hi>Musical Organs.</hi> These were <hi>Mechanical:</hi> but <hi>Geminus Rhodius</hi> the Master of <hi>Proclus Lycius,</hi> applyed <hi>Logick</hi> to <hi>Geometry,</hi> out of <hi>particular Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> abstracting <hi>Vniversals.</hi> He demonstrated, That there are only <hi>Three similar Species</hi> of all <hi>Lines,</hi> viz. <hi>Right, Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> and <hi>Cylindrical:</hi> And <hi>Perseus</hi> following his steps, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd <hi>Geometry</hi> with the Invention of <hi>three kinds</hi> of <hi>Crooked Lines,</hi> the <hi>Parabole, Hyperbole,</hi> and <hi>Elipsis;</hi> for which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd his extatick joy, as <hi>Thales, Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> did upon like occasions, in a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the <hi>Gods.</hi> But to be briefer, <hi>Pappus</hi> improved the <hi>Sphoericks; Theon</hi> more <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically</hi> digested the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Euclide; Serenus Antinsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> discover'd, that the <hi>Section</hi> of a <hi>right Cylindre,</hi> is the same with the <hi>Elipsis</hi> of a <hi>right Cone; Copernicus</hi> improved the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Triangles; Ramus corrected</hi> and <hi>supplied Euclide,</hi> where his <hi>Principles</hi> were <hi>defective; Maurolicus</hi> writ <hi>first</hi> of <hi>Secant Lines, Clavius</hi> much illustrated and promoted the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Tangents, Secants, Triangles, Right Lines,</hi> and <hi>Sphaericks,</hi> besides what he did in his <hi>Comment</hi> upon <hi>Euclide,</hi> I might mention with These, the worthy Performances of <hi>Gusanus, Pitiscus, Snellius, Ambrosius Rhodius, Kepler,</hi>

                  <hi>Franciseus à Schoten,</hi> and others, who contributed very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to the Perfections and Advancements of <hi>Geometry,</hi> and were lare Men.</p>
               <p>But none have done in it like the Excellent Persons whom I reserve for my last mention; The chief are, <hi>Vieta, Des-Cartes,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wallis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To my account of whose Performances, I must premise, That no great things can be done in <hi>Geometry,</hi> without the <hi>Analytical Method;</hi> And though some Learned Men conceive the <hi>Ancients</hi> were acquainted with <hi>this</hi> way of <hi>resolving Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems,</hi> yet their skill in it went no higher than the <hi>Quadratick</hi> Order of <hi>Aequations,</hi> which They <hi>demonstrated</hi> by <hi>Circles</hi> and <hi>Right Lines,</hi> which They call'd <hi>Loca Plana:</hi> but they were able to do nothing in the <hi>Cubical Aequations,</hi> or any of the <hi>Superiour Orders;</hi> though they endeavour'd to cover their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> in this <hi>Art,</hi> by recourse <hi>ad Locos Solidos,</hi> (viz. <hi>Conick Sections</hi>) and <hi>Lineares,</hi> as they called them, such as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix, Conchoeides,</hi> and those of like nature. But those <hi>tortous</hi> and <hi>curved</hi> Lines being described <hi>Mechanically</hi> by <hi>Compound Motions,</hi> the <hi>Problems resolv'd</hi> by them, are performed <hi>Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically</hi> by the <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Eye,</hi> not <hi>Geometrically.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the State of the <hi>Analytick Art,</hi> as long as Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flourish'd in <hi>Greece;</hi> when <hi>That</hi> was subdued by the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> their Learning with their Country passed to the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> and also to the <hi>Persians,</hi> as we have it from <hi>Hottinger</hi> and <hi>Bullialdus:</hi> But these <hi>Successors</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> did not <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> their Learning beyond the <hi>imperfect Stature</hi> in which it was delivered to them. In that condition it remained till <hi>Cardan</hi> and <hi>Tartaglia,</hi> who made some small addition towards the <hi>perfection</hi> of it; For they gave some Rules for solving <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bical Aequations,</hi> which were certain in some cases, but not in all. Their <hi>Invention</hi> some other <hi>Mathematical</hi> Men endeavoured to <hi>advance,</hi> laying down <hi>Rules</hi> for solving some <hi>Cubick</hi> and <hi>Biquadratick Aequations;</hi> but could never find an <hi>universal</hi> way, that might reach all such: Yea indeed they <hi>utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired,</hi> and held it <hi>impossible.</hi> At length appears <hi>Vieta,</hi> who by inventing the <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Extracting Roots</hi> in the most <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Aequations,</hi> and by converting the <hi>Signs</hi> used by the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> into <hi>Letters,</hi> brought <hi>Algebra</hi> to a very great <hi>perfection,</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53288:50"/>
as I have noted above; and by enriching the <hi>Analytical Art,</hi> by the <hi>Accessions</hi> of his <hi>Exigetice Numerosa,</hi> and <hi>Logistice Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciosa,</hi> he hath contributed infinite helps to <hi>Geometry.</hi> After him, divers other Learned Men polisht and adorned his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; among whom I mention chiefly our Country-men <hi>Harriot</hi> and <hi>Oughtred,</hi> who altred <hi>Vieta's Notes</hi> to advantage, and invented <hi>Canons</hi> to direct our <hi>Operations</hi> in the <hi>Extracting</hi> of <hi>Roots,</hi> both in <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>adsected Aequations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after these had thus improved the <hi>Analytick Art,</hi> and well assisted <hi>Geometry</hi> by it, <hi>Renatus Des-Cartes</hi> appears, who in a <hi>few Pages,</hi> opens a way to <hi>mighty Performances:</hi> He shews us how all the <hi>Problems</hi> of <hi>Geometry</hi> may be brought to such terms, that we shall need nothing to the <hi>Construction</hi> and <hi>Demonstration</hi> of them, but the knowledge of the <hi>length</hi> of certain <hi>right Lines;</hi> and that, as all the Operations of <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick</hi> are performed by <hi>Addition, Subtraction, Multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Division,</hi> and <hi>Extraction</hi> of <hi>Roots</hi> (which is a <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Division</hi>). So in <hi>Geometry,</hi> for the preparation of <hi>Lines</hi> that they may be <hi>known,</hi> nothing needs more to be done, than that others be <hi>added</hi> to them, or <hi>subtracted</hi> from them; or if the <hi>Line</hi> be <hi>single,</hi> (which that it may be the better referred to Numbers, may be called <hi>Vnity</hi>) and beside <hi>that,</hi> two other Lines, that a <hi>Fourth</hi> be found which shall have the same <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> to <hi>one</hi> of <hi>these Lines,</hi> that the other hath to <hi>Vnity,</hi> which is the same with <hi>Multiplication;</hi> or else, that by them a <hi>Fourth</hi> be found, which may have the same <hi>proportion</hi> to one of them, which <hi>Vnity</hi> hath to the other, which is the same with <hi>Division;</hi> or lastly, That there be found between <hi>Vnity,</hi> and some other <hi>Right Line,</hi> two or more <hi>mean Proportionals,</hi> which is the same thing with the <hi>Extraction</hi> of <hi>Quadratick</hi> and <hi>Cubick Roots.</hi> And that he may justifie the introducing of <hi>Terms Arithmetical</hi> into <hi>Geometry,</hi> he observes, That the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof was an occasion of much <hi>perplexity</hi> and <hi>obscurity</hi> in the <hi>Geometry</hi> of the <hi>Ancients;</hi> of which he could give no other conjecture, but because they did not sufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the <hi>affinity</hi> and <hi>cognation</hi> of those Sciences. But if I should intend an <hi>exact History</hi> of all his Performances, I must <hi>transcribe Him;</hi> for he hath said so much in little, that 'tis impossible to abridge those his <hi>close Composures.</hi> I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53288:50"/>
only hint some principal things referring to his Writings for the rest.</p>
               <p>And I take notice <hi>first,</hi> That he hath proposed an <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Method</hi> for the <hi>Solution</hi> of all <hi>Problems;</hi> not only those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in <hi>Right Lines, Plains,</hi> and <hi>Solids:</hi> but also all that are made in <hi>Angles,</hi> a thing of most general Service in all parts of <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> By It he resolves the <hi>famous Proposition</hi> in <hi>Pappus,</hi> which was too hard for <hi>Euclide, Apollonius,</hi> and all the <hi>Ancients.</hi> He discourses the nature of <hi>crooked</hi> Lines, and shews which are fit to be used in <hi>Geometrical Demonstrations;</hi> Gives <hi>Rules</hi> for the place where to apply our selves in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi> of any <hi>Problem;</hi> and tells us, That a <hi>Problem</hi> after it is brought to an <hi>Aequation,</hi> and reduced to its <hi>least</hi> terms, and the <hi>unknown Quantity</hi> is <hi>Quadratick,</hi> or of two Dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that then it may be demonstrated by a <hi>Right Line</hi> and <hi>Circles:</hi> but if the <hi>Aequation,</hi> after it is reduced to its <hi>least Terms,</hi> leave the unknown <hi>Quantity, Cubick</hi> or <hi>Biquadratick,</hi> it must be demonstrated by some one of the <hi>Conick Sections.</hi> Whereas again, if after the <hi>Aequation</hi> reduced, the unknown Quantity remain of five or six <hi>Dimensions,</hi> or more, <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> then the Demonstration must be performed by <hi>Lines</hi> more and more <hi>compound,</hi> according to the <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the <hi>unknown Quantity</hi> of the <hi>Aequation.</hi> But because the way by <hi>Lines</hi> is <hi>perplext</hi> and <hi>tedious,</hi> he gives <hi>Rules</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Aequations</hi> of <hi>many Dimensions,</hi> to <hi>fewer.</hi> He shews how to <hi>fill</hi> up <hi>Defects,</hi> when any <hi>Terms</hi> are wanting in the <hi>Aequation;</hi> how to convert the <hi>false Roots</hi> into <hi>true,</hi> to avoid <hi>Fractions,</hi> and to <hi>lessen Aequations.</hi> He hath <hi>demonstrated,</hi> by a <hi>Circle</hi> and <hi>Parabole,</hi> the famous <hi>Problems</hi> so much agitated among the <hi>Ancients, viz.</hi> the <hi>Trisection</hi> of an <hi>Angle,</hi> and the <hi>finding two mean Proportionals between two Lines given,</hi> with more brevity and expedition than any that went before him. And this shall suffice by way of intimation, concerning that Prince of Mathematicians and Philosophers.</p>
               <p>Since <hi>him,</hi> others have improved this <hi>Method: Schotenius</hi> hath demonstrated the <hi>Loca Plana</hi> of <hi>Apollonius: Hadderius</hi> hath added Inventions of <hi>use</hi> and <hi>pleasant Speculation</hi> in his <hi>Tract</hi> of <hi>Reduction</hi> of <hi>Aequations. Florimundus de Beaune</hi> hath writ ingenious and profitable things, <hi>de Natura &amp; Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus</hi>

                  <hi>Aequationum.</hi> But 'twould be endless to attempt full Accounts of the Modern Advancements of this Science, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed those accessions of growth it hath had since <hi>Vieta.</hi> And whoever should go about it, must reckon to begin anew as soon as he hath finish'd what he intended, since <hi>Geometry</hi> is <hi>improving daily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall therefore add no more here, but only do right to an excellent Person of our own Nation, Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> a Member of the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY,</hi> to whom <hi>Geometry</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly indebted for his rare Discoveries in that <hi>Science.</hi> Particularly, he hath propounded a Method for the <hi>measuring</hi> of all kind of <hi>crooked Lines,</hi> which is highly ingenious; and put an end to all future Attempts about <hi>Squaring</hi> the <hi>Circle,</hi> which hath <hi>puzzled</hi> and <hi>befooled</hi> so many <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> that have spent their <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>time</hi> about it. This he hath brought to effect as it near as can be done, and shew'd the <hi>exact</hi> performance by <hi>rational Numbers</hi> impossible: He hath propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed excellent ways for the <hi>measuring</hi> all kinds of <hi>Plains,</hi> and all <hi>multangular</hi> and <hi>solid Bodies.</hi> But 'tis time now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the consideration of the next <hi>Mathematical Science,</hi> Viz.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Astronomy,</hi> one of the <hi>grandest</hi> and most <hi>magnifique</hi> of all those that lie within the compass of <hi>Natural Inquiry.</hi> I shall not look back to its beginning among the <hi>Chaldaeans, Aegyptians,</hi> and <hi>eldest Graecians,</hi> in which Times it was but <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>imperfect,</hi> in comparison to its <hi>modern Advancements.</hi> For the great Men among the <hi>Greeks</hi> are taken much notice of, but for very <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>trite</hi> things in this Science: As <hi>Anaximander Milesius,</hi> for teaching, <hi>That the Earth was Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous, and the Centre of the World not bigger than the Sun: Anaximines</hi> for affirming, <hi>That the Moon shone but with a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Light; That the Sun and It were Eclips'd by the Earths interposal;</hi> and, <hi>That the Stars move round our Globe.</hi> And <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was the <hi>first</hi> that noted the <hi>obliquity</hi> of the <hi>Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. This Philosopher</hi> indeed was a Person of a <hi>vast</hi> reach, and said things in <hi>Astronomy</hi> very agreeable to <hi>late Discoveries:</hi> But <hi>Aristotle</hi> made very <hi>odd Schemes,</hi> not at all corresponding with the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> as appears from his <hi>Hypotheses</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53288:51"/>
of <hi>Solid Orbs, Epicycles, Excentricks, Intelligences,</hi> and such other ill-contrived Phancies. Besides which, if I should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to consider his now palpable Mistakes about the nature of <hi>Comets,</hi> the <hi>Galaxy,</hi> the <hi>Sphere of Fire</hi> under the <hi>Moon,</hi> and numerous other such, I should oblige my self to a large ramble. Wherefore to be brief in these Notes, I observe, That after <hi>Aristotle, Astronomy</hi> was cultivated and improved by <hi>Theophrastus, Aratus, Aristarchus Samius, Archimedes, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus, Menelaus, Theon, Hipparchus, Claudius Ptolomaeus,</hi> and many others among the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among <hi>later</hi> Authors, considerable things have been done in this way by both <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Arabians:</hi> To omit the <hi>latter,</hi> I shall give you some <hi>particular Instances</hi> of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Johannes de Sacro Bosco, ingeniously</hi> and <hi>methodically</hi> explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Sphere: Thebit first</hi> found the <hi>Motion</hi> of <hi>Trepidation: Regiomontanus</hi> published the <hi>first Ephemeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:</hi> and did excellent things in his <hi>Theoricks</hi> of the <hi>Planets. Wernerus</hi> stated the greatest <hi>Declination</hi> of the <hi>Sun. Albertus Pighius</hi> directed the way to find <hi>Aequinoxes</hi> and <hi>Solstices: Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ersius</hi> fram ed <hi>perpetual Tables</hi> of the <hi>Longitudes</hi> and <hi>Latitudes</hi> of the <hi>Planets: Copernicus</hi> restored the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> and <hi>Philolaus,</hi> and gave far more <hi>neat</hi> and <hi>consistent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts</hi> of the <hi>Phaenomena: Joachimus</hi> made <hi>Ephemerides</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Copernican</hi> Doctrine: <hi>Clavius</hi> invented a most useful <hi>demonstrative Astrolabe,</hi> and writ an <hi>exquisite Comment</hi> upon <hi>Sacro Bosco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I conclude the last Century with the Noble <hi>Ticho Brahe,</hi> who performed the great Work of restoring the <hi>Fix'd Stars</hi> to their <hi>true</hi> places, the <hi>assignation</hi> of which before him, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>guess,</hi> than any <hi>competent Rules,</hi> and the <hi>mistakes</hi> here, were the very Root and Foundation of most <hi>Errors</hi> in <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> For which reason it was, that <hi>Copernicus</hi> left that <hi>earnest advice</hi> to his Scholar <hi>Joachimus,</hi> that he should apply himself to the <hi>restitution</hi> of the <hi>Fix'd Stars;</hi> for till this were done, there could be no hopes of attaining to the <hi>true places</hi> of the <hi>Planets,</hi> nor doing any thing to purpose in the whole <hi>Science.</hi> This ingaged the Noble <hi>Tycho</hi> to this Enterprise, and he made it the Foundation of all the rest: The Method he used is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>Gassendus.</hi> By the help of this noble Performance
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53288:52"/>
he reformed the elder <hi>Astronomical Tables,</hi> both the <hi>Ptolomaick</hi> and <hi>Copernican.</hi> And from his Observations of the new Star of 1572, and six others in his time, he asserted <hi>Comets</hi> into their place among <hi>Heavenly Bodies,</hi> shattering all the <hi>Solid Orbs</hi> to pieces; And he hath done it with such <hi>cleaer conviction,</hi> that even the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> whose thraldom to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters them from closing with the <hi>Motion</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi> confess a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of repairing to some other <hi>Hypothesis</hi> than that of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle.</hi> I might add to this, That this <hi>generous</hi> Nobleman invented and framed such excellent <hi>Astronomical Instruments,</hi> as were for <hi>use</hi> and <hi>convenience</hi> far beyond <hi>any</hi> of former Times: Himself hath a Treatise concerning them. He hath also made exquisite <hi>Tables</hi> of the difference that <hi>Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> make in the <hi>appearance</hi> of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and done more great things for <hi>Astronomical Improvement,</hi> than many <hi>Ages</hi> that were before him; for which reason I could not pardon my self in a curt mention of so glorious an Advancer of this Science.</p>
               <p>The next Age after him, which is <hi>ours,</hi> hath made excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>use</hi> of his <hi>Discoveries,</hi> and those of his <hi>Elder,</hi> the famed <hi>Copernicus;</hi> and raised <hi>Astronomy</hi> to the noblest <hi>height</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> that ever yet it had among Men. It would take up a Volume to describe, as one ought, all the particular <hi>Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi> But my Design will permit but a short mention: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore briefly; I begin with <hi>Galilaeo,</hi> the reputed Author of the famous <hi>Telescope;</hi> but indeed the glory of the <hi>first Invention</hi> of that excellent <hi>Tube,</hi> belongs to <hi>Jacobus Metius</hi> of <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> but 'twas improved by the noble <hi>Galilaeo,</hi> and he first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it to the <hi>Stars;</hi> by which <hi>incomparable</hi> Advantage, he discovered the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Galaxy,</hi> the 21 <hi>New Stars</hi> that compose the <hi>Nebulosa</hi> in the Head of <hi>Orion,</hi> the 36 that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to <hi>that</hi> other in <hi>Cancer,</hi> the <hi>Ansulae Saturni,</hi> the <hi>Asseclae</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> of whose <hi>Motions</hi> he composed an <hi>Ephemeris.</hi> By these <hi>Lunulae</hi> 'tis thought that <hi>Jupiters distance</hi> from the <hi>Earth</hi> may be determined, as also the distance of <hi>Meridians,</hi> which would be a thing of much use, since this hath always been measured by <hi>Lunar Eclipses,</hi> that happen but once or twice a year; whereas opportunities of Calculating by the <hi>occultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of these <hi>new Planets</hi> will be <hi>frequent,</hi> they recurring

               <p>I come next (5.) To consider the <hi>Opticks,</hi> whose <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements</hi> are of great importance in the Matters of <hi>general Philosophy</hi> and <hi>humane</hi> Life; since the <hi>informations</hi> of <hi>Sense</hi> are the ground of <hi>both,</hi> and <hi>this Science</hi> rectifies and helps the noblest of them. Concerning it, there was once a Book of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s extant, according to <hi>Laertius:</hi> but it hath submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Time.</hi> Since him, this Science hath been cultivated by <hi>Euclide,</hi> and the celebrated <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who is said to have done strange things by it, upon the Ships of <hi>Marcellus:</hi> As <hi>Proclus</hi> who improved the <hi>Archimedian Artifices,</hi> destroyed a Fleet by his <hi>Specula Vstoria,</hi> that besieged <hi>Constantinople. Ptolomy</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> made considerable <hi>Improvements</hi> of <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> and <hi>Alhazenus</hi> the <hi>Arabian,</hi> is famous for what he did in It. From <hi>thefe, Vitellio</hi> drew <hi>his,</hi> and advanced the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> by his <hi>own</hi> Wit, and <hi>their</hi> Helps. <hi>Stevinus</hi> corrected
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53288:53"/>
                  <hi>Euclide, Alhazen,</hi> and <hi>Vitellio,</hi> in some <hi>fundamental Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> that were mistakes; and in their room substituted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Inventions of his own. <hi>Roger Bacou</hi> our fam'd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man (whom <hi>Picus Mirandula</hi> calls the <hi>Phoenix</hi> of his Age, and <hi>Vossius,</hi> one <hi>Learned</hi> to a <hi>Miracle</hi>) writ acutely of <hi>Opticks.</hi> He was accused of <hi>Magick</hi> to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> iv. and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on imprisoned: But the Accusation was founded on nothing but his skill in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and the <hi>ignorance</hi> of his <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers.</hi> After <hi>these,</hi> the <hi>Dioptricks</hi> were improved by <hi>Kepler, Gassendus, Mersennus,</hi> and the noble and incomparable <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> who hath said the most <hi>clear, useful,</hi> and <hi>improvable</hi> things about it, that ever were extant on the Subject. But nothing hath so much advanc'd the Science, as the invention of the <hi>Telescope</hi> by <hi>Metius;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> other of the <hi>Microscope,</hi> concerning which I have to say in the following Instances. I pass therefore to the <hi>last</hi> I shall mention in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> which is,</p>
               <p n="6">(VI.) <hi>Geography.</hi> In <hi>this</hi> the <hi>Ancients</hi> were exceedingly <hi>defective.</hi> And <hi>Aristotle knew the World,</hi> by the same <hi>Figure</hi> by which his <hi>Scholar conquer'd</hi> it. 'Tis noted by the ingenious <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renius,</hi> that the most <hi>general</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> things in <hi>this Science</hi> were then <hi>unknown;</hi> as, The <hi>Habitableness</hi> of the <hi>Torrid Zone;</hi> The <hi>flux</hi> and <hi>reflux</hi> of the <hi>Sea;</hi> The <hi>diversity</hi> of <hi>Winds;</hi> The <hi>Polar Property</hi> of the <hi>Magnet;</hi> The <hi>true Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi> They wanted <hi>Descriptions</hi> of remote <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> concerning which both the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> had very <hi>fabulous Relations.</hi> They knew not that the <hi>Earth</hi> was <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed</hi> by the <hi>Sea,</hi> and that it might be <hi>Sailed round.</hi> They were totally ignorant of <hi>America,</hi> and both the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> parts of this <hi>Hemisphere;</hi> yea, and understood very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the <hi>remoter</hi> places of their own <hi>Asia: Japan,</hi> the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va's,</hi> the <hi>Philippicks,</hi> and <hi>Borneo,</hi> were either not at all <hi>known,</hi> or exceeding <hi>imperfectly</hi> of <hi>old:</hi> But all <hi>these</hi> are <hi>familiar</hi> to the <hi>latter Times: Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> and the <hi>vast Regions</hi> of those <hi>mighty Empires,</hi> with the many <hi>Isles</hi> of the <hi>Great Sea</hi> are disclosed: The <hi>Frozen North,</hi> the <hi>Torrid Line,</hi> and formerly <hi>unknown South,</hi> are <hi>visited,</hi> and by their numerous <hi>Inhabitants</hi> found not to be so <hi>inhospitable</hi> and <hi>unkind</hi> to Men, as <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>

               <p>Thus I have touched upon some of the <hi>Improvements</hi> of the <hi>ARTS</hi> that search into the <hi>recesses</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> with which <hi>latter Ages</hi> have assisted <hi>Philosophical</hi> Inquiries.

               <p>The <hi>Philosophy</hi> that must signifie either for <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Vse,</hi> must not be the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> turned in upon <hi>it self,</hi> and only conversing with its own <hi>Idaea's;</hi> but <hi>It</hi> must be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the <hi>Observations</hi> and <hi>Applications</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> and take its Accounts from Things as they are in the <hi>sensible World.</hi> The Illustrious Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath noted this as the chief cause of the unprofitableness of the <hi>former Methods</hi> of <hi>Knowledge, viz.</hi> That <hi>they</hi> were but the <hi>Exercises</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> making <hi>Conclusions,</hi> and spinning out Notions from its own <hi>native Store;</hi> from which way of proceeding nothing but <hi>Dispute</hi> and Air could be expected. 'Twas the fault that Great Man found in the Ancients, That they flew presently to <hi>general Propositions,</hi> without staying for a <hi>due information</hi> from Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and so <hi>gradually</hi> advancing to <hi>Axioms:</hi> Whereas the <hi>Knowledge,</hi> from which any thing is to be hoped, must be laid in <hi>Sense,</hi> and raised not only srom some few of its <hi>ordinary</hi> Informations; but <hi>Instances</hi> must be <hi>aggregated, compared,</hi> critically <hi>inspected,</hi> and <hi>examined; singly,</hi> and in <hi>consort:</hi> In order to which Performances our <hi>Senses</hi> must be <hi>aided;</hi> for of themselves they are too narrow for the <hi>vastness</hi> of things, and too <hi>short</hi> for <hi>deep Researches:</hi> They make us very <hi>defective</hi> and <hi>unaccurate Reports,</hi> and many times very <hi>deceitful</hi> and <hi>fallacious ones:</hi> I say therefore, <hi>they</hi> must be assisted with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,</hi> that may <hi>strengthen</hi> and <hi>rectisie</hi> their Operations. And in <hi>these</hi> we have mighty <hi>advantages</hi> over <hi>Aristotle</hi> and the <hi>Ancients;</hi> so that much greater things may well be expected from <hi>our Philosophy,</hi> than could ever have been performed by <hi>theirs;</hi> though we should grant them all the <hi>superiority</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> their fondest Admirers would ascribe to those <hi>Sages:</hi> For a <hi>weak hand</hi> can move more <hi>weight</hi> by the help of <hi>Springs, Wheels, Leavers,</hi> and other <hi>Mechanick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> than the <hi>strongest</hi> could do without them: And that we really have these <hi>Advantages,</hi> must be shewn by <hi>Instance:</hi> I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Five</hi> that are considerable to that purpose, which I took notice of among many others; and they were the <hi>Telescope, Microscope, Thermometer, Barometer,</hi> and <hi>Air Pump.</hi>

(I.) The <hi>Telescope</hi> is the most excellent <hi>Invention</hi> that ever was, for assisting the <hi>Eye</hi> in <hi>remote Discoveries.</hi> The <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the Heavens is so <hi>vast,</hi> that our <hi>unaided Senses</hi> can give us but extreamly imperfect Informations of that Upper World; And the <hi>Speculations</hi> that <hi>Antiquity</hi> hath raised upon them, have for the most part been very <hi>mean,</hi> and very <hi>false:</hi> But these excellent <hi>Glasses</hi> bring the <hi>Stars</hi> nearer to us, and acquaint us better with the <hi>immense Territories</hi> of <hi>Light:</hi> They give us more <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and <hi>truer Accounts;</hi> disperse the <hi>shadows</hi> and <hi>vain Images</hi> of the <hi>twilight</hi> of <hi>naked Sense,</hi> and make us a <hi>clearer</hi> and <hi>larger prospect:</hi> By these Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <hi>they inlarge</hi> our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and shew us a more <hi>magnificent Representation</hi> of the <hi>Vniverse:</hi> So that by them the <hi>Heavens</hi> are made more <hi>amply</hi> to <hi>declare</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and we are help'd to <hi>nobler,</hi> and better-grounded <hi>Theories:</hi> I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in my Account of the Advance of <hi>Astronomy</hi> some of the most remarkable <hi>Discoveries</hi> that have been made by <hi>these Tubes,</hi> which exceedingly transcend all the <hi>Imaginations</hi> of <hi>elder</hi> Times; and by the further improvement of them, other things may be disclosed as much beyond all <hi>ours.</hi> And the <hi>present Philosophers</hi> are so far from desiring that Posterity should sit down contented with their <hi>Discoveries</hi> and <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> that they are continually sollicitous for the gaining more <hi>helps</hi> to themselves, and <hi>those</hi> that shall follow, for a further progress into the knowledge of the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and more <hi>certain judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> upon them. So that these <hi>Glasses</hi> are exceedingly <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi> since their Invention by <hi>Metius,</hi> and <hi>application</hi> to the <hi>Heavens</hi> by <hi>Galilaeo;</hi> and several ingenious Members of the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY</hi> are now busie about improving them to a greater height: What success and informations we may expect from the <hi>Advancements</hi> of this <hi>Instrument,</hi> it would perhaps appear <hi>Romantick</hi> and <hi>ridiculous</hi> to say; As, no doubt, to have talk'd of the <hi>Spots</hi> in the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>vast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalities</hi> in the <hi>Surface</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and those other <hi>Telesco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Certainties,</hi> before the <hi>Invention</hi> of that <hi>Glass,</hi> would have been thought <hi>phantastick</hi> and <hi>absurd:</hi> I dare not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention our <hi>greatest hopes:</hi> but this I adventure, That 'tis not unlikely but <hi>Posterity</hi> may by those <hi>Tubes,</hi> when they

are brought to <hi>higher degrees</hi> of <hi>perfection,</hi> find a <hi>sure</hi> way to determine those <hi>mighty Questions, Whether the Earth move?</hi> or, <hi>the Planets are inhabited?</hi> And who knoweth which way the <hi>Conclusions</hi> may fall? And 'tis probable enough, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing will at last be found out, in which this lower World is more immediately concerned, by <hi>Telescopical Observations,</hi> which is, the most desired <hi>Invention</hi> of <hi>Longitudes;</hi> upon which must needs ensue yet greater Improvements of <hi>Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and perhaps the Discovery of the <hi>North-West</hi> Passage, and the yet <hi>unknown South:</hi> Whatever may be thought of these Expectations by vulgar and <hi>narrow</hi> Minds, whose <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Hopes</hi> are confin'd by their <hi>Senses,</hi> those that consider, that <hi>one Experiment</hi> discovered to us the vast <hi>America,</hi> will not <hi>despair.</hi> But 'tis time to pass from <hi>this,</hi> to a <hi>second Modern Aid,</hi> whereby our <hi>Sight</hi> is assisted, which is,</p>

               </p>
               <p>But (III.) The <hi>Thermometer</hi> was another <hi>Instrument</hi> I mentioned, which discovers all the small <hi>unperceivable varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in the <hi>heat</hi> or <hi>coldness</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> and exhibits many rare and <hi>luciferous Phaenomena,</hi> which may help to better Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about those <hi>Qualities,</hi> than yet we have any. And as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53288:56"/>
to this, I observe with the great <hi>Verulam,</hi> and the other <hi>Bacon</hi> the Illustrious Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> That <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> are the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>left</hi> hand of <hi>Nature:</hi> The <hi>former</hi> is the great <hi>Instrument</hi> of most of her Operations; and the <hi>other</hi> hath its <hi>Interest:</hi> And yet the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath neither <hi>done,</hi> nor as much as <hi>attempted</hi> any thing toward the Discovery of their Natures; but contented it self with the <hi>jejune, vulgar,</hi> and <hi>general</hi> description, <hi>That Heat is a Quality that gathereth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of a like nature, and severs those that are unlike;</hi> and <hi>Cold congregates both.</hi> But now if we will know any thing deeply in the business of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condensation,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Meteors,</hi> and other material Affairs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, other Accounts about these things must be endeavoured; and the bare <hi>informations</hi> of our <hi>Senses</hi> are not <hi>exact</hi> enough for this purpose; for their <hi>Reports</hi> in this kind are <hi>various</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> according to the <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>disposition</hi> of our <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and several <hi>unobserved accidental Mutations</hi> that happen in them. This <hi>Instrument</hi> therefore hath been invented to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their <hi>Defects;</hi> and it gives far more <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>accurate,</hi> though perhaps not always <hi>infallible Relations:</hi> but the justest are afforded by the <hi>Sealed Thermometer.</hi> And besides the <hi>Vses</hi> of this <hi>Instrument</hi> I suggested, it will help very much in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Weather,</hi> which may be applied to many excellent Purposes of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and Services of <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (IV.) The <hi>Barometer</hi> is another late <hi>Instrument</hi> very helpful to <hi>Vseful Knowledge:</hi> That there is <hi>gravity</hi> even in the <hi>Air</hi> it self, and that <hi>that Element</hi> is only <hi>comparatively light,</hi> is now made evident and palpable by <hi>Experience,</hi> though <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> and his <hi>Schools</hi> held a different <hi>Theory:</hi> And by the help of <hi>Quick-silver</hi> in a <hi>Tube,</hi> the way is found to measure all the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of <hi>Compression</hi> in the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> and to estimate exactly any <hi>accession</hi> of <hi>weight,</hi> which the Air receives from <hi>Winds, Clouds,</hi> and <hi>Vapours:</hi> To have said in Elder Times, That Mankind should light upon an Invention whereby those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies might be <hi>weigh'd,</hi> would certainly have appeared very <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>extravagant;</hi> and it will be <hi>so</hi> accounted for some time <hi>yet,</hi> till Men have been <hi>longer,</hi> and are <hi>better</hi> acquainted with <hi>this Instrument:</hi> For we have no reason to believe it should
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53288:56"/>
have <hi>better luck</hi> than the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Circulation,</hi> the <hi>Theory</hi> of <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and all <hi>great Discoveries</hi> in their <hi>first Proposals:</hi> 'Tis impossible to perswade some of the <hi>Indians</hi> that live near the <hi>heats</hi> of the <hi>Line,</hi> that there is any such thing as <hi>Ice</hi> in the World; but if you talk to them of <hi>Water</hi> made <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>consistent</hi> by <hi>Cold,</hi> they'l laugh at you as a <hi>noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Romancer:</hi> And those will appear as <hi>ridiculous</hi> among the most of us, who shall affirm it <hi>possible</hi> to determine any thing of the <hi>weight</hi> of the <hi>Wind</hi> or <hi>Clouds:</hi> But <hi>Experience</hi> turns the <hi>laugh</hi> upon the <hi>confident incredulity</hi> of the <hi>Scoff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

by <hi>Gesner, Rondeletius, Aldrovandus,</hi> and more accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inquir'd into by the <hi>Micrographers:</hi> And the <hi>late</hi> Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who have given us Accounts of those <hi>remote</hi> parts of the <hi>Earth,</hi> that have been less known to <hi>these,</hi> have described great <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Living Creatures,</hi> very different from the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> of the <hi>nearer Regions;</hi> among whom the <hi>ingenious</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Caribbies</hi> deserves to be mentioned as an Instance.

               </p>
               <p>Thus I have dispatch'd the <hi>FIRST Part</hi> of my <hi>Method</hi> proposed in the <hi>beginning;</hi> but stand yet ingaged for the <hi>other,</hi> which is to shew,</p>
               <p n="2">(II.) That the <hi>later</hi> Ages have great <hi>Advantages,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Opportunities and Helps for the <hi>spreading,</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and thereby of improving and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging it. This I shall demonstrate in three great Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>viz. Printing,</hi> the <hi>Compass,</hi> and the Institution of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the FIRST, <hi>Printing;</hi> It was, according to <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Virgil,</hi> the <hi>Invention</hi> of <hi>John Cuthenberg</hi> of <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> though others give the honour to one <hi>Fust</hi> of the same City, and some to <hi>Laurentius</hi> a Burger of <hi>Harlem.</hi> But whoever was the <hi>Author,</hi> this is agreed, That this excellent <hi>Art</hi> was <hi>first practised</hi> about the year 1440, and was utterly unknown in <hi>Elder Times;</hi> at least in all the parts of the World that are on this side the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> which they say had it more <hi>early;</hi> but it signifies not to our purpose. Now by reason of the <hi>Ancients</hi> want of <hi>this Invention, Copies</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:53288:59"/>
of excellent things could not be so much <hi>dispersed,</hi> nor so well <hi>preserv'd</hi> either from the <hi>Corruptions</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Interest.</hi> The <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Books</hi> was very <hi>great, Forgeries frequent,</hi> and <hi>Mistakes</hi> of <hi>Transcribers numerous:</hi> They were quickly swept away out of those few <hi>Libraries</hi> in which they were, by <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> or <hi>spoiled</hi> by <hi>Dust</hi> and <hi>Rottenness.</hi> And in the <hi>absence</hi> of this <hi>Art,</hi> 'twas easie enough for one <hi>Aristotle</hi> to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy</hi> the most considerable <hi>Remains</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> that the power of his <hi>great</hi> Scholar put into his hands; which, 'tis credibly reported of him, that he did, to procure more <hi>fame</hi> for his <hi>own</hi> Performances: as also to <hi>conceal</hi> his <hi>thefts,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious</hi> dealings with those <hi>venerable</hi> Sages, whom he seems to take a great delight to <hi>contradict</hi> and <hi>expose,</hi> as I have elsewhere proved. But <hi>now,</hi> by this <hi>excellent Invention,</hi> the Knowledge that is lodged in <hi>Books,</hi> is put beyond the danger of such <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, Forgeries,</hi> or any <hi>fatal inconvenience:</hi> We <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> upon <hi>easie</hi> terms at the <hi>remotest distance; converse</hi> with the <hi>Wise Men</hi> that went <hi>before</hi> us, and <hi>securely</hi> convey down our Conceptions to the <hi>Ages</hi> that shall follow. So that by this means <hi>Knowledge</hi> is advantagiously <hi>spread</hi> and <hi>improved;</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since the <hi>Assistance Modern Ingenuity</hi> hath brought us, in that other <hi>admirable Invention,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>Compass.</hi> How <hi>defective</hi> the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was</hi> in <hi>elder</hi> Times, when they <hi>sailed</hi> by the <hi>observation</hi> of the <hi>Stars,</hi> is <hi>easie</hi> to be <hi>imagin'd:</hi> For in dark weather, when their <hi>Pleiades, Helice,</hi> and <hi>Cynosura</hi> were hidden from them by the <hi>intervening Clouds,</hi> the <hi>Mariner</hi> was at a loss for his <hi>Guide,</hi> and exposed to the <hi>casual</hi> conduct of the <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Tides.</hi> For which reason the <hi>Ancients</hi> feldom or never durst venture into the <hi>Ocean,</hi> but steer'd along within sight of the <hi>safer</hi> Shore. So that the <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Communications</hi> of <hi>those Days</hi> were very <hi>narrow;</hi> Their <hi>famed Travels</hi> in <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison</hi> were but <hi>domestick;</hi> and a <hi>whole World</hi> was to <hi>them</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. But it hath been the happy priviledge of <hi>later</hi> Days to find the way to apply the <hi>wonderful Vertues</hi> of the <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi> to <hi>Navigation;</hi> and by the direction of the <hi>Compass</hi> we securely commit our selves to the <hi>immense Ocean,</hi> and find our path in the <hi>vastest Wilderness</hi> of <hi>Waters.</hi> So that <hi>Commerce</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:53288:59"/>
and <hi>Traffique</hi> is infinitely <hi>improved;</hi> the <hi>other</hi> half of the Globe <hi>disclosed;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> on this side the <hi>great Sea, better</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood: The <hi>Religions, Laws, Customs,</hi> and all the <hi>Rarities</hi> and <hi>Varieties</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> which any the most distant Clime knows and enjoys, are <hi>laid open</hi> and made <hi>common;</hi> and thereby the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> is wonderfully <hi>inlarged,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> is both <hi>propagated</hi> and <hi>improved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who it was that <hi>first</hi> discovered this excellent <hi>Mystery,</hi> is not certainly known: But one <hi>Flavius Goia</hi> of <hi>Amalphis</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> is said to be the <hi>Author;</hi> and to have found this incomparable <hi>Rarity</hi> about 300 years ago. 'Tis pity that one of the <hi>greatest Benefactors</hi> to Mankind that ever was, should lie hid in so <hi>neglected</hi> an <hi>obscurity;</hi> when the great <hi>Troublers</hi> of the World, who have vex'd it by the <hi>Wars</hi> of the <hi>Hand,</hi> and of the <hi>Brain,</hi> have so <hi>dear</hi> and so <hi>precious</hi> a Memory. For my part I think there is more acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to the name of this <hi>obscure</hi> Fellow, that hath scarce <hi>any</hi> left, than to a thousand <hi>Alexanders</hi> and <hi>Caesars,</hi> or to ten times the number of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s and <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s. And <hi>he</hi> really <hi>did more</hi> for the <hi>increase</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> of the World by this one <hi>Experiment,</hi> than the numerous <hi>subtile Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputers</hi> that have lived ever since the <hi>erection</hi> of the <hi>School</hi> of Wrangling.</p>
               <p>And methinks it may not be improper for me here to take notice of that other great <hi>German Invention,</hi> that useth to be mentioned in the Company, <hi>viz. That</hi> of <hi>Gun-powder</hi> and <hi>Artilery,</hi> which hath done its <hi>Service</hi> also for the <hi>help</hi> and <hi>propagation</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as you will perceive when you shall consider; that by the assistance of these <hi>terrible Engines</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> the great <hi>Western Indies</hi> were presently subdued, which likely had not been so easily effected by the <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>ordinary Methods</hi> of <hi>War.</hi> 'Twas this <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning,</hi> and the <hi>invisible Instruments</hi> of <hi>Ruine,</hi> that destroyed the <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> of those <hi>numerous</hi> and <hi>hardy People,</hi> took away the <hi>hearts</hi> of the <hi>strongest Resisters,</hi> and made them an <hi>easiy Prey</hi> to the <hi>Conquering Invaders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now by the gaining that mighty <hi>Continent,</hi> and the numerous <hi>fruitful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

a <hi>larger</hi> Field of <hi>Nature,</hi> and have thereby an <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> for <hi>more Phaenomena,</hi> and <hi>more helps</hi> both for <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and for <hi>Life;</hi> which 'tis very like that <hi>future Ages</hi> will make better use of to such Purposes, than those hitherto have <hi>done;</hi> and that <hi>Science</hi> also may at last travel into <hi>those</hi> Parts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich <hi>Peru</hi> with a more <hi>precious Treasure</hi> than <hi>that</hi> of its <hi>Golden</hi> Mines, is not improbable. And so these <hi>Engines</hi> of <hi>Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> in a <hi>sense</hi> too are <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Of the <hi>first Author</hi> of <hi>this Experiment</hi> we know no more, but that he was a <hi>German Monk,</hi> who lighted on it by <hi>chance,</hi> when he was making some <hi>Chymical Tryals</hi> with <hi>Nitre,</hi> near about the time of the <hi>Invention</hi> of the <hi>Compass;</hi> but his <hi>Name</hi> and other <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> are lost.</p>
               <p>Now whoever considers, with the Noble <hi>Virulam,</hi> how much the <hi>state</hi> of things in the World hath been <hi>altered</hi> and <hi>advanced</hi> by these <hi>THREE EXPERIMENTS</hi> alone, will conceive great hopes of Modern <hi>Experimental Attempts,</hi> from which greater Matters may be looked for, than <hi>those</hi> which were the <hi>Inventions</hi> of <hi>Single Endeavourers,</hi> or the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults</hi> of <hi>Chance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of all the <hi>Combinations</hi> of Men that ever met for the <hi>Improvement</hi> of <hi>Science,</hi> there were never any whose <hi>Designs</hi> were <hi>better laid,</hi> whose <hi>Abilities</hi> were more <hi>promising,</hi> or whose <hi>Constitution</hi> was more <hi>judiciously</hi> or <hi>advantageously</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, than the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> Noble <hi>Institution</hi> was the <hi>THIRD Advantage</hi> I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that the <hi>Modern World</hi> hath for the <hi>Communication</hi> and <hi>Increase</hi> of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> And here I find I am happily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and need not say much about it; For the <hi>HISTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY</hi> of their <hi>Constitution</hi> and <hi>Performances</hi> that is abroad, gives <hi>so full</hi> and <hi>so accurate</hi> an Account of them and their <hi>Designs,</hi> that perhaps it may be <hi>superfluous</hi> to do more in <hi>This,</hi> than to recommend that <hi>excellent Discourse</hi> to the perusal of those that would be informed about those <hi>Matters;</hi> which I do with some more than ordinary zeal and concernment, both because the Subject is one of the most weighty, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that ever afforded Matter to a <hi>Philosophical</hi> Pen, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is writ in a way of so <hi>judicious</hi> a <hi>gravity,</hi> and so <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:53288:60"/>
and <hi>modest</hi> an <hi>expression,</hi> with so much <hi>clearness</hi> of <hi>sense,</hi> and such a <hi>natural fluency</hi> of <hi>genuine Eloquence,</hi> that I know it will both <hi>profit</hi> and entertain the Ingenious. And I say further, That the <hi>Style</hi> of that Book hath all the <hi>Properties</hi> that can recommend any thing to an <hi>ingenious relish:</hi> For 'tis <hi>manly,</hi> and yet <hi>plain; natural,</hi> and yet not <hi>careless;</hi> The <hi>Epithets</hi> are <hi>genuine,</hi> the <hi>Words proper</hi> and <hi>familiar,</hi> the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods smooth</hi> and of <hi>middle</hi> proportion: It is not <hi>broken</hi> with <hi>ends</hi> of <hi>Latin,</hi> nor <hi>impertinent Quotations;</hi> nor made <hi>harsh</hi> by <hi>hard</hi> words, or <hi>needless terms</hi> of <hi>Art:</hi> Not rendred <hi>intricate</hi> by long <hi>Parentheses,</hi> nor <hi>gaudy</hi> by <hi>flanting Metaphors;</hi> not <hi>tedious</hi> by <hi>wide fetches</hi> and <hi>circumferences</hi> of <hi>Speech,</hi> nor <hi>dark</hi> by too much <hi>curtness</hi> of <hi>Expression:</hi> 'Tis not <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>unjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, rugged</hi> and <hi>uneven;</hi> but as <hi>polite</hi> and as <hi>fast</hi> as <hi>Marble;</hi> and briefly, avoids all the <hi>notorious defects,</hi> and wants none of the <hi>proper Ornaments</hi> of Language. In this excellent History the Inquisitive may find what were the Reasons of forming such a <hi>Combination</hi> as the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY,</hi> what is the <hi>Nature</hi> of that <hi>Constitution,</hi> what are their <hi>Designs,</hi> and <hi>what they have done.</hi> For there is <hi>Collection</hi> of some (among numerous others that are in their <hi>Repository</hi>) of the <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Observations,</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> which they have inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and advanced for the <hi>improvement</hi> of <hi>real, useful</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a full <hi>vindication</hi> of the Design, from the <hi>dark suspicions</hi> and <hi>objections</hi> of <hi>jealousie</hi> and <hi>ignorance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT that I may not wholly refer my Reader, which may look like a put-off, I'le here offer something concerning this <hi>Establishment,</hi> as it is an <hi>Advantage</hi> for the <hi>communication</hi> and <hi>increase</hi> of <hi>Science.</hi> I say then, That it was observed by the excellent Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> and some other <hi>ingenious Moderns,</hi> That <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which should be an <hi>Instrument</hi> to <hi>work</hi> with, to find out those <hi>Aids</hi> that <hi>Providence</hi> hath laid up in Nature to help us against the <hi>Inconveniences</hi> of <hi>this</hi> State, and to make such <hi>applications</hi> of things as may tend to <hi>universal benefit;</hi> I say, They took notice, that instead of such a <hi>Philosophy</hi> as <hi>this, That</hi> which had <hi>usurp'd</hi> the <hi>Name,</hi> and obtained in the <hi>Schools,</hi> was but a <hi>combination</hi> of <hi>general Theories,</hi> and <hi>Notions,</hi> that were concluded <hi>rashly,</hi> without <hi>due information</hi> from <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> and spun out into unprofitable <hi>Niceties,</hi> that tend to <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:53288:61"/>
but <hi>Dispute</hi> and <hi>Talk,</hi> and were never like to advance any <hi>Works</hi> for the <hi>benefit</hi> and <hi>use</hi> of Men.</p>
               <p>This being consider'd, the <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>judicious Verulam</hi> made the <hi>complaint,</hi> represented the <hi>defects</hi> and unprofitableness of the <hi>Notional</hi> way, proposed <hi>another</hi> to <hi>reform</hi> and inlarge <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> by <hi>Observation</hi> and <hi>Experiment,</hi> to <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>record Particulars,</hi> and so to rise by degrees of <hi>Induction</hi> to <hi>general Propositions,</hi> and from <hi>them</hi> to take <hi>direction</hi> for <hi>new Inquiries,</hi> and <hi>more Discoveries,</hi> and other <hi>Axioms;</hi> that our Notions may have a <hi>Foundation</hi> upon which a <hi>solid Philosophy</hi> may be built, that may be <hi>firm, tite,</hi> and close <hi>knit</hi> and suited to the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of things: So that <hi>Nature</hi> being <hi>known,</hi> it may be <hi>master'd, managed,</hi> and <hi>used</hi> in the Services of Humane Life.</p>
               <p>This was a <hi>mighty Design, groundedly laid, wisely exprest,</hi> and <hi>happily recommended</hi> by the <hi>Glorious Author,</hi> who <hi>began nobly,</hi> and <hi>directed</hi> with an <hi>incomparable conduct</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Judgment:</hi> But to the carrying of it on, It was necessary there should be many <hi>Heads</hi> and many <hi>Hands,</hi> and <hi>Those</hi> formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an <hi>Assembly,</hi> that might <hi>intercommunicate</hi> their <hi>Tryals</hi> and <hi>Observations,</hi> that might joyntly <hi>work,</hi> and joyntly <hi>consider;</hi> that so the <hi>improvable</hi> and <hi>luciferous Phaenomena,</hi> that lie scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd up and down in the <hi>vast Campaign</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> might be <hi>aggregated</hi> and brought into a <hi>common</hi> Store. This the <hi>Great</hi> Man <hi>desired,</hi> and form'd a <hi>SOCIETY</hi> of <hi>Experimenters</hi> in a <hi>Romantick Model,</hi> but could do no more; His time was not ripe for such Performances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These</hi> things therefore were consider'd also by the later <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosi,</hi> who several of them join'd together, and set themselves on work upon this <hi>grand</hi> Design; in which they have been so happy, as to obtain the <hi>Royal Countenance</hi> and <hi>Establishment,</hi> to gather a great Body of <hi>generous</hi> Persons of all <hi>Qualities</hi> and sorts of <hi>Learning,</hi> to overcome the <hi>difficulties</hi> of the <hi>Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and to make a very encouraging and hopeful <hi>progress</hi> in their pursuits: For the account of which Particulars, I refer to the <hi>History,</hi> and only take notice, How ignorantly those <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>inconsiderate</hi> People talk, who speak of this <hi>Assembly</hi> as if they were a company of Men whose only aim is to set up some <hi>new Theories</hi> and <hi>Notions</hi> in <hi>Philosophy;</hi> whereas indeed, Their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53288:61"/>
                  <hi>first</hi> and <hi>chief</hi> Imployment is, carefully to <hi>seek</hi> and faithfully to <hi>report</hi> how things are <hi>de facto;</hi> and they continually declare against the <hi>establishment</hi> of <hi>Theories,</hi> and <hi>Speculative Doctrines,</hi> which they note as one of the most considerable <hi>miscarriages</hi> in the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of the Schools: And their business is not to <hi>Dispute,</hi> but <hi>Work.</hi> So that those others also that look on them as pursuing <hi>phansyful Designs,</hi> are as <hi>wide</hi> and <hi>unjust</hi> in their ill-contriv'd <hi>Censure:</hi> Since Their <hi>Aims</hi> are to free <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> from the vain <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Compositions</hi> of <hi>Phansie,</hi> by making it <hi>palpable,</hi> and bringing it down to the <hi>plain Objects</hi> of the <hi>Senses;</hi> For those are the <hi>Faculties</hi> which they employ and appeal to, and complain that <hi>Knowledge</hi> hath too long ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in the <hi>Clouds</hi> of <hi>Imagination:</hi> So that methinks this <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Reproach</hi> is, as if those that doted on the <hi>Tales</hi> of the <hi>Fabulous Age,</hi> should clamour against <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> as idle <hi>Romancers.</hi> For the main intention of this <hi>Society</hi> is to erect a well grounded <hi>Natural History,</hi> which takes off the <hi>heats</hi> of <hi>wanton Phansie,</hi> hinders its <hi>extravagant Excursions,</hi> and ties it down to <hi>sober Realities.</hi>

Another <hi>Section</hi> of the <hi>Vsefulness</hi> of <hi>Experimental Philosophy,</hi> as to the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> over <hi>inferiour</hi> Creatures; where he intends to premise some <hi>general Considerations</hi> about the <hi>Means</hi> whereby <hi>Experimental Philosophy</hi> may become <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to Humane Life; proceeding thence to shew, That the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> may be promoted by the <hi>Naturalists</hi> skill in <hi>Chymistry,</hi> by his skill in <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> or the <hi>Application</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks</hi> to <hi>Instruments</hi> and <hi>Engines;</hi> by his skill in <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi> both <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>mixt:</hi> That the <hi>Goods</hi> of Mankind may be much increased by the <hi>Naturalist</hi>'s insight into <hi>Trades;</hi> That the <hi>Naturalist</hi> may much advantage Men, by exciting and assisting their <hi>curiosity</hi> to <hi>discover, take notice,</hi> and make <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>home-bred Riches</hi> and Advantages of <hi>particular</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and to increase their number, by transferring thither <hi>those</hi> of others; That a <hi>ground</hi> of high <hi>expectation</hi> from <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philosophy</hi> is given, by the happy <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> Age, and the <hi>productions</hi> of it; That a ground of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting considerable things from <hi>Experimental</hi> Philosophy is given by those things which have been found out by <hi>illiterate Tradesmen,</hi> or lighted on by <hi>chance;</hi> That some <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>concealed</hi> property of a <hi>natural</hi> thing, may inable the <hi>knowers</hi> of it to perform, with <hi>ease,</hi> things, that to others seem either not <hi>feasible,</hi> or not <hi>practicable</hi> without great <hi>difficulty;</hi> That by the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>application</hi> of some <hi>unobvious</hi> and <hi>unheeded Properties</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of natural things, divers <hi>Effects</hi> may be produced by other <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> than those one would judge <hi>likely;</hi> and even by <hi>such,</hi> as if proposed, would be thought <hi>unlikely;</hi> That the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>peculiar</hi> Qualities, or uses of <hi>Physical</hi> things, may inable a Man to perform those things <hi>Physically,</hi> that seem to require <hi>Books,</hi> and <hi>dexterity</hi> of hand proper to <hi>Artificers;</hi> That the <hi>uses</hi> of scarce <hi>one</hi> thing in Nature, to Humane Life, are yet <hi>thorowly</hi> understood; That a great Inducement to hope for considerable Matters from <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philosophy,</hi> may be taken from the <hi>mutual</hi> assistance that the <hi>Practical</hi> and <hi>Theorical</hi> part of <hi>Physick</hi> may be brought to afford each other; That we are not to make our <hi>Estimates</hi> of what may be <hi>hoped</hi> for hereafter, when Men shall be assisted

                  <hi>This</hi> is the Account I received of that <hi>Noble</hi> Person's <hi>further</hi> Designs for the advantage of Useful Knowledge; and though he hath not made an <hi>absolute</hi> Promise of those Discourses to the Publique, yet he is known to have <hi>such,</hi> and they are with <hi>probability</hi> expected, since he is <hi>too generous</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the <hi>capable</hi> and <hi>inquisitive</hi> those his <hi>excellent Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,</hi> which tend to the <hi>common Benefit.</hi> And thus I have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53288:66"/>
said what may suffice for general Information about the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY,</hi> and the hopes we may justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of <hi>this Constitution.</hi> And in what I have discoursed, I have not deviated from my <hi>undertaking,</hi> which was to shew the <hi>advantage</hi> that <hi>this latter</hi> Age hath, for the promotion and increase of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> above those of former Times: For by describing the <hi>Reasons, Nature,</hi> and some of the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>this Establishment,</hi> I have not <hi>obscurely</hi> suggested the Helps that the World hath and may expect from <hi>Them,</hi> for those great and noble <hi>Purposes;</hi> and 'tis easie to see in the very <hi>frame</hi> of this <hi>Assembly,</hi> that they are fitted with Opportunities to collect most of the considerable <hi>Notices, Observations,</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,</hi> that are scattered up and down in the <hi>wide</hi> World; and so, to make a <hi>Bank</hi> of all the <hi>Vseful Knowledge</hi> that is among Men: For either by their <hi>whole Body,</hi> or <hi>some</hi> or <hi>other</hi> of their <hi>particular</hi> Members, they hold a <hi>Learned Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> with the greatest <hi>Virtuosi</hi> of all the known <hi>Vniverse,</hi> and have several of their own <hi>Fellows</hi> abroad in <hi>Forreign</hi> Parts, by reason of whose <hi>Communications,</hi> they know most of the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Rarities</hi> and <hi>Phaenomena</hi> observed by the curious in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>all considerable</hi> Attempts and Performances of <hi>Art, Ingenuity,</hi> and <hi>Experiment:</hi> To which consideration, if we add the <hi>inquisitiveness</hi> of their <hi>Genius,</hi> and the <hi>way</hi> of their proceeding, by <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>cautious Observation;</hi> the <hi>cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>shiness</hi> of their <hi>Assent,</hi> and the <hi>numbers</hi> of <hi>judicious</hi> Men that <hi>carefully</hi> examine their <hi>Reports;</hi> I say, If these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars be weighed, it will appear to the unprejudiced, That the World had never <hi>such</hi> an <hi>advantage</hi> for the <hi>accumulating</hi> a <hi>Treasure</hi> of <hi>substantial Knowledge,</hi> as it hath by <hi>this Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> For <hi>single</hi> Inquisitors can receive but <hi>scant</hi> and <hi>narrow</hi> Informations, either from their <hi>own Experience,</hi> or <hi>Converses;</hi> and <hi>those</hi> they <hi>have,</hi> are frequently very <hi>imperfect,</hi> or very <hi>mistaken:</hi> There is often either <hi>vanity</hi> or <hi>credulity, ignorance</hi> or <hi>design</hi> in their <hi>Relations,</hi> which therefore are many times <hi>false</hi> in the <hi>main</hi> Matter, and oftner in the <hi>Circumstance:</hi> So that the <hi>Histories</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> we have <hi>hitherto</hi> had, have been but an <hi>heap</hi> and <hi>amassment</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood, Vulgar Tales,</hi> and <hi>Romantick</hi> Accounts; and 'tis not in the power of <hi>particular unassociated</hi> Endeavours to afford us <hi>better:</hi> But now, the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53288:66"/>
frame of this <hi>Society</hi> suggests excellent ground to hope from them <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>universal Relations,</hi> and the best <hi>grounded</hi> and most useful Collection of the Affairs of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> that ever yet was extant: And as they have <hi>peculiar</hi> Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges for the gathering the <hi>Materials</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> so They have the <hi>same</hi> for the <hi>impartment</hi> and <hi>diffusion</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>I should now put an end to this Discourse, but that there is another common prejudice against the <hi>ROYAL SOCIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY,</hi> and all those of that Genius, to which I must speak a little; The Charge is, That they despise the Ancients, and all old Learning, which have been venerable among the best and wisest of all Times. To this I say, That the Modern, free Philosophers, are most ready to do right to the Learned Ancients, by acknowledging their Wit, and all the useful Theories, and Helps we have from them; They read, and consider their Writings, and chearfully entertain any Notices, or Observations they have imparted to us: They have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for their great names, and are ready to do honour to them: But yet they do not think that those, however vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sages, should have an absolute Empire over the Reasons of Mankind; nor do they believe, That all the Riches of <hi>Nature</hi> were discovered to some <hi>few particular Men</hi> of former Times; and that there is nothing left for the <hi>benefit</hi> and <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> of after-Inquirers: No; <hi>They</hi> know, There is an <hi>inexhaustible variety</hi> of <hi>Treasure</hi> which <hi>Providence</hi> hath lodged in Things, that to the Worlds end will afford <hi>fresh Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and suffice to reward the <hi>ingenious Industry</hi> and <hi>Researches</hi> of those that <hi>look</hi> into the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>go down to see his Wonders in the Deep.</hi> This, no doubt, the <hi>modesty</hi> and <hi>justice</hi> of the <hi>Ancients</hi> themselves would have confess'd: But besides this, the <hi>Modern Experimenters</hi> think, That the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi> of elder Times, though their <hi>Wits</hi> were excellent, yet the way they took was not like to bring much <hi>advantage</hi> to <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> or any of the <hi>Vses</hi> of <hi>humane Life;</hi> being for the most part <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Dispute,</hi> which still runs round in a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of <hi>Talk,</hi> but <hi>advanceth nothing:</hi> And the <hi>unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of those <hi>disputing Methods,</hi> which directly and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves never brought the World so much <hi>practical, beneficial</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:53288:67"/>
                  <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as would help towards the <hi>Cure</hi> of a <hi>Cut Finger,</hi> or the <hi>Cooling</hi> of an <hi>Hot Head,</hi> is a palpable Argument, That they were <hi>fundamental Mistakes,</hi> and that the <hi>Way</hi> was not <hi>right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> observes well, <hi>Philosophy,</hi> as well as <hi>Faith,</hi> must be <hi>shewn</hi> by its <hi>Works:</hi> And if the <hi>Moderns</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not shew more of the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>their Philosophy</hi> in <hi>six years,</hi> than the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> can produce of <hi>theirs,</hi> in the compass of as many Ages, let them be loaded with all that <hi>Contempt</hi> which is usually the <hi>reward</hi> of <hi>vain,</hi> and <hi>unprofitable Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.</hi> I say then the <hi>Modern Philosophers</hi> arrogate nothing to their own <hi>Wit,</hi> above that of the <hi>Ancients:</hi> but by the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> os the <hi>thing,</hi> and <hi>material, sensible Events,</hi> they find they have an advantage by their <hi>way.</hi> And a <hi>lame Child</hi> that <hi>slowly</hi> treads the <hi>right Path,</hi> will at last arrive to his Journeys end; while the <hi>swift Footman</hi> that <hi>runs</hi> about in a <hi>Wood,</hi> will <hi>lose</hi> himself in his <hi>wandrings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithstanding all this, there are some of Opinion that <hi>Aristotle</hi> had more advantages for Knowledge than the Moderns, because he had the Survey of all <hi>Asia,</hi> by those who at the charge of his great <hi>Scholar</hi> were imploy'd to make <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.</hi> This I have heard alledg'd; but I think this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is very defective, both in what it affirms, and in what it would infer.</p>
               <p>For first, 'Tis evident that <hi>Aristotle</hi> and the <hi>Ancients</hi> did not know all <hi>ASIA;</hi> for that part which lay beyond the River, was in a manner a <hi>Terra Incognita</hi> unto them: so that they knew scarce any thing of the <hi>Indies</hi> that lie on the other side of <hi>Ganges,</hi> little or nothing of the vast Kingdom of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> nothing of <hi>Japan,</hi> or the numerous <hi>Oriental Islands,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the defects in the ancient <hi>Geography,</hi> noted above; and these made a <hi>great,</hi> if not the <hi>best</hi> part of <hi>Asia;</hi> of which though <hi>Aristotle</hi> might have <hi>heard,</hi> yet we have no shadow of Reason to believe that he had any Informations from thence. And then I consider,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That the Account he had from the best <hi>survey'd</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, were but from <hi>Hunters, Fowlers, Fishermen,</hi> and such kind of <hi>Inquisitors,</hi> who were like enough to make <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>mistaken Reports,</hi> and he was fain to depend upon the <hi>credit</hi> of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53288:67"/>
their <hi>Relations;</hi> and therefore 'tis observ'd by Learned Men that his <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> contains many things that are <hi>frivolous,</hi> and many that are <hi>palpably false.</hi> To which I add,</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The remarque of my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> That though <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> made some <hi>use</hi> of those <hi>Experiments;</hi> and <hi>Observations</hi> he had from those <hi>Informers,</hi> yet it was after he had <hi>concluded</hi> and <hi>decreed.</hi> For he did not <hi>use</hi> and imploy <hi>Experiments</hi> for the <hi>erecting</hi> of his <hi>Theories:</hi> but having <hi>arbitrarily</hi> pitch'd his <hi>Theories,</hi> his manner was to force <hi>Experience</hi> to <hi>suffragate,</hi> and yield countenance to his <hi>precarious Propositions.</hi> And on this account, the <hi>Great</hi> Man saith, he was less <hi>excusable</hi> than the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> who altogether quitted and neglected the way of particular <hi>Industry</hi> and <hi>Experiment.</hi> Thus then <hi>Aristotle</hi> neither knew all <hi>Asia,</hi> nor had certain <hi>Relations</hi> of that part thereof, of which he had the best Informations; nor did he use those he had as he ought; which were enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the conceit of his Superlative Advantages. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider further, That though these things had been otherwise, and as much for the <hi>interest</hi> of the fond <hi>Phansy</hi> as could be wish'd, yet,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>Inference</hi> must <hi>fail,</hi> since the <hi>latter</hi> Ages have a much <hi>larger</hi> World than <hi>Aristotle's Asia;</hi> We have <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and the many <hi>New</hi> Lands that are <hi>discovered</hi> by <hi>Modern Navigators;</hi> we have <hi>larger</hi> and more <hi>perfect Geography</hi> even of the <hi>old</hi> World, infinitely more <hi>acquaintance</hi> and <hi>better</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence in all the parts of the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> by our <hi>general Traffique,</hi> than the <hi>Ancients;</hi> whose <hi>Commerce</hi> was narrow, and knowledge of <hi>remote</hi> Parts consisted but in <hi>hearsays,</hi> and <hi>doubtful Rumors-</hi> We <hi>have</hi> besides, <hi>New Heavens</hi> as well as a <hi>New Earth,</hi> a larger and truer prospect of the World above us. We have <hi>travell'd</hi> those <hi>upper</hi> Regions by the <hi>help</hi> of our <hi>Tubes,</hi> and made <hi>Discoveries</hi> more becoming the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Magnificence</hi> of <hi>our Creatour,</hi> and more agreeable to the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances</hi> of things, than the <hi>arbitrary</hi> Phansies and Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his <hi>Schools.</hi> We have a <hi>greater World</hi> of <hi>Arts, Instruments,</hi> and <hi>Observations,</hi> as in all <hi>Particulars</hi> my Discourse hath made good. And what are <hi>Aristotle's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragrations of Asia,</hi> to all <hi>these?</hi> To the <hi>great Western Indies;</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:53288:68"/>
to the fuller and clearer knowledge of the <hi>Ancient Lands;</hi> to those <hi>nobler</hi> Accounts we have of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and <hi>universal Nature;</hi> to our vast <hi>Improvements</hi> of <hi>Chymistry, Anatomy, Arithmetick, Geometry, Astronomy, Geography, Opticks, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural History, Navigation,</hi> and all things else of benefit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction? I say, <hi>What</hi> are the <hi>gleanings</hi> of a <hi>few mercenary Hunters, Fowlers,</hi> and <hi>Fishermen,</hi> over <hi>one</hi> part of <hi>Asia,</hi> to <hi>these</hi> Advantages? And what are the <hi>Reports</hi> of a <hi>few ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fellows,</hi> and the <hi>Tryals</hi> of a <hi>single Person,</hi> to the learned Inquiries and Endeavours of <hi>many sagacious inquisitive Ages,</hi> and the performances of a <hi>numerous Company</hi> of <hi>deep, wary, diligent,</hi> and <hi>Eagle-ey'd Philosophers,</hi> who have the help of <hi>those</hi> Observations, and the addition of an <hi>infinite number more?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But my Design is, by representing the <hi>advantages</hi> and <hi>hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of the <hi>Modern Way,</hi> to kindle an ardour towards the <hi>generous Experimental Researches,</hi> to vindicate <hi>Philosophy</hi> from the <hi>imputation</hi> of being <hi>notional</hi> and <hi>unprofitable,</hi> and to keep Men from adhering to that which is <hi>so,</hi> and hath been the occasion of the <hi>scandal.</hi> And as for <hi>those</hi> that yet stick <hi>there,</hi> I have some things to observe concerning the <hi>Reasons</hi> of their <hi>Devotion</hi> to that <hi>airy disputative Philosophy,</hi> and their <hi>Enmity</hi> to the <hi>Practical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I consider then, That <hi>easie Youth</hi> in its <hi>first Addresses</hi> to Learning, is wholly <hi>passive</hi> to the <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Instructions</hi> of its <hi>Teachers,</hi> whose <hi>Documents</hi> are <hi>promiscuously</hi> received with ready submission of Understandings, that <hi>implicitly</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on <hi>their Authority.</hi> We suck in the first Rudiments as we <hi>do</hi> the <hi>common Air</hi> [<hi>facili haustu</hi>] as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it, <hi>without discrimination</hi> or <hi>election,</hi> of which indeed our tender and unexcercised Minds are not capable. And, I confess, 'tis <hi>necessary</hi> we should do so; nor were there any hurt in this <hi>innocent</hi> easiness, did not most Men <hi>all their lives</hi> worship the <hi>first</hi> thing they saw in the <hi>morning</hi> of their <hi>days,</hi> and <hi>ever after</hi> obstinately adhere to those unexamined Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>mischief,</hi> we infinitely <hi>believe every thing</hi> when we are <hi>Children;</hi> and <hi>most</hi> examine little when they are <hi>Men,</hi> but <hi>settle</hi> in their <hi>first Impressions,</hi> without giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53288:68"/>
the <hi>trouble</hi> to-consider and <hi>review</hi> them. And <hi>these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,</hi> by <hi>custom</hi> and <hi>long acquaintance</hi> with our Souls, get a <hi>mighty</hi> interest, and shut them up against every thing that is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from those <hi>Images of Education.</hi> This is a <hi>general fault</hi> and <hi>infirmity</hi> of <hi>humane Nature,</hi> and from hence it comes to pass, that the tutour'd <hi>Youth</hi> slides <hi>easily</hi> into the belief of the <hi>first Principles</hi> of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which they are taught, and are confirm'd in them by their <hi>Exercises</hi> and <hi>Disputes,</hi> and <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Converses:</hi> By <hi>these</hi> their <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> which <hi>before</hi> were <hi>White-Paper,</hi> are <hi>dyed</hi> and <hi>deeply tinctured</hi> by the colour they have <hi>imbibed;</hi> And <hi>these infusions</hi> insensibly pass as 'twere into the very <hi>substance</hi> of the Mind, and are appeal'd to, on all occasions, as unsophisticated Truths. So that having spent some time in <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>trimming</hi> those Notions, <hi>the most</hi> divert to <hi>Business,</hi> or <hi>other</hi> Studies, without troubling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with any more <hi>Philosophical</hi> Pursuits; but being satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with those <hi>Notices</hi> which their <hi>first</hi> Education lodg'd in their Minds, they seek no <hi>further,</hi> nor do care to be <hi>wiser</hi> in those Matters, than they were in the <hi>disputing Infancy</hi> of their Knowledge.</p>
               <p>All this while no other <hi>hurt</hi> is <hi>done,</hi> but that Men thus are injurious to <hi>themselves,</hi> and hinder their <hi>own</hi> Improvements: but 'tis <hi>much worse</hi> when they fondly <hi>fix these</hi> as the <hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>Science,</hi> and would have no body <hi>else</hi> go further than their <hi>laziness</hi> or their <hi>cares</hi> will permit them to travel; but <hi>rail</hi> spitefully at <hi>all</hi> Endeavours for the advancement of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Wisdom,</hi> and will be angry with every one that hath outgrown his <hi>Cherry-stones</hi> and <hi>Rattles;</hi> speak evil at a <hi>venture</hi> of things they know not, and like <hi>Mastives,</hi> are <hi>fiercer</hi> for being kept <hi>dark.</hi> These are the great Enemies of the <hi>useful, experimental Methods</hi> of <hi>Philosophy:</hi> They take it ill that <hi>any</hi> thing should be accounted valuable, in which they are unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, being loth to <hi>learn</hi> in an Age wherein they expect to <hi>Dictate;</hi> and the <hi>Satyrist</hi> hath told them another reason.</p>

They imployed their <hi>Younger</hi> Studies upon the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Disputation,</hi> and, it may be, gain'd an ability to out-talk <hi>many</hi> of their <hi>Contemporaries</hi> in <hi>that</hi> way. They <hi>confirm'd</hi> themselves in these <hi>Notions</hi> by instructing <hi>others</hi> in them, and upon <hi>these</hi> Foundations have built the Reputation of being <hi>great Scholars,</hi> and <hi>mighty Disputants</hi> among their <hi>Admirers.</hi> So that we are not to wonder, if they are <hi>vehemently</hi> displeas'd with the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY,</hi> and <hi>Experimental Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,</hi> since their Designs take away the <hi>honour</hi> of their <hi>Craft,</hi> and in <hi>this way,</hi> They are upon the same <hi>level</hi> with those that are <hi>but beginning;</hi> the thought of which must needs be distasteful to <hi>self-absur'd</hi> and <hi>imperious</hi> Minds.

               <p>And in the <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> I acknowledge them in the words of the incomparable Droll;
<q>

                     <l>As Metaphysick Wit can fly.</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>These,</hi> and other such <hi>Profundities,</hi> are some of the <hi>main</hi> things of that <hi>Philosophy,</hi> for which <hi>Peripatetick Disputers</hi> are so zealous. But for the <hi>Mechanick,</hi> that attempts <hi>material</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> Accounts of things, and is in its <hi>grounds</hi> much <hi>ancienter</hi> than that of <hi>Aristotle</hi> which they admire; for the <hi>Experimental</hi> Methods, and <hi>late</hi> Improvements of <hi>useful</hi> Knowledge; Many of these Men have a suspicion, if not a contempt of them: Nor do they pretend any acquaintance with those Studies: For concluding that nothing more is to be known, than They learnt in the Circle of Disputations, they sit down in the Opinion of the perfection of their Knowledge, without caring to be inform'd what the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive World is doing in this Age of Enquiry.</p>
               <p>And on this occasion, I observe the <hi>incompetency</hi> of <hi>their Judgments,</hi> who are <hi>Enemies</hi> to the <hi>Real Experimental Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi> in that they do not (as I intimated) <hi>at all,</hi> or <hi>very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, understand</hi> what they <hi>condemn,</hi> This I have some reason to say, since in the whole <hi>compass</hi> of my Acquaintance, which is not very <hi>narrow,</hi> I profess I know not <hi>one</hi> who opposeth the <hi>Modern</hi> way, that is not <hi>almost totally unacquainted</hi> with it. And on the other side, upon the most careful turn of my thoughts among my <hi>Philosophical</hi> Friends, I cannot light on <hi>one</hi> of all those, that are <hi>for</hi> the <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Experimental</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53288:70"/>
but who have been very well instructed in the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick Doctrines,</hi> which they have deserted, and <hi>most of them</hi> much <hi>better</hi> than those who are yet <hi>zealous Contenders</hi> for them.</p>
               <p>And for my <hi>own</hi> part, I must confess, That while I was a Youth in the University, I was much delighted with those <hi>subtilties</hi> that exercise the Brain in the <hi>Nicities</hi> of <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Distinctions,</hi> and afford a great deal of <hi>idle Imployment</hi> for the Tongue in the <hi>Combates</hi> of <hi>Disputation:</hi> In which I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I was none of the most <hi>backward,</hi> but being highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with those Engagements, I found as much diversion in them, as in my dearest Recreations. But after I had spent some years in those <hi>Notional</hi> Studies, perhaps with as good success as some others, I began to think <hi>CVI BONO:</hi> and to <hi>consider</hi> what <hi>these</hi> things would <hi>signifie</hi> in the World of <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Business,</hi> I say, I <hi>thought;</hi> but I could find no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to <hi>proceed</hi> from the Answer my thoughts made me: I ask'd my self, what Accounts I could give of the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by my Philosophy, <hi>more</hi> than those that have <hi>none,</hi> and found, that I could <hi>amaze</hi> and <hi>astonish Ignorance</hi> with <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions</hi> and <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> but not <hi>satisfie ingenious Inquiry</hi> by any <hi>considerable</hi> and <hi>material Resolutions.</hi> I <hi>consider'd</hi> I had got nothing all this while, but a certain <hi>readiness</hi> in talking, and that about things which I could not use <hi>abroad,</hi> without being <hi>Pedantick</hi> and <hi>ridiculous.</hi> I perceived that <hi>that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy</hi> aimed at <hi>no more,</hi> than the <hi>instructing</hi> Men in <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Dispute;</hi> That its <hi>Design</hi> was <hi>mean,</hi> and its <hi>Principles</hi> at the <hi>best uncertain</hi> and <hi>precarious;</hi> That <hi>they</hi> did not <hi>agree</hi> among <hi>themselves,</hi> nor <hi>at all</hi> with <hi>Nature.</hi> I <hi>examined</hi> the best Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords I could meet with about the <hi>Author</hi> of those <hi>current Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses,</hi> but could not be <hi>assured</hi> that <hi>Aristotle</hi> was <hi>he.</hi> I saw many Reasons to believe, that most of the <hi>Books</hi> that bear <hi>his Name,</hi> are <hi>none</hi> of <hi>his;</hi> and <hi>those that are</hi> most <hi>strongly</hi> presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be <hi>so,</hi> are mightily <hi>altered</hi> and <hi>corrupted</hi> by <hi>Time, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Carelesness</hi> and <hi>Design.</hi> I perceived that the <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators</hi> and late <hi>Disputers</hi> had exceedingly <hi>disguised</hi> and <hi>changed</hi> the <hi>Sense</hi> of those very Writings, and made up a <hi>Philosophy</hi> that was <hi>quite another thing</hi> from <hi>that</hi> which <hi>those</hi> Books con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. So that by <hi>these</hi> means I was by degrees taken off from
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53288:70"/>
the <hi>implicit Veneration</hi> I had for <hi>that Learning,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the great Name of <hi>Aristotle</hi> which it bore. And thus the great <hi>impediment</hi> was removed, and the prejudice of <hi>Education</hi> overcome; when I thought further, That <hi>useful</hi> Knowledge was to be look'd for in <hi>God's great Book</hi> the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi> and among those <hi>generous</hi> Men that had convers'd with <hi>real</hi> Nature, <hi>undisguised</hi> with <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Notion.</hi> And still I saw <hi>more</hi> of the <hi>justice</hi> of the excellent <hi>Poet</hi>'s Censure of those No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Philosophers, when he saith,
<q>
                     <l>They stand</l>
                     <l>Lock'd up together hand in hand:</l>
                     <l>Every one leads as he is led,</l>
                     <l>The same bare Path they tread,</l>
                     <l>And dance like Fairies a phantastick Round;</l>
                     <l>But neither change their Motion, nor their Ground.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>this Philosophy</hi> therefore, and <hi>these Men,</hi> I diverted my <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Hopes,</hi> and <hi>fixt</hi> them upon <hi>those Methods</hi> that I have recommended, which I am sure are liable to none of those <hi>Imputations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I think fit to add a Caution which I have given in another Discourse, and do it once more to prevent a dangerous misunderstanding, <hi>viz.</hi> [And it is, That I have said nothing of this, to discourage <hi>young Academians</hi> from applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to those <hi>first</hi> Studies, which are in <hi>use</hi> in the <hi>Vniversities.</hi> Their <hi>Statutes</hi> require <hi>Exercises</hi> in <hi>that way</hi> of <hi>Learning;</hi> and <hi>so much</hi> knowledge of <hi>it,</hi> as inables for <hi>those Duties,</hi> is very <hi>fit.</hi> Nor do I <hi>deny,</hi> but that <hi>those Speculations</hi> raise, <hi>quicken,</hi> and <hi>whet</hi> the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and on that account may not be altogether <hi>unprofitable,</hi> with respect to the more <hi>useful Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitious;</hi> provided it keep it self from being <hi>nice, airy,</hi> and <hi>addicted</hi> too much to <hi>general</hi> Notions. But <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>danger,</hi> and the <hi>greatest part</hi> run upon the Rock. The <hi>hazard</hi> of which might in great measure be avoided, if the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> and <hi>Natural History</hi> were mingled with these <hi>other Studies,</hi> which would indeed be excellent <hi>Preparatives</hi> and <hi>Dispositions</hi> to <hi>future</hi> Improvements. And I add further, That the <hi>young Philosophers</hi> must take care of looking on their <hi>Systema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:53288:71"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>IT</hi> is the perverse Opinion of hasty, inconsiderate Men, that the <hi>study</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> is prejudicial to the Interests of <hi>Religion;</hi> And some, who are more zealous than they are wise, endeavour to render the <hi>Naturalist</hi> suspected of holding secret correspondence with the <hi>Atheist:</hi> which things if really they were so, 'twere fit that the <hi>Writings</hi> of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> should be sent after the Books of <hi>curious</hi> Arts, that were voted to Destruction by <hi>Apostolick</hi> Authority and Zeal; and <hi>then</hi> were they all laid together in a fired heap, and one Drop from my Finger would quench the Flames, I would not let fall that Drop. But 'tis to be hoped there is no such <hi>guilt</hi> or <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> in the case; we may suppose rather, that those unkind surmisals concerning <hi>natural Wisdom,</hi> are the effects of <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious</hi>

                  <hi>Ignorance;</hi> yea, I doubt they are some of the Reliques of <hi>that Barbarism,</hi> that made Magick of <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and Heresie of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, were this <hi>gross</hi> conceit about the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> only the fear and fancy of the meer vulgar, it were to be pardon'd easily, and lightly to be consider'd; but the <hi>worst</hi> is, the infection of the weak jealousie hath spread it self among some of those <hi>whose Lips should preserve Knowledge;</hi> and there are, I doubt, divers of the <hi>Instructers</hi> of the People, who should endeavour to deliver them from the vain <hi>Images</hi> of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that foment those fears in their <hi>own</hi> Imaginations, and <hi>theirs.</hi> For the sake of <hi>such,</hi> and those others, who are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Conviction, I shall endeavour to justific <hi>sober Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> into <hi>God's Works;</hi> and to shew, that they are not only <hi>innocent,</hi> but very <hi>useful</hi> in most of the Affairs wherein <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is concerned. This I shall do, for more clearness of proof, by a gradual motion of Discourse, from things that are plain, and acknowledg'd (which I shall touch briefly) to the main Matter I would enforce: In this order;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>(I.) That</hi> God is to be praised for his Works.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>(II.) That</hi> his Works are to be studied by those that would praise him for them.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>(III.) That</hi> the study of Nature, and God's Works, is very serviceable to Religion.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>(IV.) That</hi> the Ministers and Professors of Religion ought not to discourage, but promote the knowledge of Nature, and the Works of its Author.</item>
               </list>
               <p>THe FIRST contains two things, <hi>viz. That God is to be praised;</hi> and particularly <hi>for his Works.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> is the constant Voice of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Universal</hi> Nature; <hi>He is worthy to be praised,</hi> saith the Kingly Prophet, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 4. <hi>Greatly to be praised,</hi> saith the same Royal Saint, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 25. We are to offer him the <hi>Sacrifice of Praise,</hi> Heb. 13. 15. And are encouraged to do so, because, <hi>It is good to sing Praises;</hi> and <hi>praise is comely for the upright,</hi> Psal. 1. 47. and <hi>Psalm.</hi> 33.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53288:73"/>
To recite all the particular recommendations and commands of this duty, were endless, I only mention the next to my thoughts, and add,</p>
               <p>That <hi>Nature</hi> saith the same; That <hi>Praise</hi> is the Tribute that is due to the Author of our Beings; And we can offer him nothing <hi>less,</hi> and in a manner nothing <hi>else.</hi> All the World have been unanimous in <hi>this,</hi> and the rudest part of Mankind, have owned the dueness of <hi>Praise</hi> and devout Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment.</p>
               <p>And (II.) the <hi>other</hi> Branch is as clear, That <hi>God is to be praised particularly for his Works;</hi> For in <hi>these</hi> we have very full discoveries of his <hi>Perfections,</hi> and his <hi>Mercies,</hi> the most proper Subjects for our <hi>Praises.</hi> But here I must be more large, and therefore propose the following things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) When God himself would represent his own <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> he directs us to his <hi>Works.</hi> He illustrates his <hi>Greatness</hi> to <hi>Job,</hi> by instancing the Wonders of his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> Among whom we are sent to the <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Ocean;</hi> to the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and <hi>Rain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And again (2.) when <hi>devout</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Men would quicken their own Souls, and <hi>those</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> to <hi>praise</hi> him, they use the <hi>same</hi> method, and send abroad their Thoughts among the <hi>Creatures</hi> to gather instances of acknowledgment. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> magnifieth his <hi>Power</hi> by the <hi>Lightning</hi> and <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> by the <hi>Snow</hi> and <hi>Rain,</hi> by the <hi>Whirlwinds</hi> of the <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> of the <hi>South,</hi> and calls upon his afflicted Friend to <hi>remember to magnifie his Works that Men behold;</hi> and again bids him stand still, and consider the <hi>wondrous Works of God,</hi> Job 36, and 37 Chapters. And the <hi>Psalmist</hi> upon the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count urgeth his Soul to bless his Maker for his Majesty, and Honour disclosed in the <hi>natural</hi> Wonders of the <hi>Heavens</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53288:74"/>
                  <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Waters,</hi> the <hi>Springs</hi> and <hi>Grass,</hi> the <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Hills,</hi> Psalm. 104. throughout, and he gives par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>thanks</hi> again, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 136. for the discoveries of the Divine <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> in the <hi>same</hi> instances of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Power; which he further celebrates by calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the noblest of inanimates to praise him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 148. <hi>Praise him Sun and Moon, praise him O ye Stars and Light;</hi> which Creatures of his, though they are not able to <hi>sing Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs,</hi> and <hi>vocally</hi> to rehearse his praise, yet they afford <hi>glorious Matter</hi> for grateful and triumphant Songs, and by their <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and their <hi>order,</hi> excite <hi>those</hi> that <hi>study</hi> and <hi>observe</hi> them, to adore and glorifie their Maker. And therefore the Prophet runs on further into an aggregation of more Particulars, of <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Hail, Storms,</hi> and <hi>Vapours, Mountains,</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars, Beasts,</hi> and <hi>Fouls,</hi> and <hi>creeping Things;</hi> all which in the same <hi>Divine Canticle</hi> are summon'd to <hi>praise him;</hi> that is, we are required to <hi>use them</hi> as the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Occasions</hi> of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Eucharist</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi> To these I add,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That God was pleased to <hi>sanctifie</hi> a <hi>solemn Day</hi> for the celebration of his <hi>Works.</hi> He appointed a <hi>Sabbath</hi> for <hi>rest,</hi> and <hi>contemplation to himself;</hi> and for <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment</hi> to <hi>us;</hi> and his <hi>making Heaven, and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is,</hi> is intimated as the reason of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of <hi>that Day;</hi> which was observed upon <hi>that</hi> account among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and the devout <hi>Christians</hi> of eldest times kept the <hi>same</hi> in memory of <hi>God's Creation,</hi> after the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>other</hi> Sabbath. This I take to be enough for the first Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>God is to be praised for his Works.</hi> I descend to the second, which is,</p>
               <p n="2">(II.) <hi>That his Works are to be studied by those, that would praise him for them.</hi> We are commanded to <hi>sing Praises with understanding,</hi> Psal. 40. 7. and the Offering he requires, is <hi>that</hi> of a <hi>reasonable service.</hi> His <hi>Works</hi> receive but little glory from the <hi>rude wonder</hi> of the ignorant; and there is no <hi>wise</hi> Man that values the applauses of a <hi>blind admiration.</hi> No one can give God the Glory of his <hi>Providence,</hi> that lets the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of it pass by him <hi>unobserv'd;</hi> nor can <hi>he</hi> render <hi>due</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to his <hi>Word,</hi> that doth not <hi>search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53288:74"/>
'Tis equally impossible to praise the Almighty, as we ought, for his Works, <hi>while we carelesly consider them.</hi> We are commanded to <hi>search</hi> for <hi>Wisdom,</hi> as for <hi>hidden Treasure;</hi> It lies not exposed in the common ways; and the chief won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Divine Art and Goodness are not on the <hi>surface</hi> of things layed open to every <hi>careless</hi> eye. The Tribute of praise that we owe our Maker, is not a <hi>formal slight</hi> confession that his Works are <hi>wonderful</hi> and <hi>glorious;</hi> but such an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment as proceeds from <hi>deep</hi> Observation, and acquaintance with them. And though our profoundest Study and Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries cannot unfold all the Mysteries of Nature, yet do they still discover <hi>new</hi> Motives to <hi>devout</hi> admiration, and <hi>new</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for our loudest Praises. Thus briefly of the second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position also, <hi>viz. That God's Works are to be studied by those that would praise him for them.</hi> From <hi>these</hi> I now advance to the <hi>Third,</hi> which will require more thoughts, and it is this,</p>
               <p n="3">(III.) <hi>That the study of Nature and God's Works, is very serviceable to Religion.</hi> We commonly believe that the <hi>glory</hi> of God is the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>this;</hi> we say 'tis <hi>his,</hi> and we know 'tis <hi>ours,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Glory</hi> is writ upon the <hi>Creatures;</hi> the more we <hi>study</hi> them, the better we understand <hi>those</hi> Characters, the better we <hi>read</hi> his <hi>Glory,</hi> and the more fit are we to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, and proclaim it. Thus the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>God's Works</hi> promotes the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it disposeth us to <hi>it,</hi> by keeping the Soul under a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual <hi>sense</hi> of God. He that converseth with his Works, finds in all things the clear stamps of infinite <hi>Benignity</hi> and <hi>Wisdom;</hi> he perceives the <hi>Divine Art</hi> in all the <hi>turnings</hi> and <hi>varieties</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and Divine <hi>Goodness</hi> in <hi>that.</hi> He observes <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>colour</hi> of every <hi>Flower,</hi> in every <hi>fibre</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> in every <hi>particle</hi> of an <hi>Insect,</hi> in every <hi>drop</hi> of <hi>Dew.</hi> He meets <hi>him</hi> in <hi>all</hi> things, and sees all things are <hi>his,</hi> and hath an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage hereby to be instructed how to use <hi>them</hi> as our <hi>Makers,</hi> not <hi>ours,</hi> with <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>thanksgiving,</hi> with an eye to his Glory, and an aim at his Enjoyment. This is the tendency of the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> if it be abused to different and contrary Purposes, <hi>natural Wisdom</hi> is not in fault, but <hi>he</hi> that turns this excellent Instrument of Religion upon it self. But
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53288:75"/>
that <hi>better</hi> use may be made of it, and by some <hi>is,</hi> will appear by considering particularly how <hi>acquaintance</hi> with <hi>Nature</hi> assists <hi>RELIGION</hi> against its greatest Enemies, which are <hi>Atheism, Sadducism, Superstition, Enthusiasm,</hi> and <hi>the Humour of Disputing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOr the <hi>First, Atheism,</hi> I reckon thus, The <hi>deeper</hi> insight any Man hath into the Affairs of <hi>Nature,</hi> the more he discovers of the <hi>accurateness,</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> that is in the <hi>contexture</hi> of things. For the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are not like the <hi>compositions</hi> of <hi>Fancy,</hi> or the <hi>Tricks</hi> of <hi>Juglers,</hi> that will not bear a clear <hi>light,</hi> or strict scrutiny; but their exactness receives advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the severest inspection; and he <hi>admires</hi> most, that <hi>knows</hi> most; since the <hi>insides</hi> and <hi>remotest</hi> recesses of things have the clearest stamps of inimitable Wisdom on them, and the <hi>Artifice</hi> is more in the <hi>Wheel-work,</hi> than in the <hi>Case.</hi> For if we look upon any of the Works of Nature through a <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying Glass</hi> that makes <hi>deep</hi> Discoveries, we find still <hi>more</hi> beauty, and <hi>more</hi> uniformity of contrivance; whereas if we survey the most <hi>curious</hi> piece of <hi>humane</hi> ingenuity by <hi>that Glass,</hi> it will discover to us numerous <hi>Flaws, Deformities</hi> and <hi>Imperfections</hi> in our most Elegant <hi>Mechanicks:</hi> Hence I gather, That the <hi>study</hi> of <hi>God's Works,</hi> shewing us more of the <hi>riches</hi> of Nature, opens thereby a fairer Prospect of those <hi>Treasures</hi> of Wisdom that are lodged within it; and so furnisheth us with deeper Senses, and more Arguments, and clearer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the <hi>existence</hi> of an infinitely <hi>intelligent Being,</hi> that contrived it in so <hi>harmonious</hi> and <hi>astonishing</hi> an order.</p>
               <p>So that if any are so <hi>brutish,</hi> as not to acknowledge him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the view of the meer <hi>external</hi> frame of the Universe, they must yet <hi>fall down</hi> before the evidence, when <hi>Philosophy</hi> hath opened the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> and led them into the <hi>Jewel-bouse,</hi> and shewn them the surprizing variety that is <hi>there.</hi> Thus though the <hi>obvious</hi> Firmament, and the motions of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> the ordinary vicissitudes of Seasons, and productions of things, the <hi>visible</hi> beauty of the great World, and the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing</hi> variety and fitness of those Parts that make up the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

one in Man, could scarce secure <hi>Galen</hi> from the danger of being an <hi>Atheist:</hi> Yet when he pryed <hi>further</hi> by <hi>Anatomical</hi> Enquiries, and saw the wonderful <hi>diversity, aptness,</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of the minutest <hi>Strings, Pipes,</hi> and <hi>Passages</hi> that are in the <hi>inward</hi> Fabrick; He could not abstain from the <hi>devoutness</hi> of an <hi>Anthem</hi> of Acknowledgment. And that the real <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> leads us by the hand to the confession of its <hi>Author,</hi> is taught us by the Holy Pen-man, who suggests that the <hi>visible things of the Creation declare him.</hi> The <hi>Plebeian</hi> and <hi>obvious</hi> World no doubt <hi>doth,</hi> but the <hi>Philosophical</hi> much <hi>more.</hi> So that whosoever saith, that <hi>inquiry</hi> into <hi>Nature,</hi> and God's <hi>Works</hi> leads to any degree of <hi>Atheism,</hi> gives great ground of suspicion that <hi>himself</hi> is an <hi>Atheist;</hi> or that he is <hi>that other thing</hi> that the <hi>Royal</hi> Psalmist calls him, <hi>that saith in his heart there is no God.</hi> For either he acknowledgeth the <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>exactness</hi> of the Works of Nature, or he doth not; if <hi>not,</hi> he <hi>disparageth</hi> the Divine <hi>Architect,</hi> and <hi>disables</hi> the <hi>chief</hi> Argument of his <hi>existence:</hi> If he <hi>doth,</hi> and yet affirms that the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>it</hi> leads to <hi>Atheism,</hi> he saith he knows <hi>not what,</hi> and in effect <hi>this,</hi> That the sight of the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> of a <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>beautiful</hi> contrivance tends to perswade that <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> was the Author.</p>
               <p>But I remember I have discours'd of this elsewhere, and what I have said for <hi>Philosophy</hi> in <hi>general</hi> from its tendency to devout Acknowledgments, is not so true of any as of the <hi>Experimental</hi> and <hi>Mechanick.</hi> For the Physiology of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Schools creates <hi>Notions,</hi> and turns <hi>Nature</hi> into <hi>words</hi> of <hi>second</hi> Intention, but discovers little of its <hi>real</hi> beauty, and <hi>harmonious</hi> contrivance; so that <hi>God</hi> hath no <hi>glory</hi> from it, nor <hi>Men</hi> any Argument of his <hi>Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence.</hi> And for the <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Proofs, they are for the most part <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>nice,</hi> subject to <hi>Evasions</hi> and <hi>turns</hi> of <hi>Wit,</hi> and not so generally perswasive, as <hi>those</hi> drawn from the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> Topicks, which the Experimental Philosophy inlargeth and illustrates.</p>
               <p>This then gives the greatest and fullest assurance of the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and acquaintance with this kind of <hi>Learning</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth us with the <hi>best</hi> Weapons to defend it. For the <hi>modern Atheists</hi> are pretenders to the <hi>Mechanick</hi> Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> those
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53288:76"/>
of meer Matter and Motion; and their pretensions cannot be shamed or defeated by any <hi>so well,</hi> as by <hi>those</hi> who throughly <hi>understand</hi> that wild Systeme of Opinions <hi>These</hi> indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that there is only <hi>Nature</hi> in some things that are taken to be <hi>supernatural</hi> and <hi>miraculous,</hi> and the <hi>shallow Naturalist</hi> sees no <hi>further,</hi> and therefore <hi>rests</hi> in Nature; But the true Philosopher shews the vanity and unreasonableness of taking up so <hi>short;</hi> and discovers <hi>infinite Wisdom</hi> at the end of the <hi>Chain</hi> of <hi>Causes.</hi> I say, If we know no further than <hi>occult Qualities, Elements, Heavenly Influences</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> we shall never be able to disprove a <hi>Mechanick</hi> Atheist; but the more we understand of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> the more shall we discern the <hi>necessity</hi> of a <hi>wise</hi> mind to <hi>order</hi> the blind and insensible Matter, and to <hi>direct</hi> the <hi>original</hi> Motions; without the <hi>conduct</hi> of which, the <hi>Vniverse</hi> could have been nothing but a mighty <hi>Chaos,</hi> and mishapen Mass of everlasting <hi>Confusions</hi> and <hi>Disorders.</hi> This of the FIRST, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the knowledge of Nature serves Religion against Atheism;</hi> and that it doth also,</p>
               <p n="2">(II.) AGainst <hi>Sadducism.</hi> 'Tis well known that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> denyed the <hi>existence</hi> of <hi>Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi> of <hi>Souls;</hi> And the <hi>Heresie</hi> is sadly reviv'd in our days.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) What a <hi>Spirit</hi> is; and whether there be <hi>Spirits,</hi> or not; are questions that appertain to the <hi>disquisition</hi> of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.</hi> The Holy Scripture, that condescends to the plain ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of Men, useth the word <hi>Spirit</hi> (commonly) for the more <hi>subtile</hi> and <hi>invisible</hi> Bodies, and 'twill be difficult from thence to fetch a demonstrative proof of <hi>Spirits,</hi> in the <hi>strict</hi> Notion. That there are <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> which are <hi>purer</hi> than these <hi>gross</hi> Bodies, may no doubt be concluded from <hi>thence;</hi> But whether <hi>these</hi> are only a <hi>finer</hi> sort of Matter, or a <hi>different kind</hi> of Beings, cannot (I think) be determin'd by any thing deliver'd in the Divine Oracles. The <hi>Inquiry</hi> therefore belongs to <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which, from divers <hi>Operations</hi> in our <hi>own Souls</hi> concludes, That there is a sort of Beings
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53288:76"/>
which are not <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Body,</hi> viz. Beings, <hi>self-motive, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable</hi> and <hi>indivisible;</hi> Attributes directly contrary to <hi>those</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi> which is <hi>impenetrable, divisible,</hi> and <hi>void</hi> of <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</hi> By <hi>these Properties,</hi> respectively, the <hi>distinct</hi> nature of <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> is known; and by the <hi>same,</hi> that there are <hi>Spirits,</hi> in the <hi>strictest</hi> sence, as well as <hi>corporeal</hi> Beings.</p>
               <p>Now by <hi>stating</hi> the <hi>Nature,</hi> and proving the Existence of <hi>Spirits,</hi> a very considerable service is done to Religion: For hereby our Notion of the adorable <hi>Deity</hi> is freed from all <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi> grosness, in which way those must conceive him, that acknowledge nothing but <hi>Body</hi> in the World; which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a very great dis-interest to his Glory, and suggests very unbecoming thoughts of him. And by the due setling the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> the conceit of the <hi>Soul's Traduction,</hi> is overthrown, which either ariseth from <hi>direct Sadducism,</hi> or a <hi>defect</hi> in Philosophy. Hereby our <hi>Immortality</hi> is undermined, and dangerously exposed: But <hi>due Philosophical</hi> Disquisition will set us right in the Theory.</p>

               <p>So likewise as to the <hi>Traduction</hi> of the <hi>Soul;</hi> The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Scripture against it are very <hi>general;</hi> yea many expressions we find <hi>there,</hi> seem at first sight to look <hi>that way.</hi> And therefore this other help, <hi>Philosophy,</hi> must be used <hi>here</hi> also; and by the distinct representation which it gives of the Nature of <hi>Sprit,</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> and of the <hi>Operations</hi> that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to <hi>each,</hi> this Error is effectually confuted; which it cannot be by any other proceeding.</p>
               <p>Thus Philosophy befriends us against <hi>Sadducism,</hi> in the <hi>first Branch</hi> of it, as it explodes the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>Spirits.</hi>

(2.) The other is, the <hi>denyal of the Immortality of our Souls;</hi> The establishment of <hi>this</hi> likewise, the Students of <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>God's Works</hi> have attempted in all Ages, and they have prov'd it by the <hi>Philosophical</hi> considerations of the nature of <hi>Sense;</hi> the quickness of <hi>Imagination;</hi> the spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Vnderstanding;</hi> the freedom of the <hi>Will;</hi> from <hi>these</hi> they infer, that the Soul is <hi>immaterial,</hi> and from <hi>thence,</hi> that it is <hi>immortal;</hi> which Arguments are some of the most <hi>demonstrative</hi> and <hi>cogent</hi> that the meer reasons of Men can use; but cannot be manag'd, nor understood, but by <hi>those</hi> that are instructed in <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi>

               <p>For the <hi>Modern Sadduce</hi> pretends, that all things we <hi>do,</hi> are performed by <hi>meer Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion;</hi> and consequently, that there is no such thing as an <hi>immaterial</hi> Being: so that when our <hi>Bodies</hi> are <hi>dissolv'd,</hi> the whole Man is destroyed and lost for ever; which <hi>dismal</hi> conclusion is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>certain,</hi> if there be nothing in us but <hi>Matter,</hi> and the <hi>results</hi> of <hi>Motion;</hi> and those that converse but <hi>little</hi> with <hi>Nature,</hi> understand <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> what may be done by <hi>these;</hi> and so cannot be so well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the <hi>Elevations, Mixtures,</hi> and <hi>Combinations</hi> of them cannot be at last improv'd <hi>so far,</hi> as to make a <hi>sensible, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning</hi> Being; nor are they well able to disprove one, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that they are <hi>actually</hi> advanc'd to that height: whereas he that hath much inquired into the Works of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> gains a clear sight of what <hi>Matter</hi> can perform, and gets more and <hi>stronger</hi> Arguments to convince him, that its <hi>Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications</hi> and <hi>Changes</hi> cannot amount to perception and <hi>sense;</hi>

Among such, I suppose, I may be allowed to reckon the Noble <hi>Renatus Des-Cartes;</hi> And his <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks</hi> and Notions of <hi>Immaterial</hi> Beings, are removed to the greatest distance from all <hi>Corporeal</hi> Affections; which I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to declare, or signifie my <hi>adherence</hi> to those <hi>Principles;</hi> but for an Instance, to shew, that acquaintance with <hi>Matter,</hi> and the <hi>knowledge</hi> of its <hi>Operations,</hi> removes the Mind far off from the belief of those <hi>high</hi> Effects which some ascribe to <hi>Corporeal</hi> Motions; and from all suppositions of the Soul's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>bodily</hi> and <hi>material.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Philosophy</hi> is an excellent Antidote against <hi>Sadducism,</hi> in both the Main Branches of it. But then I must confess also, that the Philosophy of the late <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Writers doth rather assist, than <hi>overthrow</hi> this dangerous <hi>Infidelity;</hi> I mean, in what it teacheth concerning <hi>Substantial Forms,</hi> which I fear tends to the disabling all <hi>Philosophical</hi> Evidence of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi> of Humane <hi>Souls.</hi> For these Peripateticks make their <hi>Forms,</hi> a kind of <hi>medium</hi> between <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit, viz.</hi> Beings that are <hi>educed</hi> (as they speak) out of Matter; and are so dependent on it, that they perish utterly, or return into the <hi>bosom</hi> of the <hi>Matter,</hi> (as some cant) when they cease to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it: But yet they allow not that those Forms are materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in their essential Constitution and Nature.</p>
               <p>This is the Peripatetick account of <hi>substantial Forms,</hi> and <hi>such</hi> they assign to all Bodies, and teach, That the <hi>noblest</hi> sort of them are <hi>sensitive</hi> and <hi>perceptive,</hi> which are the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Brutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be <hi>so,</hi> that <hi>Beings</hi> which are not <hi>Spirits,</hi> but <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible dependants</hi> upon <hi>Matter,</hi> may be endowed with <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion,</hi> and <hi>Sense;</hi> what Arguments have we then to shew, that they may not have <hi>Reason</hi> also, which is but an Improvement, and higher degree of <hi>simple Perception?</hi> 'Tis as hard to be apprehended how any of the <hi>results</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53288:78"/>
should <hi>perceive;</hi> as how they should <hi>join</hi> their <hi>Perceptions</hi> into <hi>Reasonings;</hi> and the same Propositions that prove the possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>one,</hi> prove <hi>both;</hi> so that those who affirm that <hi>Beasts</hi> also have their degrees of true Reason, speak very consonantly to <hi>those Principles.</hi> And if such <hi>material, corruptible Forms</hi> as the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> describe, are <hi>sufficient</hi> for all the Actions and Perceptions of <hi>Beasts,</hi> I know not which way to go about to demonstrate, that a <hi>more elevated</hi> sort of them may not suffice for the <hi>reasonings</hi> of Men. To urge the Topicks of Proof, I mention'd, from <hi>Notions, Compositions, Deductions,</hi> and the like, which are alledged to prove our Souls <hi>Immaterial;</hi> I say, to plead <hi>these,</hi> will signifie nothing but <hi>this,</hi> That <hi>Humane</hi> Souls are no <hi>portions</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi> nor <hi>corporeal</hi> in their <hi>formal</hi> Essence; But how will they evince, that they are not <hi>educed</hi> from it, that they <hi>depend</hi> not on <hi>Matter,</hi> and shall not <hi>perish,</hi> when their respective Bodies are dissolved. Certainly all those Arguments that are brought for our <hi>Immortality,</hi> are in <hi>this</hi> way clearly disabled. For all that we can say, will prove but <hi>this,</hi> That the Soul is no <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Matter;</hi> but this will amount to no evidence, if there are a <hi>middle</hi> kind of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences, that are not <hi>corporeal,</hi> and yet <hi>mortal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that when I say, <hi>Philosophy</hi> serves <hi>Religion</hi> against <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducism,</hi> I would not be understood to mean the <hi>Peripatetick Hypotheseis;</hi> but <hi>that</hi> Philosophy which is grounded upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with <hi>real</hi> Nature. <hi>This,</hi> by leaving this whole <hi>unintelligible</hi> sort of Beings out of its Accounts, (as things for which there is no shadow of ground from <hi>Reason,</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but good evidence of their non-existence from both) disappoints the <hi>Sadduce</hi> of the advantage he hath from this needless and precarious Principle. And by distributing <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> into <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> without the admission of <hi>middle</hi> Natures; the <hi>Real</hi> Philosophy gives demonstrative force to those Arguments for our <hi>Immortality,</hi> that prove our Souls are not <hi>Bodies;</hi> and so <hi>Sadducism</hi> is ruined by it.</p>
               <p>These things I have thought fit to advertise, not out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to <hi>censure</hi> any <hi>particular way</hi> of Philosophy; but for the security of my Discourse. And though I have made a little bold with the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> here, yet the great Name of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> to which they pretend, is not concerned; for I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53288:78"/>
that he taught no such Doctrine of <hi>substantial Forms,</hi> as his later Sectators and Interpreters have imputed to Him; who indeed have depraved, and corrupted his <hi>sense,</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most) in the whole Body of his Principles; and have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the World with their own <hi>Fancies,</hi> instead of the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine</hi> Opinions of <hi>that Philosopher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I proceed,</p>
               <p n="3">(III.) THe <hi>Real Philosophy,</hi> that inquires into <hi>God's Works,</hi> assists <hi>Religion</hi> against <hi>Superstition,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of its fatal Enemies. That I may prove <hi>this,</hi> it must be premised,</p>
               <p>That <hi>Superstition</hi> consists, either in bestowing <hi>Religious</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation and Esteem on things, in which there is <hi>no good;</hi> or <hi>fearing</hi> those, in which there is <hi>no hurt:</hi> So that this Folly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it self, one while in <hi>doting</hi> upon <hi>Opinions,</hi> as <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> and Idoliziug the little <hi>Models</hi> of Fancy, for <hi>Divine</hi> Institutions: And then it runs away afraid of <hi>harmless, indifferent</hi> Appointments, and looks <hi>pale</hi> upon the appearance of any <hi>usual</hi> Effect of <hi>Nature.</hi> It tells <hi>ominous</hi> Stories of every <hi>Meteor</hi> of the Night; and makes <hi>sad</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of each <hi>unwonted</hi> Accident: All which are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and a <hi>narrow</hi> Mind; which defeat the Design of <hi>Religion,</hi> that would make us of a free, manly, and generous Spirit; and indeed represent <hi>Christianity</hi> as if it were a <hi>fond, sneaking, weak</hi> and <hi>peevish</hi> thing, that <hi>emasculates</hi> Mens Understandings, making them <hi>amorous</hi> of <hi>toys,</hi> and keeping them under the <hi>servility</hi> of <hi>childish</hi> fears; so that hereby it is exposed to the <hi>distrust</hi> of larger Minds, and to the <hi>scorn</hi> of <hi>Atheists; These</hi> and many more are the mischiefs of <hi>Superstition,</hi> as we have sadly seen and felt.</p>
               <p>Now against this <hi>evil Spirit,</hi> and its <hi>Influences,</hi> the <hi>Real, Experimental</hi> Philosophy, is one of the best Securities in the World. For by a generous and open Inquiry in the great Field of Nature, Mens <hi>minds</hi> are enlarged, and taken off from all fond adherences to their private Sentiments. They are taught by it, That <hi>Certainty</hi> is not in <hi>many things;</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53288:79"/>
that the most <hi>valuable</hi> Knowledge is the <hi>practical;</hi> By which means they will find themselves disposed to more <hi>indifferency</hi> towards those <hi>petty Notions,</hi> in which they were before apt to place a great deal of Religion; and to reckon, that <hi>all that</hi> will signifie, lies in the <hi>few, certain, operative</hi> Principles of the Gospel; and a <hi>Life</hi> suitable to such a <hi>Faith;</hi> not in <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> upon <hi>Questions,</hi> and <hi>Speculations</hi> that <hi>engender strife:</hi> and thus the Modern, Experimental <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>God's Works,</hi> is a Remedy against the <hi>notional</hi> Superstition (as I may call it) which <hi>hath</hi> been, and <hi>is</hi> so <hi>fatal</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>peace</hi> of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Besides which, (by making the Soul <hi>great</hi>) this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge delivers it from fondness on <hi>small</hi> Circumstances, and <hi>imaginary Models;</hi> and from little <hi>scrupulosities</hi> about things <hi>indifferent,</hi> which usually work disquiet in narrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Spirits: And I have known divers, whom <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and not Disputes, hath cured of this Malady.</p>
               <p>This we may observe, that those Remedies are the <hi>best,</hi> and most effectual, that alter the <hi>temper</hi> and disposition of the Mind; For 'tis suitableness to <hi>that,</hi> which makes the way to Mens Judgments, and settles them in their Perswasions. There are few that hold their Opinions by <hi>Arguments,</hi> and <hi>dry Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings,</hi> but by <hi>congruity</hi> to the Understanding, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by <hi>relish</hi> in the Affections: So that seldom any thing cures our <hi>intellectual</hi> Diseases, (throughly) but what chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <hi>these.</hi> And I dare affirm, that the <hi>Free, Experimental Philosophy</hi> will do this to purpose, by giving the Mind another <hi>Tincture,</hi> and introducing a <hi>sounder Habit,</hi> which by degrees will repel and cast out all Malignities; and settle it in a <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>manly</hi> Temperament, that will master and put to flight all <hi>idle Dotages,</hi> and <hi>effeminate Fears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Truth is, This World is a very <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and he that would cure Madmen, must not attempt it by <hi>Reasoning,</hi> or indeavour to shew the <hi>absurdity</hi> of their <hi>Conceits;</hi> but such a course must be taken, as may restore the Mind to a <hi>right Crasis;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> (when it is effected) will reduce, and rectifie the <hi>extravagances</hi> of the distemper'd Brain, which <hi>Disputes</hi> and <hi>Oppositions</hi> will but <hi>inflame</hi> and make <hi>worse.</hi> Thus, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, when frantick Persons are fond of Feathers, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53288:79"/>
taken with the employment of picking Straws, 'twould signifie very little, to represent to them the vanity of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their Delights; and when the <hi>Melancholist</hi> was afraid to sit down for fear of being broken, supposing himself of Glass, it had been to little purpose to have declared to him the <hi>ridiculousness</hi> of his Fears; the <hi>disposition</hi> of the Head was to be <hi>alter'd,</hi> before the particular <hi>Phrensie</hi> could be cured.</p>
               <p>'Tis too evident how <hi>just</hi> this is in the application to the present Age; <hi>Superstitious</hi> fondness, and fears are a <hi>real</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>madness.</hi> And though I cannot say that <hi>Philosophy</hi> must be the only <hi>Catholick</hi> way of <hi>Cure,</hi> (for of <hi>this,</hi> the far greatest part of Men is incapable) yet <hi>this</hi> I <hi>do</hi> affirm, that 'tis a <hi>Remedy,</hi> for those that are strong <hi>enough</hi> to take it: and the rest must be helped by <hi>that,</hi> which <hi>changeth</hi> the <hi>Genius;</hi> and this cannot, ordinarily, be done by any thing that <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth</hi> the <hi>particular</hi> Fancy.</p>
               <p>However I must say, (2.) That the sort of <hi>Superstition</hi> which is yet behind in my account, and consists in the <hi>causless fear</hi> of some <hi>Extraordinaries,</hi> in <hi>Accident,</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly cured by <hi>that</hi> Philosophy, which gives fair <hi>likely-hoods</hi> of their <hi>Causes;</hi> and shews that there is nothing in them <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural;</hi> the light of the day drives away Apparitions, and vain Images that <hi>fancy</hi> forms in <hi>obscure</hi> shades, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Thus particularly the Modern Doctrine of <hi>Comets,</hi> which have been always great <hi>Bugbears</hi> to the <hi>guilty,</hi> and <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous</hi> World; hath rescued Philosophers from the trouble of <hi>dreadful Presages,</hi> and the mischievous Consequences that arise from those <hi>superstitious Abodings.</hi> For whatever the <hi>casual Coincidencies</hi> may be between those <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and the <hi>dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Events, that are sometimes observed closely to attend them, (which, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> truly notes, are observ'd when they <hi>bit,</hi> not when they <hi>miss</hi>) I say, notwithstanding <hi>these,</hi> the Real, Experimental <hi>Philosophy</hi> makes it appear, that they are <hi>Heavenly</hi> Bodies, far above all the <hi>Regions</hi> of <hi>Vapours,</hi> in which we are not concerned; and so they are neither the <hi>Signs,</hi> nor the <hi>Causes</hi> of our <hi>Mischiefs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53288:80"/>
And for the other <hi>little</hi> things, which afford Matter for the <hi>Tales</hi> about <hi>Prodigies,</hi> and other <hi>ominous</hi> Appearings, the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> by exciting worthy and magnificent conceptions of the <hi>God</hi> of Nature; cures <hi>that blasphemous abuse</hi> of the adorable Majesty, whereby foolish Men attribute every trivial event that may serve their turns against those they hate, to his <hi>immediate, extraordinary</hi> interposal. For 'tis <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Works,</hi> that disposeth Men to absurd ridiculous <hi>Surmises,</hi> uncharitable <hi>Censures,</hi> seditious <hi>Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and (so) to Thoughts that are prejudicial to the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the Interests of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the security of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> to that <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> we owe to <hi>others,</hi> and to the <hi>happiness</hi> that we seek <hi>our selves.</hi> To which I add,</p>
               <p>That <hi>this</hi> kind of Superstition is a <hi>relique</hi> of <hi>Pagan</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which made Men look on <hi>Thunder, Eclipses, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,</hi> and all the more terrifying <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, as the immediate Effects of Powers <hi>Supernatural;</hi> and to <hi>judge Events</hi> by <hi>flights</hi> of <hi>Birds,</hi> and <hi>garbages</hi> of <hi>Cattel,</hi> by the <hi>accidental occursions</hi> of <hi>this</hi> Creature, and the <hi>other,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every <hi>casual</hi> occurrence. But <hi>these</hi> Particulars have been most ingeniously represented and reproved in a late very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Discourse about <hi>Prodigies;</hi> And though I do not acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esce in the Design of that excellently penn'd Book, which is to <hi>discredit, and take away all kinds of Presages;</hi> Yet I think it hath done rarely well, so far as it discovers the folly and mischiefs of that <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>superstitious</hi> Spirit, that makes <hi>every</hi> thing a <hi>Prodigy.</hi> With such apprehensions as <hi>these,</hi> the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Nature fills those Minds that are instructed in it.</p>
               <p>And there is no doubt, but that the Antipathy the <hi>Real Philosophy</hi> bears to all the kinds of <hi>Superstition,</hi> is one cause why <hi>zealous</hi> Ignorance brands those Researches with the mark of <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Irreligion.</hi> For superstitious Folly <hi>adopts</hi> those groundless <hi>Trifles,</hi> which Philosophy contemns and reproves, into the <hi>Family</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> and therefore reproacheth the Despisers of them, as Enemies to the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</p>
               <p>So it fared with some of the bravest Spirits of ancient times, who have had <hi>black Characters</hi> fixt upon their great and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53288:80"/>
worthy Names, only for their Oppositions of the foolish Rites and Idolatries of the vulgar Heathen. We know the case of <hi>Socrates:</hi> And (as to the <hi>interest</hi> of their <hi>Names</hi>) <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Anaxagoras, Theodorus, Protagoras,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> was much worse; the causless infamy coming down the Stream as far as the last Ages. Since <hi>then,</hi> we know who was an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> for saying there were <hi>Antipodes;</hi> and a <hi>Pope</hi> was taken for a <hi>Conjurer</hi> for being a <hi>Mathematician;</hi> yea those noble Sciences were counted <hi>Diabolical;</hi> and even the <hi>Sacred</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage could scarce escape the suspicion. In later times <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilaeo</hi> fell into the Inquisition for the Discoveries of his <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopes;</hi> and <hi>Campanella</hi> could not endeavour to assert, and vindicate the <hi>freedom</hi> of his Mind, without losing <hi>that</hi> of his Person.</p>
               <p>I might come nearer to our own days, and knowledge: <hi>Gothick</hi> barharity, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Iuquisition</hi> is not quite worn out of the Reformation; Though indeed it ordinarily remains but among the scum and dregs of Men: And no one is <hi>either</hi> less Religious, or less Wise for being accounted an <hi>Atheist</hi> by the common Rabble. But where-ever the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>God's Works</hi> hath in any degree obtain'd, those vile <hi>Superstitions</hi> have been despised, and put to an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous flight. But to take another step,</p>
               <p n="4">(IV.) THe <hi>Real Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>God's Works,</hi> serves <hi>Religion</hi> against <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreadful Enemy. Now <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> is a <hi>false conceit of Inspiration;</hi> and all the bold and mistaken Pretensions to the <hi>Spirit</hi> in our days, are of this sort. What particularly <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> hath suffer'd from it, would be too long to reckon upon this occasion; It will be enough to say, in an Age that hath so much and such sad experience of it, That <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> hath introduced much phantastry into <hi>Religion,</hi> and made way for all imaginable Follies, and even <hi>Atheism</hi> it self; which it hath done two ways. (1.) By crying up the <hi>Excesses</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases</hi> of <hi>Imagination</hi> for the greatest height of <hi>Godliness;</hi> And (2.) By the disparagrment of <hi>sober Reason,</hi> as an Enemy to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53288:81"/>
the Principles of <hi>Faith.</hi> And Philosophy assists Religion against both these.</p>
               <p>FOR the <hi>first</hi> in order; The real <hi>knowledge of Nature</hi> detects the dangerous imposture, by shewing what <hi>strange</hi> things may be effected by no <hi>diviner</hi> a cause than a <hi>strong Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy impregnated</hi> by <hi>Heated Melancholy;</hi> For <hi>this</hi> sometimes warms the Brain to a degree that makes it very <hi>active</hi> and <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative,</hi> full of <hi>odd</hi> Thoughts, and <hi>unexpected</hi> Suggestions; so that if the <hi>Temper</hi> determine the Imagination to <hi>Religion,</hi> it flies at <hi>high</hi> things, at <hi>interpretations</hi> of <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>Prophetick</hi> Scriptures; at <hi>Predictions</hi> of future Events, and <hi>mysterious</hi> Discoveries, which the Man expresseth fluently and boldly, with a peculiar and pathetick Eloquence; which <hi>pregnances</hi> being not <hi>ordinary,</hi> but much beyond the usual tone and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Enthusiast;</hi> and he having heard great things of the <hi>Spirits immediate Motions</hi> and <hi>Inspirations,</hi> cannot well fail of believing himself <hi>inspired,</hi> and of intitling all the <hi>excursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> of his <hi>Fancy</hi> to the <hi>immediate Actings</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> and those thoughts by the help of natural <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>self-love,</hi> will work also exceedingly upon the heightned <hi>Affections,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> upon the <hi>Body</hi> so far, as to cast it sometimes into <hi>Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Extasies,</hi> and <hi>Deliquiums</hi> of Sense, in which every <hi>Dream</hi> is taken for a <hi>Prophesie,</hi> every Image of the <hi>Fancy</hi> for a <hi>Vision,</hi> and all the <hi>glarings</hi> of the <hi>Imagination</hi> for <hi>new Lights</hi> and <hi>Revelations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have our Modern Prophets been inspired by Temper and Imagination, and not by Design only; For we may not think they are all Hypocrites and knowing Impostors; No, they generally believe themselves, and the <hi>strength</hi> of their highly invigorated Fancies shuts out the sober <hi>Light</hi> of Reason that should disabuse them, as <hi>sleep</hi> doth that of our External Senses in our <hi>Dreams.</hi> And the silly People that understand not <hi>Nature,</hi> but are apt to take every thing that is <hi>vebement</hi> to be <hi>sacred,</hi> are easily deceived into the belief of those Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and thus <hi>Diseases</hi> have been <hi>worship'd</hi> for <hi>Religion.</hi> This account the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Humane Nature</hi> gives of <hi>that,</hi> by which the World hath been so miserably abused.</p>
               <p>And when we cast our eyes abroad, we may plainly see that those <hi>glorious</hi> things are no <hi>more,</hi> than what hath been done

by the <hi>Extatick</hi> Priests of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Oracles, and the Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of all Religions; by <hi>Sybils, Lunaticks, Poets, Dreamers,</hi> and transported Persons of all sorts: And it may be observ'd daily to what degrees of elevation <hi>excess</hi> of <hi>drinking</hi> will heighten the Brain, making some <hi>witty, nimble,</hi> and <hi>eloquent,</hi> much beyond the ordinary proportion of their Parts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity; and inclining others to be hugely <hi>devour,</hi> who usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have no great <hi>sense</hi> of Religion; As I knew one, who would pray rapturously when he was <hi>drunk,</hi> but at other times was a <hi>moping</hi> Sot, and could scarce speak sense.</p>
               <p>Thus also some kinds of <hi>Madness, Diseases, Accidents, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarities</hi> of <hi>Temper,</hi> and other natural things that <hi>heat</hi> the Brain, fill Men with high surprizing <hi>Conceits</hi> about Religion, and furnish them with <hi>fervid</hi> Devotion, great <hi>readiness</hi> of Expression, and unexpected <hi>applications</hi> of Scripture to their crasy Conceits; I say, the <hi>Experimental Philosophy</hi> of our <hi>Natures</hi> informs us, that all this is common in <hi>alienations,</hi> and <hi>singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities</hi> of Mind and <hi>Complexion.</hi> And they were remarkable in the <hi>Prophets</hi> of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and the <hi>Priest</hi> whom Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> knew, that would <hi>whine</hi> himself into an <hi>Extasie;</hi> In the wonderful Discourses of the <hi>American</hi> Bishop, that said he was the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and the <hi>canting fluency</hi> of the <hi>German Enthusiasts,</hi> some of whose Imaginations were as <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>extravagant;</hi> of such Instances I might make up a much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Catalogue, if I should descend to our <hi>Domestick Lunaticks,</hi> but their temper is well known, and therefore I only add this more;</p>
               <p>That I have often met with a poor Woman in the North, whose habitual conceit it was, That she was <hi>Mother of God,</hi> and <hi>of all things living;</hi> I was wont to personate a kind of complyance with her Fancy, and a modest desire to be further informed about it; which gentleness drew from her so many odd fetches of Discourse, such applications of Scripture, and such wonderful references to Things, in which she was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver instructed, that look'd like gleanings out of <hi>Hobbs</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that I have been much amazed at her talk: And yet when I diverted her to any thing else of ordinary Matters, she spoke usually with as much sobriety and cold discretion, as could well be expected from a Person of her Condition;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53288:82"/>
nor did she use to be extravagant in any thing, but about that particular Imagination; which Instance among many others I might produce, very much confirms me in the truth of that Observation of those Philosophers who have given us the best light into the <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> Temper, <hi>viz. That there is a sort of madness, which takes Men in some particular things, when they are sound in others:</hi> which one Proposition will afford a good account of many of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Enthusiasm;</hi> and shews that the <hi>Extravagants</hi> among us may be really <hi>distracted</hi> in the <hi>Affairs</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> though their Brains are untouc'd in <hi>other</hi> Matters.</p>
               <p>Thus a <hi>Philosophical</hi> use of <hi>observation,</hi> and the <hi>knowledge of Humane Nature by it,</hi> helps us to distinguish between the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of the adorable <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>those</hi> of an hot distemper'd Fancy; which is no small advantage for the securing the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Honour,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> the interests of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (2.) there is another mischief of the <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> Spirit behind, and that is its bringing <hi>Reason</hi> into disgrace, and denying the <hi>use</hi> thereof in the Affairs of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> This is an evil that is the cause of many <hi>more;</hi> for it hath brought into the World all kinds of <hi>Phantastry</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> and exposed Religion to Contempt and Derision, by making <hi>Madness</hi> and <hi>Diseases Sacred:</hi> It leads Mens Minds into a maze of <hi>confused</hi> Imaginations, and betrays them into Bogs and Precipices, deprives them of their Light and their Guide, and lays them open to all the Delusions of Satan, and their own distemper'd Brains: It takes <hi>Religion</hi> off from its <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi> and leaves the Interest of Eternity in Mens Souls, to <hi>Chance,</hi> and the Hits of Imagination; teaching those that are deluded to lay the stress of all upon <hi>Raptures, Heats,</hi> and <hi>Mysterious</hi> Notions, while they forget<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These Evils I am content only to name in this place, having

               </p>
               <p>But yet though I affirm <hi>this,</hi> I am not so rash, or so unjust as to believe, or say, That this Spirit hath produced all those s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Caution</hi> I have said this; but yet nothing hinders but that all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Evils are justly said to be the <hi>Tendencies,</hi> and in too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Instances have been, and are the Effects of this <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I doubt not but 'twill be granted readily by all considering Men, that whatever assists <hi>Religion</hi> against this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive</hi> Enemy, doth it most important service; and this the <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Real Philosophy</hi> doth in a very eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53288:83"/>
In order to the proof of this, we may consider what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated just now, <hi>viz.</hi> That Men are led into, and kept in this Fancy of the <hi>Enmity</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> chiefly by two things:</p>
               <p>(1.) By an <hi>implicit</hi> assent to the <hi>Systemes</hi> and <hi>Distates</hi> of those who <hi>first</hi> instructed them; And (2.) By defect in clearness of Thoughts, and the ability to state things <hi>distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and to <hi>understand</hi> their <hi>Dependencies</hi> and <hi>Sequels;</hi> Both which Imperfections the <hi>Free Philosophy</hi> cures.</p>
               <p>For as to the <hi>First,</hi> (1.) <hi>That</hi> Philosophy <hi>begins</hi> with the <hi>inlargement</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> and attempts to free it from <hi>Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Pre-ingagements,</hi> which sophisticate and pervert our Judgments, and render us incapable of discerning Things as they are. <hi>Modest, impartial</hi> enquiry is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>real, experimental way</hi> of Philosophy. Not that it teacheth <hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>Neutrality</hi> in all Things, but this <hi>Caution</hi> in our Disquisitions, That we do not <hi>suddenly</hi> give <hi>firm</hi> assents to Things not well understood or <hi>examin'd:</hi> which no doubt is very just and safe. But as to what concerns those, who through ignorance, or other occasions, are incapable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king due enquiry, I think they ought not to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about Matters of Speculation at all; or at least not to <hi>affirm</hi> any thing <hi>positively</hi> about them. 'Tis enough for <hi>such</hi> to believe and practise the <hi>plain</hi> Duties of Religion, which are <hi>clear</hi> in the Holy Oracles, and with which they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted without much <hi>sagacity,</hi> or <hi>deep Judgment:</hi> For Matters of <hi>Theory,</hi> and difficult Enquiry, appertain not to the <hi>vulgar</hi> and lower rank of Understandings: But for those who are capable of <hi>search</hi> after <hi>Truth,</hi> and are provided with anvantages for it, <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> is necessary in order to their success. With this, I said, the <hi>Real Philosophy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins;</hi> and in all its progresses still more and more disposeth the Mind to it, and so delivers it from the <hi>vassalage</hi> of <hi>Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> Sayings and Opinions.</p>
               <p>And now whoever is <hi>so</hi> disposed, will not be so ready to believe that <hi>Reason</hi> is an <hi>Enemy</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> till he have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and examin'd the Matter with an <hi>impartial</hi> Judgment: And I dare say, whoever shall do <hi>that,</hi> will want nothing to convince him, that such an Opinion is false and groundless,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53288:83"/>
but <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> Thoughts, and the knowledge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, with which <hi>Philosophy</hi> will furnish him.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>second</hi> way whereby it helps to overthrow this Principle of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) By teaching us to <hi>state</hi> Matters <hi>clearly,</hi> and to draw out those conclusions that are lodged in them. For 'tis <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of <hi>Notions,</hi> and a great <hi>defect</hi> in reasoning, that makes dark <hi>Zeal</hi> to <hi>rave</hi> so <hi>furiously</hi> against <hi>Reason.</hi> Now <hi>Philosophy</hi> is <hi>Reason methodiz'd,</hi> and improved by <hi>Study, Observation,</hi> and <hi>Experiment;</hi> and whoever is addicted to <hi>these,</hi> is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed frequently in inquiry after the <hi>Causes, Properties,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> of Things, which will inure the Mind to great <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentness,</hi> and inable it to <hi>define</hi> and <hi>distinguish,</hi> and <hi>infer</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; And by these the Allegations against Reason will be made appear to be idle <hi>Sophisms,</hi> that have no sound sense or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in them.</p>
               <p>And though the Discourses of some, who have talk'd much of Philosophy and <hi>Reason,</hi> have been sometimes <hi>bold</hi> and saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and opposite to the Interests of Religion: Yet <hi>true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi> and <hi>well manag'd Reason, vindicate</hi> Religion from those abuses, and shew, that there was <hi>Sophistry</hi> and <hi>imposture</hi> in <hi>those</hi> Pretensions: So that <hi>they</hi> are no more to be blamed for the <hi>Insolencies</hi> and <hi>Riots</hi> of those that usurp their Name, than Religion it self is, for the <hi>Immoralities</hi> of such as cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Garments of <hi>external</hi> Piety and Saintship. Thus of the services of <hi>Philosophy</hi> against <hi>ENTHVSIASM.</hi> I come now to the last Instance.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53288:84"/>
               <p n="5">(V.) IT helps <hi>Religion</hi> against the <hi>Humour</hi> of <hi>Disputing;</hi> By which I mean <hi>that</hi> evil Genius, that makes Men confident of uncertain Opinions; and clamorously contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous against every different Judgment. This is that pestilent Spirit that turns Religion into <hi>Air</hi> of <hi>Notion,</hi> and makes it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate</hi> and <hi>uncertain;</hi> subject to eternal <hi>Quarrels,</hi> and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to <hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>Infidelity; That</hi> which supplants <hi>Charity, Modesty, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Meekness;</hi> substituting in their room, <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Insolence, Pride</hi> and <hi>Bitter Zeal, Clamours</hi> and <hi>Divisions,</hi> and all the Opposites of the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel.</hi> So that, it <hi>depraves Religion,</hi> and makes its <hi>Sacred</hi> Name an <hi>Instrument</hi> to promote the Projects of the <hi>Kingdom of Darkness;</hi> by envenoming Men one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>inflaming</hi> their Spirits, and <hi>crumbling</hi> them into Sects, and <hi>disturbing</hi> Societies; and so it hinders the <hi>Progress</hi> of the Gospel, and lays it open to the scorns of <hi>Vnbelievers;</hi> it turns Men from the desire of <hi>practising,</hi> to the itch of <hi>talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and abuses them into this dangerous belief, That <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> consists more in their beloved <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi> than in a <hi>sober Vertue,</hi> and the <hi>exercise</hi> of <hi>Charity;</hi> it makes them <hi>pert</hi> and <hi>pragmatical; buste</hi> about the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> while they neglect their <hi>own</hi> Spirits; fancying a perfection in the fluency of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> while the <hi>worst</hi> of Passions have the Empire of their <hi>Souls. These</hi> are some of the sad Effects of the <hi>Humour</hi> of Disputing, which hath done deplorable execution upon Religion in all Places and Times; and therefore 'tis none of the least Services that can be afforded it, to destroy this evil Genius; and there is nothing, meerly <hi>humane,</hi> that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes more towards the rooting of it out of the World, than the <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Real Philosophy.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) An intimate Commerce with <hi>God's Works,</hi> gives us to see the mighty <hi>Difficulties</hi> that are to be met in the <hi>specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>them;</hi> and thereby Men are made less <hi>confident</hi> of their Sentiments about <hi>Nature,</hi> and by many Considerations and <hi>Observations</hi> of <hi>this</hi> kind, are at length brought to such an <hi>habitual</hi> Modesty, that they are afraid to pass bold Judgments
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53288:84"/>
upon those <hi>Opinions</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> of which there is no <hi>infallible</hi> assurance.</p>
               <p>And (2.) By the <hi>frequent exercises</hi> of our Minds, we come to be made sensible how <hi>easily,</hi> and how oft we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, through the <hi>fallibility</hi> of Sense, and <hi>shortness</hi> of our Understandings; by <hi>Education, Authority, Interest,</hi> and our <hi>Affections;</hi> and so are disposed to a more <hi>prudent coldness</hi> and <hi>diffidence</hi> in things of doubtful Speculation, by which the <hi>Disputing Humour</hi> is destroyed at the bottom. Besides which,</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The <hi>Real Philosophy</hi> brings Men in-love with the <hi>Practical</hi> Knowledge: The more we have imployed our selves in <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Theory,</hi> the more we shall be acquainted with the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of Speculation; and our esteem, and love of Opinions will abate, as that sense increaseth: By the same degrees our respect and kindness for <hi>Operative</hi> knowledge will advance, and grow; which disposition will incline us also to have less regard to <hi>Nicities</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> and teach us to lay out our chief Cares and Endeavours about <hi>Practical</hi> and <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Knowledge,</hi> which will assist and promote our <hi>Vertue,</hi> and our <hi>Happiness;</hi> and incline us to imploy our selves in living according to it; And this also will be an effectual means to destroy the <hi>Humour</hi> of <hi>Contending.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Philosophy</hi> gives us a sight of the <hi>Causes</hi> of our <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual</hi> Diversities; and so lessens our expectation of an <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in Opinions; and by this, it discovers the <hi>unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of making c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p n="5">(5.) It inclines Men to place the <hi>Essential Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> only in the <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> Articles. For Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers are disposed to think, that <hi>Certainty</hi> is in a little room: And whoever believes so, concerning the Tenents of <hi>Theology,</hi> will not lay the main stress upon <hi>any,</hi> but the <hi>clear</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd Principles; by which prudent Caution he serves all the <hi>important</hi> Concernments of <hi>Religion.</hi> He will not <hi>wrangle</hi> for every <hi>Conceit;</hi> nor <hi>divide</hi> for every <hi>Difference;</hi> but takes
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53288:85"/>
care to walk in the ways of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> And so the <hi>Church</hi> is safe, and <hi>Schisms</hi> are prevented and cured.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) The <hi>Real Philosophy</hi> ends many <hi>Disputes,</hi> by taking Men off from <hi>unnecessary Terms</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> which very osten are the chief occasions of the Contests: If things were stated in <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> words, many Controversies would be ended; and the Philosophy I am recommending, inclines Men to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine</hi> with <hi>those</hi> that are <hi>simplest</hi> and <hi>plainest;</hi> and thereby also it very much promotes the Interests both of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In sum, I say, the <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Real</hi> Philosophy makes Men deeply sensible of the Infirmities of Humane Intellect, and our manifold hazards of <hi>mistaking,</hi> and so renders them <hi>wary</hi> and <hi>modest, diffident</hi> of the <hi>certainty</hi> of their <hi>Conceptions,</hi> and averse to the <hi>boldness</hi> of <hi>peremptory asserting.</hi> So that the <hi>Philosopher thinks much,</hi> and <hi>examines</hi> many things, separates the <hi>Certainties</hi> from the <hi>Plausibilities, that</hi> which is <hi>presumed</hi> from <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>prov'd;</hi> the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Sense, Phansie,</hi> and <hi>Education,</hi> from the results of <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>impartial Reason.</hi> Thus he doth before he <hi>Assents</hi> or <hi>Denies;</hi> and <hi>then</hi> he takes with him also a Sense of his own <hi>Fallibility</hi> and <hi>Defects,</hi> and never concludes but upon resolution to alter his Mind upon contrary Evidence. Thus he conceives <hi>warily,</hi> and he speaks with as much <hi>caution</hi> and <hi>reserve,</hi> in the humble Forms of [<hi>So I think,</hi> and <hi>In my Opinion,</hi> and <hi>Perhaps 'tis so—</hi>] with great difference to <hi>opposite</hi> Perswasion, candour to <hi>Dissenters,</hi> and <hi>calmness</hi> in <hi>Contradictions,</hi> with <hi>readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> to <hi>learn,</hi> and great deligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It makes them so <hi>just,</hi> as to allow that liberty of Judgment to <hi>others,</hi> which <hi>themselves</hi> desire, and <hi>so</hi> prevents all <hi>imperious Dictates</hi> and <hi>Imposings,</hi> all <hi>Captious Quarrels</hi> and <hi>Notional Wars.</hi> And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53288:85"/>
that this is the <hi>Philosophick</hi> Genius, may be shewn in a <hi>grand</hi> Instance, the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY,</hi> which is the <hi>Great Body</hi> of <hi>Practical</hi> Philosophers. In <hi>this Assembly,</hi> though it be made up of all kinds of <hi>Dispositions, Professions,</hi> and <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;</hi> yet hath <hi>Philosophy</hi> so rarely temper'd the <hi>Constitution,</hi> that those that attend there, never see the least inclination to any unhandsome <hi>opposition</hi> or uncivil <hi>reflexion,</hi> no bold <hi>obtrusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or consident <hi>sayings.</hi> The forbearing such Rudenesses is indeed a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>that Society,</hi> and their Designs and Methods of Inquiry, naturally form Men into the <hi>modest</hi> temper, and secure them from the danger of the <hi>Quarrelsome</hi> Genius. This is palpable evidence of the <hi>sweet</hi> Humour, and <hi>ingenious Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies</hi> of the <hi>Free Philosophy;</hi> and I believe 'twill be hard to shew such another Example in any so great a Body of <hi>differing Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Apprehensions.</hi> Thus the <hi>Experimental Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> rectifies the <hi>grand Abuse,</hi> which the <hi>Notional</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath so long foster'd and promoted, to the <hi>hinderance</hi> of <hi>Science,</hi> the <hi>disturbance</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and the prejudice of the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> And there is no doubt, but as it hath altered and reformed the <hi>Genius</hi> in Matters of Natural <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>search</hi> and <hi>Inquiry;</hi> so it will in its progress dispose Mens Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to more <hi>Calmness</hi> and <hi>Modesty, Charity</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> in the Differences of <hi>Religion,</hi> and even Silence <hi>Disputes</hi> there. For the <hi>free sensible</hi> Knowledge tends to the altering the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> of Mens Minds, and so cures the <hi>Disease</hi> at the <hi>Root;</hi> and <hi>true Philosophy</hi> is a <hi>Specifick</hi> against <hi>Disputes</hi> and <hi>Divisions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To confirm which we may observe further, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>this</hi> sort of <hi>Knowledge</hi> prevails, the <hi>Contentious Divinity</hi> loseth ground; and 'twill be hard to find any one of those Philosophers, that is a zealous Votary of a Sect: which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedness doth indeed give occasion to Sectaries, and Bigotts to accuse them of <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Irreligion:</hi> But it really is no Argument of <hi>less</hi> Piety; but of <hi>more</hi> Consideration and Knowledge. And 'twould make much for the advantage of Religion, and their own, if those fierce Men would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that Christianity should teach them <hi>that,</hi> which they rail against in the <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now I must expect to hear,</p>

                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53288:86"/>
(I.) That <hi>Disputes</hi> serve to discover <hi>Truth;</hi> as latent Fire is excited, and disclosed by the collision of hard Bodies: So that the Pretence is, That Philosophy doth, on this account, rather disserve than promote the Interests of Religion.</p>
               <p>To this, I Answer, (1.) That all the <hi>necessary, material</hi> Truths in Divinity are <hi>already</hi> discover'd; and we have no need of <hi>New Lights there,</hi> the <hi>Ancientest</hi> are <hi>truest</hi> and <hi>best;</hi> though in the disquisitions of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> there will be always occasions of proceeding. I add, (2.) <hi>Disputes</hi> are one of the <hi>worst</hi> ways to <hi>discover Truth;</hi> If <hi>new</hi> things were to be found out in <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as <hi>Nature,</hi> they would scarce be disclosed by <hi>this</hi> way of Enquiry. A <hi>calm</hi> Judgment, and <hi>distinct</hi> Thoughts, and <hi>impartial</hi> Consideration of <hi>many</hi> things, are <hi>necessary</hi> for the <hi>finding Truth;</hi> which lies <hi>deep,</hi> and is mingled up and down with much <hi>Error,</hi> and <hi>specious</hi> falshood; and 'tis <hi>hard,</hi> if not utterly <hi>impessible,</hi> to preserve any <hi>one</hi> of <hi>these</hi> in the <hi>heat</hi> of <hi>Disputation:</hi> In such Occasions, the <hi>Mind</hi> is commonly <hi>disordered</hi> by <hi>Passion,</hi> and the Thoughts are <hi>confused,</hi> and our Considerations <hi>tyed</hi> to <hi>those</hi> things which give <hi>colour</hi> to our <hi>Opinions.</hi> We are biast by our <hi>Affections</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our <hi>own</hi> Conceits; and our <hi>love</hi> to them is <hi>inflamed</hi> by <hi>opposition;</hi> we are made <hi>incapable</hi> of entertaining the assistance of our Opposites Suggestions by <hi>strong prejudice,</hi> and inclined to <hi>quarrel</hi> with every thing he saith by <hi>spight,</hi> and desire of <hi>triumph:</hi> and <hi>these</hi> are ill Circumstances for the <hi>discovery</hi> of <hi>Truth:</hi> He is a wonderful Man indeed that can thread a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle when he is at Cudgels in a crowd; and yet this is as easie, as to find Truth in the hurry of Disputation. The Apostle intimates, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5. That <hi>perverse Disputers</hi> are <hi>destitute</hi> of <hi>Truth;</hi> and tells us, That of the <hi>strife</hi> of <hi>words</hi> come <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, railings, evil surmisings,</hi> but no <hi>discovery</hi> of <hi>unknown Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (II.) we are told, in favour of Disputes in Religion, That we are to <hi>contend earnestly for the Faith that was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Saints;</hi> and hereby <hi>Heresies</hi> are said to be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and overthrown: So that the disabling and suppressing of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53288:86"/>
Disputes, seems to be a weakening, rather than any advantage to Religion, and the Concernments of it.</p>
               <p>To this, I say, That by the <hi>Faith</hi> we are to <hi>contend</hi> for, I conceive, the <hi>Essentials,</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> Articles are meant; <hi>These</hi> we <hi>may,</hi> and we <hi>ought,</hi> to endeavour to <hi>defend</hi> and <hi>promote,</hi> as there is occasion; and we have seen, how the <hi>Real Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> will help our <hi>Reasons</hi> in that Service. But <hi>pious Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> for <hi>these,</hi> are not the <hi>disputings</hi> of which I am now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing, those are stiff Contests about uncertain Opinions: And such I dare very boldly say, are no Contentions for the Faith, but the Instruments of the greatest mischiefs to it. As for those other <hi>Disputes</hi> that are used to convince Men of the <hi>Truths</hi> of the Gospel, and the great Articles thereof; and for the disproving <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Heresie;</hi> they are necessary, and <hi>Philosophy</hi> is an excellent help in <hi>such</hi> Contests.</p>
               <p>So that those other Objections pleadable from the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>proving</hi> and <hi>trying</hi> our Faith, and convincing <hi>Hereticks;</hi> From the Example of our Saviour's <hi>disputing</hi> with the <hi>Doctors</hi> and the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and of St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> with the <hi>Jews; These,</hi> and such other little <hi>Cavils,</hi> can signifie nothing to the disadvantage of what I have said about the <hi>Humour</hi> of <hi>Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> in Matters of <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>uncertain</hi> Opinions; against which the <hi>Real Philosophy</hi> is an Antidote.</p>
               <p>ANd thus I have shewn, under <hi>five</hi> material Heads, That the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the greatest <hi>Interests</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> and by the three last it appears how fundamentally opposite it is to all <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> which are made up and occasioned by <hi>Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Enthusiasm,</hi> and <hi>ignorant, perverse Disputings.</hi> So that for <hi>Atheists,</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> to detest and inveigh against <hi>Philosophy,</hi> is not at all strange; 'Tis no <hi>more</hi> than what may well be expected from Men of that sort; <hi>Philosophy</hi> is their Enemy; and it concerns them to <hi>disparage</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> it: But for the <hi>Sober</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> to do any thing so unadvised, and so prejudicial to Religion, is wonderful and deplorable: To set <hi>these</hi> right in their Judgment about <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical</hi> Inquiry into <hi>God's Works,</hi> is the Principal design of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53288:87"/>
                  <hi>these</hi> Papers; and in order to the further promoting of it, I advance to the last Head of Discourse proposed, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>(IV.) THat</hi> the Ministers and Professors of Religion ought not to discourage, but promote the knowledge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Works of its Author.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> is the result of the whole Matter, and follows evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it. And though it will not infer a necessity of <hi>all</hi> Mens <hi>deep</hi> search into Nature, yet <hi>this</hi> it will, That no <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Servant</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> should <hi>hinder</hi> or <hi>discountenance</hi> such <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries:</hi> And though most <hi>private</hi> Christians, and some <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Ministers, have neither leisure nor ability to look into Matters of natural Research and Inquisition; yet they ought to <hi>think candidly,</hi> and <hi>wish well</hi> to the endeavours of <hi>those</hi> that <hi>have;</hi> and 'tis a <hi>sin</hi> and a <hi>folly</hi> either in the one or other to censure, or discourage those worthy Undertakings. So that I cannot without trouble, observe how apt <hi>some</hi> are, that pretend much to <hi>Religion,</hi> and some that <hi>minister</hi> in it, to load those that are <hi>studious</hi> of <hi>God's</hi> Works, with all the <hi>studious</hi> Names that contempt and spight can suggest; The <hi>Irreligion</hi> of which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious carriage, nothing can excuse but their <hi>ignorance;</hi> And I will rather hope that they neither <hi>know</hi> what they <hi>say,</hi> nor what they <hi>do,</hi> than believe that they have any direct design against the <hi>Glory</hi> of their <hi>Maker,</hi> or against any laudable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to promote it.</p>
               <p>I know well what mischief <hi>Prejudice</hi> will do, even upon Minds that otherwise are <hi>very honest,</hi> and <hi>intelligent enough.</hi> And there are many <hi>common</hi> slanders, and some plausible <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> in the Mouths of the <hi>Zealous</hi> against <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which have begot an ill Opinion of it in well-meaning Men, who have never examined things with any depth of Inquiry. For the sake of such, I shall produce the most <hi>considerable</hi> Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of both sorts, and I hope make such returns to them, as may be sufficient to satisfie those whose Minds are not barr'd by <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> or <hi>Ignorance.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:53288:87"/>
I speak <hi>first</hi> of the <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>broad Slanders,</hi> among which, that</p>
               <p n="1">(I.) Of <hi>Atbeism</hi> is one of the most <hi>ordinary;</hi> But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly 'tis one of the most <hi>unjust</hi> Accusations that Malice and Ignorance could have invented. This I need not be industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to prove here, having made it appear, that Philosophy is one of the best Weapons in the World to defend Religion against it; and my whole Discourse is a confutation of this envious and foolish charge.</p>
               <p>Concerning it I take notice, That <hi>Philosophical</hi> Men are usually dealt with by the <hi>Zealous,</hi> as the greatest Patrons of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Cause are by the <hi>Sects.</hi> For as the <hi>Bishops</hi> and other Learned Persons, who have <hi>most strongly</hi> oppugned the <hi>Romish Faith,</hi> have had the ill luck to be accused of <hi>Popery</hi> themselves; in like manner it happens to the <hi>humblest</hi> and <hi>deepest Inquisitors</hi> into the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who have the most and fullest <hi>Arguments</hi> of his <hi>Existence,</hi> have raised <hi>impregnable Ramparts,</hi> with much <hi>industry</hi> and <hi>pious pains</hi> against the <hi>Atheists,</hi> and are the <hi>only Men</hi> that can with success serve <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> against the <hi>Godless Rout; These, Superstitious Ignorance</hi> hath always made the loudest out-cry <hi>against,</hi> as if themselves were <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>that</hi> which they have most happily <hi>oppugned</hi> and <hi>defeated.</hi> And the certain way to be esteemed an <hi>Atheist</hi> by the <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>ignorant Devoto's,</hi> is to study to lay the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Religion sure,</hi> and to be able to speak <hi>groundedly</hi> and to <hi>purpose</hi> against the <hi>desperate</hi> Cause of the <hi>black Conspirators</hi> against <hi>Heaven.</hi> And the greatest Men that have imploy'd their Time and Thoughts this way, have been <hi>pelted</hi> with this <hi>Dirt,</hi> while they have been labouring in the <hi>Trenches,</hi> and indeavouring to secure the <hi>Foundations</hi> of the <hi>Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But besides I observe, That <hi>narrow, angry</hi> People take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to charge the <hi>freer Spirits</hi> with <hi>Atheism,</hi> because they move in a <hi>larger</hi> Circle, and have no such <hi>fond adherence</hi> to <hi>some Opinions</hi> which <hi>they adore</hi> and count <hi>Sacred.</hi> And for my own part, I confess I have not <hi>Superstition</hi> enough in my <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> to incline me to doat upon all the Principles I judge <hi>true,</hi> or to speak so <hi>dogmatically</hi> about them, as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

                  <hi>confident</hi> and <hi>disputing</hi> Men are wont. But contenting my self, with a <hi>firm assent</hi> to the <hi>few practical Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and having <hi>fix'd that end</hi> of the <hi>Compass,</hi> I desire to preserve my <hi>Liberty</hi> as to the <hi>rest,</hi> holding the <hi>other</hi> in such a posture, as may be ready to draw those <hi>Lines,</hi> my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment informed by the <hi>Holy Oracles,</hi> the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>our Church,</hi> the <hi>Apprehensions</hi> of <hi>wise Antiquity,</hi> and my <hi>particular Reason,</hi> shall direct me to describe. And when I do <hi>that,</hi> 'tis for <hi>my self,</hi> and my <hi>own satisfaction;</hi> but am not concern'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose my <hi>Sentiments</hi> upon <hi>others:</hi> nor do I care to endeavour the change of their Minds, though I judge them mistaken, as long as <hi>Vertue,</hi> the <hi>Interests</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> and <hi>their own</hi> are not <hi>prejudiced</hi> by their <hi>Errors.</hi> By this <hi>modest</hi> indifference I secure <hi>Charity</hi> for all the <hi>diversities</hi> of <hi>Belief,</hi> and <hi>equally</hi> offer my <hi>Frienship</hi> and <hi>Converses</hi> to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Perswasions,</hi> that stick to the <hi>plain Principles</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> and a <hi>Vertuous Life,</hi> overlooking their particular <hi>fondnesses</hi> and <hi>follies.</hi> This is the <hi>temper</hi> of my <hi>Genius,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> some <hi>warm</hi> People, who have more <hi>Heat</hi> than <hi>Light,</hi> are apt to call <hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>cold Neutrality:</hi> But that it deserves <hi>better</hi> Names, I have made appear in some other Papers.</p>
               <p>True it is, That the Men of the meer <hi>Epicurean</hi> sort, have <hi>left God,</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> out of their Accounts; But <hi>other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi> have shewn what <hi>Fools</hi> they are for doing <hi>so,</hi> and how <hi>absurd</hi> their <hi>pretended</hi> Philosophy is in supposing things to have been made and ordered by the <hi>casual</hi> hits of <hi>Atoms,</hi> in a <hi>mighty Void.</hi> And though their general Doctrine of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> be exceeding <hi>ancient,</hi> and very accountable; when we suppose <hi>Matter</hi> was at first <hi>created</hi> by Almighty Power, and its <hi>Motions ordered,</hi> and directed by <hi>Omniscient</hi> Wisdom; Yet the supposal, that they are <hi>independent</hi> and <hi>eternal,</hi> is very precarious and unreasonable. And that all the <hi>regular</hi> Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Nature should be from <hi>blind tumultuous</hi> jumblings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixtures, is the most <hi>unphilosophical</hi> Fansie, and <hi>ridiculous</hi> Dotage in the World; So that there is no reason to accuse <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> of a Fault, which <hi>Philosophy</hi> sufficiently shames and reproves; and yet I doubt too many have entertain'd great prejudice against it upon this score; and 'tis a particular brand upon some of the modern Men, that they have revived
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53288:88"/>
the Philosophy of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> which they think to be in its whole extent <hi>Atheistical</hi> and <hi>Irreligious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I say, that the Opinion of the <hi>World's</hi> being made by a <hi>fortuitous</hi> concurrence of <hi>Atoms,</hi> is <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>vile:</hi> And this those of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Elder School taught: Whereas the late Restorers of the <hi>Corpuscularian Hypothesis</hi> hate, and despise the wicked and absurd Doctrine; But thus far they think the <hi>Atomical Philosophy reasonable, viz.</hi> as it teacheth, <hi>That the Operations of Nature are performed by</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile streams <hi>of</hi> minute <hi>Bodies; and not by I know not what ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary</hi> Qualities <hi>and</hi> Forms: They think, <hi>That the various</hi> Motions <hi>and</hi> Figures <hi>of the parts of Matter, are enough for all the</hi> Phaenomena, <hi>and all the varieties, which with relation to our Senses we call</hi> such, <hi>and</hi> such Qualities. But then they suppose, and teach, <hi>That God created Matter, and is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Orderer of its Motions, by which all those Diversities are made:</hi> And hereby <hi>Piety,</hi> and the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> is secured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This,</hi> as far as we know any thing of elder Times, was the <hi>ancient</hi> Philosophy of the World, and it doth not in the least interfere with any <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> Thus far I dare say I may undertake for most of the <hi>Corpuscularian Philosophers</hi> of our times, excepting <hi>those</hi> of M. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his way.</p>
               <p>And therefore I cannot but wonder at a late Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who seems to conclude those <hi>Modern</hi> Philosophers under the name and notion of such <hi>Somatists,</hi> as are for <hi>meer Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> and exclude <hi>immaterial</hi> Beings: whereas <hi>those</hi> Learned Men, though they own <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> as the <hi>material</hi> and <hi>formal</hi> causes of the <hi>Phenomena;</hi> They do yet acknowledge God's <hi>Efficiency,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of all Things, with as much seriousness; and contend for it with as much zeal, as any <hi>Philosophers</hi> or <hi>Divines</hi> whatsoever. And 'tis very hard that any number of Men should be exposed to the suspicion of being <hi>Atheists,</hi> for denying the <hi>Peripatetick Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> and <hi>Forms;</hi> and there is nothing else overthrown by the <hi>Corpuscularian</hi> Doctrines, as they are managed by <hi>those Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers.</hi> So that methinks that Reverend Person hath not dealt so <hi>fairly</hi> with the great Names of <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> and <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sendus,</hi> where he mentions them promiscuously with the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53288:89"/>
meer <hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Hobbian Somatists,</hi> without any note to distinguish them from <hi>those Sadduces;</hi> For both those celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Men have laboured much in asserting the Grand Articles of Religion against the <hi>Infidel</hi> and <hi>Atheist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (2.) 'tis alledg'd by some, <hi>Philosophy disposeth Men to despise the Scriptures;</hi> or <hi>at least to neglect the study of them;</hi> and therefore is to be flighted, and exploded among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>To this I say, That <hi>Philosophy is the knowledge of God's Works;</hi> and there is nothing in <hi>God's Works</hi> that is <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>his Word;</hi> How then should the <hi>study</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> incline Men to <hi>despise</hi> the <hi>other?</hi> Certainly had there been any such <hi>impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> tendency in searching into God's Works to the <hi>lessening</hi> of our <hi>value</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> The Scripture it self would never have recommended it so much unto us; Yea, <hi>this</hi> is so far from being <hi>true,</hi> that on the contrary, the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>God's Works</hi> tends in its proper nature to dispose Men to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>veneration</hi> of the Scriptures; For by <hi>familiarity</hi> with <hi>Nature,</hi> we are made sensible of the <hi>Power, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of God, fresh Instances of which we shall find in all things; And 'tis one great design of the Scripture to promote the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>these Attributes:</hi> How then can he, that is much affected with them, chuse but <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>esteem</hi> those Holy Records which so gloriously illustrate the <hi>Perfections</hi> he <hi>admires?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, by <hi>inquiry</hi> into <hi>God's Works,</hi> we discover continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, how little we can comprehend of his <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagements;</hi> and he that is sensible of <hi>this,</hi> will find himself more inclined to reverence the <hi>declarations</hi> of his <hi>Word, though they are beyond his reach,</hi> and <hi>though he cannot fathom those My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, he is required to believe:</hi> Such a disposition is necessary for the securing our Reverence to the Divine Oracles, and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> promotes it much.</p>
               <p>So that, though 'tis like enough, there may be those that <hi>pretend</hi> to Philosophy, who have less veneration and respect for the Scripture than they ought, yet that <hi>impious</hi> disesteem of those <hi>sacred</hi> Writings, is no <hi>effect</hi> of their <hi>Philosophy,</hi> but of their <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> Inclinations: And to remove the scandal brought upon Natural Wisdom by those Pretenders, it

               <p>That <hi>Philosophy, viz.</hi> that which is called, the <hi>new,</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Doctrines that are coutrary to the <hi>Word of God;</hi> or at least such as we have no ground from <hi>Scripture</hi> to believe; For instance, That the <hi>Earth moves:</hi> and, That the <hi>Moon is of a Terrestrial</hi> Nature, and capable of Inhabitants: which Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are presumed to be <hi>impious,</hi> and <hi>Antiscriptural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In return to this, I say,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) In the <hi>general;</hi> 'Tis very true, that <hi>Philosophy</hi> teacheth many things which are not <hi>revealed</hi> in Scripture; for <hi>this</hi> was not intended to instruct Men in the <hi>Affairs</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> but its <hi>Design</hi> is, to <hi>direct</hi> Mankind, and even <hi>those</hi> of the <hi>plainest</hi> Understandings, in <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Manners;</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to us the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Happiness,</hi> and the <hi>Principles</hi> that are <hi>necessary</hi> to guide us in it; with the several <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements</hi> that are proper to <hi>excite</hi> our Endeavours, and to bear them up against all <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Temptations.</hi> This, I say, was the <hi>chief</hi> Design of that <hi>Divine</hi> Book; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis accommodated, in the main, to the most <hi>ordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,</hi> and speaks after our <hi>manner,</hi> suitably to <hi>sense,</hi> and <hi>vulgar Conception.</hi> Thus we find that the <hi>Clouds</hi> are called <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Moon one</hi> of the <hi>greater Lights,</hi> and the <hi>Stars</hi> mentioned, as <hi>less considerable: and the Stars also,</hi> Gen. 1. We read of the <hi>going down</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and of the <hi>ends</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and of the <hi>Heavens;</hi> and divers other such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions are in the Scriptures, which plainly shew, That they do not concern themselves to rectifie the Mistakes of the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> in <hi>Philosophical</hi> Theories, but comply with their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53288:90"/>
Infirmities, and speak according as they understand. So that,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) No <hi>Tenent</hi> in <hi>Philosophy</hi> ought to be condemned and exploded, because there may be some occasional Sayings in the Divine Oracles, which seem not to comport with it; And therefore the <hi>Problems</hi> mentioned, concerning the <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Earth;</hi> and <hi>Terrestrial Nature</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> ought to be left to the <hi>Disquisitions</hi> of <hi>Philosophy:</hi> The <hi>Word of God</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines <hi>nothing</hi> about them; for <hi>those</hi> Expressions, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>running</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and its <hi>standing</hi> still, may very well be interpreted, as spoken by way of <hi>accommodation</hi> to <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>common</hi> apprehension; as 'tis certain, that those of its <hi>going down,</hi> and <hi>running from one end of the Heavens to the other,</hi> and numerous resembling Sayings, are <hi>so</hi> to be understood. And when 'tis else-where said, That the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> are so <hi>fixt,</hi> that it cannot be <hi>moved</hi> at <hi>any time,</hi> or to that purpose; 'Tis supposed, by Learned Men, that nothing else is meant but <hi>this,</hi> That the <hi>Earth</hi> cannot be <hi>moved</hi> from its <hi>Centre,</hi> which is no prejudice to the Opinion of its being <hi>moved upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the other <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the <hi>Moon's</hi> being a kind of <hi>Earth;</hi> the Scripture hath said nothing of it, on either hand; nor can its <hi>silence</hi> be <hi>argumentative here,</hi> since we know, That all Mankind believes many things, of which there is no mention <hi>there:</hi> As that there are such places as <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> That the <hi>Magnet attracts Iron,</hi> and <hi>directs</hi> to the <hi>North,</hi> and that the <hi>Sea</hi> hath the <hi>motion</hi> of <hi>Flux,</hi> and <hi>Reflux,</hi> with ten thousand such other things discovered by <hi>Experience,</hi> of which there is not the least hint in the <hi>Sacred</hi> Volume: And are not these to be believed, till they can be proved from Scripture? This is ridiculously to abuse the <hi>Holy Oracles,</hi> and to <hi>extend</hi> them beyond their <hi>proper</hi> Business and Design.</p>
               <p>To argue against this Supposal, as some do, by Queries, <hi>What Men are in that other Earth? Whether fallen?</hi> and <hi>how saved?</hi> is very childish and absurd. He that holds the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, may confess his <hi>ignorance</hi> in all <hi>these</hi> things, without
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53288:90"/>
any <hi>prejudice</hi> to his <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the <hi>Moon's</hi> being <hi>habitable;</hi> or the supposal of its being <hi>actually inhabited.</hi> For that may be, though no living Man can tell the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> of those Creatures.</p>
               <p>But for my part, I assert neither of these <hi>Paradoxes;</hi> only I have thought fit to speak thus briefly about them, that they may be left to the <hi>freedom</hi> of <hi>Philosophical</hi> Inquiry, for the Scripture is not concerned in such Queries. And yet besides this, which might suffice to vindicate the <hi>Neoterick Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> from the charge of being <hi>injurious</hi> to the <hi>Scripture</hi> in such Instances, I add,</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The <hi>Free Experimental Philosophy</hi> which I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, doth not affirm either of those so much dreaded <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions:</hi> For neither of them hath sufficient evidence to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>peremptory</hi> and <hi>dogmatical</hi> Assertions: And therefore, though perhaps some of those <hi>Philosophers</hi> may think, they have great degrees of probability, and are fit for <hi>Philosophical</hi> Consideration; Yet there are none, (that I know) who look on them as <hi>Certainties,</hi> and <hi>positive</hi> Truths: 'Tis contrary to the <hi>Genius</hi> of their way; to dogmatize for things of so great an uncertainty; or to be confident against them, where there wants full proof to assure the Negative. But whether the one be true, or the other, <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are not at all concerned.</p>
               <p>Thus briefly of the <hi>Slanders</hi> that are affixt upon <hi>Philosophy, viz.</hi> of its <hi>Tendency</hi> to <hi>Atheism,</hi> and disparagement of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> The other lesser ones are answered in the discussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:53288:91"/>
               <p>BUT besides the <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>slanderous</hi> Imputations, fastned on <hi>Philosophy;</hi> there are some <hi>vulgar plausibilities</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; the chief of which I shall now recite and answer; 'Tis said,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>(1.)</hi> There is too much curiosity in those Inquiries; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> desired to know nothing but Christ, and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, That what is <hi>blameable curiosity</hi> in things not <hi>worth</hi> our <hi>pains,</hi> or <hi>forbidden</hi> our <hi>scrutiny,</hi> is <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>laudable</hi> endeavour in Matters that are <hi>weighty,</hi> and <hi>permitted</hi> to our <hi>search.</hi> So that no ill can justly be fastned upon <hi>Philosophical Inquisitions</hi> into <hi>Nature,</hi> on this account, till it be first proved, That a diligent observance of God's <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> in his <hi>Works,</hi> in order to the <hi>using</hi> them to his <hi>Glory,</hi> and the <hi>benefit</hi> of the World, is either <hi>prohibited</hi> or <hi>impertinent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is indeed such a <hi>depth</hi> in Nature, that it is never like to be <hi>throughly fathomed;</hi> and such a <hi>darkness</hi> upon <hi>some</hi> of God's <hi>Works,</hi> that they will not in this World be <hi>found out to Perfection:</hi> But however, we are not kept off by any express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Prohibition; <hi>Nature</hi> is no <hi>Holy Mount</hi> that ought not to be <hi>touched;</hi> yea, we are commanded, To <hi>search after</hi> Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and particularly after <hi>this,</hi> when we are so frequently called upon to <hi>celebrate</hi> our Creator for his <hi>Works;</hi> and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the success of many that have gone before; For <hi>many shall go to and fro, and Science shall be increased.</hi> So that our <hi>Iniquiries</hi> into <hi>Nature</hi> are not <hi>forbidden;</hi> and he that saith they are <hi>frivolous,</hi> and of <hi>no use,</hi> when the Art of the Omniscient is the <hi>Object,</hi> and his Glory, and the good of Men, the <hi>end,</hi> asperseth both the <hi>Creator</hi> and the <hi>Creature,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts his duty to both.</p>
               <p>As for the latter clause of the <hi>Objection,</hi> which urgeth that Speech of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of his desiring to <hi>know nothing but Christ and him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2. I return to it, That he that shall duely consider the Discourse of the Apostle in the verse
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53288:91"/>
before, and those that succeed, will perceive, That in this expression he only slights the <hi>affected Eloquence</hi> of the <hi>Orators</hi> and <hi>Rhetoricians;</hi> He spoke in <hi>plainness</hi> and <hi>simplicity,</hi> and not in those <hi>inticing words</hi> of <hi>Man's Wisdom,</hi> which he desired either not to <hi>know</hi> at all, or not in <hi>comparison</hi> with the <hi>plain</hi> Doctrines of the Gospel. Or, if any should take the words in the <hi>largest</hi> sense, then all sorts of <hi>Humane</hi> Learning, and all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Trades</hi> are set at nought by the Apostle; And if <hi>so,</hi> the <hi>meaning</hi> can be no <hi>more</hi> than <hi>this,</hi> That he preferred the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> before <hi>these;</hi> For 'tis ridiculous to think, that he <hi>absolutely</hi> slighted all other <hi>Science.</hi> The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is indeed the <hi>chiefest</hi> and most <hi>valuable Wisdom,</hi> but the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hath its place also, and ought not quite to be excluded and despised: Or, if <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> be to be slighted, by this Text, all <hi>other Knowledge</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever must be condemn'd by it.</p>
               <p>But it will be urged,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>(2.)</hi> That there is a particular Caution given by the Apostle against Philosophy, <hi>Col. 2. 8.</hi> Beware lest any one spoil you through Philosophy.</p>
               <p>To this I have said elsewhere, That the Apostle <hi>there</hi> means either the <hi>pretended</hi> Knowledge of the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> the <hi>Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the <hi>disputing</hi> Learning of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and perhaps he might have a respect to <hi>all</hi> those sorts of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence falsly so call'd. That the <hi>Disputing</hi> Philosophy of the <hi>Greeks</hi> is concerned in the Caution, will appear very probable, if we consider, That much of it was built on <hi>meer Notion,</hi> that occasioned <hi>division</hi> into manifold <hi>Sects,</hi> which managed their Matters by <hi>Sophistry</hi> and <hi>Disputations,</hi> full of <hi>nicity</hi> and <hi>mazes</hi> of Wit; and aimed at <hi>little,</hi> but the <hi>pride</hi> of <hi>mysterious</hi> talk of things, that were not <hi>really</hi> understood. Such a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> the Apostle might <hi>justly condemn,</hi> and all Wise Men <hi>do the same,</hi> because 'tis very injurious to <hi>Religion, Real Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> of Men. But what is this to that, which <hi>modestly</hi> inquires into the <hi>Creatures</hi> of God, as <hi>they are;</hi> That collects the <hi>History</hi> of his <hi>Works,</hi> raising <hi>Observations</hi> from them for the <hi>Discovery</hi> of <hi>Causes,</hi> and <hi>Invention</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> and <hi>Helps</hi> for the <hi>benefit</hi> of Mankind? What vanity; what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53288:92"/>
to <hi>Religion</hi> can be supposed in <hi>this?</hi> Is this, think we, <hi>that Philosophy, that Wisdom of this World,</hi> which the great Apostle censures and condemns? He is bold that saith it, <hi>speaks a thing he knows not,</hi> and might, if he pleased, know the contrary; Since the <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Philosophy</hi> I vindicate, which proceeds by <hi>Observation</hi> and <hi>Experiment</hi> to <hi>Works,</hi> and <hi>uses</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> was not, if at all, the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>those</hi> Times in which the Apostles liv'd, nor did it <hi>begin</hi> to shew it self in many Ages after; and therefore cannot be concerned in St. <hi>Paul's Caution</hi> to his <hi>Colossians;</hi> nor in his smartness against <hi>worldly Wisdom</hi> elsewhere, for by that we are to understand the <hi>Fetches</hi> of <hi>Policy,</hi> the <hi>Nicities</hi> of <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Strains</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> that were then engaged against the progress of the Gospel: But what is all <hi>this</hi> to the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>God's Works;</hi> which <hi>illustrates</hi> the <hi>Divine Glory,</hi> and <hi>comments</hi> upon his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> and <hi>promotes</hi> the great <hi>Design</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which is <hi>doing good;</hi> and in its <hi>proper</hi> Nature <hi>tends</hi> to the <hi>disposing</hi> of Mens Minds to <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But (3.)</hi> If Philosophy be so excellent an Instrument to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; it may be askt <hi>(and the Question will have the force of an Objection)</hi> why the Disciples and first Preachers of the Gospel were not instructed in it; They were plain illiterate Men, altogether unacquainted with those Sublimities; God chose the foolish things of this World, to confound the wise. So that it seems he did not shew this kind of Wisdom that respect which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Discourse is due unto it.</p>
               <p>I answer, That this choice the Divine Wisdom made of the Publishers of the <hi>Glad Tydings</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> is no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice or discredit to <hi>Philosophy,</hi> than it is to other sorts of <hi>Learning;</hi> and indeed 'tis none at all to any: For the special <hi>Reasons</hi> of God's making this Election seem such as these, <hi>viz.</hi> That his <hi>Power</hi> might more evidently appear in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful propagation of the Religion of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> by such seemingly unqualified Instruments; That the World might not suspect it to be the contrivance of <hi>Wit, Subtilty</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> when there was so much plainness and simplicity in its first Promoters: And perhaps too it was done in contempt of the vain and pretended <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> over
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53288:92"/>
which the plainness of the Gospel was made gloriously to triumph. To which I add this; It might be to shew, That God values <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> above all <hi>Natural Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> how excellent soever. So that there being such special Reasons for the chusing plain Men to set this grand Affair on foot in the World, it can be no disparagement to the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> that it was not begun by Philosophers. And to counter-argue this <hi>Topick,</hi> we may consider, That</p>
               <p>The <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and Holy Men of Ancient Times that were most in the Divine Favour, were well instructed in the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>God's Works,</hi> and contributed to the good of Men by their useful Discoveries and Inventions. <hi>Adam</hi> was acquainted with the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Creatures; Noah</hi> a <hi>Planter</hi> of <hi>Vineyards; Abraham</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> collects from Ancient History) a great <hi>Mystes</hi> in the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Stars. Isaac prosperous</hi> in <hi>Georgicks. Jacob</hi> blessed in his <hi>Philosophical Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem</hi> of the <hi>speckled</hi> Rods. <hi>Moses</hi> a great Man in all kinds of <hi>Natural Knowledge.

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>WE see upon the whole. That there is no shadow of Reason why we should discourage or oppose modest Inquiries into the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> and whatsoever igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Zeal may prompt the common sort to, me-thinks those of generous Education should not be of so perverse a frame: Especially it becomes not any that <hi>minister</hi> at the <hi>Altar,</hi> to do so great a disservice to <hi>Religion,</hi> as to promote so unjust a Conceit as that of <hi>Philosophy's</hi> being an Enemy unto it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Philosophers</hi> were the <hi>Priests</hi> among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and several other Nations in Ancient Times; and there was never more need that the <hi>Priests</hi> should be <hi>Philosophers,</hi> than in <hi>ours;</hi> For we are liable every day to be called out to make good our <hi>Foundations</hi> against the <hi>Atheist,</hi> the <hi>Sadduce,</hi> and <hi>Enthusiast;</hi> And 'tis the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Works</hi> that must furnish us with some of the most proper Weapons of <hi>Defence.</hi> Hard Names, and damning Sentences; the Arrows of bitter words, and raging passions, will not defeat those <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Anak;</hi> these are not fit Weapons for our Warfare. No, they must be met by a Reason instructed in the knowledge of Things, and fought in their own Quarters, and their Arms must be turned upon themselves; This may be done, and the advantage is all ours. We have Steel and Brass for our Defence, and they have little else than Twigs and Bull-rushes for the Assault; we have Light, and firm Ground, and they are lost in Smoak and Mists; They tread among Bogs and dangerous Fens, and reel near the Rocks and Steeps. And shall we despise our Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and forsake them? Shall we relinquish our Ground, and our Light, and muffle our selves up in darkness? Shall we give our Enemies the Weapons, and all the odds, and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to insure their Triumphs over us? This is so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tishly to betray Religion and our selves.</p>
               <p>If this Discourse chance to meet with any that are guilty of these dangerous Follies, it will, I hope, convince them,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53288:93"/>
That they have no reason to be afraid of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise its Aids in the Concerns of Religion. And for those who never yet thought of this part of <hi>Religion</hi> to <hi>glorifie</hi> God for his <hi>Works,</hi> I wish it may awaken them to more attentive consideration of the <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> that is in them; and so excite their pious <hi>acclamations.</hi> And to encourage them to it, I shall adventure to add,</p>
               <p>That it seems very probable, that much of the <hi>Matter</hi> of those <hi>Hallelujah's</hi> and <hi>triumphant</hi> Songs, that shall be the <hi>joyful</hi> entertainment of the <hi>Blessed,</hi> will be taken from the <hi>wonders</hi> of <hi>God's Works;</hi> and who knows, but the contemplation of these, and God in them, shall make up a good part of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of those <hi>glorified Spirits;</hi> who will then have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable advantages for the searching into those Effects of Divine <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> beyond what are possible for us Mortals to attain. And those Discoveries which for ever they shall make in that <hi>immense Treasure</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> must needs fill their Souls every moment with <hi>pleasant</hi> astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inflame their hearts with the ardours of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> which will breathe forth in <hi>everlasting Thanksgivings.</hi> And thus the <hi>study of God's Works</hi> joyned with those <hi>pious Sentiments</hi> they deserve, is a kind of antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of <hi>Heaven;</hi> And next after the contemplations of his <hi>Word,</hi> and the wonders of his <hi>Mercy</hi> discovered in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, it is one of the best and noblest Imployments; the most becoming a reasonable Creature, and such a one as is taught by the most <hi>reasonable</hi> and <hi>excellent Religion</hi> in the World.</p>

                  <hi>Essay</hi> V. THE AGREEMENT OF Reason and Religion.</head>
               <p>THere is not any thing that I know, which hath done more mischief to <hi>Religion,</hi> than the disparaging of <hi>Reason,</hi> under pretence of respect and favour to it: For hereby the very Foundations of Christian Faith have been undermin'd, and the World prepared for Atheism. And if Reason must not be heard, the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> can neither be proved nor defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and so our Faith drops to the Ground like an House that hath no Foundation:</p>
               <p>By the same way, those sickly Conceits, and Enthusiastick Dreams, and unsound Doctrines that have poyson'd our Air, and infatuated the Minds of Men, and expos'd Religion to the scorn of Infidels, and divided the Church, and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Peace of Mankind, and involv'd all the Nation in so much Blood, and so many Ruines; I say hereby, all these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Follies, that have been the oceasions of so many Mischiefs, have been propagated and promoted. On which accounts I think I may affirm, with some confidence, That here is the Spring-Head of most of the Watters of Bitterness and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53288:96"/>
Strife; And here the Fountain of the Great Deeps of Atheism and Fanaticism, that are broken up upon us.</p>
               <p>So that there cannot be a more seasonable Service done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Reason or Religion, than to endeavour the stopping up this Source of Mischiefs, by representing the Friendship and fair Agreement that is between them: For hereby <hi>Religion</hi> will be rescued from the impious accusation of its being <hi>groundless</hi> and <hi>imaginary:</hi> And <hi>Reason</hi> also defended against the unjust Charge of its being <hi>prophane</hi> and <hi>irreligious:</hi> This we have heard often from indiscreet and hot Men; For, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entertain'd vain and unreasonable Doctrines, which they had made an Interest, and the Badges of a Party, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that their Darling Opinions could not stand, if Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, their Enemy, were not discredited; They set up loud cries against it, as the grand Adversary of Free Grace and Faith; and zealously endeavour'd to run it down under the misapplyed names of <hi>Vain Philosophy, Carnal Reasoning,</hi> and the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of this <hi>World;</hi> and what have been the Effects of this proceeding, we have seen and felt.</p>
               <p>So that, in my Judgment, it is the great duty of all sober and reasonable Men, to rise up (as they can) against this Spirit of Folly and Infatuation: And something I shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt now, by shewing, That <hi>Reason</hi> is very serviceable to <hi>Religion;</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> very friendly to <hi>Reason.</hi> In order to which, I must</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) State, what I <hi>mean</hi> by <hi>Religion?</hi> and what by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</hi> For there is nothing in any Matter of Enquiry or Debate that can be discover'd, or determin'd, till the Terms of the Question are explain'd, and the Notions settled. The want of this hath been the occasion of a great part of those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions we find in Disputes; and particularly most of the Clamours that have been raised against Reason in the Affairs of Religion have sprung from it. For while ungrounded Opinions, and unreasonable Practises are often call'd Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on the one hand; and vain Imaginations, and false Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences are as frequently stiled Reason, on the other; 'Tis no wonder that such a Religion disclaims the use of Reason; or that such Reason is opposite to Religion. Therefore, in order to my shewing the Agreement between True Religion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53288:96"/>
and the Genuine Reason, I shall, with all the clearness that I can, represent the just meaning of the one, and of the other.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Religion</hi> first; It is taken either strictly for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God; or in a more comprehensive sense, for the <hi>sum</hi> of those <hi>Duties</hi> we owe to Him: And this takes in the other, and agrees with the Notation of the Name, which imports <hi>Binding,</hi> and implies <hi>Duty.</hi> Now all Duty is comprised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these two, <hi>viz. Worship</hi> and <hi>Vertue:</hi> Worship compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all Duties that immediately relate to God, as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of them; Vertue, all those that respect our Neighbour and our Selves. So that Religion primarily, and mainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Duty cannot be performed without <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>some Principles</hi> there must be to direct the Practice: and those that discover the Duties, and guide Men in the performance of them, are call'd <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are of two sorts;
<list>
                     <item>Some (1.) Fundamental and Essential.</item>
                     <item>Others (2.) Accessory and Assisting.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fundamental</hi> is a Metaphor taken from the Foundation of a Building, upon which the Fabrick is erected, and without which it cannot stand. So that Fundamental Principles are such, as are <hi>presupposed</hi> to the <hi>Duties</hi> of Religion (one, or more) and <hi>such,</hi> as are absolutely necessary to the doing of them: of this sort I shall mention three, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>The Being of God,</hi> and the <hi>perfections of his Nature.</hi> The belief of these is necessary to all the parts of Religion. He that comes unto God, in any way of Worship, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, <hi>must know that he is,</hi> and in some measure, <hi>what:</hi> Namely, he must know, and own the commonly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd Attributes of his Being.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A second necessary Principle is, The <hi>Providenee of God, viz.</hi> the Knowledge, That he made us, and not we our selves; that he preserves us, and daily provides for us the good things we enjoy: This is necessary to the Duties of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53288:97"/>
                  <hi>Prayer, Praise,</hi> and <hi>Adoration:</hi> And if there be no Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; Prayer, and Thanksgiving, and other Acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, are in vain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Fundamental, is, <hi>Moral, Good, and Evil.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this there can be no <hi>confession</hi> of Sin; no respect to <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Humility, Justice, Purity,</hi> or the rest that we call Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These</hi> will be confes'd to be <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of Religion: And I shall not dispute how many more may be admitted into the number. These we are sure are such, in the strictest sense, for all Religion <hi>supposeth,</hi> and stands upon them: And they have been acknowledg'd by Mankind in all Ages and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the World.</p>
               <p>But besides these, there are other Principles of Religion, which are not in the same degree of <hi>absolute</hi> necessity with the former, but yet are highly serviceable, by way of incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and assistance. I reckon four, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(1,)</hi> That God will pardon us if we repent. <hi>(2.)</hi> That he will assist us, if we endeavour. <hi>(3.)</hi> That he will accept of Services that are imperfect, if they are sincere. <hi>(4.)</hi> That he will righteously reward and punish in another World.</p>
               <p>These contain the Matter and Substance of the Gospel; more clearly and explicitly reveal'd to the Christian Church; but in some measure owned also by the Gentiles. So that I may reckon, that the <hi>Principles</hi> I have mention'd, are the <hi>sum</hi> of the <hi>Religion of Mankind;</hi> I mean, as to the Doctrinal Part of it: and the <hi>Duties</hi> recited before, are the Substance of the <hi>Practical,</hi> which primarily and most essentially is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And Christianity takes in all these Duties, and all these Principles; advancing the Duties to higher degrees of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Perfection; incouraging them by new Motives and Assistances; and superadding two other Instances, <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> And for the Principles, it confirms those of Natural Religion; it explains them further, and discovers some few new ones: And all these, both of the former and the latter sort, are contain'd in the <hi>Creed.</hi> Here are all the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of Religion, and the main <hi>Assisting Principles</hi> also.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53288:97"/>
And though our Church require our assent to <hi>more</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions; yet those are only <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> not Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>Salvation.</hi> And if we go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Creed</hi> for the Essentials of Faith; who can tell where we shall stop?</p>
               <p>The sum is, Religion <hi>primarily</hi> is <hi>Duty;</hi> And Duty is All that which God hath commanded to be done by his Word, or our Reasons; and we have the substance of these in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi> Religion also, in a <hi>secondary</hi> sense, consists in some Principles relating to the Worship of God, and of his Son, in the ways of devout and vertuous living; and these are comprised in that Summary of Belief, called the <hi>Apostles Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I take to be Religion; and this Religion I shall prove to be reasonable: But I cannot undertake for all the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons some Men are pleased to call <hi>Orthodox;</hi> nor for all those that by many private Persons, and some Churches, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted essential Articles of Faith and Salvation. Thus I have stated what I mean by Religion.</p>
               <p>The OTHER thing to be determined, and fixt, is, the proper Notion of <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this we may consider, that Reason is sometimes taken for <hi>Reason</hi> in the <hi>Faculty,</hi> which is the <hi>Vnderstanding;</hi> and at other times, for <hi>Reason</hi> in the <hi>Object,</hi> which consists in those <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Conclusions,</hi> by which the Understanding is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. This latter is meant in the Dispute concerning the Agreement or Disagreement of Reason and Religion. And Reason in this sense, is the same with <hi>natural Truth,</hi> which I said is made up of Principles and Conclusions. By the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of Reason we are not to understand the Grounds of any Man's <hi>Philosophy;</hi> nor the Critical Rules of <hi>Syllogism;</hi> but those imbred <hi>Fundamental Notices,</hi> that God hath implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our Souls; such as arise not from external Objects, nor particular Humours or Imaginations, but are immediately lodged in our Minds; independent upon other Principles or Deductions; commanding a sudden assent; and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all sober Mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53288:98"/>
Of this sort are these,</p>
               <p>That God is a Being of all Perfection.</p>
               <p>That nothing hath no Attributes.</p>
               <p>That a Thing cannot be, and not be.</p>
               <p>That the Whole is greater than any of its Parts.</p>
               <p>These, and such-like, are unto <hi>Vs,</hi> what Instincts are to other Creatures. And these I call the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Conclusions</hi> are those other Notices that are inferred <hi>rightly from</hi> these; and <hi>by their</hi> help, from the Observations of <hi>Sense;</hi> And the <hi>remotest</hi> of them that can be conceived, if it be <hi>duly inferred</hi> from the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> or rightly circumstantiated <hi>Sense,</hi> is as well to be reckoned a Part and Branch of Reason, as the more <hi>immediate</hi> Conclusions, that are Principles in respect of those distant Truths. And thus I have given an account also of the proper Notion, and <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> AM to shew next, (2.) <hi>That Religion is reasonable;</hi> and this implies two things, <hi>viz. That Reason is a Friend to Religion;</hi> and that <hi>Religion is so to Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I begin with the FIRST: and here I might easily shew the great congruity that there is between that Light, and those Laws, that God hath placed in our Souls; and the <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> that by the expressness of his written Word he requires from us; and demonstrate that Reason teacheth All those, excepting only the two Positives, <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Holy Eucharist.</hi> But there is not so much need of turning my Discourse that way; and therefore I shall confine it to the <hi>Principles</hi> of Religion, which are called <hi>Faith,</hi> and prove that Reason exceedingly befriends these.</p>
               <p>It doth this (I.) By <hi>proving some of those Principles;</hi> And (II.) By <hi>defending all.</hi> For the clearing both, let us consider, That the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> are of two sorts.</p>
               <p>Either (1.) Such as are <hi>presupposed</hi> to Faith; or such as (2.) are <hi>formal Articles</hi> of it. Of the first are; The <hi>Being of a God;</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> And of the second, <hi>such</hi> as are <hi>expresly declared</hi> by <hi>Divine Testimony;</hi> as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53288:98"/>
the <hi>Attributes</hi> of God; the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of his <hi>Son,</hi> and such like.</p>
               <p n="1">(I.) For the former, they are proved by Reason; and by Reason <hi>only.</hi> The others we shall consider after.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> the Foundation of all, is <hi>proved</hi> by <hi>Reason,</hi> the Apostle acknowledgeth, when he saith, That what was <hi>to be known of God, was manifest;</hi> and to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> Rom. 1. 19. and he adds, <hi>vers.</hi> 20. That <hi>the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Things from the Creation of the World, are clearly seen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing understood by the Things that are made.</hi> And the Royal Psalmist speaks to the like purpose, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. <hi>The Heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Glory of God, and the Firmament sheweth his handy-Works.</hi> And again, <hi>Psal.</hi> 148. 3. <hi>Praise him Sun and Moon, praise him ye Stars and Light;</hi> which intimates, that these Works of his afford Matter to our Reasons for Religious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments. And Reason proves the Existence of God, srom the <hi>beauty,</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>ends,</hi> and <hi>usefulness</hi> of the Creatures; for <hi>these</hi> are demonstrative Arguments of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>omnipotent</hi> Mind, that hath framed all things so <hi>regularly</hi> and <hi>exactly;</hi> and <hi>that Mind</hi> is <hi>God.</hi> This Article then, Reason proves, which was the first Branch of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and I add, that it is Reason <hi>only</hi> that can do it; which was the other. For there are but three things from whence the Existence of any Being can be concluded, <hi>viz. Sense, Revelation,</hi> or <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sense</hi> hath no more to do here, but to present Matter for our Reasons to work on; and <hi>Revelation supposeth</hi> the Being of a God, and cannot prove it; for we can have no security that the Revelation is true, till we are assured it is from God, or from some commissioned by him. The <hi>knowledge</hi> of his Being therefore, must <hi>precede</hi> our Faith in Revelation; and so cannot be deduced from it. So that <hi>only</hi> Reason is left to assure us here. And thus Reason lays the very Corner Stone of Religion.</p>
               <p>The next to this, is the other Principle mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of <hi>Scripture:</hi> This also is to be <hi>proved</hi> by Reason, and <hi>only</hi> by it. The great Argument for the truth of Scripture, is the Testimony of the Spirit in the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by Christ and his Apostles: Our Saviour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53288:99"/>
himself useth this Argument to gain credit to his Doctrines, <hi>Believe me for the Work's sake; The Works that I do bear testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of me; and if I had not done among them the Works that no other Man did, they had had no sin,</hi> John 15. 24. And the Apostles continually urge that great Miracle, the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ from the dead, for the conviction both of the Jews and Gentiles, That he was the Son of God, and his Doctrines <hi>true.</hi> Now Miracles are an Argument to our <hi>Reasons,</hi> and we reason from them thus: Miracles are God's Seal, and they are wrought by his Power, and he is true and good, and would not lend these to Impostors to cheat and abuse Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: Therefore whoever works real Miracles for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of any Doctrine, it is to be believed, that he is taught of God, and commissioned to teach us: And that Christ and his Apostles did those things which are recorded of them, is Matter of <hi>Testimony;</hi> and Reason clears the validity of <hi>this,</hi> by the aggregation of multitudes of Circumstances, which shew, That the first Relators <hi>could not</hi> be <hi>deceived themselves,</hi> and <hi>would not deceive us;</hi> nor indeed <hi>could</hi> in the main Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if they had designed it. And the certainty of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of those things to us is evinced also by numerous convictive Reasons: So that the matter of Fact is secure; and that such Doctrines were taught, as are ascribed to those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons; and those Persons inspired that penned them, are proved the same way: And so it follows from the whole, that the Gospel is the Word of God; and the Old Testament is confirmed by <hi>that.</hi> Thus Reason proves the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture; and those other Arguments that use to be produced for it, from its <hi>Stile,</hi> and its <hi>influence</hi> upon the Souls of Men; from the <hi>excellency</hi> of its Design, and the <hi>Providence of God</hi> in preserving it; are of the same sort, though not of the same strength. Reason then proves the Scriptures, and <hi>this only;</hi> for that they are from God, is not known <hi>immediately</hi> by <hi>Sense;</hi> and there is no distinct <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that is certain and infallible to assure us of it; and so <hi>Reason only</hi> remains to demonstrate the Article.</p>
               <p>These two great Truths, <hi>The Existence of God,</hi> and <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture,</hi> are the first in our Religion; and they are <hi>Conclusions</hi> of Reason, as well as <hi>Foundations</hi> of Faith. And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53288:99"/>
thus briefly of those Principles of Religion that are <hi>presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> unto it; we have seen how Reason serves for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of them.</p>
               <p n="2">(II.) I COME now to the <hi>other</hi> sort of <hi>Principles, viz.</hi> those that are <hi>formally so;</hi> They are of two sorts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t and pure: The <hi>mixt</hi> are those that are discovered by Reason, and declared by Revelation also; and so are Principles both of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Faith: Of this kind are the <hi>Attributes</hi> of God; <hi>Moral good,</hi> and <hi>evil;</hi> and the <hi>immortality</hi> of Humane <hi>Souls.</hi> The Principles of <hi>pure Faith,</hi> are such, as are known <hi>only</hi> by Divine Testimony, as the <hi>Miraculous Conception,</hi> the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> sort <hi>Reason proves,</hi> as well as Scripture; this I shew briefly in the Instances mention'd.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That the <hi>Divine Attributes</hi> are revealed in the Holy Oracles, is very clear; and as plain it is that they are deduced from Reason; For 'tis a general Principle through the World, <hi>That God is a Being absolutely perfect;</hi> And hence Reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the <hi>particular</hi> Attributes of his Nature; since <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodness, Power,</hi> and the rest, are <hi>Perfections,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply nothing of imperfection or defect; and therefore ought to be ascribed to the infinitely perfect Being.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That there is <hi>moral Good,</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> is discoverable by Reason, as well as Scripture. For these are Reason's Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims; <hi>That every Thing is made for an end;</hi> and <hi>every Thing is directed to its end by certain Rules: These Rules,</hi> in Creatures of understanding and choice, <hi>are Laws;</hi> and the transgressing <hi>these,</hi> is <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The <hi>Immortality</hi> of our Souls is plain in Scripture; and <hi>Reason</hi> proves it, by shewing the <hi>spirituality</hi> of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and <hi>that</hi> it doth, from the nature of <hi>Sense;</hi> and our <hi>perception</hi> of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Beings; of <hi>Vniversals,</hi> and of <hi>Logical, Metaphysical,</hi> and <hi>Mathematical</hi> Notions; From our <hi>compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> Propositions, and drawing Conclusions from them; From the <hi>vastness</hi> and <hi>quickness</hi> of our <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of our <hi>Wills;</hi> all which are beyond the Powers of <hi>Matter,</hi> and therefore argue a <hi>Being</hi> that is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53288:100"/>
                  <hi>immortal;</hi> which Inference, the Philosophy of Spirits proves.</p>
               <p>Also, the <hi>Moral</hi> Arguments of Reason from the <hi>goodness</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Justice</hi> in distributing Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the nature of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and tendencies of Religious <hi>Appetites,</hi> conclude, I think, very hopefully, That there is a <hi>Life</hi> after <hi>this.</hi> Thus in short of the Principles I called <hi>mixt,</hi> which Reason demonstrates.</p>
               <p>BUT for the others, <hi>viz.</hi> (2.) Those of pure <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Reason cannot prove them <hi>immediately;</hi> nor is it to be expected that it should: For they are <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Testimony;</hi> and we are no more to look for <hi>immediate</hi> proof from Reason of those things, than we are to expect, that abstracted Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should demonstrate, That there is such a place as <hi>China;</hi> or, that there was such a Man as <hi>Julius Caesar:</hi> All that it can do here, is to assert and make good the credibility, and truth of the Testimonies that relate such Matters: and <hi>that</hi> it doth in the present case, proving the Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and thereby, in a <hi>remoter</hi> way, it demonstrates all the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which the Divine Oracles <hi>immediately</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. And it is no more disparagement to our Reasons, that they cannot evince those Sacred Articles by their own unaided force, than it is a disgrace unto them, that they cannot know that there are such things as Colours, without the help of our Eyes; or that there are Sounds, without the faculty of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And if Reason must be called blind upon this account, because it cannot know of it self such things as belong to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to discover; the best Eyes in the World may be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, because they cannot see Sounds; and the best Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late dull and dead, because it cannot taste the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Beams.</p>
               <p>But though I have said, That <hi>Reason</hi> cannot of it self <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> prove the Truths of <hi>pure</hi> Revelation; Yet (1.) it demonstrates the <hi>Divine</hi> Authority of the <hi>Testimony</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares them; and <hi>that</hi> way proves even <hi>these</hi> Articles. If this be not enough,</p>
               <p>I add thesecond Assertion, (2.) That <hi>Reason defends all</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53288:100"/>
                  <hi>the Mysteries of Faith and Religion:</hi> And for this, I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it be noted, That there are two ways whereby any thing may be <hi>defended, viz.</hi> Either (1.) by shewing the <hi>manner</hi> how the thing is; Or, if that cannot be done, by shewing (2.) That it <hi>ought</hi> to be <hi>believed,</hi> though the <hi>manner</hi> of it be not <hi>known:</hi> For instance, if any one denies, That all sorts of Creatures were in the <hi>Ark,</hi> under pretence, that it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they should be contained within such a space; He that can shew <hi>how</hi> this might be, by a distinct enumeration of the kinds of Animals, with due allowance for the unknown Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and a computation of the particular capacity of the Ark; he defends the Sacred History the first way: But if another denies the <hi>conversion</hi> of <hi>Aaron's Rod</hi> into a Serpent, upon the same account, of the <hi>unconceivableness</hi> of the <hi>manner</hi> how it was done; this cannot indeed be defended the former way: But then it <hi>may,</hi> by representing that the Power of God is infinite; and can easily do what we cannot comprehend: and that we ought to believe upon the credit of the <hi>Testimony,</hi> (that being well proved to us) though the <hi>manner</hi> of this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous performance, and such others as it relates, be <hi>unknown.</hi> And as it is in this last case, so it is in all the Mysteries of Faith and Religion; Reason cannot defend them indeed the <hi>first</hi> way: But it doth the <hi>second,</hi> by shewing, That the Divine Nature is infinite, and our Conceptions very shallow and finite; that 'tis therefore very unreasonable in us to indeavour to pry into the Secrets of his Being, and Actions; and to think that we can measure and comprehend them: That we know not the Essence and Ways of acting of the most ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and obvious Things of Nature, and therefore must not expect throughly to understand the deeper Things of God, That God hath <hi>revealed</hi> those Holy Mysteries unto us; and that 'tis the highest <hi>reason</hi> in the World to believe, That <hi>what be saith is true, though we do not know how these things are.</hi> These are all Considerations of Reason, and by the proposal of them, it sufficiently defends all the Mysteries that can be proved to be contained in the Sacred Volume, and shews that they ought to be received by us, though they cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53288:101"/>
Thus if any one should ask me, How the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>Humane?</hi> and declare himself unwilling to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Article till he could be satisfied, <hi>how;</hi> My answer would be in short, That I <hi>cannot tell;</hi> and yet I believe it <hi>is so;</hi> and he ought to believe the <hi>same,</hi> upon the credit of the Testimony, though we are both <hi>ignorant</hi> of the <hi>Manner.</hi> In order to which I would suggest, that we believe innumerable things upon the <hi>evidence</hi> of our <hi>Senses,</hi> whose Nature and Properties we do not know: How the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Matter cohere;</hi> and how the <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>Body,</hi> are Questions we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not answer; and yet that <hi>such</hi> things <hi>are,</hi> we do not doubt: And why, saith <hi>Reason,</hi> should we not believe God's <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of things we <hi>cannot comprehend;</hi> as well as we do our <hi>Senses</hi> about Matters as little understood by us? 'Tis no doubt reasonable that we should, and by proving <hi>it is so,</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>defends</hi> all the Propositions of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> And when some of these are said to be <hi>above</hi> Reason, no more is meant, Than that Reason cannot conceive <hi>how</hi> those things are; and in <hi>that</hi> sense many of the Affairs of <hi>Nature</hi> are above it too.</p>
               <p>Thus I have shewn how serviceable Reason is to Religion. I am next to prove,</p>
               <p>That (II.) <hi>Religion befriends</hi> it: And here I offer some Testimonies from the Holy Oracles to make that good; and in them we shall see, how <hi>God</hi> himself, and <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> do own and acknowledge <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I consider (1.) that <hi>God,</hi> Isa. 1. 18. calls the rebellious <hi>Israelites</hi> to <hi>reason</hi> with him; <hi>Come now, and let us reason toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, saith the Lord;</hi> and by Reason he convinceth the People of the vanity of Idols, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.9. And he expostulates with their <hi>Reasons,</hi> Ezek. 18. 31. <hi>Why will ye die, O ye House of Israel?</hi> And <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>O my People, what have I done unto thee? And wherein have I wearied thee? Testifie against me.</hi> He appeals unto their <hi>Reasons,</hi> to judge of his proceedings. Isa. 5. 3. <hi>And now, O inhabitants of</hi> Jerusalem, and <hi>Men of</hi> Judah, <hi>judge I pray you between me and my vineyard; are not my ways equal?</hi> and <hi>are not your ways unequal?</hi> In this he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53288:101"/>
intimates the competency of their Reasons, to judge of the <hi>equity</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Ways, and the <hi>iniquity</hi> of <hi>their own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And (2.) <hi>our Saviour</hi> commands the Disciples of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, to <hi>give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's,</hi> and <hi>to God the things that are God's;</hi> implying the ability of their Reasons to distinguish between the things that belonged to <hi>God,</hi> and those that appertained to <hi>Caesar.</hi> And he in divers places ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues from the Principles and Topicks of Reason: From that which we call, <hi>à majori ad minus,</hi> from the <hi>greater</hi> to the <hi>less, John</hi> 13. 14. He shews it to be the duty of his Disciples, to serve their Brethren in the meanest Offices, and to wash one another's feet, because he had washed theirs, <hi>Vers.</hi> 14. infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it by this consideration of Reason; <hi>For the Servant is not greater than his Lord,</hi> Vers. 26. and useth the same, <hi>John</hi> 15. 20. to shew, that they must expect Persecution, because <hi>He,</hi> their Lord, was persecuted. And <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 23. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to take them off from carking care and sollicitude about Meat and Raiment, by this consideration from Reason, That the <hi>Life is more than Meat, and the Body than Raiment,</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that God having given them the <hi>greater,</hi> there was no doubt but he would bestow the <hi>less,</hi> which was necessary for the preservation of it. To these Instances, I add some few from the Topick, <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> from the <hi>less</hi> to the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in the arguings of our Saviour. Thus <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 11. <hi>If ye being evil know how to give good Gifts to your Children, how much more shall your Father which is in Heaven give good Things to those that ask him?</hi> The ground of the Consequence is this Principle of Reason, <hi>That God is more benign and gracious, than the tenderest and most affectionate of our earthly Parents.</hi> So <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 24. He argues, that God will provide for <hi>Vs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he doth for the <hi>Ravens,</hi> since we are <hi>better</hi> than <hi>they; How much more are ye better than the Fowls?</hi> Which arguing supposeth this Principle of Reason, that that Wisdom &amp; Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which are indulgent to the <hi>viler</hi> Creatures, will not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the more <hi>excellent.</hi> He proceeds further in the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, by the consideration of God's clothing the Lillies, and makes the like inference from it, <hi>Vers.</hi> 28. <hi>If God so clothe the Grass, how much more will be clothe you?</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. He reasons that it was lawful for him to heal on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith-day,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53288:102"/>
                  <hi>from the consideration of the general Mercy that is due even to brute Creatures;</hi> What Man shall there be among you that shall have one Sheep, and if it fall into a Pit on the Sabbath day, will he not lay hold of it to lift it out? How much more then is a Man better than a Sheep? <hi>Vers. 12. Thus our Saviour used Arguments of Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And (3.) the <hi>Apostles</hi> did so very frequently. S. <hi>Paul</hi> disproves <hi>Idolatry</hi> this way, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 29. <hi>Forasmuch then as we are the Off-spring of God, we ought not to think that the God head is like unto Gold, or Silver, or Stone graven by Art.</hi> And the same Apostle proves the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the Dead by the mention of seven gross Absurdities that would follow the denyal of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 15. viz. <hi>If the Dead rise not,</hi> Then 1. <hi>Christ is not risen;</hi> And then 2. <hi>our Preaching is vain,</hi> and we <hi>false Apostles,</hi> And if so, 3. <hi>your Faith is vain;</hi> And then 4. you are not <hi>justified,</hi> but are in <hi>your sins;</hi> And hence it will follow 5. That those that are departed in the same Faith are <hi>perished;</hi> And then 6. Faith in Christ prosits <hi>only in this Life;</hi> And if so, 7. we <hi>are of all Men the most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Because we suffer all things for this Faith; From <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to <hi>ver.</hi> 19. And the whole Chapter contains <hi>Philosophical Reasoning,</hi> either to prove or illustrate the Resurrection; or to shew the difference of glorified Bodies from these. And S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in his second <hi>Epistle,</hi> Chap. 2. shews, that sinful Men must expect to be punished, because God <hi>spared not the Angels that fell.</hi> Instances of this would be endless; these may suffice. And thus of the Second thing also, which I proposed to make good, <hi>viz. That Religion is friendly to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> and that appears, in that God himself, our Saviour, and his Apostles own it; and use Arguments from it, even in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Faith and Religion.</p>
               <p>BUt divers <hi>Objections</hi> are urged against the use of Reason in Religion, from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and other <hi>Considerations:</hi> The chief of them I shall consider briefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From</hi> Scripture <hi>'tis alledged, (1.) That God will</hi> destroy <hi>the</hi> Wisdom of the Wise, <hi>1 Cor. 1. 19. And</hi> the World by Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom knew not God, <hi>vers. 21. And</hi> not many wise Men after the flesh are called, <hi>vers. 26. And God</hi> chose the foolish things of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53288:102"/>
                  <hi>this World to confound the wise,</hi> vers. 27. By which expressions of <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>wise,</hi> 'tis presumed that <hi>Humane Reason,</hi> and <hi>Rational</hi> Men, are meant. But these Interpreters mistake the Matter much, and as they are wont to do, put mere <hi>Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Interpretations</hi> upon <hi>Scripture;</hi> For by <hi>Wisdom</hi> here, there is no cause to understand the <hi>Reason</hi> of Men; but rather the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Jews;</hi> the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of the Disputing <hi>Greeks;</hi> and the <hi>worldly Policy</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The <hi>Rulers</hi> of that <hi>World:</hi> That the <hi>Jewish</hi> Learning in their Law is meant, the Apostle intimates, when he asks in a way of Challenge, <hi>vers.</hi> 20. <hi>Where is the Scribe?</hi> And the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifies one that was skill'd in their Laws and Customs. And that the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> is to be understood likewise, we have ground to believe from the other Question in the same Verse; <hi>Where is the Disputer of this World?</hi> Which, though some refer to the Doctors among the <hi>Jews</hi> also, yet, I humbly think, it may more properly he understood of the Philosophers among the <hi>Grecians;</hi> For the Apostle writes to <hi>Greeks,</hi> and their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy was notoriously <hi>contentious.</hi> And lastly, That the <hi>worldly Policies</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> are included in this Wisdom of this World, which the Apostle vilifies, there is cause to think from the sixth Verse of the second Chapter, where he saith, <hi>He spake not in the Wisdom of the Princes of this World;</hi> And 'tis well known that <hi>Policy</hi> was their <hi>most valued</hi> Wisdom; <hi>Tu regere imperio</hi>—To govern the Nations, and promote the grandeur of their Empire, was the great design and study of those Princes of this World. Now all <hi>these</hi> the Apostle sets at nought in the beginning of this Epistle; Because they were very opposite to the simplicity, and holiness, self-denial, and meekness of the Gospel. But that is this to the disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Reason; to which those sorts of Wisdom are as contrary, as they are to Religion? And by this I am ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) To meet another Objection urged from 1 <hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53288:103"/>
and its Antipathy to them: Whereas I can apprehend <hi>no more</hi> to be meant by the words, than <hi>this, viz.</hi> That <hi>such</hi> kind of <hi>natural</hi> Men as those <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Disputers,</hi> and <hi>Politioians,</hi> having their Minds depraved; and prepossessed with their <hi>own</hi> Wisdom, were indisposed to receive <hi>this,</hi> that was so <hi>contrary</hi> unto it. And they could not know those things of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and so would require a Mind that was of a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> frame, <hi>viz.</hi> free from that earthly Wisdom of all sorts, which counts those things <hi>foolishness;</hi> and which by God is counted so it self; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 19. which place</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Is used as another Scripture against Reason. <hi>The Wisdom of this World is foolishness with God:</hi> But it can signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing to that purpose, to one that understands and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Apostle's meaning. What is meant by the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of this <hi>World</hi> here, I have declared already; And by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of my Discourse it appears, that whatever is to be understood by it, our Reason cannot; since that either <hi>proves,</hi> or <hi>defends</hi> all the Articles of Religion.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) And when the same Apostle elsewhere, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. saith, That <hi>they had not their Conversation in fleshly Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> we cannot think he meant Humane Reason by that; for Reason directs us to live in simplicity, and godly sincerity, which he opposeth to a life in fleshly Wisdom. By this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no doubt; he means the <hi>Reason</hi> of our <hi>Appetites,</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> which is but <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Imagination,</hi> (for these blind Guides are the Directors of the Wicked) but not the <hi>Reason</hi> of our <hi>Minds,</hi> which is one of those Lights that illuminate the Consciences of good Men, and help to guide their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                     </gap>;</hi> and it may be the <hi>Genealogies</hi> of which the <hi>Jews</hi> were so fond; and the <hi>disputing Philosophy</hi> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which was properly, <hi>Science falsly so called,</hi> and did minister Questions, and endless Strife; I say, 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable <hi>these</hi> might be comprehended also: But <hi>Reason</hi> is no otherwise concerned in all this, but as condemning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving these dangerous Follies.</p>
               <p>THUS we see the Pretensions from <hi>Scripture</hi> against Reason are vain. But there are <hi>other Considerations</hi> by which it useth to be impugned, as,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>(1.) OUR Reason is corrupted, and</hi> therefore is not fit to meddle in Spiritual Matters.</p>
               <p>To this I say, That Reason, as it is taken for the Faculty of Understanding, is very much weakened and impaired; It sees but little, and that very dully, <hi>through a Glass darkly,</hi> as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. And it is very liable to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sled by our Senses, and Affections, and Interests, and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; so that we many times mingle Errors, and false Conceits, with the genuine Dictates of our Minds, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to them, as the Principles of Truth and Reason, when they are but the vain Images of our Phansies, or the false Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions of Ignorance and Mistake. If this be meant by the corruption of Reason, I grant it; and all that can be inferred from it will be; <hi>That we ought not to be too bold and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in defining speculative, and difficult matters; especially not those that relate to Religion, nor to set our Reasonings against the Doctrines of Faith and Revelation.</hi> But this is nothing to the disreputation of Reason in the Object, <hi>viz.</hi> Those Principles of Truth which are written upon our Souls; or any Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that are deduced from them: These are the same that they ever were, though we discern them not so clearly as the Innocent State did: They may be mistaken, but cannot be corrupted. And as our Understandings, by reason of their weakness, and liableness to Error, may take falshoods for some of those; or infer falsly from those that are truly such;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53288:104"/>
so we know, they do the same by the Scriptures themselves, <hi>viz.</hi> they very often mis-interpret, and very often draw per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse conclusions from them; And yet we say not, That the Word of God is corrupted, nor is the use of Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed because of those abuses. But here advantage will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to object again,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>(2.)</hi> That since our natural Vnderstandings are so weak, and so liable to mistake, they ought not to be used in the Affairs of Religion; and 'twill signifie little to us that there are certain Principles of eternal Reason, if we either perceive them not, or cannot use them.</p>
               <p>To this I Answer, That if on this account we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the use of our natural Understandings, Scripture will be useless to us also; For how can we know the meaning of the words that express God's Mind unto us? How can we compare one Scripture with another? How can we draw any Consequence from it? How apply general Propositions to our own <hi>particular</hi> Cases? How tell what is to be taken in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; what in the Mystery, what plainly; whatin a Figure? What according to strict and rigorous Truth? What by way of accommodation to our Apprehensions? I say, without the exrcise of our Understandings, using the Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, none of these can be done, and without them Scripture will signifie either nothing at all, or very little to us. And what can Religion get this way? This Inference therefore is absurd and impious. All that can justly be concluded from the weakness of our Understandings, will be what I intimated before, that we ought to use them with modesty and caution; not that we should renounce them. He is a Mad-man, who, because his eyes are dim, will therefore put them out.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected further,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>(3.)</hi> That which Men call Reason is infinitely various, and that is reasonable to one, which is very irrational to another; Therefore Reason is not to be heard. <hi>And, I say, Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture are infinitely various, and one calls that Scriptural, which another calls Heretical; Shall we conclude</hi>

therefore, That <hi>Scripture is not to be heard?</hi> Reason in it self is the fame all the World over, though Mens apprehensions of it are various, as the Light of the Sun is one, though Colours are infinite: And where this is, it ought not to be denied, because follies and falshoods pretend relation to it; or call themselves by that name.

                  <hi>But (4.)</hi> 'Tis Socinianism to plead for Reason in the Affairs of Faith and Religion.</p>
               <p>And I Answer, 'Tis gross Phanaticism to plead against it. This Name is properly applicable to the Enemies of Reason; But the other of <hi>Socinianism</hi> is groundlesly applyed to those that undertake for it; and it absurdly supposeth that <hi>Socinians</hi> are the only rational Men; when-as divers of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, such as, The <hi>Sleep,</hi> and <hi>natural mortality of the Soul,</hi> and <hi>utter ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ed in their other Opinions, without using Reason to maintain the Sense and Interpretation of those Scriptures that are alledged against them. 'Tis an easie thing, we know, to give an ugly Name to any thing we dislike; and by this way the most excellent and sacred Things have been made contemptible and vile. I wish such hasty Censurers would consider before they call Names; <hi>That no Truth is the worse, because rash Ignorance hath thrown dirt upon it.</hi> I need say no more to these frivolous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. Those that alledge <hi>Atheism,</hi> and tendency to Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity against the reverence and use of Reason, are disproved by my whole Discourse: Which shews that the Enemies of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son most usually serve the ends of the <hi>Infidel,</hi> and the <hi>Atheist;</hi> when as a due use of it destroys the Pretensions of both.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:53288:105"/>
               <p>NOw from the foregoing brief Discourse I shall deduce some <hi>Corollaries,</hi> that may be of use for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the whole Matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reason is certain and infallible;</hi> This follows from the state I gave of the Nature and Notion of Reason in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It consists in First Principles, and the Conclusions that are raised from them, and the Observations of Sense. Now first Principles are certain, or nothing can be so; for every possible Conclusion must be drawn from those, or by their help; and every Article of Faith supposeth them: And for the Propositions that arise from those certain Principles, they are certain likewise; For nothing can follow from Truth, but Truth in the longest Series of Deduction. If Error creep in, there is ill consequence in the case. And the sort of Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that arise from the Observations of Sense, if the Sense be rightly circumstantiated, and the Inference rightly made, are certain also. For if our Senses in all their due Circumstances deceive us, All is a delusion, and we are sure of nothing: But we know, that first Principles are certain, and that our Senses do not deceive us, because God, that bestowed them upon us, is True and Good; and we are as much assured, that whatever we duly conclude from either of them, is certain; because whatever is drawn from any Principle, was virtually contained in it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) I infer, <hi>That Reason is,</hi> in a sense, <hi>the Word of God, viz.</hi> That which he hath written upon our Minds and Hearts; as Scripture is that which is written in a Book. The former is the Word, whereby he hath spoken to all Mankind; the latter is that whereby he hath declared his Will to the Church, and his peculiar People. Reason is that <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> of which <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 27. <hi>That Light,</hi> whereby <hi>Christ hath enlightned every one that cometh into the World,</hi> John 1. 9. And, <hi>that Law whereby the Consciences of the Heathen either accuse, or excuse one another,</hi> Rom. 2. 15.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53288:105"/>
So that <hi>Hierocles</hi> spoke well, when he said, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>To be perswaded by God and right Reason, is one and the same thing.</hi> And <hi>Luther</hi> called <hi>Philosophy,</hi> within its own bounds, <hi>The Truth of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>The belief of our Reason is an Exercise of Faith; and Faith is an Act of Reason.</hi> The former part is clear, from the last Particular, and we believe our Reasons, because we have them from God, who cannot mistake, and will not deceive. So that relying on them, in things clearly perceived, is trust in God's veracity and goodness, and that is an exercise of Faith. Thus <hi>Luke</hi> 12. The not belief of Reason, that sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests from <hi>God's clothing the Lillies,</hi> that He will provide for us, is made by our Saviour a defect of Faith, <hi>Vers.</hi> 28. <hi>O ye of little Faith!</hi> And for the other part, that Faith is an Act of Reason, that is evident also: For, <hi>'Tis the highest Reason to believe in God revealing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>No Principle of Reason contradicts any Articles of Faith.</hi> This follows upon the whole. <hi>Faith befriends Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> and <hi>Reason serves Religion,</hi> and therefore they cannot clash. They are both certain, both the Truths of God; and one Truth doth not interfere with another, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, saith <hi>Aristotle, Truth agrees with all things that are.</hi> Whatsoever contradicts Faith, is opposite to Reason; for 'tis a Fundamental Principle of that, That <hi>God is to be believed.</hi> Indeed sometimes there is a seeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction between them; But then either something is taken for Faith, that is but Phansie; or something for Reason, that is but Sophistry; or the supposed contradiction is an Error and Mistake.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) <hi>When any thing is pretended from Reason, against any Article of Faith, we ought not to cut the Knot, by denying Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but endeavour to unite it, by answering the Argument; and 'tis certain it may be fairly answered.</hi> For all Hereticks argue either from false Principles, or fallaciously conclude from true ones: So that our Faith is to be defended, not by declaiming against Reason, in such a case, (which strengthens the Enemy,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53288:106"/>
and, to the great prejudice of Religion, allows Reason on his side); But we must endeavour to defend it, either by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the falshood of the Principles he useth in the name of Reason; or the ill Consequence, which he calls Proof.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) <hi>When any thing is offered us for an Article of Faith that seems to contradict Reason, we ought to see that there be good cause to believe that this is divinely revealed, and in the sense propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> If it be, we may be assured from the former Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risms, that the Contradiction is but an Appearance; and it may be discovered to be so. But if the Contradiction be real, This can be no Article of Revelation, or the Revelation hath not this sense. For God cannot be the Author of Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and we have seen, that Reason, as well as Faith, is his. I mean, the <hi>Principles of Natural Truth,</hi> as well as those of Revelation. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, faith <hi>Aristotle, Truth is throughout contrary to falshood;</hi> and what is true in Divinity, cannot be false in Reason. 'Tis said in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> If two <hi>Rabbins</hi> differ in Contradictories, yet both have their Opinions from <hi>Moses,</hi> and from <hi>God.</hi> But we are not obliged to such an irrational kind of Faith; And ought not to receive any thing as an Article of it, in a sense that palpably contradicts Reason, no more than we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any sense that contradicts the direct Scriptures. Faith and Reason accord, as well as the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and the <hi>New;</hi> and the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Reason is to be heeded also, because even that is Divine and Sacred.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) <hi>There is nothing that God hath revealed to oblige our Faith, but he hath given us reason to believe that he hath revealed it.</hi> For though the thing be never so clearly told me, if I have not reason to think, that God is the Revealer of what is so declared, I am not bound to believe it; except there be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the thing it self. For 'tis not Faith, but vain creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to believe every thing that pretends to be from God. So that we ought to ask our selves a Reason, why we believe the Scripture to be the Revelation of God's Will, and ought not to assent to any sense put upon it, till we have ground to think, that that sense is his mind? I say, we must have ground,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53288:106"/>
either from our particular Reasons, or the Authority of the Church; otherwise our Faith is vain Credulity, and not Faith in God.</p>
               <p n="8">(8.) <hi>A Man may hold an erroneous Opinion from a mistaken sense of Scripture, and deny what is the truth of the Proposition, and what is the right meaning of the Text, and yet not err in Faith.</hi> For Faith is a belief of God revealing: And if God have not so revealed this, or that, as to give us certain ground to believe this to be his sense, he hath not sufficiently revealed it to oblige our Faith. So that though I deny such, or such a sense, while I believe it is not from God; his veracity and Authority is not concerned, since I am ready however to give a chearful assent to what-ever is clearly and sufficiently revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. This Proposition follows from the former, and must be understood only of those Doctrines that are difficult, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely delivered: And that many things are so delivered in Scripture, is certain; For some are only hinted, and spoken occasionally; some figuratively, and by way of Parable, and Allegory; some according to Mens Conceptions; and some in Ambiguous and Aenigmatical Phrases; which Obscurities may occasion mistake in those, who are very ready to believe what-ever God saith; and when they do, I should be loth to say that such err in Faith; Though those that wrest plain Texts to a compliance with their Interests, and their Lusts; Though their Affections may bring their Judgments to vote with them, yet theirs is Error in Faith with a witness, and capable of no benefit from this Proposition.</p>
               <p n="9">(9.) <hi>In searching after the sense of Scripture, we ought to consult the Principles of Reason, as we do other Scriptures.</hi> For we have shewn, That Reason is another part of God's Word. And though the Scripture be sufficient for its own end, yet Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must be presupposed unto it; for without this, Scripture cannot be used, nor compared, nor applied, nor understood.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <hi>(10.)</hi> The Essentials of Religion are so plainly revealed, that no Man can miss them, that hath not a mighty corrupt bias in his Will and Affections to infatuate and blind his Vnderstanding.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53288:107"/>
Those Essentials are contained in the <hi>Decalogue</hi> and the <hi>Creed:</hi> Many speculative remoter Doctrines may be true, but not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental. For 'tis not agreeable to the goodness or justice of God, that Mens eternal Interests should depend upon things that are difficult to be understood, and easily mistaken. If they did, No Man could be secure, but that, do what he could, he should perish everlastingly, for not believing, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving amiss some of those difficult Points, that are supposed necessary to Salvation; and all those that are ignorant, and of weak understanding, must perish without help, or they must be saved by implicit Faith in unknown Fundamentals.</p>
               <p>THESE are some Propositions that follow from my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and from one another. The better they are consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more their force will be perceived; and I think they may serve for many very considerable purposes of Religion. Charity, and the peace of Mankind.</p>
               <p>ANd now, as a Conclusion to the whole, I shall add some Considerations of the dangerous tendency of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice (at least among the Sects) of declaiming against Reason as an Enemy to Religion.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>It tends to the introduction of</hi> Atheism, Infidelity, <hi>and</hi> Scepticism; <hi>and hath already brought in a flood of these upon us.</hi> For what advantage can the Atheist and Infidel expect greater than this, That Reason is against Religion? What do they pretend? What can they propose more? If so, there will be no proving, That there is a God; or, That the Scripture is his Word; and then we believe <hi>gratis;</hi> and our Faith hangs upon Humour and Imagination; and that Religion that depends upon a warm Phansie, and an ungrounded belief, stands but till a Disease, or a new Conceit alter the Scene of Imagination, and then down falls the Castle, whose Foundation was in the Air. 'Twas the charge of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate against the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>That their Wisdom was to believe;</hi> as if they had <hi>no ground</hi> for their Faith. And those that renounce and decry Reason, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie <hi>Julian</hi> in his Charge. If this be so, Religion will have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53288:107"/>
no bottom, but the Phansie of every one that professeth it; and how various and inconstant a thing Imagination is, every Man knows. These are the Consequences of defamations of Reason, on the pretended account of Religion; and we have seen, in multitudes of deplorable Instances, That they follow in practice, as well as reasoning. Men of corrupt inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons suspect that there is no Reason for our Faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so are upon the borders of quitting it; And the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast,</hi> that pretends to know Religion best, tells them, that these Suspicions are very true; and thence the <hi>Debauchee</hi> glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes the desperate Conclusion: Or at least; when they hear that Reason is uncertain, various, and fallacious, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all credit to their Faculties, and become confounded <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> that settle in nothing. This I take to have been one of the greatest and most deadly occasions of the Atheism of our days; and he that hath rejected Reason, may be one when he pleaseth, and cannot reprehend, or reduce any one, that is so already.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>The denial of Reason in Religion, hath been the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Engine that Hereticks and Enthusiasts have used against the Faith; and that which lays us open to infinite follies and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures.</hi> Thus the <hi>Arrians</hi> quarrelled with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because it was deduced by consequence, but not expressed in Scripture. The <hi>Apollinarists</hi> would by no means allow of Reason; And St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> that they did <hi>calumniate,</hi> and decry <hi>It,</hi> to <hi>raise prejudice against the Catholick Faith;</hi> and elsewhere, <hi>Doctores vestri Hominem dialecticum fugiendum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, &amp; cavendum, quàm refellendum censuerunt.</hi> The <hi>Vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitarians</hi> defend their Errors, by denying the judgment of Reason; and the <hi>Macedonians</hi> would not have the Deity of the Holy Ghost proved by Consequence. The later <hi>Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asts</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other places, set up loud and vehement out-cries against Reason; and the <hi>Lunaticks</hi> among us (that agree in nothing else) do yet sweetly accord in opposing this Carnal Reason; and this indeed is their common Interest. The impostures of Mens Phansies must not be seen in too much light; and we cannot dream with our eyes open. Reason would discover the nakedness of Sacred Whimsies, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mysterious Non-sense; This would disparage the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53288:108"/>
Darlings of the Brain, and cool the pleasant heats of kindled Imagination: And therefore Reason must be decryed, because an enemy to madness; and Phansie set up, under the Notion of Faith and Inspiration. Hence Men had got the trick to call every thing that was Consequent, and Reasonable, Vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy; and every thing that was Sober, Carnal Reasoning. Religion is set so far above Reason, that at length it is put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sobriety and Sense; and then 'twas fit to be believed, when 'twas impossible to be proved, or understood. The way to be a Christian, is first to be a Brute; and to be a true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in this Divinity, is to be fit for Bedlam. Men have been taught to put out their eyes, that they might see; and to hoodwink themselves, that they might avoid the Precipices. Thus have all Extravagancies been brought into Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Imaginations of a Fever, and the Conceits of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night: Whatever is phansied, is certain; and whatever is vehement, is Sacred; every thing must be believed, that is dream'd; and every thing that is absurd, is a Mystery. And by this way, Men in our days have been prepared to swallow every thing, every thing but what is sober: whatever is wild, will be suck'd in like the Air; but what is reasonable, will be fled like Infection. So that if a Man would recommend any Doctrine for his life, to those Enemies of Reason, it must be some odd non-sense, in the clothing of Imagination; and he that can be the Author of a new kind of Madness, shall lead a Party. Thus hath Religion, by the disparagement of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, been made a Medley of Phantastick Trash, spiritualized into an heap of Vapours, and formed into a Castle of Clouds; and exposed to every Wind of Humour and Imagination.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>By the same way great advantage is given to the Church of Rome:</hi> Which is well known by those that adhere unto it. And therefore <hi>Perronius, Gonterius, Arnoldus, Veronius,</hi> and other Jesuites, have loudly declaimed against Reason; and the last mentioned, <hi>Veronius,</hi> presented the World with a Method to overthrow <hi>Hereticks,</hi> (meaning those of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Faith) which promised more than ordinary; And that was, to deny and renounce all Principles of Reason in Affairs of Faith, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely and roundly; and not to vouchsafe an Answer to any Argument against <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> or the other Articles of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53288:108"/>
their new Faith; but point-blank to deny whatever Reason saith in such Matters. And he affirms, that even these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reason, <hi>viz. Non entis non sunt Attributa; omne quod est, quando est, necesse est esse;</hi> and such like, which are the Foundations of all Reasoning, are dangerous to the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> and therefore not to be heeded. This Man speaks out, and affirms directly and boldly, what the other Enemies of Reason mean, but will not own. This is a Method to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy <hi>Hereticks</hi> in earnest; but the mischief is, all Christians, and all other Religions, and all other Reasonings are cut off by the same Sword. This Book and Method of <hi>Veronius</hi> was kindly received by the <hi>Pope,</hi> priviledged by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> approved by <hi>Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops,</hi> and all the <hi>Gallick Clergy,</hi> as solid, and for the advantage of Souls; and the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone Doctors</hi> gave it their approbation, and recommended it as the only way to confute us, and all the other Adversaries of their corrupted Faith and Religion. Did these know what they did? And did they, think we, understand the Interest of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? If so, we kindly serve their ends, and promote their Designs in the way, which they account best, while we vilifie and disparage Reason. If this be renounced in Matters of Religion, with what face can we use it against the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> or any other Points of the <hi>Roman Creed?</hi> Would it not be blameless and irreprovable for us to give up our Understandings implicitly to the Dictates and Declarations of that <hi>Church?</hi> May we not follow blindly whatever the <hi>Infallible Man</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> and his <hi>Councils</hi> say? And would it not be vain self-contradiction to use Arguments against their <hi>Decrees,</hi> though they are never so unreasonable? Or to alledge Consequences from Scripture against any of their Articles, though never so contrary to the <hi>Holy Oracles?</hi> How easily may they rejoyn, when we dispute against them; You argue from Reason, and by Consequences; But Reason is dull and carnal, and an enemy to the things of the Spirit, and not to be heard in the high Matters of <hi>Religion?</hi> And what can we say next, if allow of the Accusation? I say, by this way, we perfectly disable, or grosly contradict our selves, in most of our Disputes against the <hi>Romanists:</hi> And we are very disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous in our dealings, while we use Reason against them, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53288:109"/>
deny it, when 'tis urged against our selves by another sort of Adversaries; which implies, that when we say, <hi>Reason is not to be heard,</hi> we mean, 'tis not to be <hi>heard against us;</hi> But it must against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any others we can oppugn by it. So that our denying Reason in Religion is either very humoursom and partial, or 'tis a direct yielding up our Cause to our Enemies; and doing that our selves, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing they desire, to undo us; and to promote their own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests</hi> upon our <hi>Ruines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I have represented some of the Mischiefs that arise from the disparagement of Reason; we see they are great ones, big of many others, and such as are destructive to all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all the Interests of the sober part of Mankind. This is properly <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> and all that we call so, grows upon it. Here the Enemies of our Church and Government began; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this they insisted still, and filled their Books, and Pulpits, and private Corners, with these Cantings. This was the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to overthrow all sober Principles, and Establishments; with this the People were infutuated, and credit was reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>Gibberish,</hi> and <hi>Folly; Enthusiasms,</hi> and vain <hi>Impulses.</hi> This is the Food of <hi>Conventicles</hi> to this day; the root of their Matter, and the burden of their Preachments. Let <hi>Reason</hi> be heard, and tie them to Sense, and most of their <hi>Holders-forth</hi> haue no more to say. Their spirituality, for which they are admired, is besides Reason, and against it, rather than above it; And while this Principle of the enmity between Reason and Religion stands, the People will think them the more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Preachets, because they are the less reasonable: And while they are abused by such a belief, 'twill be impossible for sober Men to have any success in their endeavours to convince them.</p>

               <p>IF any thing were to be much admired in an Age of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, not only of Nature, (which is a constant Prodigy) but of Men and Manners; it would be to me matter of astonishment, that Men, otherwise witty and ingenious, are fallen into the Conceit that there's no such thing as a <hi>Witch,</hi> or <hi>Apparition,</hi> but that these are the Creatures of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly and Superstition, foster'd by Ignorance and Design; which, comparing the confidence of their disbelief, with the evidence of the things denied, and the weakness of their Grounds, would almost suggest, that themselves are an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of what they deny; and that so confident an Opinion could not be held upon such inducements, but by some kind of Witchcraft, and Fascination in the Fancy. And perhaps that evil Spirit, whose Influences they will not allow in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ascribed to such Causes, hath a greater hand and interest in their Proposition than they are aware of. For that subtil Enemy of Mankind (since Providence will not permit him to mischief us without our own concurrence) attempts that by stratagem and artifice, which he could never effect by open ways of acting; and the success of all wiles depending upon their secrecy, and concealment, his influence is never more dangerous than when his agency is least suspected.

therefore to the carrying on the dark and hidden Designs he manageth against our Happiness, and our Souls, he cannot expect to advantage himself more, than by insinuating a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, <hi>That there is no such thing as Himself,</hi> but that Fear and Fancy make Devils now, as they did Gods of old. Nor can he ever draw the assent of Men to so dangerous an Assertion, while the standing sensible Evidences of his Existence in his practices by and upon his Instruments, are not discredited and removed.</p>
               <p>'Tis doubtless therefore the interest of this Agent of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to have the World believe, that the Notion they have of Him, is but a <hi>Phantôme</hi> and Conceit; and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, That the stories of <hi>Witches, Apparitions,</hi> and indeed every thing that brings tidings of another World, are but melancholick Dreams, and pious Romances. And when Men are arriv'd thus far, to think there are no Diabolical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts or Apparitions, their belief that there are such Spirits, rests only upon their Faith, and reverence to the Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; which we have little reason to apprehend so great in such Assertors, as to command much from their assent; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in such things in which they have corrupt Interests against their evidence. So that he that thinks there is no <hi>Witch,</hi> believes a Devil <hi>gratis,</hi> or at least upon Inducements, which he is like to find himself disposed to deny when he pleaseth. And when Men are arrived to this degree of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Infidelity, we are beholden to them if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve either Angel, or Spirit, Resurrection of the Body, or Immortality of Souls. These things hang together in a Chain of <hi>Connexion,</hi> at least in these Mens <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> and 'tis but an happy chance, if he that hath lost one Link, holds another. So that the Vitals of Religion being so much inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed in this Subject, it will not be unnecessary imployment particularly to discourse it.</p>
               <p>And in order to the proof that there have been, and are unlawful Confederacies with evil Spirits, by vertue of which the hellish Accomplices perform things above their natural Powers; I must premise, that this being matter of Fact, is only capable of the evidence of Authority and Sense: And by both these, the being of Witches and Diabolical Contracts,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53288:111"/>
is most abundantly confirm'd. All Histories are full of the Exploits of those Instruments of Darkness, and the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of all Ages, not only of the rude and barbarous, but of the most civiliz'd and polish'd World, brings tidings of their strange performances. We have the Attestation of thousands of Eye and Ear-witnesses, and those not of the easily deceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vulgar only, but of wise and grave Discerners; and that, when no Interest could oblige them to agree together in a common <hi>Lye:</hi> I say, we have the light of all these Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to confirm us in the belief of things done by Persons of despicable Power and Knowledge, beyond the reach of Art, and ordinary Nature. Standing publick Records have been kept of these well-attested Relations: and <hi>Epocha</hi>'s made of those unwonted Events; Laws in many Nations have been enacted against those vile practices; Those among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and our own, are notorious: such Cases have been often determined near us, by Wise and Reverend Judges, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clear and convictive Evidence: and multitudes in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have suffered death for their vile Compacts with Apostate Spirits. All these I might largely prove in their particular Instances, but that 'tis not needful, since those that deny the being of <hi>Witches,</hi> do it not out of ignorance of these Heads of Argument, of which probably they have heard a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times; But from an apprehension that such a belief is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, and the things impossible. And upon these presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they contemn all Demonstrations of this nature, and are ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>dned against Conviction. And I think, those that can believe all Histories are Romances, that all the wiser World have agreed together to juggle Mankind into a common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of ungrounded Fables; that the sound Senfes of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes together may deceive them; and Laws are built upon <hi>Chymera's;</hi> that the gravest and wisest Judges have been Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers; and the sagest Persons Fools, or designing Impostors: I say, those that can believe this heap of Absurdities, are either more credulous than those whose credulity they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; or else have some extraordinary evidence of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, <hi>viz. That 'tis absurd and impossible there should be a Witch or Apparition.</hi> And I am consident, were those little appearances remov'd, which Men have form'd in their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

against the belief of such things; their own Evidence would make the way to Mens assent, without any more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments than what they know already to enforce it. There is nothing then necessary to be done, in order to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the belief I would reconcile to Mens minds; but to endeavour the removal of those Prejudices they have received against it: the chief of which I shall particularly deal with. And I begin with that bold Assertion, That</p>

                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>(I.)</hi> THe NOTION of a Spirit is impossible and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and consequently so is that of Witches, the belief of which is founded on that Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>To which <hi>Objection</hi> I Answer,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) If the Notion of a Spirit be absurd, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; that of a GOD, and a SOUL distinct from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Immortal, are likewise Absurdities. And then, That the World was jumbled into this elegant and orderly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick by chance; and that our Souls are only parts of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that came together we know not whence, nor how; and shall again shortly be dissolv'd into those loose Atoms that compound them; That all our Conceptions are but the thrusting of one part of Matter against another; and the <hi>Idea's</hi> of our Minds meer blind and casual Motions: These, and a thousand more the grossest Impossibilities and Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (consequents of this Proposition, <hi>That the Notion of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is absurd</hi>) will be sad Certainties and Demonstrations. And with such Assertors I would cease to discourse about <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Apparitions,</hi> and address my self to obtain their assent to Truths infinitely more Sacred.</p>
                  <p>And yet (2.) though it should be granted them, that a Substance immaterial is as much a contradiction as they can fancy; yet why should they not believe that the Air, and all the Regions above us, may have their invisible intellectual Agents of Nature like unto our Souls, be that what it will; and some of them at least as much degenerate as the vilest and most mischievous among Men. This <hi>Hypothesis</hi> will be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53288:112"/>
enough to secure the possibility of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Apparitions.</hi> And that all the upper Stories of the Universe are furnish'd with Inhabitants, 'tis infinitely reasonable to conclude from the Analogy of Nature; Since we see there is nothing so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and vile in the World we reside in, but hath its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures that dwell upon it; the Earth, the Water, the inferiour Air; the Bodies of Animals, the Flesh, the Skin, the Entrails; the Leaves, the Roots, the Stalks of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; yea, and all kind of Minerals in the Subterrancous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions: I say, all these have their proper Inhabitants; yea, I suppose this Rule may hold in all distinct kinds of Bodies in the World, <hi>That they have their peculiar Animals.</hi> The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of which I believe the improvement of Microscopical Observations will discover. From whence I infer, That since this little Spot is so thickly peopled in every Atom of it, '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>is weakness to think that all the vast spaces above, and hollows under Ground, are desert and uninhabited. And if both the superiour and lower Continents of the Universe have their Inhabitants also, 'tis exceedingly improbable, arguing from the same Analogy, that they are all of the meer sensible Nature, but that there are at least some of the Rational and Intellectual Orders. Which supposed, there is good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the belief of Witches, and Apparitions; though the Notion of a Spirit should prove as absurd and unphiloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical, as I judg the Denial of it. And so this first Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes to nothing. I descend then to the second <hi>Prejudice,</hi> which may be thus formed in behalf of the <hi>Objectors.</hi>

                     <hi>(II.)</hi> THere are Actions in most of those Relations ascribed to Witches, which are ridiculous and impossible in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things; such are <hi>(1.)</hi> their flying out of Windows, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have anointed themselves, to remote places. <hi>(2.)</hi> Their transformation into Cats, Hares, and other Creatures. <hi>(3.)</hi> Their feeling all the hurts in their own Bodies, which they have received in those. <hi>(4.)</hi> Their raising Tempests, by mattering some nonsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal words, or performing Ceremonies alike impertinent, as ridiculous. And <hi>(5.)</hi> their being suck'd in a certain private place of their

Bodies by a Familiar. These are presumed to be actions inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the nature of Spirits, and above the powers of those poor and miserable Agents. And therefore the Objection supposeth them performed only by the Fancy; and that the whole mystery of Witchcraft is but an illusion of crasie Imagination.</p>
                  <p>To this <hi>aggregate Objection</hi> I return,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) In the general: The more absurd and unaccountable these Actions seem the greater confirmations are they to me of the truth of those Relations, and the reality of what the Objectors would destroy. For these Circumstances being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding unlikely, (judging by the measures of common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief) 'tis the greater probability they are not fictitious: For the contrivers of Fictions use to form them to as near a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity as they can to the most unsuspected Realities, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to make them look as like Truth, as is possible in the main Supposals, though withal they make them strange in the Circumstance. None but a Fool, or Madman, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, with a purpose of having it believed, that he saw in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Men with Horns on their Heads, and Eyes in their Breasts; or, if any should be so ridiculously vain, as to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in such an incredible Romance, it cannot be supposed that all Travellers that come into those parts after him should tell the same Story. There is a large Field in Fiction; and is all those Relations were Arbitrary Compositions; doubtless the first Romancers would have framed them more agreeable to the common Doctrine of Spirits; at least, after these suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Absurdities had been a thousand times laugh'd at, People by this time would have learn'd to correct those obnoxious Extravagancies; and though they have not yet more Veracity than the Ages of Ignorance and Superstition, yet one would expect they should have got more Cunning. This suppos'd Impossibility then of these Performances, seems to me a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Argument that they are not wilful, and designed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries. And if they are Fancies, 'tis somewhat strange, that Imagination, which is the most various thing in all the World, should infinitely repeat the same Conceits in all Times and Places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53288:113"/>
BUT again (2.) the strange Actions related of Witches, and presumed to be impossible, are not ascribed to their own Powers, but to the Agency of those wicked Confederates they imploy: And to affirm that those evil Spirits cannot do that, which we conceit impossible, is boldly to stint the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Creatures, whose Natures and Faculties we know not; and to measure the world of Spirits by the narrow Rules of our own impotent Beings. We see among our selves the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of some out-go the Conceits and Possibilities of others; and we know many things may be done by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, and Mechanick Artifice, which common Heads think impossible to be effected by the honest ways of Art and Nature. And doubtless, the subtilties and powers of those mischievous Fiends, are as much beyond the reach and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the most knowing Agents among us, as theirs are beyond the wit and ability of the most rustick and illiterate. So that the utmost that any Man's Reason in the World can amount to in this particular, is only this, That he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how such things can be performed; which only argues the weakness and imperfection of our Knowledg and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions; not the impossibility of those Performances: and we can no more from hence form an Argument against them, than against the most ordinary Effects in Nature. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive how the <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>t of the most obvious things about us, and the most considerable within our selves, 'tis then no wonder that we know not the Constitution and Powers of the Creatures, to whom we are such strangers. Briefly then, Matters of Fact well proved ought not to be denied, because we cannot conceive how they can be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Nor is it a reasonable method of Inference, first to presume the thing impossible, and thence to conclude that the Fact cannot be proved: On the contrary, we should judg of the Action by the Evidence, and not the Evidence by our Fancies about the Action. This is proudly to exalt our own Opinions above the clearest Testimonies, and most sensible
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53288:114"/>
Demonstrations of Fact: and so to give the Lye to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, rather than distrust the Conceits of our bold Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But yet further,</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) I think there is nothing in the Instances mention'd, but what may as well be accounted for by the Rules of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Philosophy, as the ordinary Affairs of Nature. For in resolving Natural <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> we can only assign the probable Causes, shewing how things may be, not presuming how they are: And in the particulars under our <hi>Examen,</hi> we may give an account how 'tis possible, and not unlikely, that such things (though somewhat varying from the common road of Nature) may be acted. And if our narrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Minds can furnish us with apprehensions of the way and manner of such Performances, (though perhaps not the true ones) 'tis an argument that such things may be effected by Creatures, whose Powers and Knowledg are so vastly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ours. I shall endeavour therefore briefly to suggest some things that may render the possibility of such perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances conceivable, in order to the removal of this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they are <hi>Contradictions,</hi> and <hi>impossible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the first then, That the Confederate Spirit should trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Witch through the Air to the place of general Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, there is no difficulty in conceiving it; and if that be true which great Philosophers affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, concerning the real se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parability of the Soul from the Body without Death, there is yet less; for then 'tis easie to apprehend, that the Soul, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left its gross and sluggish Body behind it, and being cloth'd only with its immed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e Vehicle of Air, or more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Matter, may be quickly conducted to any place, by those officious Spirits that attend it. And though I adventure to affirm nothing concerning the truth and certainty of this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, yet I must needs say, it doth not seem to me unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable. Our experience of <hi>Apoplexies, Epilepsies, Extasies,</hi> and the strange things Men report to have seen during those <hi>Deliquiums,</hi> look favourably upon this Conjecture; which seems to me to contradict no Principle of Reason or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, since Death consists not so much in the actual separation of Soul and Body, as in the indisposition and unfitness of the Body for Vital Union, as an excellent Philosopher hath made
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53288:114"/>
good: On which <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> the Witch's anointing her self before she takes her flight, may perhaps serve to keep the Body tenantable, and in fit disposition to receive the Spirit at its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. These things, I say, we may conceive, though I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm nothing about them; and there is not any thing in such Conceptions but what hath been own'd by Men of Worth and Name, and may seem fair and accountable enough to those who judg not altogether by customary Opinions. There's a saying of the great Apostle that seems to countenance this <hi>Platonick</hi> Notion; what is the meaning else of that Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, [<hi>Whether in the Body, or out of the Body, I cannot tell</hi>] ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Soul may be separated from the Body without death? Which if it be granted po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>sible, 'tis sufficient for my purpose. And</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The Transformations of Witches into the shapes of other Animals, upon the same supposal is very conceivable, since then 'tis easie to apprehend, that the Power of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may form those passive and pliable Vehicles into those shapes, with more ease than the Fancy of the Mother can the stubborn Matter of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb, as we see it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doth in the Instances that occur of <hi>Signatures,</hi> and monstrous <hi>Singularities;</hi> and perhaps sometimes the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Spirit puts tricks upon the Senses of the Spectators, and those Shapes are only Illusions.</p>
                  <p>But then (3.) when they feel the Hurts in their gross Bodies, that they receive in their Aiery Vehicles, they must be supposed to have been really present, at least in these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and 'tis no more difficult to apprehend how the hurts of those should be translated upon their other Bodies, than how Diseases should be inflicted by the Imagination, or how the Fancy of the Mother should wound the <hi>Foetus,</hi> as several cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Relations do attest.</p>
                  <p>And (4.) for their raising Storms and Tempests; They do it not by their own, but by the power of those Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that reside in the Air; and the Ceremonies that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd them, are doubtless nothing else but Entertainments for their Imaginations, and likely design'd to perswade them, that they do those strange things themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:53288:115"/>
(Lastly,) For their being suck'd by the Familiar, I say, (1.) we know so little of the nature of <hi>Daemons</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> that 'tis no wonder we cannot certainly divine the Reason of so strange an Action. And yet (2.) we may conjecture at some things that may render it less improbable; For some have thought that the <hi>Genii</hi> (whom both the <hi>Platonical</hi> and <hi>Christian Antiquity</hi> thought embodied) are recreated by the Reeks and Vapours of Humane Blood, and the Spirits that proceed from them: Which supposal (if we allow them Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) is not unlikely, every thing being refresh'd and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd by its Like. And that they are not perfectly abstract from all Body and Matter (besides the Reverence we owe to the wisest Antiquity) there are several considerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I could alledge to render exceeding probable. Which things supposed, the <hi>Devil's sucking</hi> the <hi>Sorceress</hi> is no great wonder, nor difficult to be accounted for. Or perhaps (3.) this may be only a Diabolical Sacrament, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to confirm the Hellish Covenant. To which I add, (4.) That the Familiar doth not only suck the Witch, but in the Action infuseth some poisonous Ferrnent into Her, which gives her Imagination and Spirits a Magical Tincture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they become mischievously influential; and the word <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesica</hi> intimates some such Matter. Now that the Imagination hath a mighty power in Operation, is feen in the just-now mention'd Signatures, and Diseases that it causeth; and that the Fancy is modified by the Qualities of the Blood and Spirits, is too evident to need proof. Which things suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, 'tis plain to conceive that the Evil Spirit having breath'd some vile Vapour into the Body of the Witch, it may taint her Blood and Spirits with a noxious Quality, by which her infected Imagination, heightned by Melancholy, and this worse Cause, may do much hurt upon Bodies that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to such Influences. And 'tis very likely that this Ferment disposeth the Imagination of the Sorceress to cause the mentioned <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or separation of the Soul from the Body, and may perhaps keep the Body in fit temper for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entry; as also it may facilitate transformation, which, it may be, could not be effected by ordinary and unassisted Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53288:115"/>
Thus we see, 'tis not so desperate to form an apprehension of the manner of these odd Performances; and though they are not done the way I have describ'd, yet what I have said may help us to a conceit of the Possibility, which sufficeth for my purpose. And though the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> I have gone upon will seem as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to some, as the things they attempt to explain are to others; yet I must desire their leave to suggest, that most things seem improbable (especially to the conceited, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionative) at first proposal: And many great Truths are strange and odd, till Custom and Acquaintance have recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled them to our Fancies. And I'le presume to add on this occasion, (though I love not to be confident in affirming) that there is none of the Platonical Supposals I have used, but what I could make appear to be indifferently fair and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.</p>

                     <hi>(III.) A</hi> Nother Prejudice against the being of Witches, is, That 'tis very improbable that the Devil, who is a Wise and Mighty Spirit, should be at the beck of a poor Hag, and have so little to do, as to attend the Errands and impotent Lusts of a sil'y old Woman.</p>
                  <p>To which I might answer, (1.) That 'tis much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that all the World should be deceiv'd in Matters of Fact, and Circumstances of the clearest Evidence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; than that the Devil, who is wicked, should be also unwise; and that He that perswades all his Subjects and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices out of their Wits, should himself act like his own Temptations and Perswasions. In brief, there is nothing more strange in this Objection, than that Wickedness is Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Servility; and that the Devil is at leasure to serve those whom he is at leasure to tempt, and industrious to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. And (2.) I see no necessity to believe that the Devil is always the Witches Confederate; but perhaps it may fitly be considered, whether the Familiar be not some departed Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Spirit, forsaken of God and Goodness, and swallowed up by the unsatiable desire of Mischief and Revenge; which

This Conceit I'm confident hath prejudic'd many against the belief of Witches and Apparitions, they not being able to conceive that the Devil should be so ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous, as Appearing Spirits are sometimes reported to be in their Frolicks; and they presume, that Souls departed never revis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if it be so suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that the Imps of Witches are sometimes wicked Spirits of our own Kind and Nature, and possibly the same that have been Sorcerers and Witches in this Life: This Supposal may give a fairer and more probable account of many of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sorcery and Witchcraft, than the other <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that they are always Devils. And to this Conjecture, Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to subjoin another, which also hath its probability, <hi>viz.</hi> (3.) That 'tis not impossible but that the Familiars of Witches are a vile kind of Spirits, of a very inferiour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and Nature, and none of those that were once of the highest <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> now degencrated into the Spirits we call <hi>Devils.</hi> The common division of Spirits is in my Opinion much too general; and why may we not think, there is as great a variety of Intellectual Creatures in the Invisible World, as of Animals in the Visible? And that all the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, yea, and Inferiour Regions, have their several kinds of Spirits differing in their natural Perfections; as well as in the Kinds and Degrees of their Depravities? Which if we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, 'tis very probable that those of the basest and meanest Orders are they, who submit to the mention'd Servilities:

                  <p>BVt <hi>(IV.)</hi> the Opinion of Witches seems to some to accuse Providence; and to suggest that it hath exposed Innocents to the fury and malice of revengeful Fiends; yea, and supposeth those most obnoxious, of whom we might most reasonably expect a more special care and protection; most of the cruel practices of those presum'd Instruments of Hell, being upon Children, who as they least deserve to be deserted, by that Providence that superintends all things, so they most need its Guardian Influence.</p>
                  <p>To this so specious an Objection, I have these things to answer.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Providence is an unfathomable Depth; and if we should not believe the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of our Senses, before we can reconcile them to our Notions of Providence, we must be grosser Scepticks than ever yet were extant. The miseries of the present Life, the unequal distributions of Good and Evil, the ignorance and barbarity of the greatest part of Mankind, the fatal disadvantages we are all under, and the hazard we run of being eternally miserable and undone; these, I say, are things that can hardly be made consistent with that Wisdom and Goodness that we are sure hath made, and mingled it self with all things. And yet we believe there is a beauty, and harmony, and goodness in that Providence, though we cannot unriddle it in particular Instances; nor, by reason of our ignorance and imperfection, clear it from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting Appearances; and consequently, we ought not to deny the being of Witches and Apparitions, because they will create us some difficulties in our Notions of Providence. (2.) Those that believe that Infants are Heirs of Hell, and Children of the Devil as soon as they are disclosed to the World, cannot certainly offer such an Objection; for what is a little trifling pain of a moment, to those eternal Tortures; to which, if they die as soon as they are born, according to the tenour of this Doctrine, they are everlastingly exposed? But
<pb facs="tcp:53288:117"/>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53288:118"/>
however the case stands as to that, 'tis certain, (3.) That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath not secur'd them from other violences they are obnoxious to, from cruelty and accident; and yet we accuse It not, when a whole Townful of Innocents fall a Victim to the rage and ferity of barbarous Executioners in Wars and Massacres. To which I add, (4.) That 'tis likely the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is not so often done by the evil Spirit immediately, but by the malignant influence of the Sorceress, whose power of hurting consists in the fore-mention'd Ferment, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into her by the Familiar. So that I am apt to think there may be a power of real Fascination in the Witches Eyes and Imaginations, by which for the most part she acts upon tender Bodies. <hi>Nescio quis teneros oculus</hi>—For the Pestilential Spirits being darted by a spightful and vigorous Imagination from the Eye, and meeting with those that are weak and passive in the Bodies which they enter, will not fail to infect them with anoxious Quality, that makes dangerous and strange Alterations in the Person invaded by this poisonous Influence: which way of acting by subtil and invisible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, is ordinary and familiar in all natural Efficiencies. And 'tis now past question, that Nature for the most part acts by subtil Streams and <hi>Aporrhaea's</hi> of Minute Particles, which pass from one Body to another. Or however that be, this kind of Agency is as conceivable as any of those Qualities, which our Ignorance hath called <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Antipathy;</hi> the reality of which we doubt not, though the manner of Action be unknown. Yea, the thing I speak of is as easie to be apprehended, as how Infection should pass in certain tenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious Streams through the Air, from one House to another; or, as how the biting of a mad Dog should fill all the Blood and Spirits with a venomous and malign Ferment; the application of the Vertue doing the same in our Case, as that of Contact doth in this. Yea, some kinds of Fascination are perform'd in this grosser and more sensible way, as by striking, giving Apples, and the like, by which the contagious Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be transmitted, as we see Diseases often are by the touch. Now in this way of conjecture, a good account may be given why Witches are most powerful upon Children and timerous Persons, <hi>viz.</hi> because their Spirits and Imaginations
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53288:118"/>
being weak and passive, are not able to resist the fatal Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; whereas Men of bold Minds, who have plenty of strong and vigorous Spirits are secure from the Contagion; as in pestilential Airs clean Bodies are not so liable to Infection as other tempers. Thus we see 'tis likely enough, that, very often, the Sorceress her self doth the mischief; and we know, <hi>de facto,</hi> that Providence doth not always secure us from one anothers Injuries; And yet I must confess, that many times also the Evil Spirit is the Mischievous Agent; though this Confession draw on me another Objection, which I next propose;</p>

                     <hi>(V.)</hi> IT may be said, that if Wicked Spirits can hurt as by the Direction, and at the desire of a Witch, one would think they should have the same power to do us injury without instigation or compact; and if this be granted, 'tis a wonder that we are not always annoyed and infested by them. <hi>To which</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Answer, (1.) That the Laws, Liberties, and Restraints of the Inhabitants of the other World are to us utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; and in this way, we can only argue our selves into confessions of our Ignorance, which every Man must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that is not as immodest, as ignorant. It must be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all that own the Being, Power, and Malice of Evil Spirits, that the security we enjoy is wonderful, whether they act by Witches or not; and by what Laws they are kept from making us a Prey, to speak like Philosophers, <hi>we cannot tell:</hi> Yea, why they should be permitted to tempt and ruine us in our Souls, and restrain'd from touching or hurting us in our Bodies, is a Mystery not easily accountable. But (2.) though we acknowledg their Power to vex and torment us in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies also; yet a reason may be given why they are less frequent in this kind of mischief, <hi>viz.</hi> because their main Designs are levell'd against the interest and happiness of our Souls, which they can best promote, when their Actions are most sly and secret; whereas did they ordinarily persecute Men in their Bodies, their Agency and wicked Influence would be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53288:119"/>
and make a mighty noise in the World, whereby Men would be awaken'd to a sutable and vigorous opposition, by the use of such means as would engage Providence to rescue them from their rage and cruelties; and at last defeat them in their great purposes of undoing us eternally. Thus we may conceive that the security we enjoy may well enough consist with the power and malice of those Evil Spirits; and upon this account may suppose that Laws of their own may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit their unlicenc'd Injuries; not from any goodness there is in their Constitutions, but in order to the more successful carrying on the projects of the Dark Kingdom; as Generals forbid Plunder, not out of love to their Enemies, but in order to their own success. And hence (3.) we may suppose a Law of Permission to hurt us at the instance of the Sorceress, may well stand with the polity of Hell, since by gratifying the wicked Person, they encourage her in malice and revenge, and promote thereby the main ends of their black Confederacy, which are to propagate Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, and to ruine us in our eternal Interests. And yet (4.) 'tis clear to those that believe the History of the Gospel, that Wicked Spirits have vexed the Bodies of Men, without any instigation that we read of; and at this day 'tis very likely that many of the strange Accidents and Diseases that befal us, may be the infliction of Evil Spirits, prompted to hurt us only by the delight they take in mischief. So that we cannot argue the improbability of their hurting Children and others by Witches, from our own security and freedom from the Effects of their Malice, which perhaps we feel in more Instances than we are aware of.</p>

(1.) That to resolve all the clear Circumstances of Fact, which we find in well-attested, and confirm'd Relations of this kind, into the power of deceivable Imagination, is to make Fancy the greater Prodigy; and to suppose, that it can do stranger Feats than are believed of any other kind of Fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination. To think that Pins and Nails, for instance, can, by the power of Imagination be convey'd within the Skin; or that Imagination should deceive so many as have been Witnesses in Objects of Sense, in all the Circumstances of Discovery: This, I say, is to be infinitely more credulous than the Assertors of Sorcery, and Demoniack Contracts. By the same reason it may be believ'd, that all the Battels and strange Events of the World, which our selves have not seen, are but Dreams and fond Imaginations, and like those that are fought in the Clouds, when the Brains of the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Spectators are the only Theatre of those fancied Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions.

But to this it will possibly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd, and the Reply will be another prejudice against the belief for which I contend, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <hi>(VII.)</hi> THat 'tis a suspicious circumstance that Witchcraft is but a Fancy, since the Persons that are accused, are commonly poor and miserable old Women, who are over-grown with discontent and melancholy, which are very imaginative; and the Persons said to be bewitch'd, are for the most part Children, or People very weak, who are easily imposed upon, and are apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive strong Impressions from nothing: whereas were there any such
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53288:120"/>
thing really, 'tis not likely, but that the more cunning and subtil Desperado's, who might the more successfully carry on the mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Designs of the Dark Kingdom, should be oftener engaged in those black Confederacies; and also one would expect Effects of the Hellish Combination upon others than the Innocent and the Ignorant.</p>
                  <p>To which Objection it might perhaps be enough to return, (as hath been above suggested) that nothing can be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by this and such-like arguings, but that the policy and menages of the Instruments of Darkness are to us altogether unknown, and as much in the dark as their Natures; Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind being no more acquainted with the Reasons and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Action in the other World, than poor Cottagers and Mechanicks are with the Intrigues of Government, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of State. Yea, peradventure (2.) 'tis one of the great Designs, (as 'tis certainly the Interest) of those wicked Agents and Machinators, industriously to hide from us their influences and ways of acting, and to work, as near as is possible, <hi>incognito;</hi> upon which supposal 'tis easie to conceive a reason, why they most commonly work by, and upon the weak and ignorant, who can make no cunning Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or tell credible Tales to detect their Artifice. Besides (3.) 'tis likely a strong Imagination, that cannot be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd or disturb'd by a busie and subtil Ratiocination, is a necessary requisite to those wicked Performances; without doubt an heightned and obstinate Fancy hath a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon impressible Spirits; yea, and as I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd before, on the more passive and susceptible Bodies: And I am very apt to believe, that there are as real Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications and Intercourses between our Spirits, as there are between Material Agents; which secret Influences, though they are unknown in their Nature, and ways of acting, yet they are sufficiently felt in their Effects: For Experience at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests, that some by the very majesty and greatness of their Spirits, discover'd by nothing but a certain noble Air that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies them, will bear down others less great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and make them sneak before them; and some, by I know not what stupifying vertue, will tie up the Tongue, and confine the Spirits of those who are otherwise brisk and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53288:120"/>
voluble. Which thing supposed, the influences of a Spirit possess'd of an active and enormous Imagination, may be malign and fatal where they cannot be resisted; especially when they are accompanied by those poisonous Reaks that the Evil Spirit breaths into the Sorceress, which likely are shot out, and applyed by a Fancy heightned and prepared by Melancholy and Discontent. And thus we may conceive why the Melancholick and Envious are used upon such occasions, and for the same reason the Ignorant, since Knowledge checks and controuls Imagination; and those that abound much in the Imaginative Faculties, do not usually exceed in the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal. And perhaps (4.) the <hi>Daemon</hi> himself useth the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the Witch so qualified for his purpose, even in those Actions of mischief which are more properly his; for it is most probable, that Spirits act not upon Bodies immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and by their naked Essence, but by means proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and sutable Instruments that they use; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count likely 'tis so strictly required, that the Sorceress should belive, that so her Imagination might be more at the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mischievous Agent: And for the same reason also Ceremonies are used in Inchantments, <hi>viz.</hi> for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But I attempt something more particularly, in order to which I must premise, That the Devil is a name for a Body Politick, in which there are very different Orders and Degrees of Spirits, and perhaps in as much variety of place and state, as among our selves; so that 'tis not one and the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that makes all the Compacts with those abused and sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Souls, but they are divers, and those 'tis like of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and basest quality in the Kingdom of Darkness; which being supposed.

Dominion and Authority being largely spread through the whole circumference of degenerated Nature, especially among those, whose pride was their original transgression) every one of these then desires to get Vassals to pay him homage, and to be employed like Slaves in the services of his Lusts and Appetites; to gratifie which desire, 'tis like it may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the constitution of their State and Government, that every wicked Spirit shall have those Souls as his property, and particular Servants and Attendants, whom he can catch in such Compacts; as those wild Beasts that we can take in hunting are ours, by the allowance of our Laws; and those Slaves that a Man hath purchas'd, are his peculiar Goods, and the Vassals of his Will. Or rather those deluding Fiends are like the seducing Fellows we call <hi>Spirits,</hi> who inveigle Children by their false and flattering Promises, and carry them away to the Plantations of <hi>America,</hi> to be servilely employed there in the Works of their Profit and Advantage. And as those base Agents will humour and flatter the simple unwary Youth, till they are on Ship-board, and without the reach of those that might rescue them from their hands: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the more mischievous Tempter studies to gratifie, please, and accommodate those he deals with in this kind, till Death hath lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53288:122"/>
To which, among other things, that might be suggested, I return,</p>
                  <p>(1.) That we are never liable to be so betrayed and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, till by our vile Dispositions and Tendencies we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the care and oversight of the better Spirits; who, though generally they are our guard and defence against the malice and violence of Evil Angels, yet it may well enough be thought, that sometimes they may take their leave of such as are swallowed up by Malice, Envy, and desire of Revenge, qualities most contrary to their Life and Nature; and leave them exposed to the invasion and sollicitations of those Wicked Spirits, to whom such hateful Attributes make them very sutable. And if there be particular Guardian Angels, (as 'tis not absurd to fancy) it may then well be supposed, that no Man is obnoxious to those Projects and Attempts, but only such whose vile and mischievous Natures have driven from them their protecting Genius. Against this dereliction to the power of Evil Spirits, 'tis likely enough what some affirm, that the Royal Psalmist directs that Prayer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 71. 9, 10. <hi>Cast me not off in the time of old Age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.</hi> For—<hi>They that keep my Soul</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the LXX and the Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, <hi>Qui custodiunt animam meam</hi>] <hi>they take counsel together, saying, God hath forsaken him, persecute him and take him, for there is none to deliver him.</hi> (2.) 'Tis very probable, that the stare wherein they are, will not easily permit palpable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses between the bad <hi>Genii,</hi> and Mankind, since 'tis probable that their own Laws and Government do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their frequent excursions into this World. Or, it may with as great likelyhood be supposed, that 'tis a very hard and painful thing for them, to force their thin and tenuious Bodies into a visible consistence, and such Shapes as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for their designs in their correspondencies with <hi>Witches.</hi> For in this Action their Bodies must needs be exceedingly compress'd, which cannot well be without a painful sense. And this is perhaps a reason why there are so few Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and why Appearing Spirits are commonly in such hast to be gone, <hi>viz.</hi> that they may be deliver'd from the unnatural
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53288:123"/>
pressure of their tender Vehicles, which I confess holds more in the Apparitions of Good, than of Evil Spirits; most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of this kind, describing their discoveries of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as very transient, (though for those the Holy Scripture records, there may be peculiar reason why they are not so) whereas the Wicked Ones are not altogether so quick and hasty in their Visits: The reason of which probably is, the great subtilty and tenuity of the Bodies of the former, which will require far greater degrees of compression, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of pain, to make them visible; whereas the latter are more feculent and gross, and so nearer allied to palpable Consistencies, and more easily reduceable to Appearance and Visibility.</p>
                  <p>At this turn, I have again made use of the Platonick Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, <hi>That Spirits are embodied,</hi> upon which indeed a great part of my Discourse is grounded: And therefore I hold my self obliged to a short account of that supposal. It seems then to me very probable from the Nature of Sense, and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of Nature. For (1.) we perceive in our selves, that all Sense is caus'd and excited by Motion made in Matter; and when those Motions which convey sensible Impressions to the Brain, the Seat of Sense, are intercepted, Sense is lost: So that, if we suppose Spirits perfectly to be disjoin'd from all Matter, 'tis not conceivable how they can have the sense of any thing; For how material Objects should any way be perceiv'd, or felt without Vital Union with Matter, 'tis not possible to imagine. Nor doth it (2.) seem sutable to the Analogy of Nature, which useth not to make precipitious leaps from one thing to another, but usually proceeds by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly steps and gradations: whereas were there no order of Beings between Us, (who are so deeply plunged into the grossest Matter) and pure, unbodied Spirits, 'twere a mighty jump in Nature. Since then the greatest part of the World consists of the finer portions of Matter, and our own Souls are immediately united unto these, 'tis exceeding probable, that the nearer orders of Spirits are vitally join'd to such Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and so, Nature by degrees ascending still by the more refin'd and subtile Matter, gets at last to the pure <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or immaterial Minds, which the <hi>Platonists</hi> made the highest
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53288:123"/>
Order of Created Beings. But of this I have discoursed elsewhere, and have said thus much of it at present, because it will enable me to add another Reason of the unfrequency of Apparitions and Compacts, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Because 'tis very likely, that these Regions are very unsutable, and disproportion'd to the frame and temper of their Senses and Bodies; so that perhaps the Courser Spirits can no more bear the Air of our World, than Bats and Owls can the brightest Beams of Day: Nor can the Purer and Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any more endure the noysom Steams, and poisonous Reeks of this Dunghil Earth, than the Delicate can bear a Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in nasty Dungeons, and the foul squalid Caverns of uncomfortable Darkness. So that 'tis no more wonder, that the better Spirits no oftner appear, than that Men are not more frequently in the Dark Hollows under-ground. Nor is't any more strange that evil Spirits so rarely visit us, than that Fishes do not ordinarily fly in the Air, (as 'tis said one sort of them doth) or that we see not the Batt daily flutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Beams of the Sun. And now by the help of what I have spoken under this Head, I am provided with some things wherewith to disable another Objection, which I thus propose:</p>
               </div>
               <div n="11" type="section">
                  <head>XI.</head>
                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>(XI.)</hi> IF there be such an intercourse between Evil Spirits and the Wicked; How comes it about that there is no corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence between Good Angels, and the Vertuous; since without doubt these are as desirous to propagate the Spirit and Designs of the Vpper and better World, as those are to promote the Interest of the Kingdom of Darkness?</p>
                  <p>Which way of arguing is still from our Ignorance of the State and Government of the other World, which must be confest, and may, without prejudice to the Proposition I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. But particularly, I say, (1.) That we have ground enough to believe, that Good Spirits do interpose in, yea, and govern our Affairs. For that there is a Providence reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Heaven to Earth, is generally acknowledg'd; but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53288:124"/>
that this supposeth all things to be order'd by the immediate influence, and interposal of the Supreme Deity, some think, is not very Philosophical to suppose; since, if we judge by the Analogy of the Natural World, all things we see are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by the Ministery of Second Causes, and Intermediate Agents. And it doth not seem so Magnificent and Becoming an apprehension of the Supreme <hi>Numen,</hi> to fancy his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Hand in every trivial Management. But 'tis exceeding likely to conjecture, that much of the Government of us, and our Affairs, is committed to the better Spirits, with a due subordination and subserviency to the Will of the chief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Universe. And 'tis not absurd to believe, that there is a Government that runs from Highest to Lowest, the better and more perfect orders of Being still ruling the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and less perfect. So that some one would fancy that perhaps the Angels may manage us, as we do the Creatures that God and Nature have placed under our Empire and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. But however that is, That God rules the Lower World by the Ministery of Angels, is very consonant to the Sacred Oracles. Thus, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 8, 9. <hi>When the Most High divided the Nations their Inheritance, when he separated the Sons of</hi> Adam, <hi>he set the Bounds of the People, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, according to the number of the Angels of God,</hi> as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> renders it; the Authority of which Translation, is abundantly credited and asserted, by its being quoted in the New Testament, without notice of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text; even there where it differs from it, as Learned Men have observ'd. We know also that Angels were very familiar with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs of old; and <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder is a Mystery; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports their ministring in the Affairs of the Lower World. Thus <hi>Origen</hi> and others understand, that to be spoken by the Presidential Angels, Jer. 51. 9. <hi>We would have healed</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go.</hi> Like the Voice heard in the Temple before the taking of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Titus,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And before <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was sent to learn Wisdom and Religion among the Beasts, <hi>He</hi> sees a <hi>Watcher,</hi> according to the LXX, an <hi>Angel,</hi> and an <hi>Holy One come down from Heaven,</hi> Dan. 4. 13. who pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the sad Decree against Him, and calls it the <hi>Decree</hi> of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53288:124"/>
                     <hi>Watchers,</hi> who very probably were the <hi>Guardian Genii</hi> of of Himself and his Kingdom. And that there are particular Angels that have the special Rule and Government of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Kingdoms, Provinces, Cities, yea and of Persons, I know nothing that can make improbable: The instance is notorious in <hi>Daniel,</hi> of the Angels of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Graecia,</hi> that hindred the other that was engaged for the Concerns of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea;</hi> yea, our Saviour himself tells us, that <hi>Children have their Angels;</hi> and the Congregation of Disciples supposed that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had his: Which things, if they be granted, the good Spirits have not so little to do with Us, and our Matters, as is generally believed. And perhaps it would not be absurd, if we referr'd many of the strange Thwarts, and unexpected Events, the Disappointments and lucky Coincidences that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal us, the unaccountable Fortunes and Successes that attend some lucky Men, and the unhappy Fates that dog others that seem born to be miserable; the Fame and Favour that still waits on some without any conceivable Motive to allure it, and the general neglect of others more deserving, whose worth is not acknowledg'd; I say, these and such-like odd things, may with the greatest probability be resolv'd into the Conduct and Menages of those Invisible Supervisors, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side over, and govern our Affairs.</p>
                  <p>But if they so far concern themselves in our Matters, how is it that they appear not to maintain a visible and confest Correspondence with some of the better Mortals, who are most fitted for their Communications and their Influence? <hi>To which I have said some things already, when I accounted for the unfrequency of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions; and I now add what I intend for another return to the main Objection,</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) That the Apparition of Good Spirits is not needful for the Designs of the better World, what-ever such may be for the Interest of the other. For we have had the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Cohabitation of the Son of God; we have <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, and the continued Influence of the Spirit, the greatest Arguments to strengthen Faith, the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Motives to excite our Love, and the noblest Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to quicken and raise our Desires and Hopes, any of which are more than the Apparition of an Angel; which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53288:125"/>
would indeed be a great gratification of the Animal Life, but 'twould render our Faith less noble and less generous, were it frequently so assisted: <hi>Blessed are they that believe, and yet have not seen.</hi> Besides which, the Good Angels have no such Ends to prosecute, as the gaining any Vassals to serve them, they being Ministring Spirits for our good, and no self-designers for a proud and insolent Dominion over us. And it may be perhaps not impertinently added, That they are not always evil Spirits that appear, as is, I know not well upon what grounds, generally imagined; but that the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry detections of Murders, latent Treasures, falsified and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulfill'd Bequests, which are sometimes made by Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may be the courteous Discoveries of the better, and more benign <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>nii.</hi> Yea, 'tis not unlikely, that those War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings that the World sometimes hath of approaching Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Calamities by Prodigies, and sundry odd <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> are the kind Informations of some of the Inhabitants of the Upper World. Thus was <hi>Jerusalem</hi> forewarned before its sacking by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> by those Aiery Horsemen that were seen through all the City for almost forty days together, 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 5. 2, 3. And the other Prodigious Portents that fore-ran its Destruction by <hi>Titus:</hi> which I mention, because they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Instances. And though, for mine own part, I scorn the ordinary Tales of Prodigies, which proceed from super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Fears, and unacquaintance with Nature, and have been used to bad Purposes by the Zealous and the Ignorant; Yet I think that the Arguments that are brought by a late very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Author, to conclude against such Warnings and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in the whole kind, are short and inconsequent, and built upon too narrow <hi>Hypotheseis.</hi> For if it be supposed, that there is a sort of Spirits over us, and about us, who can give a probable guess at the more remarkable Futurities, I know not why it may not be conjectured, that the kindness they have for us, and the appetite of fore-telling strange things, and the putting the World upon expectation, which we find is very grateful to our own Natures, may not incline them also to give us some general notice of those uncommon Events which they foresee. And I yet perceive no reason we have to fancy, that what-ever is done in this kind, must needs be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53288:125"/>
either immediately from Heaven, or from the Angels, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Commission and Appointment. But it seems to me not unreasonable to believe, that those officious Spirits that oversee our Affairs, perceiving some mighty and sad Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations at hand, in which their Charge is much concerned, cannot chuse, by reason of their affection to us, but give us some seasonable hints of those approaching Calamities; to which also their natural desire to foretel strange things to come, may contribute to incline them. And by this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> the fairest Probabilities, and strongest Ratiocinations against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, may be made unserviceable. But this only by the way.</p>
                  <p>I desire it may be considered further,</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) That God himself assords his Intimacies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses to the better Souls, that are prepared for it; which is a priviledge infinitely beyond Angelical Correspondence.</p>
                  <p>I confess the proud and fantastick Pretences of many of the conceited Melancholists in this Age, to Divine Communion, have prejudiced divers intelligent Persons against the belief of any such happy vouchsafement; so that they conclude the Doctrine of Immediate Communion with the Deity in this Life to be but an high flown Notion of warm Imagination, and over-lushious self-flattery; and I acknowledge I have my self had thoughts of this nature, supposing Communion with God to be nothing else but the exercise of Vertue, and that Peace, and those Comforts which naturally result from it.</p>
                  <p>But I have considered since, that God's more near and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate imparting himself to the Soul that is prepared for that happiness by Divine Love, Humility, and Resignation, in the way of a vital Touch and Sense, is a thing possible in it self, and will be a great part of our Heaven; That Glory is begun in Grace, and God is pleased to give some excellent Souls the happy <hi>Ante-past;</hi> That Holy Men in ancient Times have sought and gloried in this Injoyment, and never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain so sorely as when it was with-held, and interrupted; That the Expressions of Scripture run infinitely this way, and the best of Modern good Men, do from their own experience attest it; That this spiritualizeth Religion, and renders its Injoyments more comfortable and delicious; That it keeps
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53288:126"/>
the Soulunder a vivid Sense of God, and is a grand security against Temptation; That it holds it steady amid the Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of a Prosperous State, and gives it the most grounded Anchorage, and support amid the Waves of an adverse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; That 'tis the noblest incouragement to vertue, and the biggest assurance of an happy Immortality; I say, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered these weighty things, and wondred at the carelesness, and prejudice of Thoughts that occasion'd my suspecting the reality of so glorious a Privilege; I saw how little reason there is in denying Matters of inward Sense, because our selves do not feel them, or cannot form an apprehension of them in our Minds: I am convinced that things of gust and relish must be judg'd by the sentient and vital Faculties, and not by the noetical Exercises of speculative Understandings: And upon the whole, I believe infinitely that the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit affords its sensible Presence, and immediate Beatihck Touch to some rare Souls, who are divested of carnal Self, and mundane Pleasures, abstracted from the Body by Prayer and Holy Meditation; spiritual in their Desires, and calm in their Affections; devout Lovers of God, and Vertue, and tenderly affectionate to all the World; sincere in their Aims, and circumspect in their Actions; inlarged in their Souls, and clear in their Minds: These I think are the dispositions that are requisite to fit us for Divine Communion; and God transacts not in this near way, but with prepared Spirits who are thus disposed for the manifestation of his Presence, and his Influence: And such I believe he never fails to bless with these happy foretasts of Glory.</p>
                  <p>But for those that are Passionate and Conceited, Turbulent and Notional, Confident and Immodest, Imperious and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious; That doat upon Trifles, and run fiercely in the ways of a Sect; that are lifted up in the apprehension of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prerogatives of themselves and their Party, and scorn all the World besides; For such, I say, be their Pretensions what they will, to Divine Communion, Illapses, and Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, I believe them not; Their Fancies abuse them, or they would us. For what Communion hath Light with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or the Spirit of the <hi>Holy One</hi> with those, whose Genius and Ways are so unlike him: But the other excellent Souls I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53288:126"/>
describ'd, will as certainly be visited by the Divine Presence, and Converse, as the Chrystaline Streams are with the Beams of Light, or the fitly prepared Earth, whose Seed is in it self, will be actuated by the Spirit of Nature.</p>
                  <p>So that there is no reason to Object here the want of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Communications, though there were none vouchsafed us, since good Men enjoy the Divine, which are infinitely more satisfactory and indearing.</p>
                  <p>And now I may have leave to proceed to the next Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may be made to speak thus:</p>

For if they by Diabolical Assistance, can inflict and cure Diseases, and do things so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the comprehension of our Philosophy, and activity of common Nature; What assurance can we have, that the Miracles that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our Gospel were not the Effects of a Compact of like nature, and that Devils were not cast out by <hi>Beelzebub?</hi> If Evil Spirits can assume Bodies, and render themselves visible in humane Likeness; What security can we have of the reality of the Resurrection of Christ? And if, by their help, Witches can enter Chambers invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly through Key-holes, and little unperceived Crannies, and transform themselves at pleasure; What Arguments of Divinity are there in our Saviour's shewing himself in the midst of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when the Doors were shut, and his Transfiguration in the Mount? Miracles are the great Inducements of Belief; and how shall we distinguish a Miracle from a Lying Wonder; a Testimony from Heaven, from a Trick of the Angels of Hell; if they can perform things that astonish and confound our Reasons, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the Possibilities of Humane Nature? <hi>To this Objection I reply;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) The Wonders done by Confederacy with Wicked Spirits, cannot derive a suspition upon the undoubted Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that were wrought by the Author and Promulgers of our
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53288:127"/>
Religion, as if they were performed by Diabolical Compact, since their Spirit, Endeavours, and Designs, were notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously contrary to all the Tendencies, Aims, and Interests of the Kingdom of Darkness. For, as to the Life and Temper of the Blessed and Adorable JESUS, we know there was an incomparable sweetness in his Nature, Humility in his Manners, Calmness in his Temper, Compassion in his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Modesty in his Expressions, Holiness in all his Actions, Hatred of Vice and Baseness, and Love to all the World; all which are essentially contrary to the Nature and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Apostate Spirits, who abound in Pride and Rancour, Insolence and Rudeness, Tyranny and Baseness, Universal Malice, and Hatred of Men: And their Designs are as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, as their Spirit and their Genius. And now, Can the Sun borrow its Light from the Bottomless Abyss? Can Heat and Warmth flow in upon the World from the Regions of Snow and Ice? Can Fire freeze, and Water burn? Can Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so infinitely contrary, communicate, and jump in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that are destructive to each others known Interests? Is there any Balsam in the Cockatrices Egg? or, Can the Spirit of Life flow from the Venom of the Asp? Will the Prince of Darkness strengthen the Arm that is stretcht out to pluck his Usurp't Scepter, and his Spoils from him? And will he lend his Legions, to assist the Armies of his Enemy against him? No, these are impossible Supposals; No intelligent Being will industriously and knowingly contribute to the Contradiction of its own Principles, the Defeature of its Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and the Ruine of its own dearest Interests. There is no fear then, that our Faith should receive prejudice from the acknowledgement of the Being of Witches, and Power of Evil Spirits, since 'tis not the doing wonderful things that is the only Evidence that the Holy JESUS was from God, and his Doctrine True; but the conjunction of other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, the Holiness of his Life, the Reasonableness of his Religion, and the Excellency of his Designs, added cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to his Works, and strengthned the great Conclusion, <hi>That he could be no other than the Son of God, and Saviour of the World.</hi> But besides, I say,</p>

(2.) That since Infinite Wisdom and Goodness rules the World, it cannot be conceiv'd, that they should give up the greatest part of Men to unavoidable deception. And if Evil Angels, by their Confederates are permitted to perform such astonishing things, as seem so evidently to carry God's Seal and Power with them, for the confirmation of Falshoods, and gaining credit to Impostors, without any Counter-evidence to disabuse the World; Mankind is exposed to sad and fatal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion: And to say that Providence will suffer us to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in things of the greatest Concernment, when we use the best of our Care and Endeavours to prevent it, is to speak hard things of God; and in effect to affirm, That He hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in the Government of the World, or doth not concern himself in the Affairs of poor forlorn Men: And if the Providence and Goodness of God be not a security unto us against such Deceptions, we cannot be assured, but that we are always abused by those mischievous Agents, in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of plain Sense, and in all the Matters of our daily Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses.

foretold, break the Bonds of Death, and lift up his Head out of the Grave: If Multitudes of other departed Souls shall arise with Him, to attend at the Solemnity of his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If He shall, after Death, visibly Converse, and Eat, and Drink with divers Persons, who could not be deceived in a Matter of clear Sense, and ascend in Glory in the presence of an astonisht and admiring Multitude: I say, if such a One as this should prove a Diabolical Impostor, and Providence should permit him to be so credited and acknowledged; What possibility were there then for us to be assured, that we are not always deceived? yea, that our very Faculties were not given us only to delude and abuse us? And if so, the next Conclusion is, <hi>That there is no God that judgeth in the Earth;</hi> and the best, and most likely <hi>Hypothesis</hi> will be, <hi>That the World is given up to the Government of the Devil.</hi> But if there be a Providence that superviseth us, (as nothing is more certain) doubtless it will never suffer poor helpless Creatures to be ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably deceived, by the craft and subtilty of their mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Enemy, to their undoing; but will without question take such care, that the <hi>Works</hi> wrought by Divine Power for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Divine Truth, shall have such visible Marks and Signatures, if not in their Nature, yet in their Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Ends, and Designs, as shall discover whence they are, and sufficiently distinguish them from all Impostures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions; And though wicked Spirits may perform some strange things that may excite wonder for a while, yet He hath, and will so provide, that they shall be basfled and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited; as we know it was in the Case of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptian Magicians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things I count sufficient to be said to this last, and shrewdest Objection; Though some, I understand, except, that I have made it stronger than the Answer I have applyed. That I have urged the Argument of Unbelievers home, and represented it in its full strength, I suppose can be no matter of just reproof; For to triumph over the weakness of a Cause, and to over-look its strength, is the trick of shallow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed Disputers, and the worst way to defend a Good Cause, or confute a Bad One. I have therefore all along ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the most cogent Things I could think of, for the Interest
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53288:128"/>
of the Objectors, because I would not impose upon my Reader or my self; and the stronger I make their Premises, the more shall I weaken their Conclusion, if I answer them; which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have done, or not, I refer my self to the Judgments of the Ingenious and Considerate; from whom I should be very glad to be informed in what particular Points my Discourse is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; General Charges are no Proofs, nor are they easily ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of an Answer. Yet, to the mention'd Exception, I say,</p>
                  <p>That the strength of the Objection is not my fault, for the Reasons alledg'd; and for the supposed incompetency of my return, I propose, that if the Circumstances of the Persons, Ends, and Issues be the best Notes of Distinction between true Miracles and Forgeries, Divine and Diabolical Ones, I have then said enough to secure the Miracles of our Saviour, and the Holy Men of Ancient Times. But if these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors think they can give us any better, or more infallible <hi>Criteria,</hi> I desire them to weigh what I have offer'd about Miracles in some of the following Leaves, before they enter that Thought among their Certainties. And if their other Marks of Difference will hold, notwithstanding those Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I suppose the inquisitive believing World would be glad to know them; and I shall have particular Obligations to the Discoverer, for the strength with which he will thereby assist my Answer.</p>
                  <p>But till I see that, I can say nothing stronger; or if I saw it, which I shall not in haste expect, I should not be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced but that the Circumstances of Difference which I have noted, are abundantly sufficient to disarm the Objection; and to shew, that though Apparitions, Witchcraft, and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Wonders are admitted: yet none of these can fasten any Slu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, or ground of dangerous Doubt upon the miraculous performances of the <hi>H. Jesus</hi> and his Apostles. If the dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied can shew it, I shall yeeld my self an humble Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite to their Reasons; but till I know them, the General Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion will not convince me.</p>
                  <p>Now, besides what I have directly said to the Main Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I have this to add to the Objectors, That I could wish they would take care of such Suggestions; which, if they overthrow not the Opinion they oppose, will dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53288:129"/>
affront the Religion they would seem to acknowledge. For he that saith, <hi>That if there are Witches, there is no way to prove that Christ Jesus was not a Magician, and Diabolical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor,</hi> puts a deadly Weapon into the hands of the Infidel, and is himself next door to the <hi>Sin against the Holy Ghost:</hi> of which, in order to the perswading greater tenderness and caution in such Matters, I give this short account.</p>
                  <p>THe Sin against the Holy Ghost is said to be Unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; by which sad Attribute, and the Discourse of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. from the 22 to the 33 <hi>Verse,</hi> we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand its Nature. In order to which we consider, That since the Mercies of God, and the Merits of his Son, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, there is nothing can make a Sin unpardonable, but what makes it incurable; and there is no Sin but what is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by a strong Faith, and a vigorous Endeavour: <hi>For all things are possible to him that believeth.</hi> So that, That which makes a Sin incurable, must be somewhat that makes Faith impossible, and obstructs all means of Conviction. In order to the finding which, we must consider the Ways and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods the Divine Goodness hath taken, for the begetting Faith, and cure of Infidelity: which it attempted, first, by the Prophets, and Holy Men of Ancient Times, who, by the excellency of their Doctrine, the greatness of their Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and the holiness of their Lives, endeavoured the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Reformation of a stubborn and unbelieving World. But though few believed their report, and Men would not be prevail'd on by what they did, or what they said; yet their Infidelity was not hitherto incurable, because further means were provided in the Ministry of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> whose Life was more severe, whose Doctrines were more plain, pressing and particular: and therefore 'twas possible that He might have succeeded. Yea, and where He failed, and could not open Mens Hearts and Eyes, the Effect was still in possibility, and it might be expected from Him that came after, to whom the Prophets and <hi>John</hi> were but the Twilight and the Dawn. And though His miraculous Birth, the Song of Angels, the Journey of the Wise Men of the East, and the correspondence of Prophesies, with the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53288:129"/>
of the first appearance of the Wonderful Infant: I say, though these had not been taken notice of, yet was there a further provision made for the cure of Infidelity, in his astonishing Wisdom, and most excellent Doctrines; For, <hi>He spake as never Man did.</hi> And when these were despised and neglected, yet there were other Means towards Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Cure of Unbelief, in those mighty Works that bore Testimony of Him, and wore the evident Marks of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power in their Foreheads. But when after all, These clear and unquestionable Miracles which were wrought by the Spirit of God, and had eminently his Superscription on them, shall be ascribed to the Agency of Evil Spirits, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical Compact, as they were by the malicious and spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Pharisees;</hi> when those great and last Testimonies against Infidelity, shall be said to be but the Tricks of Sorcery, and Complotment with Hellish Confederates; This is Blasphemy in the highest, against the Power and Spirit of God, and such as cuts of all means of Conviction, and puts the Unbeliever beyond all possibilities of Cure. For Miracles are God's Seal, and the great and last Evidence of the truth of any Doctrine. And though, while these are only dis-believed as to the Fact, there remains a possibility of Perswasion; yet, when the Fact shall be acknowledg'd, but the Power Blasphemed, and the Effects of the Adorable Spirit maliciously imputed to the Devils; such a Blasphemy, such an Infidelity is incurable, and consequently unpardonable. I say, in sum, the Sin against the Holy Ghost seems to be a malicious imputation of the Miracles wrought by the Spirit of God in our Saviour to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical Confederacy, and the Power of Apostate Spirits; Then which, nothing is more blasphemous, and nothing is more like to provoke the Holy Spirit that is so abused to an Eternal Dereliction of so Vile and so Incurable an Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>This account, as 'tis clear and reasonable in it self, so it is plainly lodg'd in the mention'd Discourse of our Saviour. And most of those that speak other things about it, seem to me to talk at random, and perfectly without Book.</p>

I Have thus endeavoured to remove the Main Prejudices against the belief of Witches and Apparitions; and I'me sure I have suggested much more against what I defend, than ever I heard or saw in any that opposed it, whose Discourses, for the most part, have seemed to me inspired by a lofty scorn of common belief, and some trivial Notions of Vulgar Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy. And in despising the Common Faith about Matters of Fact, and fondly adhering to it in things of Speculation, they very grosly and absurdly mistake: For in things of Fact, the People are as much to be believ'd, as the most subtile Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers and Speculators; since here, Sense is the Judge. But in Matters of Notion and Theory, They are not at all to be heeded, because Reason is to be Judge of these, and this they know not how to use. And yet thus it is with those wise Philosophers, that will deny the plain Evidence of the Senses of Mankind, because they cannot reconcile Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances to the fond Fancies of a Philosophy, which they lighted on in the High-way by Chance, and will adhere to at adventure. So that I profess, for mine own part, I never yet heard any of the confident Declaimers against Witchcraft and Apparitions, speak any thing that might move a Mind, in any degree instructed in the generous kinds of Philosophy, and Nature of things. And for the Objections I have reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they are most of them such as rose out of mine own Thoughts, which I obliged to consider what might be to be said upon this occasion.</p>
                  <p>For though I have examined <hi>Scot's Discovery,</hi> sancying that there I should find the strong Reasons of Mens dis-belief in this Matter: Yet I met not with any thing in that <hi>Farrago</hi> that was considerable. For the Author doth little but tell odd Tales, and silly Legends, which he confutes and laughs at, and pretends this to be a Confuration of the Being of Witches and Apparitions. In all which, His Reasonings are Trifling and Childish; and when He ventures at Philosophy, He is little better than absurd: So that I should wonder much if any but Boys and Buffoons should imbibe Prejudices against a Belief so infinitely confirmed, from the loose and impotent Suggestions of so weak a Discourser.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:53288:130"/>
But however observing two things in that Discourse that would pretend to be more than ordinary Reasons, I shall do them the civility to examine them. It is said,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>(1.)</hi> THat the Gospel is silent, as to the Being of Witches; and 'tis not likely, if there were such, but that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour or his Apostles had given intimations of their Existence. <hi>The other is,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>(2.)</hi> MIracles are ceased, and therefore the prodigious things ascribed to Witchcraft, are supposed Dreams and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures.</p>
                  <p>For Answer to the First in order, I consider, (1.) That though the History of the <hi>New Testament</hi> were granted to be silent in the Business of Witches and Compacts, yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Old have a frequent mention of them. The Law, <hi>Euod.</hi> 22. 18. against permitting them to live, is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. And we have another remarkable prohibition of them, Deut. 18. 10. 11. <hi>There shall not be found among you any one, that maketh his Son or his Daughter pass through the Fire, or that useth Divination, or an Observer of Times, or an Enchanter, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Witch, or a Charmer, or a Consulter with Familiar Spirits, or a Wizard, or a Necromaneer.</hi> Now this accumulation of Names, (some of which are of the same sense and import) is a plain indication that the <hi>Hebrew Witch</hi> was one that practised by compact with evil Spirits. And many of the same Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are put together in the Charge against <hi>Manasses,</hi> 2 Chron. 33. <hi>viz.</hi> That he <hi>caused his Children to pass through the Fire, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Times, used Inchantments, and Witchcraft, and dealt with Familiar Spirits, and with Wizards.</hi> So that though the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal word which we render Witch and Witchcraft should, as our <hi>Sadduces</hi> urge, signifie only a <hi>Cheat</hi> and a <hi>Poisoner;</hi> yet those others mention'd, plainly enough speak the thing, and I have given an account in the former Considerations, how a Witch in the common Notion is a Poisoner. But why meer poisoning should have a distinct Law against it, and not be concluded under the general one against Murder; why meer Legerdemain and Cheating should be so severely animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53288:131"/>
on, as to be reckon'd with Inchantments, converse with Devils, and Idolatrous Practices: I believe the denyer of Witches will find it hard to give a reason. To which I may add some other Passages of Scripture that yield sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Case. The Nations are forbid to hearken to the Diviners, Dreamers, Inchanters, and Sorcerers, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27. 9. The <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> are deeply threatned for their Sorceries and Inchantments, <hi>Isa.</hi> 47.9. And we read that <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> called the <hi>Magicians, Astrologers, Sorcerers,</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> to tell his Dream. My mention of which last, minds me to say, that for ought I have to the contrary, there may be a sort of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Magicians</hi> that have no Familiars that they know, nor any express Compact with Apostate Spirits; who yet may perhaps act strange things by Diabolick Aids, which they procure by the use of those Forms, and wicked Arts that the Devil did first impart to his Confederates: And we know not but the Laws of that Dark Kingdom may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn a particular attendance upon all those that practise their Mysteries, whether they know them to be theirs or not. For a great interest of their Empire may be served by this Project, since those that find such success in the unknown Conjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may by that be toll'd on to more express Transactions with those Fiends that have assisted them <hi>incognito:</hi> Or, if they proceed not so far, yet they run upon a Rock by acting in the Dark, and dealing in unknown and unwarranted Arts, in which the Effect is much beyond the proper efficiency of the things they use, and affords ground of more than suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that some Evil Spirit is the Agent in those wondrous Performances.</p>
                  <p>Upon this account, I say, it is not to me unlikely but that the Devils may by their own Constitution be bound to attend upon all that use their Ceremonies and Forms, though igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, and without design of Evil; and so Conjuration may have been performed by those who are none of the <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sorcerers</hi> and <hi>Witches.</hi> Among those perhaps we may justly reckon <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the Diviners. For <hi>Balaam, Moncaeus</hi> hath undertaken to clear him from the Guilt of the greater Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And the <hi>Diviners</hi> are usually distinctly mentioned from those that had Familiar Spirits. The <hi>Astrologers</hi> also of Elder
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53288:131"/>
Times, and those of Ours, I take to have been of this sort of <hi>Magicians,</hi> and some of them, under the colour of that Mystical Science, worse. And I question not, but that things are really done, and foretold by those pretended Artists, that are much beyond the regular Possibilities of their Art; which in this appears to be exceedingly uncertain and precarious, in that there are no less than six ways of erecting a Scheme, in each of which the Prediction of Events shall be different, and yet every one of them be justifiable by the Rules of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Science. And the Principles they go upon, are found to be very Arbitrary, and Unphilosophical, not by the ordinary Declaimers against it, but by the most profound Inquirers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to things, who perfectly understand the whole Mystery, and are the only competent Judges.</p>
                  <p>Now those Mystical Students may in their first Addresses to this Science, have no other Design, but the satisfaction of their Curiosity to know remote and hidden things; Yet that in the Progress being not satisfied within the Bounds of their Art, doth many times tempt the Curious Inquirer to use worse means of Information; and no doubt those mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Spirits that are as vigilant as the Beasts of Prey, and watch all occasions to get us within their envious reach, are more constant Attenders, and careful Spies upon the Actions and Inclinations of such, whose Genius and Designs prepare them for their Temptations.</p>
                  <p>So that I look on <hi>Judicial Astrology</hi> as a fair Introduction to Sorcery and Witchcraft. And who knows but that it was first set on foot by Evil Spirits, as a Lure to draw the <hi>Curios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>'s</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those snares that lie hid beyond it. And yet, I believe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, It may be innocently enough studied by those that aim on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to understand what it is, and how far it will honestly go; and are not willing to condemn any thing which they do not comprehend. But that they must take care to keep themselves within the Bounds of sober Enquiry, and not indulge irregular Sollicitudes about the knowledge of Things, which Providence hath thought fit to conceal from us; Which who-ever doth, lays himself open to the Designs and Sollicitations of Wicked Spirits; and I believe there are very few among such as have been addicted to those Arts of Wonder and Prediction, but
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53288:132"/>
have found themselves att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>d by them to the more dangerous Actions and Correspondencies. For as there are a sort of base and fordid Spirits that attend the Envy and Malice of the Ignorant and viler sort of Persons, and betray-them into Compacts by Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Revenge; So, no doubt, there are a kind of more Aiery and Speculative Fiends, of an higher rank and order than those wretched Imps, who apply themselves to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: and many times prevail with them by offers of the more Recondite Knowledge; as we know it was in the first Temptation. Yea, and sometimes they are so cautious and wary in their Conversations with more resined Persons, that they never offer to make any express Covenants with them. To this purpose I have been informed, by a very Learned and Reverend Doctor, that one Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> a Master of Arts of <hi>Trin. Coll.</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> being reclaimed from Conjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, declared in his Repentance, that the <hi>Daemon</hi> always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him like a Man of good fashion, and never required any Compact from him! And no doubt, They sort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves agreeably to the State, Port, and Genius of those with whom they converse; Yea, 'tis like, as I conjectured, are assistant sometimes to those, to whom they dare not shew themselves in any openness of appearance, lest they should fright them from those ways of Sin and Temptation. So that we see, that Men may act by Evil Spirits without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they do so.</p>
                  <p>And possibly <hi>Nebuehadnezzar</hi>'s Wise Men might be of this fort of <hi>Magicians;</hi> which supposal I mention the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may serve me against some things that may be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: For, it may be said, If they had been in Confederacy with Devils, it is not probable that <hi>Daniel</hi> would have been their Advocate, or in such inoffensive terms have distinguisht their skill from Divine Revelation; nor should he, one would think, have accepted the Office of being Provost over them. These Circumstances may be suppos'd to intimate a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that the <hi>Magi</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> were in no profest Diabolical Complotment, and I grant it. But yet they might, and in all likelyhood did use the Arts and Methods of Action, which obtain <hi>Demonaick Cooperation</hi> and <hi>Assistance,</hi> though without
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53288:132"/>
their privity, and so they were a loss criminal sort of <hi>Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;</hi> For those Arts were conveyed down along to them from one hand to another, and the Successors still took them up from those that preceded, without a <hi>Philosophical Scrutiny</hi> or <hi>Examen.</hi> They saw strange Things were done, and Events predicted by such Forms and such Words; how, they could not tell, nor 'tis like did not inquire, but contented themselves with this general account, That 'twas by the power of their Arts, and were not sollicitous for any better Reason. This, I say, was probably the case of most of those Predictors; though, it may be, others of them advanced further into the more desperate part of the Mystery. And that some did immediately transact with appearing Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in those times, is apparent enough, from express menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Scriptures I have alledg'd.</p>
                  <p>And the Story of the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> 1 Sam. 28. is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Demonstration of the Main Conclusion; which will appear, when we have considered, and removed the fancy and glosses of our Author about it, in his <hi>Discovery:</hi> where to avoid this Evidence, he affirms, This Witch to be but a Cozener, and the whole Transaction a Cheat and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture, managed by her Self and a Confederate. And in order to the perswading this, he tells a fine Tale, <hi>viz.</hi> That she departed from <hi>Saul</hi> into her Closet, <q>Where doubtless, says he, she had a Familiar, some lewd crafty Priest, and made <hi>Saul</hi> stand at the Door like a Fool, to hear the cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Answers. He saith, she there used the ordinary words of Conjuration; and after them, <hi>Samuel</hi> appears, whom he affirms to be no other than either the Witch her self, or her Confederate.</q> By this pretty knack and contrivance, he thinks he hath disabled the Relation from signifying to our purpose.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Discoverer</hi> might have consider'd, that all this is an Invention, and without Book. For there is no mention of the Witch's Closet,. or her retiring into another Room, or her Confederate, or her Form of Conjuration; I say, nothing of all this is as much as intimated in the <hi>History;</hi> and if we may take this large liberty in the Interpretation of Scripture, there is scarce a Story in the Bible but may be made a Fallacy and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53288:133"/>
Imposture, or any thing that we please. Nor is this Fancy of his only Arbitrary, but indeed contrary to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Text. For it says, <hi>Saul perceived it was</hi> Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, <hi>and bowed himself,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> Samuel <hi>truly</hi> foretold his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Fate, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Israel</hi> should be deliver'd with him into the hands of the <hi>Philistines;</hi> and that on the morrow, He and his Sons should be in the state of the Dead; which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less is meant by the Expression, that [<hi>they should be with him</hi>]; Which contingent Particulars, how could the Coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and her Confederate foretel, if there were nothing in it extraordinary and preternatural?</p>
                  <p>It hath indeed been a great Dispute among Interpreters, whether the real <hi>Samuel</hi> was raised, or the Devil in his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Most later Writers suppose it to have been an Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, upon the supposition that Good and Happy Souls can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return hither from their Coelestial Abodes; and they are not certainly at the Beck and Call of an impious Hag. But then those of the other side urge, that the Piety of the words that were spoke, and the seasonable Reproof given to despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Saul,</hi> are Indications sufficient that they came not from Hell; and especially they think the Prophesie of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances very accidental to be an Argument, that it was not utter'd by any of the Infernal Predictors. And for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal that is the ground of that Interpretation, 'tis judged exceedingly precarious; for who saith that happy departed Souls were never employed in any Ministeries here below? And those Dissenters are ready to ask a Reason, Why they may not be sent in Messages to Earth, as well as those of the Angelical Order? They are nearer allyed to our Natures, and upon that account more intimately concern'd in our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and the example of returning <hi>Lazarus,</hi> is evidence of the thing <hi>de facto.</hi> Besides which, that it was the Real <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> they think made probable by the Opinion of <hi>Jesus Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac,</hi> Ecclus. 46. 19, 20. who saith of him, That <hi>after his death he prophesied and shewed the King his end:</hi> which also is likely from the Circumstance of the Woman's Astonishment, and crying out when she saw him, intimating her surprize, in that the Power of God had over-ruled her Inchantments, and sent another than she expected. And they conceive there
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53288:133"/>

But yet her Attempts and Endeavours to raise her Familiar Spirit, (though at that time over-ruled) are Arguments that it had been her custom to do so. Or if it were as the other side concludes, the Devil in the shape of <hi>Samuel,</hi> her Diabolical Confederacy is yet more palpable.</p>
                  <p>I Have now done with <hi>Scot,</hi> and his presumptions; and am apt to fancy, that there is nothing more needful to be said to discover the Discoverer. But there is an Author infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more valuable, that calls me to consider him, 'Tis the great <hi>Episcopius;</hi> who, though he grants a sort of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Magicians,</hi> yet denies Compacts. His Authority, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, is considerable, but let us weigh his Reasons.</p>
                  <p>His First is, That there is no Example of any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Nations that were in such Compact; whence he would infer, That there are no express Covenants with Evil Spirits in particular Instances. But I think that both Proposition and Consequence are very obnoxious. For that there were Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that did actually worship the Devil, is plain enough in the Records of Ancient Times; and some so read that place in the <hi>Psalms, The Gods of the Heathen are Devils;</hi> and Satan we know is call'd the <hi>God of this World.</hi> Yea, our Author himself confesseth, that the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> were so strictly prohibited Witchcraft, and all transaction with Evil Spirits, because of their proneness to worship them. But what need more? There are at this day that pay Sacrifice, and all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Homage to the <hi>Wicked One</hi> in a visible Appearance; and 'tis well known to those of our own that traffick, and reside in those Parts, that the <hi>Caribbians</hi> worship the Devil under the name of <hi>Maboya,</hi> who frequently shews himself, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts with them; the like Travellers relate concerning divers
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53288:134"/>
other parts of the <hi>Barbarous Indies:</hi> and 'tis confidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by sober intelligent Men that have visited those places, that most of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and some other <hi>Northern</hi> People, are <hi>Witches.</hi> So that 'tis plain that there are National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies with Devils; or, if there were none, I see not how it could be inferr'd thence, that there are no Personal Ones, no more, than that there were never any <hi>Daemoniacks,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we know of no Nation universally possessed; nor any <hi>Lunaticks</hi> in the World, because there is no Country of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. But our Author reasons again,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) To this purpose; <q>That the profligate Persons, who are obnoxious to those gross Temptations; are fast enough before; and therefore such a Covenant were needless, and of no avail to the Tempters Projects.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Objection I have answered already, in my Remarques upon the IX <hi>Prejudice,</hi> and say again here, that if the Designs of those Evil Spirits were only in general to secure wicked Men to the Dark Kingdom, it might better be pretended that we cannot give a Reason for their Temptations and Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in this kind; But it being likely, as I have conjectur'd, that each of those Infernal Tempters hath a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in those he hath seduced and secured by such Compacts, their respective Pride, and tyrannical desire of Slaves, may reasonably be thought to ingage them in such Attempts, in which their so peculiar Interest is concerned.</p>
                  <p>But I add what is more direct, <hi>viz.</hi> That such desperate Sinners are made more safe to the Infernal Kingdom at large, by such Hellish Covenants and Combinations; since thereby they confirm and harden their Hearts against God, and put themselves at greater distance from his Grace, and his Spirit; give the deepest Wound to Conscience, and resolve to wink against all its Light and Convictions; throw a Bar in the way of their own Repentance, and lay a Train for Despair of Mercy: These certainly are sure ways of being undone, and the Devil we see, hath great Interest in a Project, the success of which is so attended. And we know he made the Assault <hi>de facto</hi> upon our Saviour, when he tempted him to fall down and worship. So that this Learned Author hath but little Reason to object,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:53288:134"/>
(3.) That to endeavour such an express Covenant, is contrary to the Interests of Hell; which indeed are this way so mightily promoted. And whereas he suggests, that a thing so horrid is like to startle Conscience, and awaken the Soul to Consideration and Repentance; I Reply, That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed considering Man in the general, as a Rational Creature, acted by Hopes and Fears, and sensible of the Joys and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of another World, one would expect it should be so: But then, if we cast our Eyes upon Man as really he is, sunk into Flesh, and present Sense; darkned in his Mind, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his Imagination; blinded by his Passions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted by Sin and Folly; hardned by evil Customs, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the Torrent of his Inclinations and Desires; I say, looking on Man in this miserable state of Evil, 'tis not incredible that he should be prevailed upon by the Tempter, and his own Lusts, to act at a wonderful rate of Madness, and continue unconcerned and stupid in it; intent upon his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Satisfactions, without sense or consideration of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and danger of his Condition; and by this, I am fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished also to meet a fourth Objection of our Author's, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) That 'tis not probable upon the Witches part, that they will be so desperate to renounce God, and eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and so, everlastingly undo their Bodies and Souls, for a short and trivial Interest; which way of arguing will only infer, That Mankind acts sometimes at prodigious degrees of brutishness; and actually we see it in the Instances of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. There is not a Lust so base and so contemptible, but there are those continually in our Eyes, that feed it with the Sacrifice of their Eternity, and their Souls; and daring Sinners rush upon the blackest Vilanies, with so little remorse or sense, as if it were their design to prove, that they have nothing left them of that whereby they are Men. So that nought can be inferr'd from this Argument, but that Humane Nature is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibly degenerate; and the vileness and stupidity of Men is really so great, that things are customary and common, which one could not think possible, if he did not hourly see them. And if Men of Liberal Education, and Acute Reason, that know their Duty and their Danger, are driven by their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53288:135"/>
with their Eyes open, upon the most fatal Rocks, and make all the haste they can from their God and their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; If such can barter their Souls for Trifles, and sell Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting for a Moment; sport upon the brink of a Precipice, and contemn all the Terrors of the future dreadful day; why should it then be incredible, that a brutish vile Person, sotted with Ignorance, and drunk with Malice, mindless of God, and unconcerned about a future Being, should be perswaded to accept of present delightful Gratifications, without duly weighing the desperate Condition?</p>
                  <p>Thus, I suppose, I have answered also the Arguments of this Great Man, against the Covenants of Witches; and since a Person of such Sagacity and Learning, hath no more to say against what I defend, and another of the same Character, the ingenious Dr. <hi>Parker,</hi> who directed me to him, reckons these the strongest things that can be objected in the Case, I begin to arrive to an higher degree of Confidence in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and am almost inclined to fancy, that there is little more to be said to purpose, which may not by the improvement of my <hi>Considerations</hi> be easily answered; and I am yet the more fortified in my Conceit, because I have, since the former Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Book, sent to several Acute and Ingenious Persons of my Acquaintance, to beg their Objections, or those they have heard from others, against my Discourse or Relations that I might consider them in this: But I can procure none save only those few I have now discuss'd, most of my Friends telling me, That they have not met with any that need or deserve my notice.</p>
                  <p>By all this it is evident, that there were <hi>Witches</hi> in Ancient Times under the Dispensation of the Law; and that there were such in the Times of the <hi>Gospel</hi> also, will not be much more difficult to make good. I had a late occasion to say something about this, in a Letter to a Person of the highest Honour, from which I shall now borrow some things to my present purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:53288:135"/>
I Say then, (II.) That there were Compacts with Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in those times also, is me-thinks intimated strongly, in that saying of the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning our Saviour, <hi>That he cast out Devils by Beelzebub.</hi> In his return to which, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not the Supposition or possibility of the thing in general; but clears himself by an appeal to the Actions of their own Children, whom they would not tax so severely. And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not very well understand why those times should be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd from Witchcraft and Diabolical Compacts, more than they were from Possessions, which we know were then more frequent (for ought appears to the contrary) than ever they were before or since. But besides this, There are Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons plain enough in the Apostle's Writings of the Being of Sorcery and Witchcraft. St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons Witchcraft next Idolatry, in his Catalogue of the Works of the Flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 20. and the Sorcerers are again joyn'd with Idolaters, in that sad Denunciation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. And a little after, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15. they are reckon'd again among Idolaters, Murderers, and those others that are without. And me-thinks the Story of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>non Magus,</hi> and his Diabolical Oppositions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel in its beginnings, should afford clear Conviction. To all which I add this more general Consideration,</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) That though the New Testament had mention'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Matter, yet its silence in such Cases is not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative. Our Saviour spake as he had occasion, and the thousandth part of what he did or said is not Recorded; as one of his Historians intimates. He said nothing of those large unknown Tracts of <hi>America;</hi> nor gave any intimations of as much as the Existence of that Numerous People; much less did he leave Instructions about their Conversion. He gives no account of the Affairs and State of the other World, but only that general one, of the Happiness of some, and the Misery of others. He made no discovery of the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia</hi> of Art or Nature; no, not of those, whereby the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Gospel might have been much advanced, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Printing,</hi> and the <hi>Magnet;</hi> and yet no one useth his silence in these. Instances, as an Argument against the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things, which are evident Objects of Sense. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53288:136"/>
the omission of some of these Particulars is pretty strange, and unaccountable, and concludes our ignorance of the Reasons and Menages of Providence; but I suppose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else. I thought, I needed here to have said no more, but I consider, in consequence of this Objection, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; That as <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> drove the Devil from his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and his Altars, (as is clear in the Cessation of Oracles, which dwindled away, and at last grew silent shortly upon his appearance) so in like manner, 'tis said, that he banisht him from his lesser holds in Sorcerers and Witches; which Argument is peccant, both in what it affirms, and in what it would infer. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) The coming of the <hi>H. Jesus</hi> did not expel the Devil from all the greater Places of his Residence and Worship; for a considerable part of barbarous Mankind do him publick solemn Homage to this day: So that the very Foundation of the Pretence fails, and the Consequence without any more adoe comes to nothing. And yet besides,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) If there be any credit to be given to Ecclesiastick Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, there were Persons possessed with Devils some Ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ, whom the Disciples cast out by Prayer, and the Invocation of his Name: So that Satan was not driven from his lesser Habitations, as soon as he was forced from his more famous Abodes. And I see no reason</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Why, Though Divine Providence would not allow him publickly to abuse the Nations, whom he had designed in a short time after for Subjects of his Son's Kingdom, and to stand up in the Face of Religion in an open affront to the Divinity that planted it, to the great hindrance of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the Gospel, and discouragement of Christian Hopes; I say, Though Providence would not allow this height of insolent Opposition; yet I see not why we may not grant, that God however permitted the Devil to sneak into some private skulking Holes, and to trade with the particular more devoted Vassals of his wicked Empire: As we know that when our Saviour had chased him from the Man that was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, he permitted his Retreat into the Herd of Swine. And I might add</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53288:136"/>
(4.) That 'tis but a bad way of arguing, to set up fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied Congruities against plain Experience, as is evidently done by those Arguers, who, because they think that Christ chased the Devil from all his high Places of Worship when he came; that 'tis therefore fit he should have forced him from all his other less notorious Haunts: and upon the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a decency, which they frame, conclude a Fact, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the greatest Evidence of which the thing is capable. And once more</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) The consequence of this Imagined <hi>Decorum,</hi> if it be pursued, would be this, that Satan should now be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all the Ways and Tricks of Cozenage, whereby he abuseth us; and Mankind since the coming of Christ, should have been secure from all his Temptations; for there is a greater congruity in believing, that, when he was forced from his haunts in Temples and publick Places, he should be put al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so from those nearer ones, about us and within us in his dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temptations of universal Mankind; Then, that upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishing those, he should be made to leave all profest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and Correspondence with those profligate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whose vileness had fitted them for such Company.</p>
                  <p>So that these Reasoners are very fair for the denial of all Internal Diabolical Temptations. And because I durst not trust them, I'le crave leave here to add something concerning those.</p>
                  <p>In order to which, that I may obtain the favour of those wary Persons, who are so coy and shy of their assent, I grant; That Men frequently, out of a desire to excuse themselves, lay their own guilt upon the Devil, and charge him with things of which in carnest he is not guilty: For, I doubt not but every Wicked Man hath Devil enough in his own Nature to prompt him to Evil, and needs not another Tempter to incite him. But yet, that Satan endeavours to further our wickedness, and our ruin by his Inticements, and <hi>goes up and down seeking whom he may devour,</hi> is too evident in the Holy Oracles, to need my Endeavours particularly to make it good; Only those diffident Men cannot perhaps apprehend the manner of the Operation, and from thence are tempted to believe, that there is really no such thing. Therefore I
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53288:137"/>
judge it requisite to explain this, and 'tis not unsutable to my general Subject.</p>
                  <p>In order to it I consider, That Sense is primarily caused by Motion in the Organs, which by continuity is conveyed to the Brain, where Sensation is immediately performed; and it is nothing else, but a Notice excited in the Soul by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse of an External Object; thus it is in simple outward Sense: But Imagination, though caused immediately by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Motion also, yet it differs from the external Senses in this, That 'tis not from an Impress directly from without, but the Prime and Original Motion is from within our selves: Thus the Soul it self sometimes strikes upon those Strings, whose Motion begets such and such Phantasms; other-while, the loose Spirits wandring up and down in the Brain, casually hit upon such Filements and Strings, whose Motion excites a Conception, which we call a Fancy or Imagination; and if the Evidence of the outward Senses be shut out by Sleep or Melancholly, in either case, we believe those Representations to be real and external Transactions, when they are only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Heads; Thus it is in <hi>Enthusiasms</hi> and <hi>Dreams.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these Causes of the Motions which stir Imagination, there is little doubt, but that Spirits, Good or Bad, can so move the Instruments of Sense in the Brain, as to awake such Imaginations as they have a mind to excite; and the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation having a mighty influence upon the Affections, and they upon the Will and external Actions, 'tis very easie to conceive how Good Angels may stir us up to Religion and Vertue, and the Evil Ones tempt us to Lewdness and Vice, <hi>viz.</hi> by Representments that they make upon the Stage of Imagination, which invite our Affections, and allure, though they cannot compel our Wills.</p>
                  <p>This I take to be an intelligible account of Temptations, and also of Angelical Incouragements; and perhaps this is the only way of immediate Influence that the Spirits of the other World have upon us. And by it, 'tis easie to give an account of <hi>Dreams,</hi> both <hi>Monitory</hi> and <hi>Temperamental, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasms, Fanatick Extasies,</hi> and the like, as I suggested.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:53288:137"/>
This may suffice for an Answer to the first Pretence, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>silence</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> in this Matter. I come to examine the other, That</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>(2.)</hi> MIracles are ceast, thefore the presumed Actions of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, are Tales and Illusions.]</p>
                  <p>To make a due return to this, we must consider a great and difficult Problem, which is, <hi>What is a Real Miracle?</hi> And for answer to this weighty Question, I think,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) That it is not the strangeness, or unaccountableness of the thing done simply, from whence we are to conclude a Miracle. For then we are so to account of all the <hi>Magnalia</hi> of Nature, and all the Mysteries of those honest Arts which we do not understand.</p>
                  <p>Nor (2.) is this the <hi>Criterion</hi> of a Miracle, That it is an Action or Event beyond all Natural Powers; for we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Extent and Bounds of Nature's Sphere and Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities: And if this were the character and essential Mark of a Miracle, we could not know what was so; except we could determine the extent of <hi>natural causalities,</hi> and fix their Bounds, and be able to say to Nature, <hi>Hitherto canst thou go and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> And he that makes this his measure whereby to judge a Miracle, is himself the greatest Miracle of Knowledge or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty. Besides, though an Effect may transcend really all the Powers of meer Nature; yet there is a world of Spirits that must be taken into our Account. And as to them also I say,</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Every thing is not a Miracle that is done by Agents Supernatural. There is no doubt but that Evil Spirits can make wonderful Combinations of Natural Causes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps perform many things immediately which are prodigious, and beyond the longest Line of Nature: but yet these are not therefore to be called Miracles; for, they are <hi>Saecred Wonders,</hi> and suppose the <hi>Power</hi> to be <hi>Divine.</hi> But how shall the Power be known to be so, when we so little understand the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and extent of the Abilities of Lower Agents? The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Question will discover the <hi>Criterion</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:53288:138"/>
which must be supposed to have all the former Particulars; <hi>viz.</hi> They are <hi>unaccountable, beyond the Powers of meer Nature,</hi> and <hi>done by Agents Supernatural;</hi> And to these must be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) That they have peculiar Circumstances that speak them of a Divine Original. Their mediate Authors declare them to be so, and they are always Persons of Simplicity, Truth, and Holiness, void of Ambition, and all secular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs: They seldom use Ceremonies, or Natural Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and yet surmount all the Activities of known Nature: They work those wonders, not to raise admiration, or out of the vanity to be talkt of; but to seal and confirm some Divine Doctrine or Commission, in which the Good and Happiness of the World is concern'd, I say, by such Circumstances as these, Wonderful Actions are known to be from a Divine Cause; and that makes and distinguisheth a Miracle.</p>
                  <p>And thus I am prepared for an Answer to the Objection, to which I make this brief return, That though <hi>Witches</hi> by their Confederate Spirit do those odd and astonishing things we believe of them; yet are they no Miracles, there being evidence enough from the badness of their Lives, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Ceremonies of their Performances, from their malice and mischievous Designs, that the <hi>Power</hi> that works, and the end for which those things are done, is not Divine but Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical. And by singular Providence they are not ordinarily permitted, as much as to pretend to any new Sacred Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in Matters of Religion, or to act any thing for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Doctrinal Impostures. So that whether <hi>Miracles</hi> are ceased or not, these are none. And that such Miracles as are only strange and unaccountable Performances, above the common Methods of Art or Nature, are not ceas'd, we have a late great evidence in the famous <hi>GREATREX;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom it will not be impertinent to add the following account, which I had in a Letter from Dr. <hi>G. R.</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>D.</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Person of singular Piery and Vertue, and a great-Philosopher. He is pleased thus to write.</p>

He undergoes various Censures here, some take him to be a <hi>Conjurer,</hi> and some an <hi>Impostor,</hi> but others again adore him as an <hi>Apostle.</hi> I confess, I think the Man is free from all Design, of a very agreeable Conversation, not addicted to any Vice, nor to any Sect or Party; but is, I believe, a sincere <hi>Protestant.</hi> I was three weeks together with him at my Lord <hi>Conwayes,</hi> and saw him, I think, lay his hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a thousand Persons; and really there is something in it more than ordinary: but I am convinc'd it is not miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. I have seen pains strangely fly before his hand till he hath chased them out of the Body, Dimness cleared, and Deafness cured by his Touch; twenty Persons at several times in Fits of the <hi>Falling-Sickness,</hi> were in two or three minutes brought to themselves, so as to tell where their pain was; and then he hath pursued it till he hath driven it out at some extream part: <hi>Running Sores</hi> of the <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Evil</hi> dried up, and <hi>Kernels</hi> brought to a <hi>Suppuration</hi> by his hand: grievous <hi>Sores</hi> of many months date, in few dayes healed: <hi>Obstructions,</hi> and <hi>Stoppings</hi> removed; <hi>Cancerous Knots</hi> in the Breast dissolved, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But yet I have many Reasons to perswade me, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this is Miraculous; He pretends not to give Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to any Doctrine; the manner of his Operation speaks it to be natural; the Cure seldom succeeds without reiterated Touches, his Patients often relapse, he fails fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he can do nothing where there is any decay in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and many Distempers are not at all obedient to his Touch. So that I confess, I refer all his Vertue to his particular Temper and Complexion, and I take his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to be a kind of <hi>Elixir,</hi> and <hi>Vniversal Ferment;</hi> and that he cures (as Dr. <hi>M.</hi> expresseth it) by a <hi>Sanative Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:53288:139"/>
This, Sir, was the first Account of the <hi>Healer</hi> I had from that Reverend Person, which with me signifies more than the Attestations of multitudes of ordinary Reporters; and no doubt but it will do so likewise with all that know that excellent Bishop's singular Integrity and Judgment. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, upon my inquiry into some other Particulars about this Matter, I received these further Informations from the same Learned Hand.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>As for M.G. what Opinion he hath of his own Gift, and how he came to know it? I Answer, He hath a different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of it from yours and mine, and certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it to be an <hi>immediate Gift</hi> from Heaven; and 'tis no wonder, for he is no Philosopher. And you will wonder less, when you hear how he came to know it, as I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten received it from his own Mouth. About three or four years ago he had a strong impulse upon his Spirit, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pursued him from what-ever he was about, at his Business, or Devotion, alone, or in company, that spake to him by this inward Suggestion, [<hi>I have given thee the Gift of Curing the Evil.</hi>] This Suggestion was so importunate, that he complained to his Wife, That he thought he was haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: She apprehending it as an extravagancy of Fancy; but he told her he believed there was more in it, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to try. He did not long want opportunity. There was a Neighbour of his grievously afflicted with the <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Evil,</hi> He stroked her, and the Effect fucceeded. And for about a twelve-month together he pretended to cure no other Distemper. But then the <hi>Ague</hi> being very rife in the Neighbourhood, the same Impulse after the same manner spoke within him, [<hi>I have given thee the Gift of curing the Ague;</hi>] and meeting with Persons in their Fits, and taking them by the Hand, or laying his Hand upon their Breasts, the <hi>Ague</hi> left them. About half a year after the accustomed Impulfe became more general, and suggested to him, [<hi>I have given thee the Gift of Healing;</hi>] and then he attempted all Diseases indifferently. And though he saw strange
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53288:139"/>
Effects, yet he doubted whether the Cause were any Vertue that came from him, or the Peoples fancy: To convince him of his incredulity, as he lay one night in Bed, one of his Hands was struck dead, and the usual Impulse suggested to him to make tryal of his Vertue upon himself, which he did, stroking it with his other hand, and then it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately returned to its former liveliness. This was repeated two or three Nights (or Mornings) together.</p>
                     <p>This is his Relation, and I believe there is so much since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Person, that he tells no more than what he believes to be true. To say that this Impulse too was but a result of his temper, and that it is but like Dreams that are usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to Mens Constitutions, doth not seem a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account of the <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> Perhaps some may think it more likely, that some <hi>Genius</hi> who understood the Sana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Vertue of his Complexion, and the readiness of his Mind, and ability of his Body to put it in execution, might give him notice of that which otherwise might have been for ever unknown to him, and so the <hi>Gift of God</hi> had been to no purpose.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This is my Learned and Reverend Friend's Relation: I shall say no more about it but this, That many of those Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, have been since critically inspected and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by several sagacious and wary Persons of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and other Very Learned and Judicious Men, whom we may suppose as unlikely to be deceived by a contrived Imposture, as any others whatsoever.</p>

                  <p>I Have now done with my <hi>Considerations</hi> on this Subject, which I could wish were less seasonable and necessary than I have reason to believe they are: But, alas! we live in an Age wherein <hi>Atheism</hi> is begun in <hi>Sadducism:</hi> And those that dare not bluntly say, <hi>There is no God,</hi> content themselves, for a fair step and Introduction, to deny there are <hi>Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Witches.</hi> Which sort of <hi>Insidels,</hi> though they are not so ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary among the meer Vulgar, yet are they numerous in a little higher rank of Understandings. And those that know any thing of the World, know, That most of the small Pretenders to <hi>Wit,</hi> are generally deriders of the belief of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions:</hi> Which were it only a slight, or meer speculative Mistake, I should not trouble my self or them about it. But I fear this Error hath a Core in it worse than Heresie: And therefore how little soever I care what Men believe or teach in Matters of Opinion, I think I have reason to be concern'd in an Affair, that toucheth so near upon the greatest Interests of Religion. And really I am astonisht sometimes to think into what a kind of Age we are fallen, in which some of the greatest Impieties are accounted but <hi>Buggs,</hi> and <hi>terrible Names, Invisible Tittles, Piccadillo's,</hi> or <hi>Chimera's.</hi> The sad and greatest Instances, are <hi>Secriledge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crast.</hi> For the two former, there are a sort of Men (that are far from being profest Enemies to Religion) who, I do not know, whether they own any such Vices. We find no mention of them in their most particular Confessions, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>r have I observed them in those Sermons that have contained the largest Catalogues of the Sins of our Age and Nation. <hi>'Twere dangerous to speak of them as Sins, for fean who should be found guilty.</hi> But my Business at present is not with these, but the other, <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> which I am sure was a Sin of Elder Times; and how comes it about that our Age, which so much out-does them in all other kinds of Wickedness, should be wholly innocent in this? That there <hi>may be Witches</hi> and <hi>Apparitions</hi> in our days, notwithstanding the Objections
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53288:140"/>
of the <hi>Modern Sadduce,</hi> I believe I have made appear in the foregoing <hi>Considerations;</hi> in which I did not primarily intend direct <hi>Proof,</hi> but <hi>Defence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Against which if it should be Objected, That I have for the most part used only Supposals, and conjectural Things in the vindication of the Common Belief, and speak with no point-blank assurance, in my particular Answers, as I do in the General Conclusion. I need only say, That the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I defend is Matter of Fact, which the Disbelievers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne by alledging, That <hi>it cannot be;</hi> or, <hi>it is not likely:</hi> In return to which, if I shew, how those things may be, and probable, notwithstanding their Allegations, though I say not down-right that they are in the particular way I offer; yet 'tis enough for the Design of Defence, though not for that of Proof: for when one saith a thing <hi>cannot be,</hi> and I tell him how possibly it may, though I hit not the just manner of it; I yet defeat the Objection against it, and make way for the evidence of the thing <hi>de Facto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But after all this, I must confess there is one Argument against me, which is not to be dealt with, <hi>viz.</hi> A mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence grounded upon nothing, that <hi>swaggers,</hi> and <hi>Huffs,</hi> and <hi>swears</hi> there are no <hi>Witches.</hi> For such Philosophers as these, let them enjoy the Opinion of their own Superlative Judgments, and enter me in the first rank of Fools for credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my Senses, and those of all the World, before their sworn Dictates. If they will believe in <hi>Scott, Habbs,</hi> and <hi>Osborne,</hi> and think them more infallible than the Sacred Oracles, the History of all Ages, and the full experience of our own, who can help it? They must not be contradicted, and they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved not to be perswaded. For this sort of Men, I never go about to convince them of any thing. If I can avoid it, I throw nothing before them, lest they should turn again and rend me. Their Opinions came into their Heads by chance, when their little Reasons had no notice of their entrance, and they must be let alone to go out again of themselves the fame way they entred. Therefore not to make much noise to disturb these <hi>infallible Huffers,</hi> (and they cannot hear a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53288:141"/>
for their own) I softly step along, leaving them to believe what they think.</p>
                  <p>I have only this further to add, That I appear thus much concerned for the justification of the belief of <hi>Witches,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it suggests palpable and current Evidence of our <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</hi> For though we have reasonable Evidence enough from the Attributes of God, the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Providence, and the Nature of our Souls, to convince any, but those who will stupidly believe, that they shall die like Beasts, that they may live like them: Yet the Philosophick Arguments that are produced for the Article, though very cogent, are many of them speculative and deep, requiring so great an attention and sagacity, that they take no hold upon the whifling Spirits that are not used to Consider, nor upon the common fort that cannot reach such Heights: But they are both best convinced by the Proofs that come nearest the Sense, which indeed strike our Minds fullest, and leave the most lasting Impressions; whereas high Speculations being more thin and subtile, easily slide off, even from Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings that are most capable to receive them. This is one of the Main Reasons that engaged me on this Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it affords considerable Evidence of that great Truth, which every Christian ought to be solicitous to have made good.</p>
                  <p>And really if we compute like Men, and do not suffer our selves to be abused by the Flatteries of Sense, and the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Gayeties that steal us away from God, and from our selves, there is nothing can render the thoughts of this odd Life tollerable, but the expectation of another: And Wise Men have said, That they would not have a Moment, if they thought they were not to live again. This perhaps some may take to be the discontented Paradox of a Melancholick, vext and mean Condition, that is pinched by the straightness of Fortune, and envies the Heights of others Felicity and Grandeur; But by that time those that judge so, have spent the Heats of Frolick Youth, and have past over the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stages of Vanity; when they come to sit down, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53288:141"/>
make sober reflections upon their Pleasures and Pursuits, and sum up the Accompt of all that is with them, and before them, I doubt not but their considering Thoughts will make <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Conclusion, and find, that 'tis but a misery to live, if we were to live for nothing else. So that if the content of the present Life were all I were to have for the hopes of Immortality, I should even upon that account be very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to believe that I was mortal: For certainly the Pleasures that result from the Thoughts of another World in those, that not only see it painted in their Imaginations, but feel it begun in their Souls, are as far beyond all the titillations of Sense, as a real lasting Happiness is beyond the delusive Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a Dream. And therefore they that think to secure the injoyment of their Pleasures, by the infamy of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in the overthrow of our future Hopes, indeavour to damm up the Fountain of the fullest and cleanest Delights; and seek for limped Waters in the Sinks and Puddles of the Streets.</p>
                  <p>But this would afford Matter for another Discourse, into which I must not digress, but here make an end of this.</p>

               <p>WE parted from <hi>Peru,</hi> with design to pass to <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan</hi> by the South Sea: and after we had been long driven up and down by contrary Winds, and wandred in the greatest Wilderness of Waters in the World, without the least hopes of making any Land, in that immense undiscover'd Abyss, that was beyond both the <hi>Old</hi> World, and the <hi>New;</hi> it pleased God to bring us into the Harbour of a most <hi>Angelical</hi> Country, that lay hid in the greatest Ocean in the Universe.</p>
               <p>We found there a People of singular Goodness and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who received us with most affectionate kindness, and provided for us with a Parent-like Care and Indulgence: We were lodg'd in a fair Pile of Buildings, call'd the <hi>Strangers House,</hi> appointed for such Occasions, and there we had all things, both for our Whole and Sick, that belonged to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Mercy. The <hi>Governour</hi> of that House (a most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging and benign Person) acquainted some of our number with divers remarkable Matters concerning the Kingdom of <hi>BENSALEM</hi> (so it was call'd); Particularly, with the strange entrance and beginning of Christianity there, and the excellent Foundation of <hi>SOLOMON</hi>'s House, a <hi>Royal</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53288:144"/>
                  <hi>Society</hi> erected for Enquiries into the Works of God: After we had been there a little while, one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of that House came to the Town where we were. He entred in State; and within few days having had notice of us, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that one of our Company should be brought to him: The rest chose me to wait on the great Man, which I did, and was receiv'd by him with much goodness; He gave me a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of the Foundation of <hi>Solomon's House,</hi> and the State of <hi>Philosophy</hi> in <hi>Bensalem,</hi> granting permission it should be declared to the World. Accordingly it was publisht by <hi>Verulamius,</hi> in his History call'd the <hi>NEW ATLANTIS;</hi> and thus far his Account went.</p>
               <p>But now I shall enter upon a Relation of things, of which yet there hath been no News from <hi>Bensalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the third day after I had been with the Father of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's House,</hi> a Servant came to me from the Governor of ours, just as we had dined, to desire me to spend the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon with him: I received the invitation with a chearful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and went immediately with the Officer to attend his Lordship; He led me through the Garden of our House into another, the largest and most beautiful I ever saw; It was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compast with a lofty Stone-Wall; The Stone were blue, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally streakt with green. It had Mounts, Grotto's, and Summer-Houses, very pleasant and magnificent; The Walks were large, planted with Ever-greens, and the Fruit-Trees (of all sorts that we have, and many that we have not) set in the old <hi>Quincuncial, Lozenge</hi> Figures, after the manner of the ancient hanging Gardens of <hi>Babylon;</hi> It had Wildernesses, Ponds, Aviaries, and all things else that can render such a place agreeable. I could have dwelt in this Paradise; but the Servant led me on into a square Cloyster'd Court, having hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Buildings on all sides, fenced on the South with a tall Grove of Cedar: The Cloysters were paved with red and green Marble, and supported with pollisht Pillars of a speck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Stone, very clear and shining; Hence we went into a fair spacious Hall adorned with large Maps of all sorts; here were some Servants decently clad, they were playing at Chess; as soon as I entred, they arose, and saluted me very civilly with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53288:144"/>
a modest sweetness in their looks, that seem'd very obliging. My Guide conducted me up Stairs into a noble Gallery, hung with most excellent Pictures of Famous Men, and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; and, at which I was much surprized, of some that I had seen. He left me here, to give the Governor notice that I was come; and presently I saw him enter, with a mild chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, mixt with a manly gravity in his Countenance: He had on a long Robe of Purple Silk, and a kind of Turban on his Head of the same colour, which had a Star of Gold wrought on it, worn just before: He imbraced me with much affection, expressing great satisfaction in the opportunity of entertaining me alone: He enquired after the welfare of our People, and whether we wanted any Accommodation, either for our Whole or Sick; I bowed with a low reverence, and answer'd, That we wanted nothing, but an occasion to speak our acknowledgments of the Bounty and Humanity of that blessed Place; and particularly to express how much we were oblidg'd to his Lordships generous favours: He replyed smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, That Complements were not in use in <hi>Bensalem;</hi> and taking me by the hand, he led me into an handsome square Chamber wainscotted with Cedar, which fill'd the Room with a very grateful odour: It was richly painted, gilt, and full of Inscriptions in Letters of Gold: He sate him down on a Couch of Green Velvet, and made me take my place by him.</p>
               <p>After some more particular inquiry into the condition of our Sick, of whom I gave him an account, he told me, That the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Solomon's House</hi> commanded him to acquaint me with the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>Bensalem,</hi> as himself had with the condition of <hi>Philosophy</hi> there; and that he would have done this too, but that the urgent Business of the Publick State, which lay upon him, would not afford him time; I rose up at these words, and answered with a low submission, That I knew not in what terms to express my sense of the Father's Condescention and Goodness; and that his excellent Relation of the state of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and its ways of improvement in that Kingdom, had inflamed me with desire to know what I might, concerning the Affairs of its <hi>Religion,</hi> since the so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous plantation of Christianity in it; And particularly, <hi>Whether it had kept its ancient Purity,</hi> and <hi>Simplicity in that</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53288:145"/>
                  <hi>Realm;</hi> which was lost in most other places? This Question, replyed He, (making me sit down again by him) I shall fully answer in the things I have to say to you; and having paused a little to settle his Thoughts, he began his <hi>Narrative</hi> in this manner.</p>
               <p>AFTER the Conversion of this Land by the <hi>Evangelism</hi> of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> (of which you have heard) Religion underwent some Revolutions, that I shall not mention; But take my ground from the <hi>last,</hi> which hapned no very long time since: For the understanding which, you must know, That upon the South-West of this place, in the unknown Ocean also, lies an Island, famous for the rise it gave to a very spreading Sect in Religion: From this unfortunate Country, came certain Zealous Persons hither, that pretended to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary <hi>Illuminations,</hi> and to more <hi>purity, strictness,</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality,</hi> than other Christians; They taught, That <hi>our Rites</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> were <hi>Superstitious</hi> and <hi>Anti-christian;</hi> That we wanted <hi>Pure Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Gospel-Worship;</hi> That our <hi>Good Works;</hi> and Christian <hi>Vertues,</hi> were nothing worth; That the <hi>best</hi> of our People were but <hi>Formalists</hi> and meer <hi>moral</hi> Men; That our <hi>Priests</hi> were <hi>uninlightned,</hi> strangers to the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> and that there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a <hi>thorow Godly Reformation</hi> of our <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Men at first were only gazed upon by our People, as strange Persons; But at length, by the vehemence of their Zeal, and glory of their Pretences, they began to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression on some, who had more <hi>Affection</hi> than <hi>Judgment:</hi> By <hi>them,</hi> and the continuance of their own restless Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, they wrought upon others; And in process of time and endeavour, through the secret Judgment and Permission of God, prevail'd so far, that the great Body of the People, especially of those that were of <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, was leaven'd (more or less) with their Spirit and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
               <p>Here he stopt a little, and then said; 'Tis wonderful to consider how some Ages and Times are dispos'd to changes; some to one sort of alteration, and some to another: In <hi>this</hi>

                  </gap>ssest they were with the conceit of the divineness and necessity of their <hi>Fancies</hi> and <hi>Models,</hi> that they despised and vilified the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Government, and <hi>Governors,</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently assaulted our most excellent <hi>SALOMONA,</hi> the King of this Realm, with continual Petitions and Addresses, to establish them by Law, and to change the whole Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion, in complyance with <hi>their</hi> Imaginations: But he was a Wise and Religious Prince; He saw the folly and danger of such Alterations, and endeavour'd, by all the ways of Lenity and Goodness, to allay the heat of their unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Prosecutions: But <hi>they</hi> being the more emboldned by this <hi>moderate</hi> Course, and <hi>provoked</hi> by the little inclination the good King shew'd to their <hi>New Models,</hi> broke out, after some less violent struglings, into down-right <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many Revolutions, too long to be mention'd <hi>now,</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded so far at last, that the Pious Prince was depos'd and murder'd; the Government usurp'd by the prevailing Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants: And, not to mention the disorders of the <hi>Civil</hi> State that follow'd, the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> was most miserable. For <hi>now,</hi> all the Sects that have a Name in History in any part of the known World, started up in this Church, as if they had all been transplanted hither: They arose as it were out of the Earth, which seem'd to bring forth nothing but <hi>Monsters,</hi> full grown at their Birth, with Weapons in their hands ready for Battel; and accordingly they fell one upon another with strange rage and fierceness. For having torn and destroyed the Ancient Doctrine and Government, every one contended to set up its <hi>own,</hi> and to have its beloved Opinions and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53288:146"/>
entertain'd and worship'd, as the infallible Truths and Ways of God: So that all places were fill'd with <hi>New Lights,</hi> and those Lights were so many <hi>Wild-Fires,</hi> that put all into <hi>Combustion.</hi> We saw nothing of Religion but glaring Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, and Contention about the Shells and Shadows of it. It seem'd to run out wholly into Chaff and Straw; into <hi>Disputes</hi> and <hi>Vain Notions;</hi> which were not only unprofitable, but destructive to Charity, Peace, and every pious Practice. All was Controversie and Dissention, full of Animosity and Bitterness; For though they <hi>agreed</hi> in some common Falshoods and Follies, yet <hi>that</hi> made no <hi>Vnion;</hi> every dissent in smallest Matters was ground enough for a Quarrel and Separation. But <hi>these</hi> things were <hi>common</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>All hated the <hi>former Constitutions;</hi> All cried up their own Clan, as the <hi>only Saints,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> All vilified <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> as <hi>Carnal,</hi> and Incompetent, and an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the things of the Spirit: All had confident, false, and perverse Notions of the Divine <hi>Attributes,</hi> and Counsels; All decry'd <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Morality</hi> as a dull thing, that was nothing in the account of God. All fill'd their Discourses with the words of <hi>Light, Faith, Grace,</hi> the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and all talk'd in set <hi>Phrases,</hi> phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully and ignorantly about them: All pretended to great <hi>Heights</hi> in <hi>Knowledge,</hi> though that consisted in nothing but an ability to repeat those Phrases of their Sect, like Parrots: All talk'd of their extraordinary <hi>communion</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> their <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Experiences, Illuminations,</hi> and <hi>Discoveries;</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all demean'd themselves with much sawciness and irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards God, and contempt of those that were not of the same phantastical Fashion: All were <hi>zealous</hi> in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>set</hi> of <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Opinions;</hi> and all bitterly oppos'd and vilified every different Judgment. <hi>These</hi> are some of the main things that made up the <hi>common</hi> Nature of the Parties: In <hi>particulars,</hi> as I have said, they were infinitely at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>While things were in this condition, some of our Missio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries in Forreign Parts returned, and among the other Books, and Rarities from the World, they brought the Works of some of your Episcopal Divines, and other Learned Men, particularly those of <hi>Hammondus, Taylorus, Grotius,</hi> &amp;c. Such</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53288:146"/>
of them that were written in English, they translated into Latin, the rather because they judg'd those Discourses very seasonable and proper to obviate the Evil Genius of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Age. As soon as they came abroad in the general Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, they were read by the sober sort of our Divines with great approbation and acceptance; and from them they had Light and Advantage for the detecting the Follies and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies of the Times.</p>
               <p>For my part, I was then a Student in the University, and therefore shall chuse to relate what effect those Writings had there, and particularly upon divers of my mine own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who are now very considerable in this Church, and have done great Service in it.</p>
               <p>It was one Advantage that the Young Academians had from that unhappy Season, that they were stirr'd up by the general Fermentation that was then in Mens Thoughts, and the vast variety that was in their Opinions, to a great activity in the search of sober Principles, and Rules of Life. I shall not undertake to describe the Spirit and Temper of all the Theologues and Students of those Times, but shall give you an account of some that I knew, who have been very useful to the Church in confuting and exposing the Fanatical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Genius, and who derived much of their Spirit and Doctrines from those excellent Authors of your Country.</p>
               <p>Here I told the Governor that things had been lately also in our parts much after the manner he had described the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of theirs; and that therefore I was very desirous to know by what Ways and Doctrines the People were reduced to a better temper. I said also, that I had relation to one of our Universities, and on that account likewise was sollicitous to understand how those Academical Divines were formed; and what they did when they came abroad.</p>
               <p>He answer'd, that he was ready to gratifie my desires; but then, said he, I would not have you think that I magnifie the Persons I shall describe to you, or their Learning and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, above all our other Clergy: No, thanks be to God, we have numbers of Excellent Men, famous for their Piety, Learning, and Usefulness in the Church: of whom, by reason of my distance, and constant Imployments in this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53288:147"/>
place, I have no personal knowledge; and therefore I choose to speak only of those that were bred in the University about mine own Time; and the rather, that you may observe the Providence of God in raising Men so serviceable to his Church in the very worst of Days. Having premis'd which, he fell immediately to an account of their Preparations in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, and thence to a Relation of their Performances after. Of the former he spoke thus;</p>
               <p>THose Divines, of whom I have undertaken to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, went through the usual course of Studies in the University, with much applause and success: But did not think themselves perfect, as soon as they were acquainted with the knowledge contain'd in <hi>Systems:</hi> No, they past from those Institutions, to converse with the most <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> Authors in all sorts of profitable Learning. They begun at the top, with the Philosophers of the Eldest Times, that were before the days of <hi>Aristotle:</hi> They perused the <hi>Histories</hi> of their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and then read all the remains of them that are extant: They consider'd their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, only as <hi>Hypotheseis,</hi> with Minds <hi>free</hi> and <hi>untainted:</hi> They studied, them to know the several Scheams of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, without passing Judgments <hi>yet,</hi> upon their <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>Falshood.</hi> They read <hi>Plato,</hi> and convers'd <hi>much</hi> with that <hi>Divine</hi> Philosopher: They acquainted themselves with <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> his great Scholar; and by his <hi>Original</hi> Writings, they found how much he had been misrepresented and abused by his <hi>Commentators,</hi> (especially by those of later Times) and saw how different a thing <hi>Aristotelian Philosophy</hi> was in his <hi>own</hi> Works, from <hi>that</hi> which they had met in <hi>compendiums,</hi> and the <hi>Disputing</hi> Books that pretended to it: They made themselves intimate with <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Cicero:</hi> And dealt much with the other chief Writers, both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi> By which means, they were well instructed in the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and the various Thoughts and Opinions of the greatest Men among the Ancients.</p>
               <p>But yet, notwithstanding this Conversation with those Sages, They were not so <hi>pedantically,</hi> and <hi>superstitiously fond</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as to sit down <hi>there</hi> in contempt of all <hi>later</hi>
               </p>

Helps and Advancements. They were sensible, That Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was still <hi>imperfect,</hi> and capable of further growth, and therefore they looked forward into the <hi>Moderns</hi> also, who about their time, had imployed themselves in discovering the Defects of the Ancients, in reviving some of their neglected Doctrines; and advancing them by new Thoughts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: They read, and consider'd all sorts of <hi>late</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in <hi>Anatomy, Mathematicks, Natural History,</hi> and <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> and acquainted themselves with the <hi>Experimental Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Solomon's House,</hi> and the other Promoters of it. So that there was not any valuable Discovery made, or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion started in any part of <hi>Real Learning,</hi> but they got consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable knowledge of it. And by this <hi>Vniversal</hi> way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, They furnish'd their Minds with great <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Conceptions,</hi> and rendred themselves more capable of judging of the <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>likelyhood</hi> of any propos'd <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> Nor did they content themselves with <hi>Reading,</hi> and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Books,</hi> but join'd <hi>Contemplation,</hi> and much thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness with it: They exercised their Minds upon what they read; They consider'd, compar'd, and inferr'd: They had the felicity of <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct thinking,</hi> and had large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass in their Thoughts. By <hi>reading</hi> they rendred their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings <hi>full;</hi> and by <hi>Meditation</hi> they kept that fulness from being <hi>disorderly</hi> and <hi>confus'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being thus prepared, They addrest themselves to the more <hi>close,</hi> particular, and thorow study of <hi>Divinity:</hi> They thought it not enough to read a few <hi>Systems,</hi> and bundles of Novel Opinions, to understand the current <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> of the Times, or to gain the faculty of speaking to the People in the <hi>taking T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53288:148"/>
                  <hi>grew,</hi> and was much advanced by Time, yet <hi>Divinity</hi> was in its <hi>perfectoon,</hi> in the days of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>nearest</hi> Ages to them; and had still been <hi>degenerating</hi> (more or less) in following Times. That it was therefore best to enquire after the <hi>old Ways,</hi> and to take the Measures of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> from <hi>Primitive Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Vsage;</hi> and accordingly they endeavoured to form <hi>theirs.</hi> They convers'd with the Works of your Excellent Writers, whom I mention'd, and other Learned Men, whom Providence raised about that Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to direct the World to those <hi>eldest, best</hi> Patterns. They read also the <hi>Histories,</hi> and observ'd the <hi>growth</hi> of <hi>Sects:</hi> They examin'd the Books of the chief reputed <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd the Arguments where-with they endeavour'd to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish their Opinions. They descended even to the Wild Scribbles and Contentions of the several Parties in our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Land; They acquainted themselves thoroughly with their <hi>Spirit, Principles, Phrases,</hi> and <hi>ways</hi> of <hi>Reasoning;</hi> as judging, that none could deal effectually in the exposing and confuting any Sect, but those who well understood it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all this, They directed their Studies (many of them) to the <hi>Jewish Learning,</hi> That they might be instructed in the Rites, Opinions, and Usages of that People, for the better understanding of many things in the Scripture that relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. They enquired into the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of the great Principles of <hi>Religion,</hi> and particularly of the <hi>Christian;</hi> and provided themselves thereby to deal with <hi>Atheists, Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> with which that Age abounded. I could say much more, but this is enough to shew that these Men were qualified to do something in the World.</p>
               <p>Here I interrupted the Relation a little, and said, That it seem'd to me that such <hi>Preparations</hi> should have taken up the better part of their Lives, and not have left much time for Action. He answer'd, That <hi>Diligence, Meditation,</hi> and a <hi>right Method</hi> of Studies would go very far, and do migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Matters in an indifferent Time; and that he who knew the <hi>shortest</hi> cut, and went constantly on, would pass over a considerable Desart in a few days, while another that loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, or was ignorant of the way, might wander all his Life in it to little purpose. That those Men took the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53288:148"/>
Course, and had the best Guides, the choice Books of all sorts; one anothers excellent Company, and improving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. That they spent no unprofitable time, among the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous Triflers; and in the confused Rubbish of Learning. That they went straight on towards their end, without diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to bie and impertinent Matters. They that made even their most common Conversations to serve them, in their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> the <hi>Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> of Men: And even the <hi>wildness</hi> and humours of <hi>Sects</hi> afforded them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in the nature of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> and <hi>Superstitions</hi> of all kinds. So that their Understandings and Observations were advanced <hi>far,</hi> while their years were not <hi>many;</hi> and they had the happy Conjunction of the <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Ripe Age,</hi> with the <hi>vigour</hi> of <hi>Youth.</hi> I bowed to declare my satisfaction, and He went on.</p>
               <p>IT will be time now, after the Discourse of their <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> to let you know what they <hi>did;</hi> and what were the Effects of these <hi>promising beginnings.</hi> This I shall do, By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting</p>

               <p>I BEGIN with their more <hi>General Actions</hi> and <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of their Thoughts.</p>
               <p>ONe of the <hi>first</hi> things they <hi>did,</hi> was, to deliver their <hi>own</hi> Minds (and to endeavour the same for <hi>others</hi>) from the <hi>Prepossessions,</hi> and <hi>Prejudices</hi> of <hi>Complexion, Education,</hi> and implicit <hi>Authority;</hi> Asserting the Liberty of Enquiry, and thereby freeing their Reasons from a base and dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servitude, and vindicating this just Right of Humane Nature. For though they knew, That <hi>Green Youth,</hi> and <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> Inquirers, ought not pragmatically to call their Teachers to account for their Doctrines, or to venture upon deep Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53288:149"/>
without assistance; Yet they thought, that <hi>Men</hi> who were bred in the way of Study, had first submisly heard the Opinions of their Instructors, and been well acquainted with their Dictates, who were arriv'd to maturity of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and a good capacity to seek after Truth; might at length be permitted to <hi>judge for themselves;</hi> that <hi>so</hi> they might <hi>choose,</hi> like <hi>reasonable</hi> Creatures, and not have their Principles <hi>brutishly obtruded</hi> on them. This they saw was a <hi>natural</hi> Right, and that the Tyrannical Custom of over-ruling and suppressing it, had held the greatest part of Mankind in fatal Chains of Ignorance and Error.</p>
               <p>Here, I say, They begun, and taught, That all lovers of Truth, whose Judgements were competently matur'd, ought to free their Minds from the Prejudices of Education, and usurping Authorities; that is, so far, as not to conclude any thing certainly true, or false, <hi>meerly</hi> on the account of <hi>those Impressions:</hi> But to <hi>try all things,</hi> as Scripture and Reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and incourage us; and to suspend the giving up our <hi>full,</hi> and resolv'd assent to the Doctrines we have been taught, till we have impartially consider'd and examin'd them <hi>our selves.</hi> That in our Researches, we ought to retain a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>venerable Names;</hi> but not <hi>blindly</hi> to <hi>give up</hi> our Understandings to them, against clear Evidence of the Divine Oracles, or Impartial Reason. That when other Considerations, on both sides, were <hi>equal,</hi> the Inducements of <hi>old Belief,</hi> and <hi>reverend Authorities</hi> ought to determine us to a <hi>probable</hi> assent on <hi>that</hi> side: But when God's Word, or our Faculties stood on the <hi>other,</hi> we ought not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd.</p>
               <p>Thus they modestly asserted the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and bounded it with so much Caution, that no Prejudice could arise to Legal Establishments from that freedom: For they allow'd it not to <hi>immature</hi> Youth; or to <hi>illiterate</hi> or <hi>injudicious</hi> Men, who are not to be <hi>trusted</hi> to conclude for themselves in things of <hi>difficult</hi> Theory: But advised <hi>such,</hi> to submit to their Instructors, and so practise the plain things they are taught, without busie intermedling in Speculative Opinions, and things beyond their reach. Such a <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> as <hi>this</hi> they taught, and <hi>such</hi> was necessary for the Age, in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53288:149"/>
which the Minds of Men were inthrall'd by the Masters of Sects, and the Opinions then stil'd <hi>Orthodox,</hi> from which it was accounted <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Damnatiou</hi> to recede. So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be done, to set them at large from those vain Fancies and Ways, till they were perswaded to examine them with <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>indifference,</hi> and to conclude according to the Report of their Faculties. They knew, That Truth would have the advantage, could it but procure an <hi>impartial</hi> Tryal: That the False Doctrines, and Fanatical Practices of the Times would be detected and sham'd, were it not for the superstitious straightness that supprest all Enquiry; and that those <hi>Old Truths</hi> that were exploded with so much abhorrence, would, in all likelyhood, gain upon the Judgments and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents of all that were <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>durst</hi> to be <hi>inquisitive.</hi> On such accounts they prest the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Judgment;</hi> and in a time when it was very <hi>seasonable,</hi> and no hurt could directly arise from it. Since</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) They taught, and urged much <hi>modesty</hi> together with it; and allow'd not <hi>Dogmatical</hi> Affirmations, but in things that were most <hi>fundamental</hi> and <hi>certain:</hi> They consider'd, That our Understandings, at best, are very weak; and that the search of Truth is difficult; that we are very liable to be imposed on by our Complexions, Imaginations, Interests, and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. That whole Ages, and great Kingdoms, and Christian Churches, and Learned Counsels, have joyn'd in Common Errors; and obtruded false and absurd Conceits upon the World with great severity, and flaming Zeal; That much Folly, and great Non-sense have many times generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and been held for certain, and Sacred; That all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are puzled, and bafled in the disquisition of the <hi>seeming, plainest,</hi> and most <hi>obvious</hi> things, In the <hi>Objects</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Motions</hi> of our <hi>own</hi> Souls: That (in earnest) we cannot tell, <hi>How we speak a Word,</hi> or <hi>move a Finger; How the Soul is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Body;</hi> or the <hi>Parts of Bodies to one another;</hi> how our <hi>own</hi> were <hi>framed</hi> at first; or how afterwards they are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd. That these <hi>nearest</hi> things, and a thousand more, are hid from our deepest Enquiries.</p>
               <p>Thus they consider'd often, and fill'd their Thoughts with a great sense of the <hi>narrowness</hi> of humane Capacity, and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53288:150"/>
Imperfections of our largest Knowledge; which they used not to any purposes of <hi>unwarrantable Scepticism,</hi> or absolute <hi>neutrality</hi> of Judgement, but to ingage their Minds to a greater <hi>wariness</hi> in <hi>Enquiry,</hi> and more shiness of Assent to things not very clear and evident; to more <hi>reservedness</hi> in their Affirmations, and more <hi>modesty</hi> in their Arguings.</p>
               <p>After this manner they practised themselves, and thus they discours'd to others, and nothing could be more proper for those times, in which everyone (almost) was immoderately <hi>confident</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> way, and thereby rendred <hi>insolent</hi> in his Dictates, and incurable in his Errors; scornful to opposite Judgments, and ready to quarrel all Dissenters; So that the World was hereby fill'd with Animosity and Clamours; whereas <hi>modesty</hi> in <hi>Opinions</hi> would have prevented those Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs; and it was taught by those Men as the likelyest way of <hi>Cure.</hi> For there is no hopes, either of Truth or Peace, while every one of the divided, thinks himself <hi>infallible:</hi> But when they come to grant a possibility of their being out in their Beloved Tenents, there is something then to work upon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their better Information.</p>
               <p>But (3.) there was still less danger in the <hi>Liberty</hi> they promoted: for as much as they practised and perswaded much <hi>prudence</hi> to be us'd in the publishing of their Tenents; They allowed not any declaration of <hi>private</hi> Sentiments, when such a Declaration might tend to the disgrace or dissettlement of Legal Appointments, or any <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Establish'd</hi> Religion; provided there were no <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or direct <hi>Heresie</hi> in the things injoin'd: But believ'd, and taught, That Men ought to <hi>content</hi> themselves with their <hi>own Satisfactions,</hi> in the Supposed Truths they have discover'd, without clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Disputes, or Wranglings. And though in the large compass of Enquiry they took, and the Considerations they had of all sorts of <hi>Idaea's,</hi> that enter into the various Minds of <hi>thinking</hi> Men, it could <hi>not be,</hi> but that they should have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Apprehensions, <hi>different</hi> from vulgar Thoughts; Yet they were very <hi>cautious</hi> in discovering their Conceptions among the illiterate and unqualified; They had no delight in speaking strange things, or in appearing to be singular and extraordinary: They were not so fond of their own Opinions,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53288:150"/>
as to think them necessary for all others: Nor were they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Common Zeal, to spread and propagate every Truth they thought they knew: No, they consider'd, there were Truths which the World would not bear, and that some of the greatest would be receiv'd <hi>here</hi> with the bitterest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and derision: So that to <hi>publish,</hi> would be but to <hi>expose</hi> them to popular scorn, and <hi>themselves</hi> also: Their main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was, to make Men <hi>good,</hi> not <hi>notional,</hi> and <hi>knowing;</hi> and therefore, though they <hi>conceal'd</hi> no <hi>practical</hi> Verities that were proper and seasonable, yet they were sparing in their <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> except where they tended to the necessary vindication of the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or the directing the Lives of Men: They spoke of other Matters of <hi>Notion</hi> only among their <hi>known Friends,</hi> and such as were well prepar'd, able to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and dispos'd to pardon or receive them: Among <hi>these</hi> they discours'd the <hi>greatest, freest</hi> Speculations, with as much liberty in their <hi>Words,</hi> as in their <hi>Thoughts;</hi> and though they differ'd in many Notions, yet those Differences did nothing but serve the <hi>pleasure</hi> of <hi>Conversation,</hi> and exercise of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning: They begot no estrangements or distasts, no noise or trouble abroad.</p>
               <p>Such was the <hi>prudence</hi> that They practised and taught; and <hi>this</hi> also was very proper for those Times, when every Man vented his <hi>Conceits</hi> for <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and told his <hi>Dreams</hi> for <hi>Revelations,</hi> and then pretended he was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily enlightned, and strove to make Proselites, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel'd with all that did not embrace his Fancies, and <hi>separated</hi> from the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Church, and endeavour'd to involve the World in Hurries and Distractions; and all <hi>this,</hi> for the sake of a few <hi>pittiful, needless, sensless Trifles:</hi> In <hi>such</hi> a time, <hi>this pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> Spirit and Practice was singularly <hi>seasonable</hi> and <hi>useful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though they were thus <hi>cauteous</hi> and wary about Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries more <hi>remote,</hi> and <hi>not necessary;</hi> yet they were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indifferent to <hi>what Men believ'd</hi> and thought: No, They were concern'd, and zealous against the <hi>Fanatick</hi> Conceits and Humours of the Age, which were the occasions of so much Folly, Irregularity, and Disturbance: And my next Business is to declare in some great Instances, how they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned Themselves in <hi>opposing</hi> of them. This was the <hi>second</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53288:151"/>
thing I undertook to relate; namely, <hi>Their particular endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in the Affairs of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I fall on it; I must declare to you, That They had not any <hi>Religion</hi> different from <hi>that</hi> of <hi>other Catholick</hi> Christians, but were faithful <hi>adherers</hi> to the <hi>old acknowledg'd Christianity,</hi> as it was taught by the Church of <hi>Bensalem:</hi> To this Church they <hi>conform'd heartily;</hi> though they were <hi>distinguishable</hi> from some others of her Sons, by the <hi>appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of their <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Endeavours:</hi> I have told you, They grew up among the Sects; They were Born and Bred in that Age, which they could not help; But as they order'd the Matter, it was no hurt to the Church, or them, that they were educated in bad times: They had the occasion thence, of understanding the <hi>Genius, Humour,</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which, those that stood always at distance from them, could not so thorowly and inwardly know: By that means they had great advantage for providing, and applying the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and Confutations that were proper and effectual; And by daily Converse, and near Observation, they setled in their Minds a dislike of those ways, that was <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>juster</hi> than the Antipathy of some others who saw only their <hi>out-sides,</hi> that in many things were <hi>specious</hi> and <hi>plausible.</hi> They studied in the Places where some of the chief of the Sects govern'd, and those that were ripe for the Service, <hi>preach'd publickly,</hi> as other <hi>Academical</hi> Divines did. This they scrupled not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were <hi>young,</hi> and had been under no <hi>explicit</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to those Laws, that were then unhappily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled: But in <hi>those,</hi> and in their other <hi>Vniversity-Exercises,</hi> they much serv'd the Interest of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Bensalem,</hi> by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the <hi>Ataxites,</hi> (so the Sectaries are here call'd) and propagating the <hi>Anti-fanatical</hi> Doctrines, which they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd and improved: So that I cannot look upon that Spirit otherwise, than as an <hi>Antidote</hi> that Providence then sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably provided against the deadly Infection of those days: On which account, they were by <hi>some,</hi> call'd the <hi>Anti-fanites,</hi> because of their peculiar opposition of the <hi>Fans,</hi> or <hi>Fanites,</hi> (as the <hi>Ataxites</hi> were sometimes named): And though some Persons thought fit to judge, and spoke of Them as a <hi>new</hi> Sort of <hi>Divines;</hi> Yet they were not to be <hi>so</hi> accounted, in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53288:151"/>
any sense of <hi>disparagement;</hi> since the <hi>new</hi> Things they taught, were but <hi>contradictions</hi> of the <hi>new</hi> Things that were <hi>introduced;</hi> and <hi>new</hi> Errors and Pretences, will occasion <hi>new</hi> ways of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and Defence.</p>
               <p>I have now (I doubt) said the Governor, almost tired you with <hi>prefacing,</hi> but these things were fit to be <hi>premised:</hi> I exprest my self well-pleased, both with the <hi>Matters</hi> he related, and the <hi>order</hi> which he thought convenient to declare them in; and so he proceeded to the second main Head; Their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Principles and Practices.</p>
               <p>I MUST tell you then, said He, <hi>first,</hi> That they took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the loud Out-cries and Declamations that were among all the Sects, against <hi>Reason;</hi> and observ'd, how by <hi>that means</hi> all Vanities and <hi>Phanatick</hi> Devices were brought into Religion: They saw, There was no likelyhood any stop should be put to those Extravagancies of Fansie that were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently obtruding themselves upon the World; but by <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating</hi> and <hi>asserting</hi> the <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> in <hi>Religion;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, their <hi>private</hi> Discourses, and <hi>publick</hi> Exercises ran much <hi>this</hi> way; to maintain the sober use of our Faculties, and to expose and shame all vain <hi>Enthusiasms:</hi> And as <hi>Socrates</hi> of old, first began the Reformation of his Age, and reduced Men from the wildness of Fansie, and <hi>Enthusiastick Fegaries,</hi> with which they were overgrown, by pleading for <hi>Reason,</hi> and shewing the <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> that there is in heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to its Dictates; So They, in order to the cure of the <hi>madness</hi> of their Age, were zealous to make Men sensible;</p>
               <p>That <hi>Reason</hi> is a Branch and Beam of the Divine Wisdom; <hi>That Light</hi> which he hath put into our Minds, and <hi>that Law</hi> which he hath writ upon our Hearts: That the Revelations of God in Scripture, do not <hi>contradict</hi> what he hath engraven upon our Natures: That <hi>Faith</hi> it self, is an <hi>Act of Reason,</hi> and is built upon these two Reasonable Principles, <hi>That there is a God;</hi> and, That <hi>what he saith is true:</hi> That our Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deductions are not to be call'd <hi>Reason,</hi> but <hi>Sophistry, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> and <hi>Mistake:</hi> That nothing can follow from <hi>Reason,</hi> but <hi>Reason;</hi> and that what <hi>so</hi> follows, is as true and certain as <hi>Revelation:</hi> That God never disparageth Reason, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53288:152"/>
but that the <hi>vain Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom of this World</hi> there spoken against, were <hi>Worldly Policies, Jewish Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, Traditions,</hi> and the <hi>Notional Philosophy</hi> of some Gentiles: That <hi>Carnal</hi> Reason is the Reason of <hi>Appetite</hi> and <hi>Passion;</hi> and not the Dictates of our Minds: That Reason <hi>proves some</hi> Main and Fundamental Articles of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>defends all,</hi> by proving the Authority of Holy Scripture: That we have no cause to take any thing for an Article of Faith, till we see Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe that <hi>God said it,</hi> and in the <hi>sense</hi> wherein we receive such a Doctrine: That to decry, and disgrace <hi>Reason,</hi> is to strike up <hi>Religion</hi> by the Roots, and to prepare the World for <hi>Atheism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to <hi>such</hi> Principles as <hi>these,</hi> They managed their Discourses about this Subject: They stated the Notions of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reason clearly,</hi> and endeavour'd to deliver the Minds of Men from that <hi>confusedness</hi> in those Matters, which blind Zeal had brought upon them; that so they might not call Vain <hi>Sophistry</hi> by the name of <hi>Humane Reason,</hi> and rail at <hi>this,</hi> for the sake of <hi>Fallacy,</hi> and the <hi>Impostures</hi> of Ignorance and Fancy. Hereby they made some amends for the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rashness of those inconsiderate Men, who having heard others defame Reason as an Enemy to Faith, set up the same Cry, and fill'd their Oratories with the terrible noise of <hi>Carnal Reason, Vain Philosophy,</hi> and such other misapplyed words of reproach, without having ever clearly or distinctly consider'd what they said, or whereof they affirm'd: And <hi>this</hi> they did too at a time when the World was posting a-pace into all kinds of madness; as if they were afraid the half-distracted Religionists would not run fast enough out of their Wits, without their Encouragement and Assistance: And as if their Design had been to <hi>credit Phrensie</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> and to disable all proof that could be brought against them. This I believe many of those well-meaning <hi>Canters</hi> against Reason did not think of, though what they did had a direct tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that way: And <hi>accordingly</hi> it succeeded; For the conceited People hearing much of <hi>Incomes, Illuminations, Communions, Lights, Discoveries, Sealings, Manifestations,</hi> and <hi>Impressions,</hi> as the Heights of Religion; and then, being told, that <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> is a <hi>low, Carnal Thing,</hi> and not to judge in these <hi>Spiritual</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:53288:152"/>
Matters; That it is a Stranger to them, and at enmity with the Things of God: I say, the People that were so taught, could not chuse but be taken with the wild <hi>Exstatical Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asts,</hi> who made the greatest boasts of these <hi>glorious</hi> Priviledges; nor could they easily avoid looking upon the <hi>glarings</hi> of their own <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and the <hi>warmths</hi> and impulses of their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,</hi> as <hi>Divine Revelations,</hi> and <hi>Illapses.</hi> To this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous pass thousands were brought by such <hi>Preachments,</hi> and had so well learn'd to apply the Doctrines they had been taught, that he that should endeavour to undeceive them, was sure to hear what an <hi>Enemy this Reason,</hi> this <hi>Carnal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> this <hi>Vain Philosophy,</hi> was to <hi>Free Grace</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> and how little able to judge of those <hi>Rich,</hi> those <hi>Precious,</hi> those <hi>Spiritual</hi> Enjoyments.</p>
               <p>'Twas time now, in such an Age as <hi>this,</hi> to assert the sober <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> and to rescue Religion by it. And They did this happily, and shamed all false pretences to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> shewing,</p>
               <p>That there was nothing but <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Complexion</hi> in the <hi>Illuminations, Incomes, Raptures, Prophesies, New Lights, flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> of <hi>Expression, mysteriousness</hi> of <hi>Phrase,</hi> and other wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things of the <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> which were ignorantly taken to be Divine Communications, to the great abuse of Religion, and the Souls of Men: Perceiving (I say) that this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Phanatick</hi> Spirit was the <hi>evil Genius</hi> of the Age, they bent all their force against it, and detected the imposture, and labour'd zealously to disabuse the credulous People, who were exceeding apt to be taken with such <hi>glorious Nothings.</hi> (But of this, I shall have another occasion to speak more.)</p>
               <p>ANd because the <hi>wildness</hi> of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> and <hi>reproaches</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> had expos'd <hi>Christianity</hi> it self to the Suspicions of some, and Contempts of others, as if it were a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious unreasonable thing, that depended only upon Mens Fancies; Therefore here They labour'd also, with very pious pains, to <hi>demonstrate</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion;</hi> The <hi>Beeing of God;</hi> The <hi>Immortality of Humane Souls;</hi> And <hi>Authority of Scripture;</hi> which they did with much Zeal, and much Judgment: And these Doctrines
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53288:153"/>
were too seasonable and necessary in that Age, in which the most glorious Professors laid the whole stress of Religion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Fancies, and thereby undermin'd the Foundations of Faith, and Truth; and by many Vanities, and endless Divisions, had made so many Infidels, and unhappily dispos'd so many others to go the same way: Against <hi>these</hi> therefore They bent their strength, and rescued multitudes, especially those of the <hi>spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Generation, from the hands, both of the <hi>Enthusiast</hi> and the <hi>Infidel;</hi> Answering and discrediting all the <hi>new</hi> Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Objections, both of the one and the other: And their Endeavours here were very needful, because the <hi>Ancient</hi> Books of those kinds were despis'd and neglected by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd Parties; and they were not so suitable to the Guize and Fashion of our Age; and many Exceptions were started a-new, and many other vain things boasted of, to which those elder Discourses did not apply their force: But these <hi>new</hi> Defenders of the Christian Truths met them all, and spake the things that were suitable, as well as those that were <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>true:</hi> By these means the reasonable sober Spirit began to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate; and the <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> who took notice of it, and knew it would destroy his Glorious Imaginations, rais'd a loud cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour against these Men as <hi>Socinians,</hi> and advancers of Proud <hi>Reason,</hi> above <hi>Free Grace</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this envious and foolish Charge, they sufficiently ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified themselves by several Sermons, and publick Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in their <hi>Academical Solemnities,</hi> against the chief Principles of <hi>Socinianism,</hi> sirenously asserting the <hi>Deity of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> of Humane <hi>Souls,</hi> &amp;c. and vigorously opposing the main <hi>Socinian Tenents:</hi> In consequence of which, they shew'd the <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>safe</hi> ways to destroy those Opinions, without hurting the <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctrines, which many had <hi>wounded</hi> to do them <hi>spight;</hi> and in this Design some of them appeared in publick with great success.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:53288:153"/>
HAving thus asserted the <hi>Honour</hi> of our <hi>Faculties,</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Interests of <hi>Religion,</hi> They took notice, what <hi>unworthy</hi> and <hi>dishonourable Opinions</hi> were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd abroad concerning <hi>God,</hi> to the disparagement of all his Attributes, and discouragement of vertuous Endeavours, and great trouble and dejection of many pious Minds; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here they appear'd also to <hi>assert</hi> and <hi>vindicate</hi> the <hi>Divine Goodness</hi> and <hi>love of Men</hi> in its <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>extent,</hi> against those Doctrines, that made his <hi>Love, Fondness;</hi> and his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Cruelty;</hi> and represented God, as the Eternal Hater of the far greatest part of his reasonable Creatures, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signer of their Ruine, for the exaltation of <hi>meer Power,</hi> and <hi>arbitrary Will:</hi> Against these sowr and dismal Opinions They stood up stoutly, in a time when the Assertors of the Divine Purity and Goodness, were persecuted bitterly with nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names of Reproach, and popular Hatred. They gave sober Accounts of the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, and his <hi>Attributes,</hi> suitable to those Declarations of himself he hath made by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and our Reasons: They shew'd continually how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible it was that <hi>Infinite Goodness</hi> should <hi>design</hi> or delight in the misery of his <hi>Creatures:</hi> That God never <hi>acts</hi> by <hi>meer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Will,</hi> but by a <hi>Will directed</hi> by the Perfections of his Nature: That to act <hi>arbitrarily</hi> is <hi>Imperfection</hi> and <hi>Impotence:</hi> That he is tyed by the excellency of his Beeing, to the Laws of <hi>Right,</hi> and <hi>Just,</hi> and that there are <hi>independent Relations</hi> of <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> among things, <hi>antecedent</hi> to all <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> which are indispensible and eternal: That <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is the Fountain of all his Communications and Actions <hi>ad extra:</hi> That to <hi>glorifie</hi> God, is rightly to apprehend and celebrate his Perfections, by our Words, and by our Actions: That <hi>Goodness</hi> is the <hi>chief</hi> moral Perfection: That <hi>Power</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Goodness is <hi>Tyranny;</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> without it, is but <hi>Craft</hi> and <hi>Subtilty;</hi> and <hi>Justice, Cruelty,</hi> when <hi>destitute</hi> of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: That God is not pleased with our <hi>Praises,</hi> otherwise than as they are the <hi>suitable</hi> Actings of his Creatures, and tend to make them love him, in order to their being happy in him.</p>

By <hi>such</hi> Principles as <hi>These,</hi> which are wonderfully fertile, and big of many great Truths, they undermined, and from the bottom overthrew the fierce and churlish <hi>Reprobatarian</hi> Doctrines; And those Truths they proved from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Things,</hi> with all possible clearness, and strength of Evidence.</p>
               <p>OBserving further, That <hi>Faith</hi> was preach'd up as the <hi>whole</hi> of Religion; and <hi>that</hi> represented <hi>variously, phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastickly,</hi> and after an <hi>unintelligible</hi> manner, drest up in <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors</hi> and <hi>Phrases,</hi> and dangerous <hi>Notions,</hi> that prescinded it from <hi>Good Works,</hi> and made <hi>them</hi> unnecessary: Here they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared also, and detected the vanity and canting of this <hi>Airy Divinity;</hi> Stating the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> plainly and clearly, and stripping it out of its <hi>Chymerical</hi> cloathing, Teaching,</p>
               <p>That Faith in the <hi>general</hi> is the <hi>Belief of a Proposition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd;</hi> and <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> the <hi>belief of a Divine Testimony;</hi> and <hi>Evangelical,</hi> Saving Faith, <hi>such a Belief as works on the Will and Affections,</hi> and <hi>produceth the Works of Righteousness:</hi> So that the Faith that is said to <hi>justifie,</hi> (in the <hi>forensick</hi> sense) is a <hi>complex</hi> thing, and takes in an <hi>Holy Life,</hi> and all the <hi>Graces</hi> of the Spirit, which are call'd by the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> because <hi>that</hi> is the <hi>Root</hi> of all the rest.

                  <hi>Christ's Righteousness</hi> is <hi>imputed,</hi> viz. <hi>Metonymically,</hi> and as to <hi>Effects;</hi> That is, That for the <hi>sake</hi> of his <hi>Righteousness,</hi> God was pleas'd to <hi>pardon Penitents,</hi> and to deal with them upon their <hi>Faith,</hi> and sincere <hi>Obedience,</hi> as if they had been <hi>Righteous</hi> themselves: Not as if he past false, and mistaken Judgements, and looked on <hi>Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> as <hi>really</hi> and <hi>properly theirs;</hi> but that for <hi>his</hi> sake He pardon'd their sins, and accepted of their personal <hi>imperfect</hi> righteousness, as if it had been <hi>perfect.</hi> They shew'd that <hi>this</hi> account was agreeable to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Analogy</hi> of <hi>sound</hi> Faith, and Practice; and that the <hi>other sense</hi> was no-where deliver'd in the holy Oracles, but was a meer imagination contrary to the Attributes of God, and to the Doctrines, and designs of the Gospel, and exceedingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to Christian Life, and Vertue: They alledg'd that <hi>Christ's Righteousness</hi> is <hi>no-where</hi> in Scripture said to be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted:</hi> That he is no otherwise made <hi>Righteousness to us</hi> then he is made <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Redemption;</hi> that is, He is the great <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>procurer</hi> of them; and that in <hi>that</hi> sense he is the <hi>Lord our Righteousness.</hi> They took notice how that by this odd Fanatick principle, <hi>Personal Righteousness</hi> was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, and disparaged; and one of the first things the people were taught, was, to <hi>renounce</hi> their <hi>own Righteousness,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out restriction, or limitation, in which Counsel there is much <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>humility;</hi> but much <hi>non-sense</hi> and much <hi>danger,</hi> if it be not deliver'd, and taken in a <hi>cautious</hi> sense: For the Apostles, and primitive Believers never renounc'd <hi>any Righteousness,</hi> but <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Mosaical dispensation,</hi> in which some of them had gloried much before their conversion; But <hi>after</hi> it, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, It was nothing worth, and counted it as <hi>dross,</hi> and <hi>dung</hi> in respect of <hi>that Righteousness</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> taught: They never disparaged <hi>real, inward Righteousness:</hi> Yea they took ground of <hi>confidence,</hi> and <hi>rejoycing</hi> from it, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi> and <hi>sincerity of their conversation,</hi> from their having a <hi>good Conscience in all things;</hi> from their <hi>stedfastness</hi> amidst <hi>Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> in their <hi>Sufferings;</hi> and they plainly tell us, That Religion was <hi>doing Righteousness,</hi> and consisted in <hi>visiting the Widow and Fatherless,</hi> and <hi>being unspotted with the World;</hi> in <hi>denying</hi> all <hi>ungodliness,</hi> and <hi>worldly lusts,</hi> and living <hi>soberly,</hi>

               <p>But said He, I forget my self, and run out too far into this Discourse, in which I suppose I need not inform you, the Scriptures being so full in it.</p>
               <p>Here I took liberty to move a Question, and ask'd him, Whether those Divines did teach, or allow Mens <hi>relying,</hi> and <hi>depending</hi> on their own inward Vertues, or outward Works? To this he said, They had not the least imagination, that there was either <hi>Merit,</hi> or <hi>Perfection</hi> in our qualifications, or performances; but that in <hi>those respects</hi> they renounc'd their own <hi>righteousness,</hi> and <hi>obedience:</hi> That they acknowledg'd, and declared that our highest, best services could never <hi>deserve</hi> the divine notice, or acceptance by any worthiness in them; But then, added He, They said also, that <hi>Christ's obedience</hi> was <hi>Perfect,</hi> and <hi>Meritorious,</hi> and that God was so well satisfied with it, that for <hi>his sake</hi> he promised to pardon the failings of our duties, and to accept of <hi>Sincerity</hi> instead of <hi>Perfection:</hi> That on this account, our <hi>short, defective</hi> righteousness was receiv'd, as if it had been <hi>adaequate,</hi> and <hi>compleat;</hi> we being through Christ, under a Covenant of Grace, and Pardon, and our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience not judg'd according to strict measures, and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but by the rules of mercy, and favour. Thus they stated that matter clearly, and struck at the root of <hi>Antinomian</hi> follies, and impostures.</p>
               <p>ANd because <hi>Morality</hi> was despised by those elevated Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticks, that talk'd so much of <hi>Imputed Righteousness,</hi> in the false sense; and accounted by them, as a <hi>dull,</hi> and <hi>low</hi> thing; therefore those Divines labour'd in the asserting and vindicating of this: Teaching the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>Moral</hi> Vertues; That <hi>Christianity</hi> is the <hi>highest improvement</hi> of them; That the meer <hi>first-table</hi> Religion is nothing, without the works of the <hi>second;</hi> That <hi>Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Devoutness,</hi> and delight in <hi>Hearing, Prayer,</hi> and other externals of worship, may be in very evil men: That Imitation, and Custom, and Pride, and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53288:155"/>
may produce these: That <hi>these</hi> are no more then the <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Godliness:</hi> That the <hi>power</hi> of it consists in subduing <hi>self-will,</hi> and ruling our <hi>passions,</hi> and moderating our <hi>appetites,</hi> and <hi>doing</hi> the <hi>works</hi> of real Righteousness towards God, and our Neighbour.</p>
               <p>And because there was a Religion that had got into credit, that did not make Men <hi>better,</hi> but <hi>worse</hi> in all relations, worse Governours, and worse Subjects, and worse Parents, and worse Neighbours; more sower, and morose, and fierce, and censorious; Therefore, They prest Men to consider, That the <hi>design</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> was to <hi>perfect humane Nature;</hi> To restore the empire of our <hi>minds</hi> over the <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>affections;</hi> To make them more temperate, and contented in reference to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and more humble, meek, courteous, charitable and just towards others. On such things as <hi>these,</hi> performed <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,</hi> by the assistance, and encouragement of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> and from a desire to be ruled by his Laws, they lay'd the whole stress.</p>
               <p>ANd being the Age was unhappily dispos'd to place <hi>much Religion</hi> in their conceited <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi> and <hi>Systems</hi> of Opinion, to the destruction of Charity, and Peace; To the dissetlement of Religion, and great hinderance of real Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: They therefore zealously decryed this <hi>superstition</hi> of <hi>Opinions,</hi> and smartly reproved <hi>Disputings,</hi> and <hi>eagerness</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test about <hi>Notions,</hi> and <hi>lesser</hi> Truths: Shewing the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, and mischiefs of that spirit, and it's inconsistency with Charity, and the peace of Mankind: They perswaded <hi>modestly</hi> in all <hi>extraessential</hi> Doctrines, and <hi>suspence</hi> of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in things that were not absolutely <hi>certain;</hi> and readiness to pardon the mistakes of those that differ from us in matters of speculation.</p>
               <p>In order hereunto, They made this one of their main Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; That <hi>The principles which are necessary to Salvation are very few, and very plain, and generally acknowledg'd among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:</hi> This they taught, and were earnest in it, because they saw it would secure Charity to dissenters, and prevent all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencies of captious dispute, all schisms, and unnecessary separations, and many Wars, and Persecutions upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

of Religion: For if the things in which Men <hi>differ,</hi> be not <hi>Religion,</hi> be not <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Fundamental;</hi> If this be true, and this truth acknowledg'd, All these would want pretence; and so <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> would possess the spirits of Men.

               <p>In Consequence of this Spirit, and Doctrine, they discours'd the things wherein they differ'd from others, with mildness, and modesty, without anger, and damning sentences; and afforded their converses to all sorts of good Men, though they believ'd them mistaken: They never exprest rage in their conversations, or discourses against <hi>bare errours,</hi> and mistakes of judgment: But for the <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>confidence, censoriousness</hi> and <hi>groundless</hi> separations, that are the frequent attendants of different opinions; <hi>These</hi> sometimes mov'd them to anger, and expression of just resentment; because they look'd on them as great <hi>Immoralities,</hi> and very <hi>pernicious sins:</hi> And on the occasion of these <hi>spiritual</hi> vices, they were warmed with zeal, against the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and <hi>Bigots;</hi> for the taking down of whose <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>confidence,</hi> They thought it necessary to detect the <hi>Impostors,</hi> and to expose their vanities; which they did <hi>successfully,</hi> and shew'd:</p>
               <p>That their <hi>Divinity</hi> consisted most in <hi>Phrases;</hi> and their <hi>boasted spirituality,</hi> in <hi>fond affections:</hi> That their <hi>new lights</hi> were but <hi>freakish</hi> fancies; and <hi>old Heresies</hi> revived; and the

precious <hi>Mysteries</hi> of their Theology, but conceited <hi>absurdities,</hi> and <hi>non-sense</hi> in a fantastick dress: They happily drew the parallel between <hi>our Separatists,</hi> and those antient <hi>ones,</hi> the <hi>Pharisees;</hi> and proved that the same spirit acted the <hi>Ataxites,</hi> that govern'd <hi>those Jewish Fanaticks:</hi> And because their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences were <hi>taking,</hi> and <hi>specious,</hi> and had caught great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the easie, well meaning people of <hi>Bensalem;</hi> Therefore, to disabuse them, they labour'd much to shew the <hi>shortness</hi> of their kind of <hi>Godliness;</hi> and the danger of placing all Religion in <hi>Praying, Hearing, Zeal, Rapture, Mysteries,</hi> and <hi>Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly they declar'd, and prov'd, That 1. <hi>Fluency,</hi> and <hi>Pathetick</hi> eloquence in <hi>suddain</hi> Prayer may proceed, and <hi>doth,</hi> many time, from <hi>excited passion,</hi> and warm imagination; from a peculiar temper, and heated melancholly: That <hi>these</hi> are no sign that a man <hi>prays by the spirit,</hi> nor do they argue him to be one jot the better, then those that want the faculty, or any whit the more accepted of God for it: That to <hi>pray by the spirit</hi> is to pray with <hi>Faith, Desire,</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> and that a Man may pray by the <hi>spirit,</hi> and with a <hi>Form.</hi>

admiringly to follow such Preachers, They shew'd, was but to be in love with <hi>flattery,</hi> and <hi>self-deceit:</hi> That it was no sign of <hi>Godliness,</hi> but an evident argument of pride, malice, and immoderate selfishness; That <hi>these</hi> are the true causes of the zeal, and earnestness of <hi>many</hi> after Sermons; and of the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> that they have in <hi>hearing,</hi> though they would perswade others, and believe themselves, that the love of Religion, and sence of duty are the only motives that prevail with them.</p>

divisions stop'd, Religious practice promoted, and the peace of the Church at last establish'd.

               </p>
               <p>These things they declar'd, and prov'd against the <hi>negative Superstitions</hi> of <hi>Taste not, Touch not, handle not:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And They shew'd also, how justly chargeable the <hi>Ataxites</hi> were with many <hi>Positive</hi> ones; in that they doated upon <hi>little, needless, foolish</hi> things, and lay'd a great stress of Religion upon them: That the keeping such stir about pretended <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi>

opinions, and the placing them in their <hi>Creeds,</hi> among the most sacred and fundamental Doctrines, was a dangerous and mischievous <hi>Superstition:</hi> That it was very <hi>superstitious</hi> to dignify private conceits, or <hi>uncertain tenents,</hi> with the style of <hi>Gospel-light, Gods Truths, precious Truths,</hi> and the like expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of admiration, and fondness: That to intitle the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God to the <hi>effects</hi> of our <hi>imaginations,</hi> and the <hi>motions</hi> of <hi>natural passions,</hi> was <hi>Superstition;</hi> and that <hi>so</hi> was the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>necessity,</hi> and <hi>spirituality</hi> of suddain <hi>conceiv'd</hi> prayer: That there was much <hi>Superstition</hi> in their <hi>Idolizing</hi> their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>ways</hi> of Worship, and <hi>models</hi> of Discipline, as the <hi>pure Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Christs Government,</hi> and <hi>Scripture Rules:</hi> And that in <hi>these,</hi> and many other respects they that talk'd so much <hi>against Superstition,</hi> were themselves most notoriously guilty of it.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Will-worship</hi> They taught, (after your most learned <hi>Hammondus</hi>) That the Apostle in the only place where it is mention'd, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. doth not speak of it, in an <hi>evil</hi> sense; But that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> imports a <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>unconstrain'd</hi> worship, which is the <hi>more</hi> acceptable for being <hi>so:</hi> That <hi>Sacrifices</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law; <hi>Free-will-offerings</hi> under it; The feasts of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,</hi> and <hi>Dedication, Davids design</hi> of building the Temple; the <hi>Austerities</hi> of the <hi>Rechabites;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul's refusing hire,</hi> for his labour among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> were of <hi>this sort.</hi> That men are not to be blamed for <hi>Will-worship,</hi> except they would <hi>impose</hi> it <hi>without Authority,</hi> as <hi>necessary.</hi> That when they thus teach for <hi>Doctrines</hi> their <hi>own Traditions,</hi> and grow so proud, and conceited with them, as to <hi>separate</hi> from the publick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, upon the fancy that they are more pure, and holy then others; That this their Will-worship is sinful, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical; which was the case of the <hi>Ataxites,</hi> who therefore were Will-worshippers in the evil sense; But the Anti-fanites shewed, that the pious Institutions of just Authority were no way lyable to any such imputation:</p>
               <p>That such might <hi>impose</hi> particular Circumstances, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies, and that those Impositions were no way contrary to <hi>Gospel Liberty:</hi> That that was only <hi>Freedom</hi> from the <hi>Jewish yoke,</hi> from the <hi>bondage</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Sathan:</hi> not <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:53288:160"/>
from the <hi>Injunctions</hi> and Appointments of <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical</hi> Governours: That <hi>all,</hi> or the <hi>chief</hi> power of <hi>these,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consisted in fixing, and appointing <hi>circumstances</hi> of order, and decorum, that were left undetermined, and not prescrib'd in Scripture: That if they may not do <hi>this,</hi> they are in a manner useless: That the Church of <hi>Bensalem</hi> impos'd nothing that was grievous, or prohibited: They minded the <hi>Ataxites</hi> that themselves were great <hi>Imposers,</hi> That they imposed <hi>Oaths;</hi> and Ceremonies in <hi>that</hi> part of Religious Worship, a <hi>form</hi> of <hi>words,</hi> the <hi>lifting</hi> up of the <hi>hand;</hi> and That they would have impos'd numerous, doubtful, and false opinions, to have been subscrib'd as a necessary <hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> making thereby their own private tenents of <hi>equal</hi> moment, and certainty with the great fundamental Articles, which is <hi>proper</hi> imposing upon the Conscience: That they would not, by any means, allow Liberty of Conscience, when they were in power; that this then was the great <hi>Abomination,</hi> and the most <hi>accursed</hi> thing in the world: That they persecuted the <hi>Bensalemites</hi> for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences with wonderful inhumanity; That when <hi>other</hi> power is taken from them, they are grievous persecutors with their <hi>Tongues,</hi> and are continually shooting the Arrows of bitter, scornful words against all that are of different judgment.</p>
               <p>Thus Those Divines disabled all the charges, and pretences of the Fanites; and turn'd the points, and edge upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And they manag'd their Rebukes of these self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd men, with much judgment, and wit, without any thing of fierceness, or scurrility: They shew'd them the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality of their spirit, and it's contradictions, and antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to the genius, and temper of the Gospel; and urged, That though they hated debauchery, and some gross <hi>Carnal</hi> sins, as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did the <hi>Publicans,</hi> Yet they were given up to many other sorts of <hi>wickedness,</hi> to spiritual <hi>Pride, Malice, Envy, Avarice, Stubbornness, Disingenuity,</hi> and <hi>Disobedience:</hi> That they harbour'd, and kept warm <hi>these,</hi> under their pretences of <hi>Christs Righteousness,</hi> and their specious <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>Godliness:</hi> That though they were always confessing sin, in the <hi>general,</hi> with much seeming remorce, and trouble of spirit, yet they seldom, or never, made acknowledgements of these.

though they lov'd to hear the sins of <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> and <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> vehemently declaim'd against; Yet they could not endure to have <hi>these</hi> throughly detected, and reprov'd: That even their own Teachers durst not touch <hi>here,</hi> and that when others did it, though without <hi>naming</hi> parties or pointing out persons, they call'd it <hi>Railing</hi> and <hi>Persecution;</hi> and made no other use of those just rebukes: That though they shew'd great seeming <hi>tenderness</hi> of Conscience in other smaller matters of <hi>Mint, Annise,</hi> and <hi>Cummin;</hi> Yet they seldom appear'd sensible, or troubl'd at their transgressions in those <hi>greater</hi> matters of the Law.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53288:161"/>
customary confessions under the power of them: That <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> are but <hi>single</hi> acts, and <hi>such</hi> too as have not the <hi>will</hi> in them: That God hath afforded us sufficiency of means, and helps enough to subdue all the evils of our natures; and that if we neglect to use those aids, and live at rest under any sinful appetites and passions, we are <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and our boasted Faith, and spiritualities will signify nothing to us.</p>
               <p>HEre the Governour made a little stop, and then said; I have run over these things as they offer'd themselves to my mind; I might have set them in a better order, and have added many other particulars, but as to <hi>method,</hi> there is no great need of curiosity in it in such a relation: By the things I have told you, you may gather what was the Genius of those Divines in many <hi>others,</hi> which for brevity I omit.</p>
               <p>I said, that though one might collect the opinion of many matters more, by what he had been pleas'd to represent to me; yet there were two things which I had a desire to be informed in further, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Notion of <hi>Free Grace;</hi> and <hi>Justification</hi> by <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Doctrines about <hi>these,</hi> answer'd He, might in great part be gather'd from some of those principles I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd; but however I shall gratify you with a short account of them:</p>
               <p>For <hi>Free Grace,</hi> it was ever in the mouths of the <hi>Ataxites,</hi> and they seem'd to be transported, and ravish'd in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it: But their notion was very <hi>perverse,</hi> and <hi>false:</hi> For they made it an <hi>arbitrary</hi> kindness, bestow'd upon some very <hi>few</hi> persons, for <hi>no reason</hi> in the world; Not for the sake of any <hi>vertue,</hi> or divine <hi>qualifications,</hi> but only for <hi>meer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable will,</hi> and <hi>pleasure:</hi> And said, That God from this <hi>Free Grace</hi> (as they call'd it) chang'd the hearts of the Elect by an <hi>immediate, irresistible power;</hi> and <hi>created</hi> Faith, and other Graces in them, in the same way of <hi>omnipotent</hi> operation.</p>
               <p>Against these <hi>dangerous</hi> conceits, they taught, That God loves <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> and is no fond <hi>Respecter</hi> of <hi>Persons:</hi> That <hi>those</hi> are the proper objects of his special kindness: That there was a <hi>general</hi> Grace which had <hi>appear'd unto all men,</hi> in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53288:162"/>
the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> written upon our hearts, and common aids of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> That it's freedom, consisted in it's <hi>universal</hi> diffusion through the world without <hi>let,</hi> or <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment;</hi> and in the <hi>spontaneity</hi> of it: This said he may seem some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a <hi>hard</hi> word; but I have no plainer to express the fulness of my sense by; and I never use a <hi>difficult</hi> term, when the thing can be spoke as well in one that is more <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>familiar.</hi> I answer'd, that I understood it very well, and that he meant that Gods Grace was <hi>willing,</hi> and <hi>unforc'd;</hi> flowing from the <hi>benignity</hi> of his nature; still communicating it self to all <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> that were <hi>capable:</hi> You apprehend me right, continued the Governour, and <hi>thus</hi> he hath imparted himself to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: But then added He, There is a <hi>Grace,</hi> more <hi>special,</hi> that concerns <hi>Christians only, without us;</hi> the <hi>declaration</hi> of the <hi>Gospel:</hi> and <hi>within us;</hi> those <hi>divine vertues</hi> that are wrought by them, and therefore call'd <hi>Graces:</hi> He said, The Gospel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth without force, and God works upon us by it, in a way <hi>proper,</hi> and <hi>sutable</hi> to reasonable Creatures, by our <hi>Reasons,</hi> and our <hi>Interests,</hi> by our <hi>Hopes,</hi> and our <hi>Fears:</hi> assisting all good desires, and endeavours by the operation of his holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>This, said he, acts as a <hi>General Cause,</hi> according to the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition</hi> of the <hi>Subject:</hi> our <hi>endeavours</hi> would be <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> without it; And yet, It never works <hi>alone</hi> by <hi>meer omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> without our <hi>endeavours:</hi> They operate in <hi>conjunction,</hi> as the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>moysture</hi> of the earth, and <hi>seminal</hi> principles do in the production of <hi>Plants,</hi> and <hi>Flowers;</hi> each cause doing what is <hi>proper</hi> to it: The <hi>Dictates</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> are contain'd in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the Spirit <hi>enlightneth,</hi> and teacheth by <hi>that.</hi> And so he came to the great Doctrine of</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Justification</hi> by <hi>Faith:</hi> Here he call'd to my mind what he had related before concerning <hi>Faith,</hi> and the false notions of it among the <hi>Fanites:</hi> and then said,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Justification</hi> is either taken for the <hi>making us just,</hi> or the <hi>dealing</hi> with us as if we were <hi>such:</hi> And that <hi>Faith</hi> is taken as a <hi>single</hi> Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>belief</hi> of the <hi>Gospel;</hi> or <hi>complexly,</hi> as it <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all the rest,</hi> viz. The <hi>whole body</hi> of <hi>Holiness.</hi> Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd which necessary distinctions, He told me, That Faith in the <hi>single</hi> acception of it, was the great <hi>instrument</hi> of the Gospel,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53288:162"/>
to <hi>make</hi> us <hi>just;</hi> and so <hi>justified</hi> in the <hi>proper, Physical</hi> sense; But that as it compriseth the <hi>other Graces,</hi> it justifies in the <hi>forensick,</hi> and less proper sense, <hi>viz.</hi> That God <hi>deals</hi> with the <hi>Faithful,</hi> namely those that are <hi>sincerely obedient</hi> to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as if they had been <hi>strictly,</hi> and <hi>perfectly just,</hi> and had <hi>fulfill'd</hi> his Laws. By the help of which short, and plain state of the controversie, methought I saw clearly into the whole matter, and was free'd from many perplexities, and confusions in which I was wont to be involv'd.</p>
               <p>And being thus inform'd of the principles of those Divines in those chief heads of Doctrine, I had a curiosity to have an account of their mind, concerning the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Government,</hi> about which there had been so much stir in our <hi>European</hi> parts of Christendom, and therefore intreated him to represent their opinion to me in this subject: To which he answer'd me thus.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antient Form</hi> of <hi>Church Government</hi> in this Island ever since the plantation of Christianity in it, hath been <hi>Episcopal:</hi> But of later years, it was very much hated, and opposed by the <hi>Ataxites,</hi> who set up <hi>new Modells</hi> (every sect it's own fancy) as the only divine Government, and Discipline of Christ; So that the Scriptures were rack'd, and every little word, and point forc'd, and many subtilties of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion suborn'd to declare for the beloved imagination: and then the whimsie was voted to be of <hi>divine right,</hi> and the only <hi>Scripture-Government;</hi> and the advancing of it, made no less then the Interest of <hi>Gods Glory,</hi> and the promoting of <hi>Christs Kingdom.</hi> On the other side, the <hi>antient Government</hi> was decry'd as <hi>superstitious, Church Tyranny, Humane Invention,</hi> a <hi>limb of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> to be extirpated <hi>root,</hi> and <hi>branch,</hi> by a <hi>thorow, Godly Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> In which design (as I told you) they succeeded to the subversion both of the Civil, and Ecclesiastical state: But when they had <hi>destroy'd,</hi> they knew not how to <hi>build;</hi> for they could never agree upon the Platform to be erected in the room of <hi>that</hi> which they had subverted: For every Sect was for setting up it's <hi>own</hi> frame; and every one had a <hi>different</hi> Model from every other; and each was confident, that it's Form was <hi>Christs Institution,</hi> and so by no means to be receded
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53288:163"/>
from, in the least point: The effects of which were endless Animosities, Hatreds, and Struglings against each other, and the greatest rage, and violence of them <hi>altogether,</hi> against the Church of <hi>Bensalem,</hi> and all <hi>Episcopal</hi> constitutions.</p>
               <p>Amidst these Bandyings, some <hi>Antifanatick</hi> Divines taught, That there was no reason to think, that any <hi>particular Model</hi> was <hi>prescrib'd</hi> in Scripture, <hi>so,</hi> as to be <hi>unalterable,</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal:</hi> That it was necessary <hi>there should be a Government</hi> in the Church; That the Apostles had appointed <hi>General Officers,</hi> and <hi>General Rules,</hi> such as <hi>God's Glory, Edification, Decency, Order, avoidance</hi> of <hi>Offence,</hi> and the like; but that it did not appear, they had determined the <hi>particular</hi> Circumstances, and Form: That there was no express <hi>command</hi> of them; and that the plea of <hi>Apostolical example</hi> (could it be made out) would not hold for an <hi>universal Law</hi> to the Church in <hi>all ages,</hi> except where there was some <hi>intrinsick,</hi> necessary goodness in the things practised; or some <hi>annext Precept</hi> to inforce it: That there was neither of these in the present case; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they urged, That the <hi>Form,</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> was to be left to the <hi>Ruling Powers</hi> in the Church, to be order'd by them so as should seem best to suit with the <hi>General Rules,</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of Government.</p>
               <p>By the means of which Principles, Foundation was lay'd for Peace, and Obedience; and that age was prepared for the reception of the old, Legal establish'd Government, when it should be restored. Concerning <hi>This</hi> those Divines taught,</p>
               <p>That it was of all the most <hi>venerable</hi> Form, and greatly to be rever'd for its <hi>Antiquity, Vniversality,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> it had from <hi>Apostolical</hi> Practice, and our <hi>Fundamental</hi> Laws: That on <hi>these,</hi> and other accounts, it was infinitely to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, and chosen, before any new-fangled Model, upon the score of which declarations, and discourses, in the <hi>Ataxites</hi> times, great complaint was made by them, among the foolish Zealots of their party, that the <hi>Vniversities,</hi> were over-run with a <hi>Prelatical</hi> spirit, than which, nothing was more odious in those days: But the prudent men took no notice of their cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, but went on with the design of propagating such <hi>sober</hi> Principles, as tended to the healing of the Nation. When
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53288:163"/>
the publick <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> was restor'd; They most chearfully put themselves under it, and submitted to its <hi>Orders</hi> heartily, upon the belief of its being the most <hi>Primitive, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, Prudent, Legal Government</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p>I Have now, said the Governour, past over the particulars, in which you desir'd to be inform'd; much more might have been said of them, but I know your own thoughts will improve these suggestions, which are enough to give light to the main Notions. I returned him my humble acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the care, and pains he had taken to satisfy, and inform me in these, and the other heads of those Mens Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. To which he answer'd, That it was a great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and satisfaction to him if he had given me any content by his relation; and then will'd me that if there were ought in the <hi>Theological</hi> part, that I had any query about, I would propose it freely: For, said he, we have a little time more to spare in talking of this <hi>first General,</hi> if you have any curiosity to be inform'd further of any thing belonging to it. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd that he added to his favours by the liberty of Questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he was pleased to allow me, and that I had one thing more to desire a few words of, if he so pleas'd, which was, what <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Preaching</hi> those Divines followed: This said He, I should have minded my self, and am very glad you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me of it!</p>
               <p>You must know then, continued He, That there was not a greater <hi>diversity</hi> in any thing in <hi>Bensalem</hi> in the Age of which I now speak, than in the <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Preaching;</hi> of which amongst other evils, this was <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> the <hi>least,</hi> That the people distasted, and contemn'd all the Doctrines, and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that were not deliver'd after their <hi>own</hi> fashion, though otherwise never so seasonable, and wholesome; and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately admiring their own men, who spoke in the <hi>Phrase,</hi> and <hi>Mode</hi> that they fancied, they vilified, and despis'd those others, that us'd another method, though it were never so solid, edifying, and useful. And indeed, things were come to that pass in <hi>Bensalem,</hi> that there was scarce any <hi>other</hi> use made of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but to pass judgments upon the Preacher, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53288:164"/>
which was not only undertaken by the people of Age, and Experience: or by those only of better education and more advanc'd knowledge; But <hi>every</hi> Age, and <hi>every</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was thought fit to judge here, every Youth, and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; every Rustick, and Mechanick would pass absolute, and definitive sentence in this matter. Accordingly the most <hi>empty,</hi> and <hi>fantastical</hi> Preachers were generally the most <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular:</hi> And those that dealt most in jingles, and <hi>chiming</hi> of words, in <hi>Metaphors,</hi> and vulgar <hi>similitudes,</hi> in <hi>Fanatick</hi> Phrases, and <hi>Fanciful</hi> schemes of speech, set off by <hi>pleasing smiles,</hi> and <hi>melting Tones,</hi> by <hi>loudness</hi> and <hi>vehemency; These</hi> were sure to be the <hi>taking, precious</hi> men, though their discourses were never so trifling, and ridiculous. But the Divines, whom I describe, were no admirers of this ill-gotten, and ill-grounded Fame: They had no ambition to be cry'd up by the common Herd, nor any design to court their applauses: They car'd not for their favour, or kind thoughts <hi>further,</hi> than those afforded advantage and opportunity for the doing of them good. <hi>This</hi> they consider'd as the end of their Ministry, and <hi>this</hi> they made the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi> of their <hi>Preaching;</hi> which I shall describe to you under these following Characters.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was <hi>Plain</hi> both in opposition to, First, <hi>Obscurity,</hi> and Secondly, <hi>Affectation.</hi> First, They preach'd no <hi>dark</hi> or <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure</hi> notions; For though their thoughts were conversant about the deepest Theories, both in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> yet they knew, that <hi>such</hi> were not fit for Pulpits, or common hearers They had no design to make <hi>themselves</hi> admir'd by soaring into the Clouds: Their great aim was the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and instruction of those to whom they spoke; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were so far from preaching the <hi>heights</hi> of <hi>speculation,</hi> That they usually avoided (as much as they could) all the <hi>Controversies</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> in which the <hi>Essentials</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> were not concern'd. And when <hi>either</hi> of <hi>these</hi> call'd for discourse of <hi>Doctrinal</hi> matters, their great care was to be understood. For secondly, They did not involve their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses in <hi>needless words</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> or <hi>subtile distinctions;</hi> but spoke in the plainest, and most intelligible Terms: and distinguish'd things in the most easie and familiar manner that the matter
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53288:164"/>
of discourse would bear. They took this for an <hi>establish'd Rule,</hi> That <hi>unwonted</hi> words were <hi>never</hi> to be us'd, either in Pulpits, or elsewhere, when <hi>common</hi> ones would as fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present their meaning: and they always chose <hi>such,</hi> as the custom of speaking had rendred familiar in the Subjects on which they spoke, when <hi>those</hi> were <hi>proper,</hi> and <hi>expressive.</hi> And though many sorts of thoughts, and Subjects cannot be made obvious to the meer vulgar; yet they endeavour'd to render such as were out of the common road of thinking, <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> to those that are capable of the matters they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press. Thirdly, They did not trouble their hearers with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Mysteries:</hi> They led them not into the dark places of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations:</hi> nor fed them thence with their own <hi>imaginations</hi> under pretence of <hi>secret,</hi> and <hi>hidden</hi> Truths: No, they taught them from the plain Texts, and Doctrines of the Holy Writings: and gave them the <hi>sincere milk</hi> of the Word without any mixture of <hi>elaborate fancies,</hi> or <hi>mystical</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Fourthly, They slighted, and avoided all <hi>canting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick Phrases,</hi> which were so much the Mode of those times. For They saw, they did but please with their <hi>sound,</hi> without conveying any sense into the minds of those that were so much delighted with them. So that the pretended <hi>plain preaching</hi> of those days, was really <hi>not at all understood;</hi> nor as much as <hi>intelligible.</hi> Therefore instead of such phrases, They us'd the most proper, and natural expressions, and such as most easily opened the mind to the things they taught.</p>
               <p>I do but slightly mention these particulars here, said the Governour, because I have spoken of them before in my larger accounts of these men: And so he went to the second thing mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The plainness of their preaching, in opposition to <hi>Affectation.</hi> Now the usual affectations of Preachers, said he, relate either to <hi>Learning, Wit,</hi> or <hi>Zeal;</hi> from all which They were very free. For first, They affected not to ostentate <hi>Learning,</hi> by high-flown expressions, or ends of <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latine:</hi> They did not stuff their Sermons with numerous, needless <hi>Quotations;</hi> or flourish them with the names of great Authors: ways to be <hi>admired</hi> by the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and <hi>despised</hi> by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53288:165"/>
the <hi>Wise:</hi> No, their Learning was not shewn in such cheap trifles as these, but it abundantly appear'd to the intelligent, by the <hi>judgement</hi> and <hi>strength,</hi> the <hi>reason,</hi> and <hi>clearness</hi> with which they spoke. Secondly, They despis'd the small essays of appearing <hi>witty</hi> in their Sermons: They us'd no <hi>jingling</hi> of words, nor <hi>inventions</hi> of sentences, no <hi>odd</hi> fetches of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or <hi>niceness</hi> in <hi>labour'd</hi> periods: They affected no <hi>gayness</hi> of <hi>metaphors,</hi> or <hi>prettiness</hi> of <hi>similitudes:</hi> no tricks to be plaid with the <hi>words</hi> of their <hi>Texts;</hi> or any other of the <hi>conceited</hi> sorts of fooling: but spoke with <hi>seriousness,</hi> and <hi>gravity,</hi> as <hi>became</hi> the Oracles of God; and shew'd their <hi>wit</hi> in the <hi>smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and edge of the things they deliver'd, without vanity, or trifling. Thirdly, They did not put on <hi>fantastical shews,</hi> and appearances of <hi>affected zeal:</hi> They us'd no set <hi>Tones,</hi> or cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous <hi>noise;</hi> no <hi>violent,</hi> or <hi>Apish</hi> actions: They spoke with a well-govern'd <hi>affectionateness,</hi> and concerment; and <hi>such</hi> as shew'd they were in <hi>earnest:</hi> and very sensible of the weight of the affairs they were about: But without any thing of <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> or <hi>extravagance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, said He, after what I have mention'd under this <hi>first</hi> Head, I may spare my pains of speaking much under the rest that follow; and therefore I shall be brief on them.</p>
               <p n="2">(II.) Those Divines were <hi>methodical</hi> in their preaching: not that they were <hi>nice,</hi> in running their Texts into all the <hi>minute divisions</hi> of words; or <hi>formal</hi> in tying themselves just to one order on all Subjects: But they divided their matter into the <hi>substantial parts</hi> of Discourse; or resolv'd it into some <hi>main Proposition;</hi> and so treated of their subject in the method that was <hi>natural</hi> to it, and most beneficial for the people they were to instruct: They went not on in a <hi>cryptick undiscover'd</hi> order on the one hand, nor did they spin out their matter into numerous, coincident particulars on the other: But made their Method very easie, and obvious, and their Heads <hi>few,</hi> and <hi>very distinct;</hi> which is helpful both to the <hi>understandings,</hi> and <hi>memories</hi> of the hearers.</p>
               <p n="3">(III.) Their preaching was <hi>Practical:</hi> For though they taught all the great substantial principles of Religion; yet still they directed them to <hi>Practice,</hi> and laid the main stress on
<pb facs="tcp:53288:165"/>
                  <hi>that.</hi> According to the saying of our Blessed Lord, <hi>If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.</hi> They taught the true, practical Divinity, without <hi>whimsies,</hi> and <hi>Romantick strains;</hi> and laid down the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> that are <hi>practicable,</hi> and <hi>such</hi> as sort with the plain Precepts of the Gospel, and the <hi>condition,</hi> and <hi>possibilities</hi> of <hi>humane</hi> nature: They spoke here, as those that understood the <hi>passions, appetites,</hi> and ways of men; and the course that was to be taken, to set them in right order: They did not talk by roat out of Books, or <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastick experiences;</hi> They did not direct by <hi>Metaphors,</hi> and <hi>Phrases,</hi> and <hi>unpracticable</hi> fancies: But laid down the true, sober, rational, experimental method of action.</p>
               <p n="4">(IV.) Their way was <hi>earnest</hi> and <hi>affectionate:</hi> They were not <hi>cold,</hi> or <hi>trifling,</hi> in matters of such vast consequence: They did not <hi>invite</hi> with <hi>indifference;</hi> or <hi>reprove</hi> with <hi>softness;</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> with <hi>negligence</hi> and <hi>unconcernment:</hi> But did all <hi>these,</hi> with a <hi>zeal,</hi> and warmth <hi>sutable</hi> to such weighty occasions. But then, They endeavour'd to excite mens affections, not by their <hi>senses,</hi> and <hi>imaginations only;</hi> not, as I said before, by meer empty <hi>noise,</hi> and <hi>Tones,</hi> and <hi>Gestures,</hi> and <hi>Phrases,</hi> and passionate <hi>out-crys;</hi> but by the <hi>weight</hi> of their <hi>sense,</hi> and the <hi>reason</hi> of their <hi>perswasions,</hi> endeavouring by the <hi>understandings,</hi> to gain the <hi>affections;</hi> and so to work on the <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Such</hi> was Their <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Preaching,</hi> on which I might have much enlarg'd, but I give you only the brief Heads.</p>
               <p>Here I ask'd him, what entertainment <hi>this</hi> their <hi>preaching</hi> met with in <hi>Bensalem?</hi> He answer'd, That for a long time it was but <hi>coldly</hi> receiv'd by the people, whose imaginations, and humours us'd to be fed upon <hi>Allusions,</hi> and <hi>Phrases,</hi> and <hi>Metaphors,</hi> and <hi>Opinions:</hi> And therefore, they hated <hi>sound Doctrine,</hi> and distasted the <hi>sincere</hi> Word: Their <hi>pallates</hi> were so <hi>vitiated</hi> by the <hi>fantastical</hi> food, to which they had been us'd, that the <hi>substantial</hi> and <hi>wholesome</hi> dyet would not down with them: So that those Divines were not at all <hi>popular</hi> at first, but the People generally ran after the <hi>affected, fanciful</hi> men, who entertain'd their itching Ears with <hi>jingles,</hi> and <hi>mysteries,</hi> and <hi>new nothings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after that many of <hi>These</hi> Teachers had forsaken the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53288:166"/>
publick places of Worship, and in opposition to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, and Edicts of State, betook themselves to holes and private corners, The bewitch'd multitude fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them into those places; Their zeal, and admiration of their own Men being increased, and heightned by the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and restraint that was upon them: For they doted on the fancies They taught; and could not endure sound sense: But the <hi>Judicious</hi> of all sorts, entertain'd, and relish'd the <hi>sober, unaffected</hi> preaching of the <hi>Anti-fanaticks;</hi> And at length also, by time, and <hi>their</hi> approbation, and example, most of the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning, mis-led people were recover'd back to the Church of <hi>Bensalem,</hi> and brought to a relish and liking of the plain way of Instruction.</p>
               <p>And now said He, I have done with what concerns the <hi>Theological Genius,</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of the men I undertook to describe, 'Tis too late for us at present to enter upon their way of <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Learning:</hi> of <hi>this</hi> I have given some short hints, but I intend you a larger account at our next meeting; and if you are not tyred already with my discourse, <hi>that</hi> shall be to morrow in the afternoon, which I hope I shall have at liberty: If you will come hither at that time, you will find me ready to acquaiut you with what is further considerable in the Story of those Men.</p>
               <p>I thank'd him, with a profound reverence for the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pleasure he had afforded me already in his Relation; and for that further entertainment he was pleas'd to design for me; saying, that I never counted time better spent than that, which I had the honour to pass in his Instructive Conversation, and on Subjects of such delight, and importance. And so I took my leave for that night, and was conducted back by the same Messenger to my Lodgings.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:53288:166"/>
               <p>I Went the next day, at the appointed time, and found the Governour in the same room. After some Reflections on his past Relation, and a few common matters of Discourse (which I need not remember) He told me, He would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me now with some things relating to the Opinion, and Genius of the same Men, in several sorts of <hi>Learning:</hi> of this, said He, you heard somewhat in the beginning, which will shorten this Account: I answer'd, that I did well remember what was told me of their <hi>universal</hi> way of study, and converse with the best Authors, both <hi>Antient,</hi> and <hi>Modern.</hi> I therefore shall omit further discourse of that, said He, and tell you their Opinion (as far as I apprehend it) of the several chief parts of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>Learning.</hi> I begin with</p>
               <p>LOGICK: As to <hi>this,</hi> They oppos'd not the usual <hi>Systems</hi> of the Schools, as they were <hi>Exercises,</hi> and <hi>Institutions</hi> for <hi>Youth:</hi> But They did not like the <hi>formal Syllogistical</hi> way among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer Reasoner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> They many of them more approv'd of the <hi>Logick</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> which teacheth first to <hi>explain</hi> the <hi>Terms</hi> of the Question, and <hi>then</hi> to proceed by orderly Gradations from one proposition to another, till we come to the thing we would prove. A method of Reasoning more <hi>quick,</hi> and <hi>close,</hi> and much less subject to <hi>fallacies,</hi> and <hi>wandrings,</hi> than the way o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Syllogism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to move the propositions from whence a man would infer his conclusion, in the <hi>modest, Socratical</hi> way of <hi>Question;</hi> In my judgment, is a very good, and advantageous method. For in <hi>this,</hi> the occasions of passion which are ministred by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive assertions, are taken away, and the Arguer is ingaged no further, then he thinks fit. He may break off when he pleaseth, without prejudice to his credit, which he hath not ingag'd, by undertaking <hi>Dogmatical</hi> proof of any thing: And so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes may be brought to a short, and fair issue; and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant heats may be avoided: for the Arguer may keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self uningaged, and so see more clearly how to apply his force, and restrain the discourse within the bounds of the subject: whereas in the positive way of disputing by <hi>Syllogism,</hi> there are these contrary disadvantages:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:53288:167"/>
Our Reasons are led a great way about; Mens minds are concern'd for the credit of their assertions, which they positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertake to prove; Ambiguous and Aequivocal Terms steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and insensibly mislead the Reasoners; or distinctions are applyed, which mislead them more; The Disputer takes up one end, and runs away hastily in an opposition of it, perhaps without clearly understanding what it means, and without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving how this new pursuit works him off from the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness; He goes on still, and is still turn'd out of his way more, and more, by him that he opposeth: For if he seek occasion to evade the force of the Argument, he may do it well, and salve his credit to, and the deceit shall not easily be perceiv'd. In like manner the opponent for his part, may by Syllogism draw his answerer, though a wary person, almost whether he pleaseth, and impose upon him by <hi>Terms,</hi> and fallacious <hi>Contexture</hi> of words, although he be one that understands consequence well, in <hi>plain</hi> reasoning: And so in this way, men may talk endless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but come to no result; and when they are weary of ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, they may sit down, if they please, but be it when, and where they will, they know not how they came thither, nor what is become of the Question at first debated. This is the usual issue of all <hi>Syllogistical disputes;</hi> But in the <hi>Platonical,</hi> and <hi>Socratical</hi> method, these extravagancies may easily be avoided: which therefore I think to be the better way for <hi>men,</hi> that would find truth, and inform one another: But for the <hi>Youth</hi> that would <hi>try</hi> their wits, and appear subtile in arguing, <hi>Syllogisms</hi> may be proper for their purposes.</p>
               <p>For PHYSIOLOGY; They did not sit down in any <hi>System,</hi> or <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> as <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>establish'd:</hi> They consider'd the <hi>incomprehensible</hi> wisdom that is in the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> the <hi>difficulties</hi> that occur in the seeming <hi>plainest</hi> things; the <hi>scantness,</hi> of our largest knowledge, and shallowness of our deepest enquiries; of which I spoke before: and therefore gave but <hi>timerous</hi> assent to <hi>any</hi> notions in <hi>Natural Philosophy:</hi> They held no <hi>infallible</hi> Theory <hi>here:</hi> Nor would they allow any speculations, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Nature to be <hi>more</hi> then <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture: And <hi>these</hi> they taught were not to be rais'd from <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted notions,</hi> and the unassisted operations of the mind, but to be collected leasurely from a careful <hi>observation</hi> of <hi>particulars:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53288:167"/>
So that they thought, with much reason, that the best <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> for <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> would be a good <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Nature:</hi> This they saw to be very defective in their Time, and that while it remain'd in that imperfection, the knowledge of Nature, and the use of it, would be very scanty, and inconsiderable: But that from its <hi>inlargement, more,</hi> and <hi>surer</hi> Light might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and the uses of Life, and Empire of man over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, might be greatly promoted, and advanc'd. For These ends the Foundation of <hi>Solomon's House,</hi> about that time, was lai'd; and <hi>This</hi> divers of them thought the best design that ever was for <hi>increasing</hi> Natural Knowledge, and the advantages of Humane Life, and infinitely beyond all the <hi>disputing, notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> ways, from which nothing could arise, but <hi>dispute,</hi> and <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> They consider'd this method of joint endeavours, in such a royal, and noble Assembly, about the <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> and effects of Nature, to be the way to make <hi>Philosophy operative,</hi> and <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> To take it off from spending it's strength in forming vain <hi>Ideas</hi> of fancy, and wrangling endlesly about <hi>Chimaeras;</hi> and to make an <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>Action,</hi> and profitable works.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding <hi>this,</hi> They did not wholly slight <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hypotheses,</hi> and Philosophical conjectures: No, They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd into all the considerable speculations, that are extant, both <hi>Antient,</hi> and <hi>Modern;</hi> though they addicted not themselves to any of the Sects of Philosophers: They <hi>rejected</hi> no probable Opinion with <hi>contempt;</hi> nor <hi>entertain'd</hi> any, with <hi>fondness:</hi> They doated on none, because they were <hi>Antient;</hi> nor did they contemn any, because they were <hi>new:</hi> But receiv'd the likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods of Truth, and Knowledge of <hi>any date,</hi> from <hi>any hand,</hi> or in <hi>any dress.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I ask'd, whether these men were not enemies to <hi>Ari-stotle,</hi> and <hi>his Philosophy?</hi> He answer'd, That They gave that respect to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that was due to his <hi>antiquity, parts,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> in the World: That they read his Books, and thought <hi>as well</hi> of him, as of some others of the <hi>Philosophers:</hi> That they gladly receiv'd any of the Truths, or Probabilities, that he taught: But then, That they did not make his Authority <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute;</hi> or slavishly submit their judgments to all his Dictates; They did not reckon him <hi>infallible</hi> in Philosophy; no nor yet
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53288:168"/>
free from many actual, great mistakes: They did not prefer his judgment before <hi>all</hi> the <hi>elder</hi> Philosophers, or those of his own time; Nor did they think he was without <hi>Equal,</hi> or <hi>Superiors,</hi> both in Knowledge, and Vertue: They had not that <hi>partial, unjust</hi> fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for him, that the <hi>Moores,</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> and some other vain men had, to the prejudice, and disvalue of the Philosophers, that were before Him, from whom he took most of his Notions.</p>
               <p>He said, That the <hi>Philosophy</hi> taught in some common Schools, for <hi>Aristotle's,</hi> was a <hi>depravation,</hi> and <hi>corruption</hi> of it: That it was but <hi>Monkery,</hi> and <hi>Moorish</hi> Ignorance formed into <hi>idle,</hi> and <hi>unintelligible whimsies.</hi> That the main Principles, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and Soul of that Philosophy, <hi>Their first matter, Substantial Forms,</hi> and <hi>Qualities,</hi> were meer <hi>Imaginations,</hi> that had no ground either from <hi>Sense,</hi> or <hi>Reason:</hi> That they were utterly unaccountable in themselves; and served no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Knowledge or Life: But rendred all the Philosophy that was built on them <hi>fantastical,</hi> and <hi>useless.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other side he said, That the <hi>Corpuscular Philosophy</hi> was the <hi>eldest,</hi> and most accountable Doctrine: That it was as <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi> as <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> it self: That it was <hi>applicable</hi> to the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and that it was very <hi>easie,</hi> and <hi>intelligible: This</hi> Theory, added he, those Philosophers preferred much to the <hi>other</hi> of <hi>Qualities</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> which in <hi>comparison</hi> is <hi>novel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They examined the Philosophy of your <hi>Gassendus,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd, and amplified the <hi>Atomical</hi> Doctrine: And enquired into the <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of that other great man of your World, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus Descartes;</hi> Both whose works had been brought hither, by our Missionaries. This <hi>làtter</hi> they consider'd, and studied much, and in him they found a prodigious wit, and clear thoughts, and a wonderfully ingenious Fabrick of Philosophy, which they thought to be the neatest <hi>Mechanical</hi> System of things that had appear'd in the World; However, they adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to it, as the <hi>certain</hi> Account of Nature; nor yielded their assent as to <hi>positive,</hi> and <hi>establish'd</hi> Truth; But entertain'd what they thought <hi>probable,</hi> and <hi>freely dissented</hi> in other matters. Yea some of them, who thought highly of his <hi>Mechanical</hi> wit, and believ'd he had carried matter and motion as far they could go; declar'd earnestly <hi>against</hi> the <hi>compleatness,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53288:168"/>
of his <hi>Hypotheses;</hi> and learnedly shew'd, That the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical</hi> Principles <hi>alone</hi> would not salve the <hi>Phoenomena;</hi> and that his accounts though they were pretty, and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, were yet short, defective, and unsatisfying; and in some things not very agreeing, and consistent. These judg'd that nothing could be done in <hi>Physiology</hi> without admitting the <hi>Platonical</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> and so would have the <hi>Mechanical</hi> Principles aided by the <hi>Vital:</hi> But in these matters, others of them had different thoughts; though all <hi>agreed</hi> in the <hi>modesty,</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> of judgment and discourse.</p>
               <p>As to MORAL PHILOSOPHY, They did by no means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the <hi>Contentious, Disputing Ethicks,</hi> that turn'd that useful knowledge, into Systems of unprofitable niceties, and notions; and made it (as <hi>Cicero</hi> speaks) to be rather <hi>Ostentatio Scientiae,</hi> then <hi>Lex Vitae:</hi> But they founded <hi>theirs,</hi> upon the excellent <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>Humane Nature</hi> and <hi>Passions:</hi> Into <hi>these</hi> they inquir'd much, and observ'd the various inclinations, and workings of the Humours, and Appetites of Men; especially they studied <hi>themselves,</hi> and entred into the recesses of their own souls: Nor did they stop here, but formed their knowledge, and observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into solid <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> for the commanding of their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and bounding their desires, and governing themselves, by the Laws of Vertue and Prudence. <hi>Such</hi> were their <hi>Ethicks;</hi> and their Tempers, and Practices were suitable.</p>
               <p>For though they were men of rais'd understandings, and great learning; Yet were they not, in the least, haughty, or conceited; but their behaviour was generally most sweet, and obliging: They cared for no mans <hi>wit,</hi> that wanted <hi>goodness;</hi> and despis'd no mans <hi>weakness,</hi> that had it: They hated the humour of those learned men, who were <hi>stately,</hi> and <hi>imposing;</hi> and dislik'd nothing more then <hi>Ill-nature:</hi> whatever their own was by Birth and Temper, their care was to make it sweet, by Discipline and Usage; and so, exercis'd their Moral Pinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Rules upon themselves: They were no admirers of <hi>Popularity,</hi> but pitied those that were at pains for Air and noise: They followed a sober, vertuous course, without flanting shews, and pretensions; and liv'd in an innocent, even cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, without rapture, on the one hand, or dejection, on
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53288:169"/>
the other: They were <hi>free</hi> in their Conversations, and not <hi>superstitiously</hi> scrupulous about things that are harmless and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. But, said the Governour; I consider, I need not insist thus on the description of their <hi>Moral</hi> Temper of Spirit; It may be collected in <hi>these,</hi> and many other particulars, from what hath been said before: And therefore I now pass imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to their</p>
               <p>METAPHYSICKS, About which, I must first tell you, That they had no opinion of <hi>those</hi> of the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Schools, which consisted of <hi>Logical niceties,</hi> and <hi>empty notions,</hi> that sophisticated mens reasons, and inclin'd them to hover in <hi>abstracted</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and to rest in meer <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Art;</hi> to the neglect of the more <hi>material</hi> ratiotinations: <hi>Such Metaphysicks</hi> were in use at that time in the <hi>Vniversities</hi> of <hi>Bensalem;</hi> and therefore out of respect to the Statutes of those Seats of <hi>Learning,</hi> They did not professedly endeavour to expose those studies: No, They were against rude and violent <hi>Innovations;</hi> But yet as they had opportunity, they prudently advis'd such Youth as they knew, to take care that they did not <hi>dwell</hi> on those <hi>Aery Notions;</hi> or reckon of them, as any part of that <hi>standing Knowledge,</hi> which they were to use, through the course of their future lives: They allowed them for <hi>exercise,</hi> but caution'd against the reception of them, as <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Science.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I ask'd, whether Those men were against <hi>all Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks?</hi> or <hi>what sort</hi> they allowed? He made answer; That They were not against <hi>all.</hi> But that</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some of them counted, <hi>The explication</hi> of <hi>General Terms,</hi> and <hi>notions</hi> of things to appertain to Metaphysicks; and <hi>this</hi> they reckon'd to be most necessary, and useful for the avoiding confusions, and mistakes in reasoning: So that they never entred into any Controversie, or Enquiry, without stripping the words, and notions, they were to treat of, from all <hi>fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi> and <hi>borrowed</hi> senses, and fixing them in their natural, and genuine acception: Knowing, that most disputes and errours in reasoning arise from <hi>mistakes</hi> of <hi>simple Terms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But then <hi>others</hi> of Them, who as highly esteem'd of <hi>this</hi> course, judg'd it to belong to <hi>Logick,</hi> and that it was not to be brought under <hi>this</hi> science, the only object of which, <hi>They</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53288:169"/>
made the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Immaterial</hi> World: And in this sort of <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> the <hi>Science</hi> of <hi>Spirits,</hi> they were not all of one Opinion; For some were for the Doctrine of <hi>Plato,</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sprita, extended, penetrable, indiscerpible, self-motive</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances: Whereas <hi>others</hi> thought with <hi>Descartes,</hi> that <hi>extention, motion,</hi> and the like Attributes, belong'd only to <hi>Bodies,</hi> and had nothing to do with <hi>Spirits,</hi> which could be <hi>defin'd</hi> by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but <hi>Thinking,</hi> and the <hi>Modes</hi> of it. But this difference in Opinion produc'd no rudeness, or heats of opposition, only it gave exercise some times, to their wits, in their private <hi>Philosophical</hi> entertainments.</p>
               <p>As for the Doctrine of the common Schools of <hi>Tota in Toto</hi>—Both sides esteem'd it <hi>contradictious,</hi> and <hi>vain:</hi> And knew, that this was one great occasion of the <hi>Sadducism,</hi> and disbelief of <hi>Spiritual Beings,</hi> which was so much the Mode of that age.</p>
               <p>I said, That I had heard something of both these Doctrines; And that each of them seem'd to me, to contain opinions that were very <hi>strange;</hi> adding, that I desir'd to know, whether those Gentlemen entertain'd the conceits, that the <hi>old Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> and <hi>our Cartesians</hi> did, in <hi>their Hypotheses?</hi> He ask'd me <hi>what notions</hi> I meant; I answer'd, That the <hi>Platonists</hi> held, There was an <hi>Anima Mundi;</hi> and the <hi>Praeexistence</hi> of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Souls, things seemingly very uncouth, and absurd. And the <hi>Cartesians,</hi> on the <hi>other</hi> side, taught, That all things were <hi>Mechanical,</hi> but <hi>Humane thoughts,</hi> and operations; and that the <hi>Beasts</hi> were but meer <hi>Automata,</hi> and <hi>insensible machins;</hi> which, said I; seem very odd, and ridiculous fancies.</p>
               <p>As to these Opinions replyed he, They had different thoughts, as other Philosophers have; <hi>Some</hi> of them supposing that the <hi>Platonical</hi> Opinions are very fit to be admitted, to give assistance to the <hi>Mechanical</hi> Principles; which they think very defective of themselves. And <hi>Others</hi> judging, That the <hi>Cartesian Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses</hi> are <hi>probable,</hi> and <hi>Mechanism</hi> sufficient to account for the <hi>Phoenomena;</hi> and that there is no <hi>need</hi> of introducing so hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and obscure a Principle, as the <hi>Soul</hi> of the World.</p>
               <p>In the Matters, and <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> They also take several ways of Opinion: But then, the dissenters to either judgment, do not condemn the opposite, as ridiculous, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53288:170"/>
absurd: Knowing, That there is a great <hi>appearance</hi> of truth in the <hi>contrary</hi> Doctrine; and <hi>no certainty</hi> in <hi>that,</hi> which they approve most.</p>
               <p>As to the Opinion of <hi>Praeexistence</hi> of <hi>souls:</hi> It hath said He, been the Doctrine of many of the <hi>wisest</hi> men of <hi>eldest</hi> times, both <hi>Gentiles, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> and the almost general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the old <hi>Eastern</hi> World: It contains no opposition to any Article of Faith, and some believe, It will give a very plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and fair <hi>solution</hi> of the main, and most <hi>difficult</hi> things in <hi>Providence:</hi> On which accounts it should not, I think, be <hi>rashly,</hi> condemn'd as <hi>absurd;</hi> but may very well deserve to be <hi>heard,</hi> and is very worthy to be examin'd: Though, added He, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm nothing <hi>positively</hi> of it; And I suppose many of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons I describe, were dispos'd to <hi>like</hi> thoughts with <hi>these,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I pray'd him to acquaint me with their Opinion of the MATHEMATICKS? He Answered, That They were great valuers of <hi>those Sciences;</hi> which they accounted excellent <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives,</hi> and helps to <hi>all sorts</hi> of Knowledge, and very ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable <hi>particularly</hi> in <hi>this,</hi> That they us'd the mind to a <hi>close</hi> way of <hi>reasoning,</hi> and were a good Antidote against the <hi>confus'd,</hi> and <hi>wandring</hi> humour of <hi>Disputers:</hi> For which reason, Some of them thought, it would be very well, If they were us'd as the <hi>first Institutions</hi> of the <hi>Academick</hi> Youth; judging, that <hi>these</hi> Sciences would <hi>exercise</hi> the <hi>wit,</hi> as <hi>much,</hi> as the usual <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks,</hi> at least; and beget a much <hi>better habit</hi> in the mind, then those <hi>contentious</hi> studies.</p>
               <p>Besides This, said He, I cannot at present think of any thing <hi>more, considerable,</hi> concerning their inclinations, in <hi>meer Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Knowledge:</hi> But as to their way of <hi>Learning,</hi> as <hi>Divines,</hi> something may be added,</p>
               <p>And with Relation to <hi>this</hi> I may say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they are not much taken with the <hi>School-men,</hi> but rather think, That those <hi>subtile,</hi> and <hi>Angelical</hi> Doctors have done Religion no small disservice, by the numerous <hi>disputes, niceties,</hi> and <hi>distinctions</hi> they have rais'd, about things, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>plain</hi> enough: By which, The <hi>natural,</hi> and <hi>genuine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of mens minds are perverted, and the clear light of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53288:170"/>
Reason, and Truth intercepted, and obscur'd: And they judg'd, There was less cause in the <hi>latter</hi> ages to reckon of <hi>School-Divinity,</hi> since the <hi>Peripatetick Philosophy,</hi> on which it was grounded, grew every where into discredit: So that they thought it not <hi>safe,</hi> to have Religion concern'd, in <hi>that,</hi> which did not <hi>truly</hi> help it; and which was not <hi>now able</hi> to help it self.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They did not admire many of the <hi>Commentators,</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors</hi> of the Scripture: For though they <hi>praised</hi> those Industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men for their <hi>Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> to the <hi>holy</hi> Writings: Yet they did not think much due to divers of their performances. For a considering Man could not but observe, how they kept voluminous stir about the plain Places, which they never left, till they had made <hi>Obscure;</hi> while they let the <hi>difficult</hi> ones pass without notice. Besides which, the manifold <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, Phancies, Disputes, Contradictions</hi> to one another, and the Scriptures, which were observable among those Writers, rendred divers of them of mean account in the Judgment of those Men. However they had a just esteem of many of the <hi>Critical Interpreters,</hi> and <hi>particularly</hi> of those famous Lights of your end the World, well known to us also, <hi>Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Hammondus,</hi> whose learned <hi>works</hi> and <hi>expositions</hi> they beheld with great respect, and veneration.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) As for the <hi>ANTIENT FATHERS;</hi> They valued those greatly of the <hi>first</hi> 300, yea 500 years, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before Christianity was so much mingled with Opinions, and corrupted by disputes; and the various devices of Men: <hi>Their</hi> works they reverenced, because there was much holiness, in those venerable persons, and much simplicity in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and among others, there are two particular reasons, why they had <hi>those sages</hi> in so much esteem.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Because the Controversies they handle, are mostly such, as Concern the <hi>main</hi> things of Religion, in opposition to the <hi>Jews, Heathens,</hi> and some gross <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who undermined the Foundations of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Life: These</hi> were undertakings worthy the zeal, and pains of those holy Ancients; who did not multiply <hi>unnecessary</hi> quarrels, and occasions of dispute; or make <hi>speculative</hi> opinions <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and presently denounce <hi>thick Anathema's</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all, that differed from them in <hi>lesser</hi> matters; But they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53288:171"/>
stuck firmly to the <hi>few, plain</hi> things, and placed their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on principally in a <hi>holy Life,</hi> and lived in <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and frequent <hi>communion: Those</hi> days, and those Men the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifanites</hi> celebrated much, and prayed, and endeavour'd for the <hi>Restauration</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> to <hi>that Primitive Temper:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) They reverenc'd <hi>those Fathers,</hi> because living nearer the times of the Apostles, they had <hi>more</hi> advantages to know their Doctrines, and Government, and Usages, than the ages at a greater remove have: on which Accounts, They attend <hi>more</hi> to <hi>their practises</hi> and <hi>opinions,</hi> then to those of <hi>succeeding</hi> times, when <hi>pride, ambition, covetousness,</hi> and <hi>disputes</hi> had lead Men aside into the various ways of <hi>phancy,</hi> and <hi>faction:</hi> These then they accounted excellent <hi>witnesses</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and our best <hi>Interpreters</hi> of it's <hi>Dectrines,</hi> and <hi>Constitutions;</hi> though they did not make them <hi>Judges</hi> in affairs of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> or reckon all to be <hi>infallible,</hi> that they <hi>did,</hi> or <hi>said.</hi> Thus were they dispos'd towards the <hi>first Fathers.</hi>

               <p>For <hi>Those</hi> of the <hi>following</hi> ages They esteem'd their piety, and zeal; and praised God for the good they did in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; and gave all due acknowledgments to their pious endeavours; and were ready to imbrace their instructions in the ways of Godliness, and Vertue; and willing to receive the evidence of any truth from them: But They did not <hi>equal</hi> them in their estimation with the <hi>Elder Fathers,</hi> nor <hi>superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> doat on <hi>all</hi> their sayings; nor take them for the <hi>best Guides</hi> in <hi>all</hi> the Doctrines of Religion.</p>
               <p>For <hi>those Fathers</hi> lived in the disputing ages, when pride, and interest and prevailing faction had espoused <hi>opinions,</hi> as <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and made Men quarrel, and divide, and break the peace of the Church, of the World, for <hi>Trifles;</hi> They much differ'd from one another; and some of them, at times, from themselves; and many of them, in <hi>some things,</hi> from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>more primitive</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity: They disputed often with much eagerness; and were very angry with each other about things of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and vented unseemly passions, and were too often very impatient of Contradiction, and different judgment. They, some of them spoke hastily, and determined too soon in a heat, against <hi>one kind of opposites;</hi> and then, forgot at another time, and
<pb facs="tcp:53288:171"/>
affirm'd the quite contrary, against an <hi>other sort</hi> of <hi>Adversaries:</hi> They made too much of their opinions, and were many times too severe to harmless dissenters. <hi>These,</hi> and divers more such, were the weaknesses of <hi>many,</hi> of those Reverend Men: which I do not mention, said He, to detract from their worth in <hi>other</hi> things, or to lessen their just honour and valuation: but to shew you some of the things, which, 'tis like, were the reasons, why those Divines did not esteem of the <hi>latter,</hi> as they did of the <hi>most ancient Fathers.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>These,</hi> and such like, I say, I judg might be the reasons: But They themselves were very cautious in saying any thing that might look like detractions, or disesteem of those venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Persons: They contented themselves to omit poring on such of them, as They thought there might be less cause to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, or less need to study; without discovering their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and imperfections; or discouraging others from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their inclinations to converse with them. Yea, they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected not to read them themselves, as they had time, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion: But then, they read them not with design to gather <hi>fine sentences</hi> to adorn their discourses, nor to gain <hi>Authorities</hi> in speculative matters, to confirm their opinions: But to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove</hi> their <hi>reasons,</hi> to get <hi>direction</hi> from their <hi>pio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="4">(4.) About their opinion of the <hi>Rabinical Learning:</hi> Among the Authors of <hi>this</hi> sort, diverse of them were very conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant: not out of any great esteem of the <hi>Men,</hi> or their <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> but from a desire to acquaint themselves by Them, with the <hi>Doctrines, Terms</hi> of speech, and <hi>Customes</hi> of the Jews, in order to their better understanding of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>defence</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> against those enemies of the Cross. On these accounts, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, with which their Books
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53288:172"/>
were loaded, to be very useful for a Divine, and like to be of more behoof to him, than all the tedious volumes of the <hi>Schoolmen:</hi> And some thought, it would not be amiss, if the <hi>Rabbins</hi> succeeded in those places, which those <hi>other Doctors,</hi> were leaving <hi>vacant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, said He, I have also given you a Taste of the Genius, and Humour of those Divines in some <hi>chief</hi> parts of <hi>Learning:</hi> And though I have mentioned only <hi>some particular</hi> sorts, yet I do not thereby exclude them from their share in the <hi>Languages, History,</hi> and other kinds of knowledg; which I have omitted in this account, only, because their sence of them, for the most part, was <hi>common</hi> with the judgment, and opinion of other learned Men.</p>
               <p>I have represented to you their Genius and endeavours, not with design (as I intimated before) to exalt, and magnifie <hi>them</hi> above the other Divines of <hi>Bensalem,</hi> but to shew how the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God over-rul'd those evil times, in which those Men were bred, and to raise a good and generous Spirit amid the extravagances of an unhappy age: and I have thus particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly described their Principles, and Practices, not to exclude other worthy, and Reverend Men (with which, thanks be to God, this Church abounds) from the share of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are due to their pious, and excellent Labours, but because those Persons are better known to me, than any others of our Clergy.</p>
               <p>At this Period of his discourse, a Servant came in, and with low reverence, acquainted the Governor that some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of quality were come to speak with him. Upon which, he rising up, told me, He was sorry for this interruption, but hoped ere long, to have the freedom of another opportunity of Conversing with me.</p>
