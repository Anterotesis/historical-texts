            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>teor called <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Polinx</hi> appeares single to the Sea-faring Men, it portends a dangerous Tempest, because of the density or toughnesse of the matter which is not easily dissolved: And when it appeares double divided into two, it presageth Serenity and a good Voyage. But it is otherwise in the Body Politick. When the King and Parliament are united, it promiseth Happy and Halcionian Dayes to the Subject; and when they appeare divided, it threatens Ruine and Dissipation to the whole Kingdome. This is our present condition, the Heads are drenched with the oyle of Discord, and it runs down to the skirts of the Garment. Of all Hereticks in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, they were the worst who made two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
<pb facs="tcp:48224:3"/>
a God of Good and a God of Evill: Of all Hereticks in Policy, they are the most dangerous, which make the Common-wealth an <hi>Amphisbena,</hi> a Serpent with two heads, who make two Supreames without subordination one to another, the King and the Parliament. That is to leave a Seminary of Discord, to lay a Trappe for the Subject to set up a Rack for the Conscience, when Superiours sends out contrary Commands (as the Commission of Array, and the Order for the <hi>Milita.)</hi> If they were subordinate one to another, we had a safe way both to discharge our Conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and secure our Estates to the World, that is by obeying the Higher Power according to that golden Rule, <hi>in presentia Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joris cessat authoritas Minoris.</hi> But whilest they make them coordinate one with another, the Estate, the Liberty, the Life, the Soule of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Subject lies at Stake: what passage can poor Conscience find between this <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis,</hi> between the two hornes of this <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma?</hi> No Man can serve two Masters.</p>
            <p>All great and sudden Changes are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the Body Naturall, but much more to the Body Politick. Time and Custome beget
<pb facs="tcp:48224:3"/>
Reverence and Admiration in the minds of all men; frequent Alterations produce nothing but Contempt, Break ice in one place, it will crack in more. Mountebankes, Projectors, and Innovators, alwayes promise golden Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, but their performance is seldome worth a cracked Groat. The credulous Asse in the Fable believed, that the Wolf (his counterfeit Phisiitian) would cure him of all his Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and lost his skin for his labour. When the Devill tempted our first Parents, he assured them of a more happy Estate, then they had in Paradise: but what saith our common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe seldome comes the better. It is the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, that nothing should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly blessed in this World, yet it is our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to impute all our sufferings to our present condition, and to believe a change would free us from all Imcombrances. So thought the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, when they changed their Consulls into <hi>Consulary Tribunes:</hi> So thought the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines when they cashiered their <hi>Decem-Viri;</hi> both found the disadvantage of their Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; both were forced to shake hands again with their old Friends. Other Nations have used to picture an English man with a paire of
<pb facs="tcp:48224:4"/>
sheares in his hand, thus deriding our newfan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glednesse in attire: But it is farr worse to be shaping new Creeds every Day, and new forms of Government, according to each mans pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate humour. When a sick man tosseth from one side of his bed to another, yet his Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per followes him. They say our Countryman never knowes when he is well, but if God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty be graciously pleased once again to send us Peace, I trust we shall know better how to value it. In the mean time, let us take heed of credulity and newfanglednesse. Those States are most durable, which are most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to their own Rules. The glory of <hi>Venice</hi> is perpetuated not so much by the strong Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as by that Sanction or Constitution, that it is not lawfull for any man to make mention of a new Law to the grand Counsell, before it have been first discussed and allowed by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Company, of their most intelligent most experienced Citizens. Among the <hi>Locrians</hi> no man might propose a new Law, but with an halter about his neck, that if he did not speed in his suite, he might presently be strangled. The Lacedemonians did so farr abhorre from all study of change, that they banished a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

            <p>I desire that no man will interpret what I say in this Discourse as intended to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the lawfull Rights, and just priviledges of Parliament. The very name of a Parliament was Musick in our eares; at the Summons thereof our hearts danced for joy. It is rather to be feared that we idollized Parliaments, and trusted more in them then in God for out temporall well being. God who gave the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> a King in his anger, may at his pleasure give us a Parliament in his anger. That we reap not the expected fruit (next to our sins) we may thank the Observator, and such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries. I confesse my selfe the most unfit of thousands to descend into this Theater, as one who have lived hitherto a Mute; but to see the Father of our Country threatned and villified by a common Souldier, is able to make a dumb man speak, as it did sometimes the Sonne of <hi>Craesus. Quando doler est in capite</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Bernard)</hi> when the head akes the tongue cries for assistence, and the very least members, the Toe, or the litle Finger is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

I pretend not to skill in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, the Observator may have read more Bookes and more Men, but let him not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise a weak Adversary who comes armed with evident truth, I know I have the better cause, the better second. The Birds in <hi>Aristophanes</hi> fancying an all-sufficiency to themselves, did attempt for a while to build a City walled up to Heaven, not much unlike such another Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Apes in <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> but at length the one for feare of <hi>Iupiters</hi> Thunder, and the other for want of convenient tooles, gave over the Enterprise. Believe it, the frame of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, glorious, well-temper'd, and setled Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, though it may be shaken for a time, will not, cannot be blown upside down, with a few windy Exhalations, or an handfull of Sophisticall squibbes. The World begins to see something through the holes of these mens cloakes, and to espye Day through the midst of the Milstone. And now that men may bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a word edgeway with them, it will be pealed into their eares dayly.</p>

I shall deale more ingenuously with the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server, then he hath done with his Soveraigne, to catch here and there at a piece of a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and passe by that as mute as a Fish, to which he had nothing to say. If His Majesties cleare. Demonstrations (which to a strong judgement seeme to be written with a beam of the Sun, and like the principles of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry doe rather compell then perswade) did leave any place for further confirmation, the Observers silence were sufficient to proclaime them unanswerable. There needs no other proofe of His Majestyes Lenity and Goodnesse then this, That a Subject dare publish such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations in a Monarchy, and maintain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with his Liege Lord, <hi>Multa donanda inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niis, sed donanda vitia, non portenta sunt.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth small pitty, who priseth his word more then his Head. King <hi>Lewes</hi> said of some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Preachers in <hi>France, If they tax me in their Pulpits I will send them to preach in another Climate. Pollio</hi> said of <hi>Angustus, Non est facile in eum scribere, qui potest proscribere.</hi> The King of the Bees, though he want a sting, yet is he sufficiently armed with Majesty. So should King <hi>Charles</hi> be to the Observer and his pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes
<pb facs="tcp:48224:6"/>
if they were profitable Bees, as they are a nest of Waspes and Hornets.</p>
            <p>I find two branches of this Family (I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call them the Family of Love) as a verse one to another as <hi>Sampsons</hi> Foxes. It is hard to say whether is the ancient House; for they both sprung up, the one in <hi>Spaine,</hi> the other at <hi>Geneva,</hi> about the same time, the yeare 1536. The Captaines of the one are <hi>Bellarmine, Simancha, Mariana,</hi> &amp;c. The chieftains of the other, are <hi>Beza</hi> (if it be his Book <hi>de jure Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus,</hi> as is believed,) <hi>Buchanan, Stephanus Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> &amp;c. The former in favour of the Pope, the latter in hatred of the Pope; yet both former and latter may rise up in Judgement with our Incendiaries and condemne them; for if they had had as gracious a Prince as King <hi>Charles;</hi> they had never broached such tenets to the World, I have busied my selfe to find out the Progenitors of these two different Parties: and for the former, I cannot in probabillity derive them from any other then Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> Who it seemes (as the Oestridge) left an egge in the Sand, which after a long revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time, was found and hatched by the care of some Loyolists, for thus he in <hi>Aventine, A
<pb facs="tcp:48224:6"/>
Prince is subject to the People, by whose benefit he reignes; whatsoever Power, Riches, Glory, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he hath, he received it from the People, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem Plebs constituit, eundem destituere potest.</hi> As for the latter (because I know they will scorn to ascribe their Originall to a Pope) I cannot fine one of their Ancestors in all the Church of Christ, for fifteen hundred yeares, untill I come as high as Saint <hi>Iudes</hi> dreamers, or the Pharisees of whom <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, that they were a <hi>Sect, cunning, arrogant, and opposite to Kings.</hi> And they have one Pharasaicall virtue in great eminency, that is, self-love and partiallity, to make their own case different from all other mens, as may appeare by these particulars.</p>
            <p>First, a question is moved concerning the Kings Supremacy in Ecclesiasticall Affaires. They give Power to Kings to reforme the Church, just as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> gives to the Pope to depose Princes, not certainly, but contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, in the case of an ungodly Clergy (that is in their sense, all other but themselves:) but if they be once introduced, neither King nor Parliament have any more to doe, but execute their Decrees, then <hi>the whole Regiment of the Church, is committed by Christ to Pastors, Elders,
<pb facs="tcp:48224:7"/>
and Deacons,</hi> so Cartwright; then <hi>Magistrates must remember to subject themselves, submit their Scepters, thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Secondly, where they have hope of the King, there the Supreame Magistrate may, nay he ought to reforme the Church, yea <hi>though the Statutes of the Kingdome be against it,</hi> so say the Authors of the Protestation printed 1605. But what if the King favour them not? then he is but <hi>a conditionall trustee, it belongeth to the States and representative body of the Kingdom:</hi> but what if the Nobility will not joyne? <hi>then the People must,</hi> so said <hi>Field, since we cannot bring this to passe by Suite, or Dispute, the People and Multitude must doe it,</hi> yea, <hi>though it be with blood,</hi> as Martin threatens in his Protestation. <hi>The People</hi> (saith Buchanan) <hi>have as much pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over Kings, as Kings have over particular Persons. Nobility</hi> (saith the Book of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) <hi>is the Bounty of the People to some Persons, for delivering them from Tyrants, which preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the Children kept, by the Peoples negligence.</hi> And of late, have not the Peers been exhorted
<pb facs="tcp:48224:7"/>

By these reverend. Fathers (I mean the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) the Discipline was brought into <hi>Genevah</hi> it self, against the will of the <hi>Syndicks,</hi> and two Councels. <hi>In illa promiscua colluvie suffragiis fui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus superiores,</hi> saith <hi>Calvin.</hi> Thus these men make Kings and Nobles, but as Counters which stand somtimes for a pound, somtimes for a penny <hi>pro arbitrio supputantis,</hi> just like <hi>Chawcers</hi> Frier, he knew how to impose an easy Pennance, where he looked for a good Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:48224:8"/>
Laws, and Declarations against Arbitrary Government. Now the Law is become a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallity, a Lesbian Rule, Arbitrary Government is turned to necessity of State. It is not exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned what is just or unjust, but how the party is affected or disaffected, whether the thing be conducible or not conducible to the cause; we are governed not by the known Laws and Customs of this Realme, but by certain farr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetched, dear-bought Conclusions, or rather Collusions, drawn by unskilfull Empericks, without Art or Judgement from the Law of Nature and of Nations, which may be good for Ladyes by the Proverbe, but not for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Subjects. Now are we taught down-right, that <hi>the Laws of the Land are but mans-inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, morall precepts, fitter for Heathens then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; that we must lead our Lifes according to Gods word,</hi> (as if Gods word and the Law of the Land, were opposite one to another) and that notwithstanding the Law, men must <hi>not thinke that Gods Children in doing the work of their Heavenly Father</hi> (that is, reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion) <hi>will faint in their Duty</hi> (that is, in raising Arms.) So, farewell <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Laws of England for ever, if this man may

have his will: and welcome the judiciall Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> Now I see the reason, why they have taught so long, that the King cannot pardon any crime condemned by the judiciall Law; because no Man can dispence with the Law of God, But how many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thousands have been drawn into this action which never Dreamed of such a bottomlesse Gulfe of Mischief, and when they doe see it will abhominate it, and the Contrivers of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they have cryed Bishops out of Parliament, because no man that warreth must intangle himself with the affaires of this Life: yet they themselves have been humble Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, both in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have a number of wise and grave Ministers admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Parliament, in stead of Bishops.

the people that <hi>their zeal to God may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by their Duty to the King,</hi> that by the Christian Labours of their painfull Preachers, <hi>they may not want hands to bring their wishes to passe,</hi> (they are their own words.)

            <p>Treason never yet wanted a cloake, we are not to judge of Rebells by their Words, but by their deeds; their voice is <hi>Iacobs</hi> voice, but their hands are the hands of <hi>Esau.

Among others, that Speech which exhorts us to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the pride of Kings; to purchase a Parity in the Church with a parity in the State; to shed the blood of the ungodly; that sleights all former Oaths and Obligations, and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Laws of the Land as the inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men: may be a sufficient Warning-Piece to all Loyall Subjects and good Christians. And so may the late Petition be, though from meaner Hands to a Common Councell, wherein they doe nakedly and professedly fall

upon His Majesties Person without any Mask, and sawcily and traytorously propose the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Civill Government, which every true-hearted English Man will detest.

And who sees not that this is cast abroad thus by the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their sublimated and Mercuriall Prompters, to try how it will rellish with the palate of the People, as an Introduction to their actuall Designe, that when it comes to passe, the World may not wonder at it as a Prodigie.

            <p>First he supposeth that all Dominion, is from the grant or consent of the People; whereas in truth all Dominion in the abstract is from God. The People could not give what they never had, that is, power of Life and Death: But true it is, that Magistrates in the concrete, are stiled <hi>the Ordinance of Man;</hi> subjectively because they are Men, objectively because <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13.</note> they raigne over Men, and many times effectively, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are created or elected by Men. But this last holds not in all cases, I say nothing of such Kings as were named immediately by God: Those whose Predecessors or themselves have attained to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty by the Sword, by Conquest in a just Warre, claime immediately from God. Those also who were the first Owners or Occupants of waste Lands, might admit Tenents or Subjects upon such Conditions as they themselves would prescribe. Thirdly, those who plant at excessive Charge in remote parts of <hi>America,</hi> will give and not take Laws from their Colonies. Fourthly, upon the spreading of a numerous Family, or the great increase of Slaves and Servants, <hi>ditis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen domus,</hi> how often have the Fatherly or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrall power been turned into Royalty? And though these were but petty Kingdoms at the first; yet as great Rivers grow from the Confluence of many little Brooks; so by Warrs, Marriages, and Treaties, they might be enlarged.

All the first Governours were Kings. Both Forms are warranted by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but not both in the same Degree of Eminency. If an old Man had the eye of a young Man, he would see as well as a young Man (said the Philosopher) the Soule of an Ideot is as rationall, as the Soule of a States man, the difference is in the Organ: So the Soule of Soveraign Power, which is infused by God into Democracy or Aristocracy, is the same that it is in Monarchy: but seeing the Organ is not so apt to attain to the end, and seeing that God and Nature do alwayes intend what is best; and lastly, seeing that in some Cases the existence of Government as well as the essence is from God, who never inst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>There is a double right considerable; the right to the Crown, and the right of the Crown: the right and title to the Crown is with us undoubted, there needs no Angell from Heaven to confirme it, where no man can pretend against it. The Right of the crown is the onely subject in question. This is from the Law of God, the Law of Nature, and the Law of Nations. That this Power in an absolute Conquerer may be limited by Statutes, Charters, or municipall Laws, in Court of Conscience, in Court of Justice, to God, to his People, I grant, without communicating So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Power to subordinate or inferiour Subjects, or subjecting Majesty to censure: Which Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraseth this to be <hi>troubling</hi> of a Church, or of a State: It is a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>taphor taken from a Vessell wherein is Liquour of severall parts, some more thick, others more subtile, which by shaking together is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, and the dreggs and residence is lifted up from the bottome to the toppe. The Observer hath learned how to take Eeles; It is their own Rule, they that would alter the Government, must first trouble the State.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>posito sed non concesso,</hi> admitting, but not granting, that Power is originally inherent in the People, what is this to us who have an excellent forme of Government established, and have divested our selves of this Power? can we play fast and loose and resume it again at our pleasures? <hi>Lesbia</hi> was free to choose her selfe an Husband when she was a Maide, may she therefore doe it when she is a Wife? Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that His Majesty were elected in His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, yea or in His own Person for him and His Heires, is this Power therefore either the lesse absolute or lesse perpetuall? Admitting that before election, we had power to covenant, yea, or condition by what Laws we would be governed, had we therefore power
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48224:23"/>
to condition that they should be no longer Laws, then they listed us? This were to make our Soveraigne not a great and glorious King, but a plain Christmasse Lord: or have we therefore Power still to raise Arms to alter the Laws by force, without Soveraigne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? This seems to be the Observers main Scope, but the conclusion is so odious, (as which hath ever been confessed Treason) and the consequence so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly weak, that he is glad to deale altogether Entheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, admitting and granting that the last exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise or execution of Power, that is the <hi>posse commita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or <hi>Regni, is</hi> in the People, is the right also in the People, or from the People? Excuse us if we rather give credit to our Saviour, <hi>Thou could'st have no Power at all against me, except it were given thee from</hi>

Put the case the King grants to a Corporation such and such Magistrates, with power also to them to elect new magistrates (which yet holds but somtimes) from whom do those Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates hold their power? not from the People who elect them, but from the King who creates them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, you tell us that the Power of a King, is to have powerfull Subjects, and to be powerfull in his Subjects, not to be powerfull over his Subjects. Your reason halts, because it wants a <hi>caeteris paribus:</hi> several Kings may have severall advantages of greatnesse. The truth is, neither many powerfull Subjects without obedience, nor forced

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Monarchyes, are indebted for themselves to this lowly beginning of obedience. It is not to be a King of Kings, nor a King of slaves, nor a King of Devills, (you may remember to whom that was applied,) but to be the King of Hearts, and Hands, and Subjects, of many rich, loving, and dutifull Subjects, that makes a powerfull Prince. As for the present puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance of <hi>France,</hi> can you tell in what Kings Reigne it was greater since <hi>Charlemaine?</hi> Neverthelesse admitting that the Peasants in <hi>France</hi> (as you are pleased to call them) suffer much: yet nothing neare so much as they have done in seditious times, when Civill Warr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If the Subjects of <hi>France</hi> be Peasants, and the Subjects of <hi>Germany</hi> be Princes, God send us Englishmen to keep a mean; between both extremes, which our Fore-Fathers found most expedient for all parties.</p>

            <p>Thus we see your Premisses are weake and naught, <note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> your argument proceeds from the staffe to the corner, and your whole discourse is a Rope of Sand. First, your ground-work (that the People is the Fountain and efficient of Power) totters, and is not universally true.

            <p>Next, your inference from hence which in this place you call <hi>just,</hi> and a little after say, that <hi>nothing is more known or assented unto,</hi> that the King is <hi>singulis major</hi> but <hi>universis minor,</hi> greater then any of his Subjects singly considered, but lesse then the whole collected Body, is neither just, nor known, nor assented unto unlesse in

that Body, you include His Majesty as a principall Member. And yet if that should be granted you, before it would doe you any good, these <hi>universi,</hi> or this whole Body, must be reduced to the Major or greater part, and this diffused and essentiall Body must be contracted to a representative Body (unlesse we may believe your new Learning, that the Essentiall and Representative Body are both one.) But waving all these advantages, tell me Sir, might you be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to follow <hi>Licurgus</hi> his advise, to try this Discipline at home, before you offer it to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth? could you be contented that all your Servants together, or the Major part of them had power to turne you out of your Mastership, and place your Steward in your roome; or your Children in like case depose you from your Fatherhood? No I warrant you, the case would soone be altered. And when the greatest part of the sheep dislike their Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, must be presently put up his Pipes and be packing? Take heed what you doe, for if the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be greater then the King, it is no more a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy but a Democracy.

Howsoever, we see they doe but <hi>rogore le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem</hi> pray a Law, the King enacts it, and as he wills or takes time to advise, so their Acts are binding or not binding.

               <hi>whom a Body Politick compact of all sorts and degrees of people, divided into terms, and by names of Spiritualty and Temporalty, being bounden and owen next to God a naturall and humble obedience, he being instituted and furnished by the goodnesse and sufferance of Almighty God with plenary, whole, and entire Power, Preeminence, Authority &amp;c.</hi> Now Sir observe, first that not onely individuall Persons, but the whole compacted Body Politicke of the Kingdome, are not onely lesse then His Majesty, but doe owe unto him a naturall and humble obedience, (how farr is this from that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty which you ascribe to the representative Body?) Secondly, that the Spiritualty were ever an essentiall part of this Body Politick. Thirdly that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Power is plenary.

It is true, were His Majesty as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is, or you would have him to be, not a true Possessor of Soveraigne Power, but a Keeper onely, as the Roman Dictator or an arbitrary Proctor for the People, your rule had some more shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: but against such evident light of truth to ground a contrary assertion, derogatory to His Majesty, upon the private authority of <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> (no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Authors) were a strange degree of weaknesse or wilfulnesse, especially if we consider, first, upon what a trifling silly Homonomie it is grounded, <hi>quia comites dicuntur quasi socii Reqis, et qui habent soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um habent Magistrum.</hi> If he had called them the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48224:27"/>
Kings Attendents, or subordinate Governours of some certain Province or County, as the Sheriffe <hi>Vice Comes</hi> was their Deputy, there had been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reall in it. Secondly, if we consider, that this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion is as contrary to the Observers own grounds, as it is to truth, for what they <hi>(Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta)</hi> doe appropriate to the House of Lords <hi>curiae Comitum &amp; Baronum,</hi> he attributes to the collective Body of the whole Kingdom, or at the least to both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: that is farr from the Observers meaning and nothing to the purpose. This Catachresticall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travigant expression, with the amphibologicall ground of it, is either confuted or expounded by the Authors themselves, as saying, <hi>the King hath no Peere,</hi> therefore no Companion; that he is <hi>Vicarius Dei</hi> Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, that he is not <hi>sub homina,</hi> under Man. And if the words have any graine of truth in them, they must be undestood not of an Authorative, but onely of a Consultive Power to advise him, or at the most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probative, to give their assent to Laws propounded, he having limited himselfe to make no Laws without them. So we may say a Mans promise is his Master; as if a man should say that the Judges in the House of Peers, who have no Votes, but are meere assistents, yet in determining controversies in point of Law, are in some sort superiour to the Lords, not in Power which they have none, but in skill and respect of that dependence, which the Lords may have upon their Judgement and integrity.</p>

               </gap>doe what they have done. Secondly, for your <hi>magic tale,</hi> there is a caution in this Canon, that the same quality must be both in the cause and in the effect, which yet is not alwayes, not in this very case, it must be in causes totall essentiall and univocall, such as this is not. The Sun is the cause of heat, yet it is not hot it selfe, <hi>Sol &amp; homo generant hominem viventem,</hi> yet the Sun lives not. If two Litigants consent to license a third Person to name another for Arbitrator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, he may elect a Judge, not be a Judge. Yet I shall not deny you any truth, when and where the antecedent consent of free societies not preinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, doth instrumentally conferr and convey, or rather applie power and authority into the hands of one or more, they may limit it to what terme they please, by what covenants they please, to what conditions they please, at such time as they make their election: yet Covenants and Conditions differ much which you seem to confound, breach of Covenant will not forfeit a Lease, (much lesse an Empire.) I have seen many Covenants between Kings and their People, sometimes of Debt, and many times of Grace, but I doe not remember that ever I read any Conditions, but with some old elective Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> (if they were Kings) long since antiquated, and one onely King of <hi>Polonia.</hi>

You adde and truely, that there ought to be no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of Soveraignty, <hi>but by the same power by which it had its Constitution,</hi> wherein God had his share at least: but this will not serve your turn, if you dare speak out plainly, tell us, when a King is constituted by right of Conquest and long Succession, yea or by the election of a free people, without any condition of forfeiture, or power of revocation reserved (as the <hi>Capuans</hi> gave themselves to the <hi>Romans,)</hi> and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your position it is <hi>established by God,</hi> can the People, or the Major part without grosse Treason at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to dethrone this King, or send him a writ of ease? They that are so zealous in Religion, to have every thing ordered according to the expresse word of God, let them shew but one Text, where ever God did give this Power to Subjects, to reduce their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes to order by Arms. If this were so, Kings were in a miserable condition. Consider the present Estate of Christendome, what King hath not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of sundry Communions and Professions in point of Religion? upon these mens grounds he must be a Tyrant to one party or more. <hi>Moses</hi> seemed a Tyrant to <hi>Korah</hi> and his rebellious Company; Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> did seem Tyrants to <hi>Squire, Parry, Sommervill,</hi> and the Powder-Traytors. <hi>Licur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> of whom <hi>Apollo</hi> once doubted whether he should be numbred among the Gods or Men, was well neere stoned, and had his eyes put out in a popular tumult.

And though Prince and People doe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intend their own respective good, yet it were folly to imagine to atteine to such high ends of such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and concernment, without the mixture of some Dangers, Difficulties, Troubles, and Inconveniences: as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, that since the fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> thornes often grow without roses, but no true ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses without thorns: we must take the rose with the thorn, the one with the other in good part, for better for worse, <hi>fructus transit cum onere</hi> the benefit passeth with the burthen. If we can purchase tranquillity which we intend, with Obedience and Subjection which we must undergoe; we have no cause to complain of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. It is a most wretched Government, where one reall suffering, is not compensated with ten benefits and blessings.</p>
            <p>Again, this publicke good of the people, is (to use your own phrase) either <hi>singulorum</hi> or <hi>universorum,</hi> publicke or private, of particular Subjects, or of the whole Common-wealth: howsoever the actuall intentions of individuall Members of a Society may aime at the private, yet when these two are inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent (as sometimes it falls ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

must not grumble to suffer for the generall good of the Body Politick.</p>
            <p>But you say the end is farr more honourable then the meanes, and the Preservation of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty is the end of Regall Dignity. True, but this preservation must be understood, <hi>sub modo,</hi> according to Law, which is not alterable at the discretion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Men, but with the concurrence both of King and Subjects. Likewise this is to be understood, where the ends are not mutuall (as here they are) the King for the People, and the People for the King: and where the end is not partiall but adaequate (as this is not.) Lastly, the end is more valuable, how? <hi>qua finis</hi> as it is the end in the intention of the efficient, not alwayes in the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thirdly, to the Observers instance of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours in the Barons Warrs, I know not whether Warrs he intends, the former or the latter, or both: This is certain, no party gained by them. They p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fatall and destructive sometimes to the King, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the Barons, sometimes to both, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to the People. And howsoever the name of free Customs and Laws was mae use of as a plausible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, yet it is evident, that Envy, Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>enge, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, Ambition, Lust, Jealousie, did all act their severall parts in them. And if there were any
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48224:36"/>
(as I doubt not there were many) who did solely and sincerely aime at the publicke good, yet it cannot be denyed there was too much stiffenesse, and animosity on both side<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>: a little yielding and bending is better then breaking outright, and more especially Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science requires it of them who are Subjects, and of them who contend for an alteration. <hi>Pliny</hi> relates a Story of two Goats that met in the midst of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row planke, over a swift current, there was no room for one to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>sse by another, neither could turn back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they could not fight it ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ning them both; that which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remained, was that the one couching on the planke made a Bridge for the other to goe over, and so both were saved. But the Subject is so direfull and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, and the remembrance of those times so odious to all good Men, that I passe by it, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ot much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall to the Question in hand: Both Parties are dead and have made their accounts to God, and know long since whether they did well or ill: neither can their example either justifie or condemne our actions. It is probable there were some <hi>Shebahs,</hi> Trumpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Sedition in those dayes, as this Author proves himselfe now: yet none so apt as these <hi>Catalines</hi> to cry out against Incendiar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es. It is a good wish of <hi>Saraviah,</hi> that such seditious Authors might ever be placed in the front of the battle. Yet thus farre the Authors ingenuity doth lead him, to distinguish the Barons then, from His Majesties Opposites now. The Barons then fought for their Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to change the Laws and alter the Government both in Church and Common-wealth, which was the very case of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48224:36"/>
the <hi>Lincolnshire, Yorkeshire,</hi> and Northren Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells in the Dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> I wish none of His Majesties Subjects were involved in it at this present.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whereas he urgeth that a native Prince may disfranchise His Subjects by Force, if He can make a Party, as well as Strangers: either he intends that he may doe it <hi>de facto,</hi> that is true; so may a Thiefe take away an honest mans purse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else that he may doe it <hi>de jure,</hi> lawfully and conscionably; that is most untrue: There is a vast difference betwixt a just Warre and an unjust Oppression. His instance of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> is quite beside the Cushion, his error was threatning and indiscretion, the fault they found was with <hi>Solomon, thy Father hath made our yoke grievous:</hi> And yet it is most certain, they never had so gracious so happy a Reigne as <hi>Solomons</hi> was for Peace &amp; Plenty, who made Silver as plentifull as stones, and Cedars <note place="margin">1.

I have read such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious suppositions as this in late Pamphlets, as of a Pilot seeking to split his Ship upon the rocks: of a Patient calling to his Phisitian for poison; but never read one of them urged in a Classicke Author. Put the case a man is to saile by Sea, the Pilot may runn mad, and seeke to split the Ship upon rocks; shall we therefore make an Ordinance, that it shall not be lawfull for a Pilot to move his rudder according to the alterable face of Heaven, or different disposition of Wind and Weather, before he have consulted and gained the consent of all the Passengers, or at the least of every inferiour Marriner, or of the Major part of them? <hi>Interea perit Nau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If you will prescribe Limits and Bounds and Conditions to Kings, you must find them written in plainer Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters then any you produce hitherto. The Charter of Nature, <hi>Lex nata non data,</hi> is indeed to preserve our selves, as Water contracts it selfe into a Globe or Circle in a dusty place; an Embleme of Association, which cannot be without Nerves, Bonds, Ligaments, Laws, and Kings. What is this against the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, who is the Minister of God for our preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and safety?

            <p>But because the Observer doth so often presse the Charter of Nature, even to the dissolving of <hi>all Oaths and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

First, I affirme though it be nothing to us, (who are free Subjects and might well have been omitted by him, as making nought to his purpose) that even by the Laws of Nature, of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of God, one Man, or a Society of Men might enslave themselves to another for sustenance or protection. All Histories both sacred and profaine are full of Examples, and the Law of God is plaine <hi>Exod. 21. 6. Levit,</hi> 25. 47. &amp;c. And it seems strange, that the Observer should so farr over-reach or beat the aire to no end at all: this confessed truth quite overthrowes his whole structure of tacite trusts and conditions and rebellions against Nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to come nearer our own case, I answer, that though the Law of Nature cannot be destroyed or contradicted, yet it may be limited by the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws of the Land. And so it is; the Observer will not deny it in his own case, though he mete with another measure to his Soveraigne. The

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>here is a new Charter made by which he holds it; that is, the Law of the Land. It is usuall with these Men to divest Men of all due relations, as if it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>lat Treason, notwithstanding the Charter of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, beyond and above both these, there is the Law of God, there is the last Will and Testament of our Saviour, by which we hold our hopes of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, which to Christians must be as the Pillar of Fire to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> a direction when to go, where to stay. Here we read of Tyrants, and of the sufferings of the Saints, but not a word of any tacite trusts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, or of any such rebellion against Nature, or dispensation with Oaths, nor of any resistence by Arms. Certainly there is no one duty more pressed upon Christians by Christ and his Apostles then Obedience to Superiours. <hi>Give unto Caesar that which is Caesars,</hi> saith our Saviour. <hi>Submit your selves to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordinance of Man, for the Lords sake,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Peter.

Again if the King command any thing which is contrary to the known Laws of the Land, if it be by an injury to a third Person, we may not doe it: as for a Judge to deliver an unjust sentence, for every Judge ought to take an Oath at his admission, that he will doe right to every person, <hi>notwithstanding the Kings letters</hi>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Christian in this case? yes, three remedies.</p>
            <p>The first is to cease from sinne, <hi>Rex bonus est dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra, malus sinistra Dei,</hi> a good King is Gods right hand, a bad his left hand, a scourge for our sinnes: as we suffer with patience an unfruitfull yeare, so we must doe an evill Prince as sent by God. <hi>Tollatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The second remedy is prayers and tears, <hi>In that day you shall cry unto the Lord because of your King.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Sam. 7. 18.</note> Saint <hi>Nazianzen</hi> lived under five persecutions and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew other Remedy: he ascribed the death of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> to the prayers and teares of the Christians. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> armed the <hi>Iews</hi> with prayers for <hi>Nebuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> not with daggs and daggers against <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar.</hi> Saint Paul commands to make prayers and supplications for Kings, not to give poison to them. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> could have taken vengeance with a word as well on <hi>Herod</hi> as <hi>Ananias,</hi> but that he knew that God reserves Kings for his own Tribunall. For this cause Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> a Man of known courage, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make use of the forwardnesse of the People against <hi>Valen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ian</hi> the Emperour. And when <hi>Saul</hi> had slayne the Priests of God and persecuted <hi>David,</hi> yet saith <hi>David, who can stretch forth his hand against the Lords anointed and be guiltlesse?</hi> It was Duty <note place="margin">Sam. 26. 9.</note>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:48224:42"/>
and not a singular desire of perfection that held <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> hands; who can stretch out his Hand? No Man can doe it.</p>
            <p>The third remedy is flight, this is the uttermost which our Master hath allowed, <hi>when they perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you in one City fly to another.</hi> But a whole <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> Kingdome cannot fly, neither was a whole Kingdome ever persecuted by a lawfull Prince: private men ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of <hi>Domitians</hi> cruelty, but the Provinces were well governed: The raging desires of one Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly extend to the ruine of all. Nor is this condition so hard for Subjects, <hi>This is thankworthy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> 
               <hi>if a man for Conscience towards God indure grief,</hi> and <hi>if a man suffer as a Christian let him glorifie God on</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.</note> 
               <hi>this behalfe.</hi> This way hath ever proved successefull to Christian Religion: the blood of the Martyrs is the seed of the Church; <hi>caedebantur, torquebantur, nrebantur, &amp; tamen multiplicabantur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all these Remedies are not sufficient, they are nothing, and they that thinke otherwise are stupid fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the judgement of the Observer; unlesse the People have right to preserve themselves <hi>by force of Arms,</hi> yea <hi>notwithstanding any contracts that they have made to the contrary; for every private man may desend himselfe by force if assaulted, though by the force of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> 
               <hi>or his own Father, &amp;c.</hi> First I observe how the Observer enterferes in his Discourse, for in the forty fourth page he telleth us quite contrary, that <hi>the King as to his own Person is not forcibly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled in any ill doing.</hi> But passing by this contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I aske two questions of him, by his good leave, The first is, if a Father should goe about onely to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48224:43"/>
correct his Child and not to kill him or maime him, whether he might in such a case cry Murther Murther, and trie M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>steries with his Father, and allege his own judgement against his Fathers to prove his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency? My second question is, if an inraged Father should offer extreme violence to his Sonne, how far he might resist his Father in this case, whether to give blow for blow, and stabbe for stabbe, or onely to hold his Fathers hands? For if it be a meere resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence without any further active violence, (which is allowable,) if it be onely in extream perills where the life is ind<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngered, and against manifest rage and fury; what the Observer gets by this, he may put in his eye and see never the worse. But to give his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and his instance for it a positive answer, I say further, that this which he calls a Remedy is ten times worse then the disease itselfe, even such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, as the luke-warm blood of Infants newly slain is for the Leprosy: and in this respect worse, that a Leprosy is a disease indeed, but where shall a Man almost read in story of a Father slaughtering his Son (except perhaps some franticke Anabaptist in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Abraham:)</hi> it will not be difficult to find two Sons that have made away their Fathers, for one Father that hath made away his Sonne, notwithstanding the Fathers Authority. So this case is <hi>inter raro aut nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam contingentia,</hi> and may be reckoned amongst the rest of the Observers incredible suppositions, which are answered before in the beginning of this Section. But if the Observers Doctrine were once received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world throughly, for one instance of a Parracide now, we should hear of an hundred. A Mischief is better
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48224:43"/>
then an inconvenience; a Mischief that happens once in an Age, then an inconvenience which is apt to produce a World of Mischiefes every day: as where the King is able to make good his Party, <hi>res facile redeunt ad pristinum statum;</hi> or where Forrein Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces shall engage themselves, on the behalfe of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy it selfe, or perhaps doe but watch for an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to seise upon both parties, as the Kite did on the Frog and the Mouse; and howsoever, where Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Covetousnesse, Envy, Newfanglednesse, Schisme shal gain an opportunity to act their mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous intentions, under the cloake of Justice, and zeal to the Common-wealth. We are now God knowes in this way of Cure which the Observer prescribes. I may say it safely, This Kingdom hath suffered more in the tryall of this remedy in one year, then it hath done under all the Kings and Queenes of <hi>England,</hi> since the union of the two roses, I think I may inlarge it, since the Conquest (except onely such seditious times.) Leave a right to the Multitude to rise in Arms, as often as they may be perswaded there is Danger, by the Observer or some such seditious Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours for their own ends; and every English Subject may write on his doore, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I doe grant, that to levy Arms against the authority of the King, in the absence of his Person is to warre against the King; otherwise we should, have few Treasons. Some desperate Ruffian or two or three Raggamuffins sometimes (but rarely) out of revenge, most commonly upon seditious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and misled by some factious Teachers, may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the Person of the Prince: but all grand

               </gap>ld captive by force and his commands are meerely extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him by duresse and fear of further Mischief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contrary to the dictate of his own reason, (as it was in the case of <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth) there his commands are to be esteemed a nullity of no moment, as a forced marriage or a bond sealed <hi>per minas.</hi> But where the King hath Dominion of his own Actions, though he be actually misled, and much more though he be said to be misled; the case is far otherwise. These three truths with these Cautions I doe admit in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the Kings Person and Office.</p>
            <p>But yet further here are sundry rocks to be avoided in it. The first is not onely to distinguish in reason but actually and in deed to divide the Kings Person from His Authority; that is, to make the King a <hi>Platonicall Idea</hi> wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To what purpose then are those significant solemnities used, at the Coronation of our Kings? Why are they crowned? but to shew their personall and Imperiall Power in Military Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: why inthroned? but to shew their judiciary Supremacy: why ino<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>led? but to expresse their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in matters of Religion. That the Kings Authority may be where His Person is not, is most true: that His person may be without Authority, is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48224:44"/>
most false. That his Office and Authority may be limited by Law, is true: but a King without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall Authority, is a contradiction rather then a King; such a King as the Souldiers made of Christ, with a scarlet Robe, a Crown of Thornes, a Scepter of <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>A third error in this distinction is to limit the Kings Authority to his Courts. All Courts are not of the same Antiquity, but some erected long after others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Court of Requests: Neither are all Justices of the same nature, some were more eminent then others, that were resident with the King as his Councell in points of Law; these are now the Judges: Others did justice abroad for the ease of the Subject; as <hi>Iustices of Assise, Iustices in Eire, Iustices of Oi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Terminer, Iustices of Peace.</hi> The <hi>Barons</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> were anciently Peeres of the Realme, and doe still continue their name: but to exclude the King out of his Courts is worse, a strange Paradox, and against the grounds of our Laws, <hi>The King alone</hi>

               <hi>and no other may and ought to doe justice, if he alone were sufficient, as he is bound by his Oath.</hi> And again, <hi>If our Lord the King be not sufficient himselfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine every cause, that his labour may be the lighter,</hi>

The Kings did use to sit personally in their Courts: We reade of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth and <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, that they used every day for an houre after dinner to receive bills and and heare causes: <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth

A clear and rationall head is as requisite to the doing of Justice, as the profound knowledge of Law: It is a part of his Oath, <hi>to doe, to be kept in all his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Right Iustice, in Mercy, and Truth;</hi> was this intended onely by Substitutes, or by Substitutes not accountable to him for injustice? we have sworne that he is <hi>supreme Governour in all causes, over all Persons within his Dominions,</hi> is it all one to be a Governour, and to name Governours? <hi>David</hi> exhorts <hi>be wise now therefore O yee Kings.

eased of lesser burthens, that he may be conversant <hi>circa ardua Reipublicae,</hi> about great affaires of State, but so as not to divest his Person of his royall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the least matters. Where the King is, there is the Court, and where the Kings Authority is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in His Person or in his Delegates, there is his Court of Justice. The reason is plain then, why the King may not controule his Courts; because they are himselfe: yet he may command a review, and call his Justices to an account. How the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will apply this to a Court, where neither His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty is present in Person, nor by his Delegates I doe not understand.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last error is to tie the hands of the King absolutely to his Laws. First in matters of Grace, the King is above his Laws, he may grant especiall Privileges by Charter to what Persons, to what Corporations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e pleaseth, of his abundant Grace and meere motion; he may pardon all crimes committed against the Law of the Land, and all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltyes and irregularityes imposed by the same: the perpetuall Custome of this Kingdome doth warrant it. All wise men desire to live under such a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where the Prince may with a good Conscience dispence with the rigour of the Laws. As for those that are otherwise minded, I wish them no other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment then this, that the paenall Laws may be executed on them strictly, till they reforme their Judgements.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the Acts of Regall Power and Justice, His Majesty may goe besides or beyond the ordinary course of Law, by his Prerogative. New Laws
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48224:47"/>
for the most part (especially when the King stands in need of Subsidies) are an abatement of Royall Power. The Soveraignty of a just Conquerer, who comes in without pactions, is absolute, and bounded onely by the Laws of God, of Nature, and of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but after he hath confirmed old Laws and Customes, or by his Charter granted new Liberties and Immunities, to the collective Body of His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or to any of them; he hath so farr remitted of his own right, and cannot in Conscience recede from it. I say in Conscience, for though humane Laws as they are humane, cannot bind the Conscience of a Subject, and therefore <hi>a fortiore</hi> not of a King who is the Law-giver, yet by consequence and virtue of the Law of God, (which saith <hi>submit your selves to every ordinance of Man for the Lords sake,</hi> and again <hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy selfe)</hi> they doe bind, or to speak more properly, Gods Law doth bind the Conscience to the Observation of them. This is that which Divines doe use to expresse thus; That they have power to bind the Conscience <hi>in se</hi>

            <p>First, It must be acknowledged by all Men, that the King of <hi>England</hi> in the eye of the Law never dyes. <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clarke</hi> (two Priest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

per verba de presenti facit matrimonium,</hi> a contract in words of the present tense, is a true Marriage and indissolvable: and yet for Solemnity sake, when the partyes come to receive the Benediction of the Church, The Minister though he knew of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And therefore M. <hi>Dolman</hi> (otherwise <hi>Parsons</hi> the Jesuit, from whom these Men have borrowed all their grounds) erred most pittifully in this, (as he did in many other of your Tenets,) that a King is no more a King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Coronation, then a Major of a Corporation is a true Major after his Election, before he have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Oath. To thinke a few scattered People, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled without any procuration have the power of the Commonalty of <hi>England,</hi> is an Error fitter to be laught at then to be confuted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the words of the Oath (which beares markes enough in it selfe, of the time when it was made) are not to be pressed further then Custome and practice (the best Interpreters of the Law) doe warrant, otherwise the Words <hi>quas vulgus elegerit,</hi> cannot without much forcing be applied to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

Thirdly, it cannot be denyed, that if the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This would be strange Doctrin, (indeed incredible) that all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> who have given this answer have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworn, and neither Parliament nor Convocation to take notice of it, in so many Ages, nor in the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Fourthly, it is confessed that in Acts of Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, the King is not bound to assent (it is well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Lastly, that though he be bound by oath to consent, yet if he doe not consent, they are not binding Laws to the Subject.

God blesse Parliaments, and grant they may doe nothing unworthy of themselves or of their name, which was <hi>Senatus Sapientum:</hi> The commendation of bad men, was the just ground of a wise mans fear. But let us examine the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. <hi>Parliaments</hi> (you say) <hi>have the same efficient cause as Monarchyes, if not higher,</hi> (it seemes you are not resolved whether) Higher? How should that be? unlesse you have devised some Hierarchy of Angells in Heaven to overtoppe God, as you have found out a Court <hi>Paramount</hi> over his Vicegerent in Earth. But you build upon your old sandy Foundation, that all Kings derive their power from the People. I must once more tell you, the Monarchy of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not from the People as the efficient, but from
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48224:59"/>
the King of Kings. The onely Argument which I have seen pressed with any shew of probability (which yet the Observer hath not met with) is this, That upon deficiency of the Royall Line, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion escheats to the People as the Lord <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount.</hi> A meere mistake, they might even as well say, that because the Wife upon the death of her Husband is loosed from her former obligation, and is free either to continue a Widdow, or to elect a new Husband, that therefore her Husband in his Life time did derive his Dominion from Her, and that by his Death, Dominion did escheat to Her as to the Lady <hi>Paramount:</hi> yet if all this were admitted it proves but a respective Equallity. Yes, you adde that the Parliament is the very essence of the Kingdome, that is to say, the cause of the King, and therefore by your <hi>Lesbian</hi> Rule of <hi>quod efficit tale</hi> it is in it selfe more worthy and more powerfull. Though the Rule be nothing to the purpose, yet I will admit it and joyne issue with the Observer; whether the King or the Parliament be the cause of the other, let that be more worthy. That the King is the cause of the Parliament, is as evident as the Noon-day light; He calls them, He dissolves them, they are His Councell, by virtue of His writ they doe (otherwise they cannot) sit: That the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be the cause of the King, is as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible as it is for <hi>Shem</hi> to be <hi>Noahs</hi> Father. How many Kings in the World have never known Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, neither the name, nor the thing?

An intire right, what to out Wifes and Children, to our Lands and Possessions? this is not tollerable.</p>
            <p>Hence also he tells Magistrally enough, of an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power in the Parliament, <hi>That there is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power in every State somewhere, it is true, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore it hath ever been accounted safer to live under one Tyrant then many: The Lust, Covetousnesse, Ambition, Cruelty, of one, may be sooner satisfied then of many, and especially when the power is but temporary and not hereditary nor of continuance: We see Farmers which have a long terme, will husband their grounds well; but they that are but Tenents at will, plough out the very heart of it. No Sir (I thanke you) we will none of your Arbitrary Government. And suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, but no way granting, that the Parliament were the essentiall Body of this Kingdome, or (which is all one) were indowed with all the power and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges thereof to all intents and purposes; yet it had no Arbitrary Power over it selfe, in such things as are contrary to the Allegiance which it owes to His Majesty, and contrary to its Obligation to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Laws and Customs of this Land.</p>

The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is infallibly true, grounded upon an undeniable Maxime, that <hi>quod competit tali qua tali, competit omni tali,</hi> that which is true of one Parliament not by accident, but essentially as it is a Parliament, must of necessity be true of every Parliament. The Assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as evident, confessed by the Parliament it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who best knew the extent of their own power, that there was somethings of which <hi>ils nount pas cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance,</hi> they had no cognizance. And if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Observer, these things which did not belong to their cognizanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, were the appeasing some intestine

or Civill Commotions, and the guarding of the Seas and Marches: why, these are the very case now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion concerning the <hi>Militia.</hi> And doth a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here confesse that they have no cognizance of these? yes, what saith the Observer to this? he saith they doe not renounce their right, but onely excuse themselves in point of Counsell; Most absurdly, as if there were either consent or counsell without cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance. But he saith they did give both consent and counsell, and the King could <hi>not be satisfied without them.</hi> It may be so: but there is a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween giving counsell when the King licenseth, yea and requireth it; and intruding into Counsell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling: between an approbative consent such as the Saints give to God Almighty, the onely Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative Judge of Heaven and Earth; and an active consent, without which the Kings hands should be so tied that he could do just nothing. The former all good Kings doe desire, so farre as the exigence of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice will give way to have their Counsells commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated: But the latter makes a great King a Cipher and transformes an Emperour into a Christmasse Lord. You tell us, that King <hi>had a very wise Councell of Warre,</hi> and perhaps more knowing in these things then the Commons. It were strange if they should not be so, if the Commons who are Srangers to the affaires &amp; ingagements of State, should understand them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then those who have served sundry Apprentiships in that way: <hi>qui pauca considerat facile pronunciat,</hi> he that knows not or regards not the circumstances, gives sentence easily, but for the most part is mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

This is rather an exception against the Law it selfe then the King: So the Observer and his pewfellowes deal with Laws and Law-makers; if they make for them, <hi>suscipiunt ut Aquilas,</hi> they admire them as Eagles, if they make against them <hi>despici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:48224:69"/>
is destructive to Parliaments? you might have said more truely the productive cause of all Parliaments, that ever were in <hi>England,</hi> or of any Assembly that had an Analogy with Parliaments, I tooke you only for a Reformer of some abuses newly crept in: but it is plain, you intend to be another <hi>Licurgus,</hi> to alter the whole frame of Government. Truely Sir you beginne very high, and jumpe over the backs of a great many Generations at once: Doubtlesse you are either very wise, or have a great opinion of your owne Wisdome. But to the point, It is confessed that sometimes some evills doe flow from inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate trust, but many more from needlesse Jealousy. <hi>incommoda non solvunt Regulam,</hi> Inconveniences doe not abrogate a Law. Restraint commonly makes p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ssion more violent. When you have done what you can, there must be a trust either reposed in one or many; and better in one then many. Doe but looke home a little, without trust a Man knows not his owne Father; without trust a man knowes not his own Children. Some trust there must be, and who fitter to be trusted then he that hath the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of power: unlesse you will make two Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premes. You confesse that Parliaments ought to be used as Phisick, not as constant Diet. And the Law hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ow set down a faire terme for the continuance of an ordinary Parliament, unlesse you would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in a course of Phisick.</p>
            <p>The second exception is, His Majesty declares, that the Parliament hath no universall power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise in all things, but <hi>in quibusdam arduis,</hi> according to the Writ, and cites the president of <hi>Wentworth,</hi> a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48224:69"/>
Member of the House of Commons, committed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (the Parliament sitting,) for propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to advise Her, in a matter She thought they had nothing to doe with. The Observer magnifies Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for Her Goodnesse and Clemency, but withall he addes, <hi>But we must not be presidented in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent violation of Law by Queen</hi> Elizabeth. A grave Historiographer tells us of a close and dangerous kind of Enemies, <hi>tacitum inimicorum genus,</hi> such as make a mans praises an introduction to their venemous inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, as if it were not malice but pure love of truth that even forced them to speak so much: such an one is a good Man, but &amp;c. So Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was a good Queen, but in this particular she played the Tyrant. To violate Laws, to violate them apparently, therefore wilfully, to have no respect to the House of Commons (whereof <hi>Wentworth</hi> was a Member,) was no signe of Grace and Clemency. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (a wise and mercifull Princesse, one that so much courted Her People) would not have done it, but that She thought She had just grounds: or if She might erre in her judgement, yet She had as wise a Councell as any Prince in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and a businesse of this consequence could not be done without their advice, who doubtlesse were some of them Members of the same House, or if both She and they should be mistaken, yet why were the House of Commons themselves silent, whilest such a known Privilege was apparently invaded? why did they not at least in an humble Petition represent this apparent violation of their Libertyes that it might remaine as a memoriall to plead for them to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb facs="tcp:48224:70"/>
that they were not the betrayers of the Rights of Parliaments? She that was so gracious as he Observer acknowledgeth, and whose goodnesse was so perfect and undissembled, could not choose but take it well, and thanke them for it. Neither will it suffice to say She gained upon them by Courtesy: such an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent violation, so prejudiciall to the Highest Court of the Kingdome, passed over in deep silence, shews as litle Courtesy on the one side, as Discretion on the other. In brief, as I cannot conceive that these words <hi>in quibusdam arduis,</hi> are so restrictive that the House may consult of nothing but what shall be proposed, or was intended at the time of the Summons: so on the other side I doe not see, how either the Commission or Prescription, doe give them such an universall Cognizance or Jurisdiction. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Herselfe oftner then once in this point; in Her first Parliament (when in reason She should be most tender) to the Speaker and the Body of the House of Commons, out of their Loves humbly moving Her to Marriage, She answered that <hi>She tooke it well, because it was without limitation of Place or Person, if it had been otherwise, She must needs have misliked it, and thought it a great presumption, for those to take upon them to bind and limit, whose duties were to obey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third exception is, the King saith, they must meerely counsell and not command, (a strange charge if you marke it) <hi>For it is impossible that the same trust should be irrevocably committed to the King and His Heires for ever, and yet that very trust, and a power above that trust be committed to others.</hi> The Observer answers first (little to the purpose) <hi>that though there cannot be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48224:70"/>
two Supremes yet the King is</hi> universis minor, <hi>lesse th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

The Law is plain, <hi>The Kings Most Royall Majesty of meer droit &amp; very Right, is very Head, King, Lord and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">26 Hen. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Ruler of this Realm.</hi> And doth he now intend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the King of <hi>England in his, &amp;c.</hi> among condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Princes. Take heed Sir, this will prove a worse &amp;c. then that in the late Canons. Secondly, he answers that though the Kings power be irrevocable, yet it is not universall, the people have reserved something to themselves out of Parliament, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Parliament. It were to be wished that he would distinctly set down the particular reservations; a deceitfull Man walkes in Generallityes. Still the Observer dreams of Elective Kingdoms, where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have made choise either of a Person or a Family: To us it is nothing, they that give nothing can reserve nothing. Trusted and yet reserved? How the Observer joynes Gryphins and Horses together? if trusted how reserved? if reserved how trusted? but how doth the Observer prove either his trust or reservation? nay it is a tacite trust; in good time, so he proves his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a Company of dumbe witnesses. In conclusion his proofe is, that it is a part of the Law of Nature. A trimme Law of Nature indeed, which is <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trally</hi> opposite to the Law of God and of Nations. The Observer deales in this just as if he had a Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man died testate, and he should sue for a part of his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48224:71"/>
goods, and neither allege the Will nor Codicill, not Custome of the Country, but the Law of Nature onely for a Legacy.</p>
            <p>Next the Observer raiseth a new Argument out of His Majestyes words, <hi>A temporary Power ought not to be greater then that which is lasting.</hi> This is first to make Draggons and then to kill them; or as Boyes first make bubbles in a shell, and then blow them away without difficulty. The Sinewes and Strength of His Majestyes Argument did lye in the words <hi>to Him and to His Heires,</hi> and not in the word <hi>above:</hi> but if he will put the word <hi>above</hi> to the tryall, if he reduce it into right Form it is <hi>above</hi> his answer. To give a power <hi>above</hi> His Majesty, sufficient to censure His Majesty, to a Body dissolvable at His Majestyes pleasure, is absurd and ridiculous: as if the King should delegate Judges, to examine and sentence the Observers seditious passages in this Treatise, and yet withall give power to the Observer to disjustice them at his pleasure; in such a case he need not much fear the Sentence. The Observer pleads two things in answer to his own shadow. First, that <hi>then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans had done unpolitickly, to give greater power to a Temporary Dictator then to the ordinary Consulls.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that <hi>it was very prosperous to them sometimes to change the Form of Government, neither alwayes living under circumscribed Consulls nor under uncircums<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ibed Dictators.</hi> We see what his Teeth water at; he would have His Majesty a circumscribed Consull, and gain an Arbitrary Dictatorian Power to himselfe and some other of his Friends. But in the meane time he forgets himselfe very farre in his History: for first
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48224:71"/>
the power of the Dictator and of the Consulls was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ot consistent together; but the power of the King and the Parliament is consistent. Secondly the change of Government was so farre from being prosperous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o the Romans, that every change brought that State even to Deaths doore. To instance onely in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>les:</hi> if he had not after an incredible manner held a whole Army play upon a Bridge, they had payed for their new fanglednesse, with the sacking of their Citty. Thirdly, the choosing of a Dictator was not a change of their Government, but a branch of it, a piece reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for extremest perills, their last Anchor and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge either against Forre in Enemyes, or the Domestick Seditions of the <hi>Patricii</hi> and <hi>Plebei:</hi> and is so farr from yeelding an Argument against Kings, that in the judgement of that Politick Nation, it shewes the advantage of Monarchy above all other Formes of Government.</p>
            <p>The Observer still continues His Majestyes Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, To make the Parliament more then Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, is to make them His Commanders and Control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. To which he answers, <hi>To consent is more then to counsell, and yet not alwayes so much as to command, for in inferiour Courts, the Iudges are so Counsellours for the King, that he may not countermand their judgement, yet it were a harsh thing to say that therefore they are His Controllers, much more in Parliament, where the Lords and Commons represent the whole Kingdome.</hi> If there were no other Arguments to prove the Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48224:72"/>
of Parliament above the other Courts then this that it represents the Kingdome as they doe the King; it would get little advantage by it. <hi>To consent is more then to counsell, and yet not alwayes so much as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi> True, <hi>not alwayes:</hi> but to cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> in no other notion then Laws and lawfull Customes doe allow; it is readily yeelded, but makes nothing to his purpose. One said of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that he writ waking, but <hi>Plato</hi> dreaming, The one had his eyes open and considered Men as they were indeed, the other as he would have them to be: but if ever Man writt dreaming, it was this Observer; his notes may serve rather for the Meridian of new <hi>England</hi> then old <hi>England,</hi> and of <hi>Eutopia</hi> rather then them both. He calls the Judges the Kings Counsellers, as if they were not also his Delegates, Deputies, and Comis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, what they doe is in His name and His Act: yet if they swerve from justice, he may grant a review and call them to account for any misdemeanour by them committed, in the excercise of their places; and this either in Parliament or out of Parliament. But the inference hence, That because the Parliament may take an account of what is done by His Majesty in His inferiour Courts, therefore much more of what is done by him without the Authority of any Court, seemes very weake. It is one thing to take an account of Himselfe, another to take an account of

How deep the Observers share is herein, I leave it to his own Conscience. This is certaine, a Man may keep his Possession by Force, but he that shall goe about to thrust another out of his lawfull Possession, is the true Authour of the tumult, and whatsoever he suffers, he can blame no man but himselfe.</p>
            <p>Now to your foure Charges. First, who divided the King and Parliament. There may be a quaere of others, but it is beyond all question that those base tumults and disorders at <hi>Westminster</hi> and upon the <hi>Thames</hi> tending to the danger of His Majestyes Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but much more as they were unsufferable affronts to Sacred Majesty, and all those who are accessary to them, as Contrivers, Fomenters, or Connivers, are the principall grounds of this cursed Division: they that make two Supremes coordinate one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make a division with a witnesse. Next, for your seperation between the Parliament and the Kingdome. First your mouth runnes over extremely when you call it the most pernicious thing that can be, next to the renouncing God: we have stricter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to others then to our Proctors. Secondly, to regulate their trust, according to their first inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48224:75"/>
and former Presidents, is not to withdraw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation; if it were who taught it them, but those who first practised the same to their King? But that you may clearly discern who are the Authours of this seperation, heare a neare Friend of yours in his <hi>plain English</hi> or rather plaine Sedition, thus he, <hi>If ever the Parliament should agree to the making up of an unsafe unsatisfying Accomodation, this will beget a new que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether in case the representative Body can not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r will not discharge their trust, to the satisfaction not of fancy, but of reason in the People, they may resume if ever yet they parted with a power to their manifest undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and use their power so farr as conduceth to their safety?</hi> You see the high ad ultimate Judicature is neither now the Kings, nor the Parliaments. Your third division is between the Parliament and a part of it. Of this charge they are guilty who made the distinction, of good and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d Lords, of well affected and ill affected Members. The votes of Absentees doubtlesse by the Law of Nations devolve to those that are present: but if the place of the Assembly be not free, if the absence be necessitated by unjust force or just fear, the case is otherwise. Your fourth divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is between the Major part misled, and a Faction in the major part misleading. I wonder you should thinke this so impossible.

            <p>Fourthly, I wonder the Observer is not ashamed to tell of His Majestyes preferring his single judgement before all advise whatsoever, when the Observer char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him with following the advice of his Cabinet Councell, when he hath his Privy Councell with him, when in the great Councell, if they might meet free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he believes that two third parts approve of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

            <p>Lastly, It is the part of good Counsellers, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their whole advise together, what they desire to remove, and what they desire to introduce; as well what they desire to build up, as what the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>to be advised of the fashion of new.</hi> His Majesty hath required one intire full view of their demands, that He might judge more perfectly what to assent to, and what to advise further upon. This is a sure way not to be over-reached, not to cut down an old Tree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be a new one ready to be planted in its place: many Men will agree in the destructive, which will never agree in the constructive part. The old Senators first of <hi>Capua</hi> and after of <hi>Florence,</hi> found this to be true by experience; the People did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree so well in taking them away, but they disagreed ten times as much in the choise of new: and they that were voted down whilest they looked upon them positively, were voted to stand when they looked upon them comparatively, they were not so worthy as they desired, but much more worthy then those that should be subintroduced. To instance in the case of the Church, there are many Schismaticall Factions at this day, never an one of these can have their own ends, except the present government be taken away; so farre they agree: yet if it should be taken away, not one of six should have his own ends; here of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity

they must fall in pieces, and in probability will cry out with the <hi>Capuans</hi> and the <hi>Florentines, The old is the better of the two.</hi> If every Mans sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle suffrage were ascertained to his proper object, as it is in the election of our Knights and Burgesses, we should soone see who would have most voices: and perhaps the old (in a free meeting) might have more then all the new put together.</p>

Next, he makes it neare a prodigy, <hi>a mistery above if not contrary to Nature,</hi> that a few Hipocrites should beguile the Parliament, or the Major part be mastered by a <hi>Septemvirate.</hi> I will nor argue with the Observer <hi>utrum sit</hi> whether it be so; my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the great Councell of the Kingdome pull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

any men to personate a part from the teeth outwards? That great Offices and Honours have never been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearle in any Mens eyes to hinder their sight (though like Lapwings they made least noise when they were nearest their nests?) That others have never been like organ pipes to whom the wind of popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause hath onely given a sound? Is it never possible for a party who have premeditated their parts, and before their designe be discovered, to exclude or vote out those whom they conceive to be their opposites, upon some pretences or others, (suppose of an unlawfull election, or being Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolists or the like?) I say nothing of the bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching power of Oratory, nor of that sheepish Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of following the Drove, nor of the vehement impression that fancyed dangers make in some men, as of him that died in an innocent Bath, when the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers onely told him, that his hearts blood was comming out now. But you may say these will never hold on to the journyes end: Though we often see that when Men are too farr ingaged, have passed the Waters of <hi>Rubicon</hi> and cannot retire with safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they grow desperate and run head long upon the mouth of the Cannon: yet considering the gracious disposition of our Dread Soveraigne, whose joy it is as it was his Saviours to find the sheep that was lost, I doe verily believe they will not hold on to the last indeed; why should they lose themselve to be laught at for their labours by them that had other ends then they? But yet till this departure be, they make one body visibly. When the Body naturall is infested with contrary distempers, that which is

It is as easy to conceive how the traine Bands may be at the disposition of their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who pay them, reward them, punish them: and it is certain that they who have the naming of them will chuse such as they may confide in.

            <p>This brings us to the issue which is propounded by the Observer, and is accepted by His Majesty, <hi>which

               </gap>s not alwayes to be credited, but speech is the Arch-Deceiver. If this be not a vaine flourish, an empty aiery offer, but meant in good earnest, there is hope we may be happy. His Majesty hath satisfied this demand long since, by His Declaration of the 12. of <hi>August</hi> 1642. and yet we find not these fruits here promised with so much confidence; He hath na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the partyes, He hath specified the crimes. Take the accusation in his owne words, 1. <hi>Of entring into a solomne Combination for altering of the Government of Church and State, 2. Of designing Offices to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and other Men, 3. Of soliciting and drawing down the Tumults to</hi> Westminster, 4. <hi>Of bidding the people in the height of their rage and fury goe to</hi> Whitehall, 5. <hi>Of their scornfull and odious mention of His Majesties Person, 6. Of a designe to get the Prince into their hands, 7. Of treating with Forreine Power to assist them.</hi> He is willing also to referre himselfe to the strength of his proofes, and evidence of the matter, which is all the Observer desires. Heare Him for that also, <hi>We desire that the L. K. M. H. M. P. M. H.</hi> Sir <hi>A. H. M. St. M. M.</hi> Sir <hi>H. L. A. P. and C. V. may be delivered into the hands of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, to be tryed by their Peers, according to the known Law of the Land. If we doe not prove them guilty of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48224:83"/>
High Treason, they will be acquitted and their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence will justly triumph over Vs.</hi> Now if they desire to shew themselves great Patriots and Lovers of their Country indeed, here is a faire opportunity offered, if they have as much courage as <hi>Codrus</hi> had to leape into the gaping gulfe of Division, and to reduce the Kingdom to its former continuity and unity, if they dare trust to the touchstone of Justice, and if the bird in their brest sing sweetly to them that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: here is a course provided whereby they may vindicate their good names, and out of the feined reports of malignant Sycophants make themselves a triumphant Garland or Crown of lasting Honour. But we see no hast, I know not mens hearts. There is an unhappy story in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> (but I dare not apply it,) of <hi>Pericles</hi> a Stickler in the <hi>Athenian</hi> Commonwealth, who being busy and private in his study to make his account to the State, was advised by his Nephew <hi>Alciliades</hi> (it was pestilent Counsell) rather to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy low to make no accounts: which he did effect by ingaging the Commonwealth in a Warre, so as they had no leisure to call for his accounts after that. There can be nothing pleaded in bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e to the performance of this Proposition, but the privilege of Parliament. A great plea indeed; so the Observer, <hi>That none of the Members of the Parliament may be apprehended in case of suspition, where no information or Witnesses ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to make good the prosecution, without acquainting the Parliament, if leave may be conveniently obteined.</hi> He addes that <hi>by the same Act the whole House might have been surprised.</hi> And in another place, that by this meanes, <hi>the meere imputation of Treason shall sweep
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48224:83"/>
away a whole Parliament.</hi> And his reason is thus groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That if way be given to this, so many Members of either House may be taken away at any time, upon groundlesse pretences, as may make a Major part of whom they will: And then farewell to the Freedome of Parliaments. Which truely seemes to be urged with great shew of equity, where the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes are taken away by dozens or greater numbers, and the tryall is long deferred to serve a turne. You shall find the same Argument used &amp; pressed after the same manner by <hi>Steven Gardiner</hi> to the Parliament, alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that nothing could be <hi>of worse Example</hi> then to <note place="margin">Auno 154</note> 
               <hi>allow such a president,</hi> that by that meanes <hi>it shall be at the pleasure of him that ruleth to doe the same in more.</hi> But for all that we doe not find that either the Parliament did afford him relief, or were sensible of any such danger: doubtlesse it stands both with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall equity &amp; the known Law of the Land, that they who have the honour to be the great Councell of the King &amp; Kingdome, should have all such Privileges &amp; immunityes as are conducible to the furtherance of those ends for which they are convocated; such are free accesse and recesse, to be exempted from attendence upon Inferiour Courts, so long as they are in that imployment, To have their Servants free from arrests, that whilest themselves are busy about the great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Common-wealth, their Estates and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions may not suffer in their absence, and that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall privilege of all Councellers, that whilest their intentions are reall, they should not be questioned for a slippe of the tongue, or a mistake in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We see ordinary Courts doe not onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their Ministers of Justice in the excercise of
<pb facs="tcp:48224:84"/>
their places, but even those Witnesses which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> that His Majesty is the true fountain of these Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, not any mutuall compacts. This is plaine by that petition, which Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> (then Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker for the House of Commons) made in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, which I thinke hath been observed by all Speakers that ever were since, <hi>That if in communication, or reasoning, any Man in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, these Privileges ought not to be destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the essence or Fundamentall Ends or righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Constitution of Parliaments: and such a Privilege i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> that the Observer claimes, <hi>to be denyed nothing.</hi> For whereas our Parliament is so sweetly tempered an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> composed of all estates, to secure this Nation from the evills which are incident to all Formes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: he that shall quite take His Majestyes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative voice away secures us from Tyranny, but leaves us open and starke naked to all those popular evil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> or Epidemicall diseases which flow from <hi>Ochlocracy;</hi> as Tumults, Seditions, Civill Warres, and that <hi>Ilias</hi> of Evills which attends them; and seemes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the King (be it spoken with reverence) to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ase of the old Woman in the Epigrammatist, when she had coughed out her two last teeth,
<q>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:48224:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From hence appeares a ready answer to that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion so often moved, <hi>what great virtue is in the Kings single vote to avert evills from us, that an ordinance of both Houses may not be binding to the whole Kingdom without His consent?</hi> The case is plain, it is of no great virtue against the evills of Tyranny, but is a Soveraigne Remedy against the greater Mischiefes which flow from <hi>Ochlocracy:</hi> and I trust God will ever preserve it to us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, these Privileges must not transcend the condition or capacity of Subjects by making destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive reservations, or so as to deck the Temples of inferiour Persons with the flowers of the Crowne. Such a Privilege seemes this to be which the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver here claimes, a Dictatorian Immunity from all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, to owe no account but to God and their own Consciences: and yet by this new Learning they may take an account of the King. What is this but to make Kings of Subjects and Subjects of Kings? When some Ancients more skilfull in <hi>Theology</hi> then in <hi>Philosophy</hi> or <hi>Geography,</hi> did heare of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> they reasoned against it (as they thought) strongly, that then there were <hi>pensiles homines</hi> and <hi>pensiles arbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> men that did goe with their heads downwards, and Trees that did grow with their tops downwards; they forgot that Heaven is still above, and the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter below: but what they did but imagine the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server really laboureth to introduce, to make whole
<pb facs="tcp:48224:85"/>
Kingdomes to walke with their Heads downwards and their heeles upwards.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the just measure or standard, whereby all Privileges ought to be examined and tryed, is not now the Law of Nature, which is applyable (though not equally) to all Formes of Government; this were to put the shoe of <hi>Hercules</hi> upon an Infants foote. The Law of Nature may be limited, though not contraried by the known Laws and Customs of this Realme, as they shall appear by Charters, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, Presidents, Rolls, Records, Witnesses. His Majesty cites a confession of the Parliament it selfe, to prove that their Privileges extend not to the cases <hi>of Treason, Felony, or breach of Peace,</hi> which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been the common beliefe of all Men. And it seemes no satisctory Answer to say, that therefore they extend not to these Cases be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Houses do usually give way in these cases for them to come to tryall, either in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if it be proper, or otherwise in other Courts. For it is a great doubt how a Commoner in case of Treason can be tryed in Parliament <hi>per pares</hi> by his Peeres: and if it be in their own power to give way or not to give way, the Privilege extends to these cases as well as others.

               <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Faith, for whatsoever is not of Faith is Sinne.</hi> Reason is as evident, that all circumstances must concurre to make an action good, but one single defect doth make it evill. Now seeing the approbation of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is required to every good action, the want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of makes it unlawfull, nor simply in it selfe, but rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>huic, hic, nunc,</hi> to this Person, at this time, in this place. Therefore all Divines doe agree in the case of a scrupulous Conscience, that where a Man is bound by positive Law to doe any Act, and yet is forbidden by the Dictates of his own Conscience to do it, he must first reform his understanding, and then perform obedience. And this in case where a thing already is determined by positive Law: but in His Majestyes case where the question is not of Obedience to a Law already constituted and established, but of the free election or assenting to a new Law before it be enacted, it holds much more strongly. But yet this is not all, there is a third obligation (&amp; a threefold cord is not easily broken.) Take one instance, the King i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury)</hi> are his Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers and consent not to any alteration; what should a King doe in this case? in the one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>cale there is Law, Conscience, and Oath, in the other the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der respect which he beares to a great part (yet but a part) of his people. I presume not to determine: but our Chroniclers tell us what was the event then, That his Majesty resolved to leave the Church in as good State or better then he found it, That the Knights confessed their error, and desired forgivenesse of the same Arch-Bishop, That when the same motion was renewed after in the same year of his Raigne, the King commanded them that from thenceforth, they should not presume to move any such matter. Even as his Predecessor <hi>Richard</hi> the second in the very like case had commanded the same Bill to be cancelled: Kings then did conceive themselves to have a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voice, and that they were not bound by the votes of their great Councell.</p>
            <p>These grounds being laid, the Observers instances will melt away like Winter ice. First the Oath and obligation is visible and certain, but the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation or necessityof alteration, is invisible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. Secondly the rule that a man may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his own Conscience for the advise of any Counseller, is universall, and holds not onely in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons judiciary whether sole or sociall, but generally in all the actions of a Mans Life. Thirdly the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is the sole Judge or Directer of the will: the sin of <hi>Pilate</hi> was not to contradict Revelations (which he never had,) but for fear of complaints, and out of a desire to apply himselfe to an inraged

               <hi>Romans</hi> had not found a defect in their popular Government, they had never fled to the choise of a Dictator or absolute Prince, as a sacred Anchour in all their greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremityes.

When he had redeemed that Citty from ruine, how was he rewarded?

Parliaments are sublunary Courts, and mutable as well as all other Societyes. If we descend a little lower to the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, we shall find <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> declared the Lord Protector in Parliament, yet without Title to the Crown in 1455. Shortly after we find both him and his Adherents by Parliament likewise attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of High Treason in 1459. The yeare following 1460, he was again by Parliament declared not only Lord Protector, but also Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and right Heire to the Crown, and all Acts to the contrary made voide, and the Lords sweare to the observance thereof. It rests not here, the very next year 1461. his Sonne <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth not contented to be an Heire in reversion, assumes the Imperiall Diadem, and in Parliament is received actuall King. The
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48224:95"/>
end is not yet, ten yeares after this 1471, King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is admitted King by Parliament again, and King <hi>Edward</hi> attainted of High Treason, declared an Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the Crown intailed upon King <hi>Henry</hi> and his Heires Males, and for want of such issue, to <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Clarence</hi> and his Heires. But this lasted but a while; disinherited <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Clarence</hi> are reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the very next Yeare, <hi>Edward</hi> is Crowned again, and received King in Parliament.

            <p>Parliaments against Parliaments: and this in that very question which you say is properly to be judged by Parliament, who is the right King? When the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not of a particular person and his Heires, but of a Person and his Family, so as the People have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to elect whom they please of that stock, (as it was long since in <hi>Scotland,</hi> till it was rescinded by Act of Parliament to take away those storms of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and Faction which it raised,) The Parliament was the most proper Judge who should succeed: but where the Crown is hereditary, there needs little question of the right Heire, which for the most part every Country Man knows as well as the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Kingdome. How easily were Queens rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and deposed in <hi>Henry</hi> the eights time by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament?

Who made the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server a Distinguisher where the Law doth not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish? But let us view his Reasons without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
            <p>Three things are alledged, first the circumstances of the action, Secondly, the intention of the Actors, Thirdly the Authority of the Commanders. For the first he saith, <hi>The King was meerely denyed entrance for the time, his generall Right was not denyed.</hi> I doe easily beleeve, that Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> meant not to hold <hi>Hull</hi> for ever: If he did, he is not such a Child to say so. When the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and his Complices had plotted to surprise the <hi>Tower</hi> or <hi>Dover Castle,</hi> and to possesse themselves of the Persons of King <hi>Iames</hi> &amp; his Councell, it was not their designe to hold those Forts, or detein them Prisoners for ever: but untill they had gained their own conditions, which were the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Religion, and the distribution of the great Offices of the Kingdome among themselves; yet it was never the lesse adjudged Treason, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for it.</p>
            <p>He addes, <hi>No defying language was given to the King.</hi> No more did <hi>Iudas</hi> give the King of Kings when he cryed, <hi>Hail Master &amp; kissed him.</hi> The Prophet complaineth, of some that <hi>the words of their mouth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This very plea ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a rotten and a trayterous heart: To kill an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and an anoynted King in the sight of the Sun, requires an height of impiety, a longer preparation of Partners, and instruments fleshed in Blood and Mischiefe. He that should have commanded such a shot, had need to have given his charge in ambiguous terms, as <hi>Edvardum occidere nolite timere bonum est,</hi> or otherwise might have been thrown over the walls for his Labour. If such a shot had fayled, it had been destructive to the Actor and all his Partakers: if it had taken it would have made them stinke in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>It follows, <hi>How should this administer to the King any grounds to levy guards at</hi> Yorke? &amp;c. <hi>Did the King without fear treat with Sir</hi> Iohn Hotham <hi>as a Traytour in the face of his Artillery, and offer to enter Hull with twenty horse unarmed, and continue such a harsh Parley so many houres; and yet when he was in</hi> Yorke, <hi>in a County of so great assurance, could nothing but so many Bands of Horse and Foot secure him from the same Sir</hi> Iohn Hotham? I wonder the Observer doth not blush to be His Majestyes Remembrancer how much he descended from his Royall State that day, in his attendence so many houres, and his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous proffers. Is it because he thinks good Subjects take delight to hear of such an audacious affront put upon their Soveraigne?

hand, pittyfully complaining and suing to Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> for admission? But the King called Sir <hi>Iohn Traytour,</hi> and gave him harsh language. Did he so? you may remember what <hi>Philip</hi> answered for the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> when some of his own wicked instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments complained they called them Traytours; <hi>that his Countrymen were plain dealing men to call things by their right names, and could not for their lifes think one thing and say another.</hi> If <hi>Philip</hi> a Prince benefited by those Creatures, pleaded so for his Subjects; why might not King <hi>Charles</hi> who was injuried, and a loser, have leave to speak for himselfe to his own Subjects? But if the King were so confident there, why did he raise Forces at <hi>Yorke,</hi> a place of more <hi>assurance?</hi> First shew us your Commission to take his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties answer, or at least tell us why Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> began to raise Forces first? His Majesty <hi>is</hi> authorized by God and the Law to raise Forces, and owes no account to the Observer. And to His Majestyes confidence then, and diffidence after, I can say nothing positively: if it were in another case, there might be sundry rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons given. Perhaps the second cogitations are the sounder; or Men may hope for better measure then they find; or the latter day is a Scholler to the former; or a Man may desire to surprise him and cannot, whom he hath no desire to kill if he could; or Mischiefe growes not to maturity in an instant, but by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>The King might have prevented this repulse, by sending a Messenger before hand, or by comming with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such considerable Forces in so unexpected a manner.</hi> How considerable His Majestyes Forces were, and

               <hi>Nondum finitus Orestes,</hi> His circumstances are not yet done; He addes, <hi>the things remaining at</hi> Hull <hi>in the Kings trust for the use of the Kingdom were Arms, &amp; by consequence of more danger then other kind of Chattells. If I intrust my cloake to anothers custody, I may not take it again by force, but if it be my sword, and there is strong presumption that it may be drawn upon me, I may use any meanes to secure it.</hi> I wish all the Observers Faction had been of his opinion in one point; His Majesty and many of His good Subjects have been plundered deepely, and have had both their Cloaks and their Coates &amp;c. taken away by force, wherein they challenged a right of interest, which is more then trust. Still the Observer builds upon his former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travigants:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48224:101"/>
His Majesty is not <hi>Rex ad placitum</hi> one that hath meerely the custody of Regall power, as the Lord Keeper hath of the great Seale, or as the Observer may give his Cloake to his Neighbour to hold: but he is the very owner and Possessor of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty to him and to his Heires; and this not by the antecedent trust, nor by the guift of the People, but by the goodnesse of God.

Well, what is the interest of this imaginary State? an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary interest. <hi>An interest Paramount in cases</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. What a mixture of pleas is here? extremity is the plea of private Persons. In case of extremity where a Man can not have recourse to the Magistrate, every Man becomes a Magistate to himselfe: an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest <hi>Paramount</hi> is the right of Superiour Lords. But first, here was no such extremity, if there had, still his plea is starke naught: necessity doth arme a private Man against a Thiefe, but not authorize a private Man to disarme a lawfull Magistrate. His other plea of an interest <hi>Paramount</hi> is well worse; If the People (to comply with his own sense,) have an <hi>interest Paramount</hi> in whatsoever the King holds either <hi>jure Coronae,</hi> or <hi>jure Personae,</hi> then they are the Soveraigne, and he but a Subject. But it <hi>was reserved for him in better hands.</hi> Reserved for the King? how doe you meane? as <hi>Tophet</hi> is said to be <hi>prepared for the King;</hi> that is to shoot at the King at <hi>Edgehill</hi> or elswhere: otherwise I do not see how it was reserved for the King. This plea or the like, might serve a highway Robber or any Oppressor, to say it is taken into more needfull hands, or into their hands that knew better how to use it; or that it was but borrowed, and should be repayed <hi>(at the Greek Calends.)</hi> None so fit to judge in what hands a thing should be kept as the true owner of it. <hi>But the Kings right is not the same in</hi> Hull <hi>that it is in other moveables.</hi> True he hath
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48224:102"/>
not the same right of property or possession to sell it, or give it, but he hath a right of Dominion, and Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; protection, which is altogether inconsistent with his exclusion or shutting out of <hi>Hull.</hi> If he be held out of it by force, he is a King <hi>de jure,</hi> but not <hi>de facto,</hi> even as he is King of <hi>France,</hi> or at least of <hi>Normandy Aquitaine</hi> &amp;c. or as the King of the Romans is King of <hi>Rome.</hi> The King hath another interest in <hi>Hull</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side that of Dominion: other Townes are indebted to the King for their Protection, but this Town for its very Foundation. The Crown purchased it when it <hi>was capable of nothing but heards of Cattell and flocks</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Camden.</note> 
               <hi>of sheepe,</hi> The Crown builded it, the Crown indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed it with Privileges &amp; Possessions, made it a distinct County and able to support such a Dignity, the Crown fortified it and made it so strong as it is: and was all this done with an intent to be thrust out of it? O that <hi>Edward</hi> the third who builded it, or <hi>Henry</hi> the eight who fortified it with Blockhouses, were but in it for a day or two, with a Regiment of their old Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leers to try who should be King of <hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Humber.</hi> The proper name of it is not <hi>Hull,</hi> but <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Hull.</hi> The Observer doth well to decline the right name, for according to his notions, it may be called <hi>Kingston per Antiphrasin,</hi> because it is none of the Kings Town.</p>
            <p>If the circumstances will not justify the action, the Observer flyes to the Common Sanctuary of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours; a good intention: so he goes on, <hi>The next thing considerable is the Parliaments intention.

had it ingraven in his forehead, how he stands affected to the Commonwealth. We Beetles did see no signes of civill Warre, but all of Peace and Tranquillity: but the Observer and his Confederates being privy to their own plots, to introduce by the sword a new form of Government both into State and Church, might easily foresee, that they should stand in need of all the strength, both in <hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Hallifax</hi> to second them: whereof yet all true En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen do acquit the Parliament in their hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; though the Observer be still at his old ward, shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> out, and the Parliament in, so changing the state of the question. But what weight that consideration hath, follows in his next and last Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir</hi> John Hotham <hi>is to be looked on as the Actor, the Parliament as the Author, in holding</hi> Hull. <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is much wondred at, that the King seems more violent against the Actor, then the Author, but through the Actor, the Author must needs be pierced, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>if the Parliament be not virtually the whole Kingdome it selfe, If it be not the Supreme Iudicature as well in matters of State, is matters of Law: If it be not the great Councell of the Kingdome as well as of the King, to whom it belongeth by the consent of all Nations to provide in extraordinary cases,</hi> Ne quid detrimenti capiat Respub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica; <hi>Let the brand of Treason stick upon it: Nay if the Parliament would have used this forcible means, unlesse petitioning would not have prevailed, or if the grounds of their Iealousie were meerly vain, or if the Iealousie of a whole Kingdome can be counted vain; Let the reward of Treason be their guierdon.</hi> Hitherto the Observer
<pb facs="tcp:48224:104"/>
like the wily Fox, hath used all his sleights to frustrate the pursuit of the Hounds: but seeing all his fetches prove in vain, he now begins to act the Catte, and flyes to his one great helpe, to leape up into a Tree, that is, the Authority of Parliament, <hi>ut lapsu graviore ruat,</hi> that he may catch a greater fall. By the way the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server forgets how the King is pierced through the sides of Malignant Counsellers.</p>
            <p>Three things are principally here consider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ble. First whether Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> had any such Command or Commission from the Parliament. Secondly, if he had, whether he ought to have produced it? Thirdly, supposing he both had it, and produced it, whether it be valid against His Majesty, or whether an illegall Command do justifie a Rebellious Act.</p>
            <p>To the first of these. I take it for granted, That a Commission, or an Ordinance for Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> to be a meer Governour of <hi>Hull,</hi> doth not extend to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of His Majesty ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Hull,</hi> nor Warrant Sir <hi>John</hi> to shut the Gares against His Soveraign; if it did, every Governour might do the same, and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Command might trample upon Supreme. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can a posteriour approbation warrant a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent excesse; for this is not to authorise, but to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, the sole power whereof is acknowledged to be in His Majesty, without any sharers. To the first questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore, the answer is, Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> had no such Warrant or Commission from the Parliament: He himselfe confessed, That he had no positive or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Order. How should he know of His Majesties comming by instinct, or a Propheticall Spirit? A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative can not, ought not to be proved; the proofe rests
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48224:104"/>
whollyon Sir <hi>Johns</hi> side, and can be no other then by producing the Ordinance it selfe, or his instrument whereby he can receive the sense of the House from <hi>Westminster</hi> to <hi>Hull</hi> in an instant: If he have not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Ordinance to shew, it is in vain to pretend the Authority of Parliament.</p>
            <p>To the second question. Admitting, but not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that he had such an Ordinance, whether could it be availeable to him, being not produced, when it was called for and demanded so often by His Majesty? <hi>De non apparentibus, &amp; non existentibus eadem est ratio,</hi> Whether there was no such Ordinance, or no such Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance did appeare, is all one both in Law and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; He that can reade and will not make use of his Clergy suffers justly: He that hath a Warrant and will not produce it, may cry, <hi>Nemo laeditur nisi a seipso,</hi> No Man is hurt but by himselfe. A known Officer so long as he keeps himselfe within the sphere of his own activity, is a Warrant of himselfe: But he that it imployed extraordinarily, or transcends the bounds of Common Power, must produce his Authority, or take what falls. Sir <hi>John</hi> hath not yet gained so much credit, that his <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> his word should be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proofe, or his Testimony in his own case taken for an Oracle.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, admitting that Sir <hi>John</hi> had such an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and likewise that he did produce it, (for if we admit neither, he can prove neither,) yet the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is how valid this Ordinance may be as to this act. I doubt not at all of the Power of Parliament, that is, a compleat Parliament, where the King and both Houses doe concurre: but an ordinance without
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48224:105"/>
the King, against the King, alters the case; this may have the Authority of both Houses perhaps, but not of a complete Parliament. Secondly the Power of both Houses is great, especially of the Lords as they are the Kings Great Councell, and in that relation are the Supreme Judicature of the Kingdome: but before the Observer said it, I never thought the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons did challenge any share of this Judicature, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept over their own Members, or preparatory to the Lords: or that they had power to administer an Oath, which the Apostle saith <hi>is the end of all strife;</hi> who <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eb. 6. 19.</note> ever knew any Judicature without power to give an Oath? This makes the Observers new devise, <hi>of the people meeting in their underived Majesty to doe justice,</hi> a transparent fiction. It is not the Commons, but the Lords or the Kings Councell that challenge Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judicature. But take both Houses with that latitude of Power, which they have either joyntly or severally, yet His Majesty saith they have no power over the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome, or over his Forts or Magazines: he avoucheth for it the Common Law, Statute Law, Presidents, Prescriptions; we have not yet heard them answered, nor so much as one instance, since the beginning of this Monarchy given for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of such an Ordinance, or of any new Ordinance binding to the Kingdom, without his Majestyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, in Person or by Commission. If the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server have any Law, or President, or Case, he may do well to produce it: if he have none, he may sit down &amp; hold his peace; his remote inconsequent consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces drawn from the Law of Nature are neither true nor pertinent. Yet I never heard that Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> did
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48224:105"/>
allege any authority from the House of the Lords; but from the House of Commons onely. This brings the Parliament still into a straiter roome; as if it were <hi>totum homogeneum,</hi> every part to bear the same name with the whole: so he may give the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament to a particular Committee, or perhaps to a particular Member. He saith it is <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually the Kingdome.</hi> Not so, it is virtually the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Kingdom: not to all intents neither, but to some purposes. He addes, that it is the <hi>great Councell of the Kingdom, to which it belongs to provide that the Commonwealth receive no prejudice.</hi> It is a part of the Great Councell, and should provide for its safety, as the grand inquest doth for the whole County; by finding out the dangers and grievances, and proposing remedyes: but to prattle of a Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty or plenitude of Soveraigne Power, derived now at this time of the day from the People, is to draw water out of a Pumice, or to be mad with reason.</p>
            <p>I have now answered all that the Observer hath brought throughout his Booke, either concerning <hi>Hull</hi> or Sir <hi>John Hotham.</hi> Now will he heare with patience what <hi>Hull</hi> Men say?

<q>
                  <p>Forasmuch as the King being seduced by wicked and evill Counsell, intends to make Warre against this Towne of <hi>Hull,</hi> who have done nothing but by Order of Parliament: We therefore whose names are here under written, doe protest before Almighty God and all good Christians, to be ready with all cheerfullnesse and willingnesse to our powers with our Lifes and Estates, to defend the same against all opposition whatsoever.</p>

Some men may be so silly as to aske whether of these two ingagements, the Oath or the Protestation ought to be kept? The case is clear the former Obligation doth alwayes prejudge the latter: the latter Will is best, but the first Oath: The Protestation is plaine perjury, and to persevere in it, is to double the sinne: <hi>Dura promissio, aecerbior solutio,</hi> to make the Protestation was ill, to keep it <note place="margin">

To which much more might be added, as that the former Oaths were grounded both upon a naturall and a civill Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, were freely assumed, but this Protestation was meerely forced: the former were taken before a lawfull Magistrate, the latter before an Intruder, who had no power to administer such a Protestation.

               <hi>Ireland:</hi> A Tragicall Subject which may justly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge our teares and prayers. The Observer falls upon this in the 17. 29. and 36. pages of this Treatise, and likewise in his Observator defended, and other Discourses lately published, either without a name or under another name. The condition of <hi>Ireland is</hi> so much the more to be deplored, by how much the lesse it could then be expected: when Religion began to shew its beames over the face of that Kingdom, yea without any pressure to the Conscience of any man, except such as were introducers of innovations into the publike service of the Church; when the Law had obteined a free current throughout the whole Island; when the scale of equity gave the same weight to Gold and Lead, and the equall administration of Justice to Rich and Poore, did secure the inferiour Subjects from oppression; when there was a dayly growth of all Arts and Trades and Civility; when that which was formerly so great a burthen to this Crown in the ordinary accounts every year, was now become able not onely to defray its own charge, but also make a large supply to His Majestyes Revenue; when all the orders of that Kingdom had so lately given an unanimous expression of their Zeal and Devotion to His Majestyes Service: That on a suddain the Sky should be so totally overcast, with a pitchy cloud of Rebellion, That all our fairest hopes should be so unexpectedly nipped in the bud; deserves a little inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition into the true reason of it.</p>
            <p>Some who have long since learned, that <hi>a dead man cannot bite,</hi> are bold to cast it on the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> score; how justly let these two considerations wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48224:109"/>
First that the prime Actors in this Warre, were as great opposers and Prosecutors of the Earle: Members of the same Faction may feine quarrells among themselves in publike, only to gain upon a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous party, and to inable themselves to doe more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, but this never proceeds so far as blood. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, looke who they are in <hi>Ireland</hi> whose Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call actions, in such a scarcity of necessary supplyes, have mainteined the English and the Protestant cause, and you shall find very many of them the intimate Friends of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and principall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in the Irish Army called the Popish Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which was said to be intended against <hi>England:</hi> if you inquire further into the long Robe for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, you will find the same observation made good. Then let the Earles ashes rest in peace for this.</p>
            <p>Others bred out of the excrements of those Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants who made Warre against Heaven, cast this upon his sacred Majesty. (To use the Observers words) <hi>An absurd, unreasonable, incredible supposition,</hi> That he who may boast more truely then <hi>Pericles</hi> could up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his deathbed, that never one <hi>Athenian</hi> did wear black for his sake: Now, as if all his former goodnesse were but personated, or <hi>Neroes</hi> Soule had transmigrated into his Body, should delight in the blood and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Subjects. To what end? to exhaust his Treasure, lose his Revenues, weaken his Friends, &amp; deprive himselfe of the certain assistence of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, at a time when he conceives it to be so usefull for his affaires. They had need be strong proofes indeed, that can incline the judgement of any rationall Man, to such a senselesse Paradox. Let us view them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48224:110"/>
First, <hi>The Rebells said so, They pleaded the Kings Authority, They called themselves the Queenes Army.</hi> Is not this a doughty Argument? By the same reason we may accuse Christ, as the Patron of all Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Conventicles, because they say, <hi>here is Christ, and there is Christ,</hi> some out of a credulous simplicity, others out of a deep subtlety: or ascribe the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Haeresies to the Apostles, because the false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers did use their names, to make their Haeresies more current: So Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> and <hi>Serjeant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Skippon,</hi> doe pretend the Authority of King and Parliament; the King disclaimes both the one and the other: many who are now in Arms against the King, do verily beleeve they fight for the King, against some bad Counsellers, whom they cannot name. The same Rebells sometimes pleaded an Ordinance of Parliament. Nothing is more usuall with Pirates then to hang out a counterfeit Flagge.</p>
            <p>A second reason is, <hi>Sundry Commanders of note were passed over into</hi> Ireland, <hi>by his Majestyes warrant, who were seen presently after in the head of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells.</hi> His Majesty hath long since answered this, and demanded reparation of such a groundlesse Calumny. I onely adde two things. The one how ignorant our intelligencers are of the State of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to fein such a devise of a Brother of Sir <hi>George Hamletons:</hi> yet Sir <hi>George</hi> hath no Brother there but Sir <hi>Fredericke,</hi> who was then and long after in Manour <hi>Hamleton,</hi> as opposite to the Irish Rebells as the Observer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The other is, if this were true, yet it were but a poor collection; There are many who have had not onely Warrants under the Kings hand, but Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48224:110"/>
Patents under his Broad Seale, who owe their very subsistence to His Majestyes bounty; yet have made a shift to creepe from his bosome, out at his sleeve. If such a thing had been, (as it is an impudent Fiction;) yet these are neither the first nor the last, that have betrayed the trust of a Gracious King.</p>
            <p>The third and last reason is, because His Majesty was not so active to represse this insurrection, nor so ready to proclaime them Traytours: so the Observer, <hi>He that will not accuse the King of zeal against the Irish Rebells, yet he may truely say, there is not the same</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Obser pag. 11.</note> 
               <hi>zeal expressed that was against the Scots</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered supplyes of the English and Scottish Nation are retarded, opportunityes neglected, nice exceptions framed.</hi> This plea is pertinent to make the King, though not the Contriver, yet the Conserver of that Rebellion: but is as false as the Father of Lyes, from whom it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds Hear His Majesty himselfe, <hi>The Irish Rebells pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise</hi>

               <hi>such unhumane and unheard of outrages upon our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable People, that no Christian care can hear without horrour, nor Story paralell. And as we looke upon this, as the greatest affliction it hath pleased God to lay upon us, so our unhappinesse is increased in that by the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers at home, so early remedyes have not beene applyed to those growing evills, as the necessity there requires. And we acknowledge it a high Crime against Almighty God, and inexcusable to our good Subjects, if we did not to the utmost imploy all our powers and faculties, to the speediest and most effectuall assistence and protection of that distressed People.</hi> He conjures all His loving Subjects to joyne with him in that Worke, He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers

               </gap>ge the revenues of his Crowne; what can the Observer desire more? perhaps he may say these Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers came late and unseasonably. Then let us looke backward to His Majestyes Proclamation of the first of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1641, soon after his return from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in a time of so great Distractions here at home, when that Remonstrance which ushered in all our Feares and Troubles, was ready to be published. Let them shew, that any Course was presented to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty before this, either by his great Councell to whom he had committed the care of it, or by his Lords Justices and Councell of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who were upon the place? <hi>We abhorring the wicked Disloyalty and horrible Acts committed by those Persons, do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not onely declare our just indignation thereof, but also do declare them and their Adherents and Abetters, and all those who shall hereafter joyne with them, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the like acts on any of our good Subjects in that Kingdome, to be Rebells and Traytours against our Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Person, and Enemyes to our Royall Crown of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Commanding them to lay down Arms without delay, or otherwise authorizing and requiring his <hi>Lord Iustices</hi> there, and <hi>the Generall of His Majesties Army,</hi> to prosecute them <hi>as Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and Rebells with fire and sword.</hi> But if we look further still; when the first tydings of this cursed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion came to His Majesty in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he did not sleep upon it, but presently acquainted both His Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments with it, required their assistence, recommended it to their care, promised to joyn in any course that should be thought fit. Neither did His Majestyes care
<pb facs="tcp:48224:111"/>
rest there, but at the same time he named six or seven <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>olonels in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to raise Forces instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to suppresse that insurrection, which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: and they say, if some had been as active then, as they were made powerfull by the confluence of that part of the Kingdome, in all probability that Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice egge had been broken sooner then hatched; before that ever any of the old English, and many of the meer Natives had declared themselves. In pursuance of these premises, when the Act for Undertakers was tendered to His Majesty, he condiscended freely to give away all his Escheats to this Worke (an Act not to be paralelled among all his Predecessors:) yea though some clauses in that Statute, (especially for the limitation of His Majestyes Grace,) might seem to require a further discussion. The wants of <hi>Ireland</hi> and the present condition of <hi>England</hi> doe speak abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, whether those great Summes of Mony, or those great Forces raised for that end, have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to the use for which they were solely desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: yet <hi>Rabshekeh</hi> will not want a pretext to raile a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they conceive that His Majesty was not willing without good advise, upon the first motion to put all his strong Forts in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> into the hands of the Scotch Army; can you blame him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the present State of Affaires there? I dare referre it to any mans judgement that is not wholy prepossessed with prejudice, whether it was expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at that time, or conducible to the speedy settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48224:112"/>
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for them to make that demand<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> To divide a little Army, sixty miles one part from another, as farre as betwixt <hi>London Derry,</hi> and <hi>Carig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus</hi> or the <hi>Newry,</hi> where impassable Rivers and Mountaines, and an uncertain passage by Sea would not permit one part to assist another; was a ready way either to a long Warre, or certain overthrow, and not to bring it to a quick conclusion. Neither did these places stand in need of any addition of Forces to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themselves, whose Service and Victories against the Rebells, may compare with any Forces in the North of <hi>Ireland:</hi> all their desire was that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would but shew themselves the Masters in the Field, to carry the Warre home to the Rebells own doores. Or if they had desired more Garrisons, <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gannon</hi> or <hi>Charlemount</hi> in the heart of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> had been much more convenient to distresse the Enemy, then to have all their Forces lye scattered up and down the Sea coast. But these things were accorded quickly, and weeke after weeke, and Moneth after Moneth passed before any Forces moved out of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the Reliefe of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or perhaps His Majesty was not willing in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble of a Bill to Presse Souldiers for <hi>Ireland,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest Himselfe altogether of the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> here in <hi>England:</hi> We cannot be contented of late to gather the fruit, unlesse we may break the bough that did beare it, or to quench our present thirst, unlesse we may alter the property of the Fountain. Howsoever to exstinguish all questions, His Majesty did freely offer to raise with speed 10000 English Volunteers
<pb facs="tcp:48224:112"/>
for that Service; or to passe a Bill without any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the right, which might do the Work without prejudice to any Person.</p>
            <p>What is it then which may in probability be thought the ground of this Rebellion? It requires not so long a search as the head of <hi>Nilus;</hi> for though I deny not, but that the Hen might be sitting, and some <hi>Irish</hi> have been long plotting such a thing in forreine Parts; yet <hi>they sate so farre from their Nests, that they</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Guiccardine</note> 
               <hi>could never have hatched it,</hi> without some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary helps. Some say that by weak management, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Authority was grown contemptible; or that desperate Estates or crying Debts, did ingage the Ringleaders both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and elswhere, into such courses; or that Personall quarrells and Revenge might challenge a share. Some say that there was a generall desire to shake off the English Government: but omitting these and the like, there are two grounds visible enough. The one is the Example of the late Covenant of their Neighbour Nation: As the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone drawes Iron to it; so Examples especially if they be successefull, have an attractive virtue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. I doubt not but the one went upon much safer grounds then the other in point of Policy, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I desire to argue the Lawfulnesse in point of Justice, being a meer Stranger to their Nationall Laws. This is certain, there was a vast difference in the manner of prosecution, the one being more bloody then the other: which whether it be to be ascribed to their severall Principles, or to some particular and accidentall reasons I leave every man to his own Judgement. This is all I say, That if the one had not

               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>A second reason was a generall apprehension <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Jealousie and Feares at that time, That the Liberty both Civill and Religious, of the Subject and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus Men plunge themselves into reall dangers, out of fancyed and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Jealousies and Feares.</p>
            <p>The next thing in the Observer concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> is the disparity between the proceedings of the true Rebells in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the misnamed Rebells here in <hi>England. Their actions are all Blood, Rapine, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; All Ages, Sexes, Conditions, have tasted of their infernall Cruelty;</hi> Their intentions were to <hi>extirpate Religion,</hi> &amp;c. to <hi>massacre</hi> the English Nation; <hi>their chief Leaders, are Iesuits and meere Bandetto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> &amp;c. Farre be it from me to justify, or so much as qualify those barbarous Acts, which have been committed in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Cruelty is an Argument of a Coward, not of an Heroicall Nature. But it ill becomes the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server to inveigh against the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> untill he have first taken the beame our of his own eye. He that shall compare <hi>Dolman</hi> or <hi>Parsons</hi> the <hi>Iesuit</hi> with this Observer, either for dangerous positions or viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent detractions, may say <hi>aut Philo Platonizat, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Plato Philonizat,</hi> Good Wits jumpe. The Observer
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48224:113"/>
doth but suppe up what <hi>Parsons</hi> and some others had disgorged before, that he might vomit it up again. When once the Bankes are broken, it is hard for him that was the cause of the inundation to prescribe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to it. Had the Observer and his Partners been as much the Major part of <hi>England</hi> as the Papists were of <hi>Ireland,</hi> wee should have seen what men they were. In the mean time the Observer hath given a Caution, that whilest Christians remaine in a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive condition,</hi> that is, are the weaker part and want strength, it is discretion (not duty) to conceale them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion is against the Authority of the King, not against his Person, this both against his Person and Authority: the <hi>Irish</hi> seek a Liberty of Conscience to themselves, these not onely a Liberty, but to impose a necessity upon all others: the <hi>Irish</hi> desire a capacity of Preferment, yet at his Majesties discretion to cull out whom he pleaseth; these Men will be their own Carvers and not leave the King such a latitude: The <hi>Irish</hi> fight against Men of another Religion, of another Nation; We like wild Beasts fight Protestant against Protestant, Englishman against Englishman, Brother against Brother, Parent against Child: they fight for to recover what they had lost; we fight to lose what we have: they know what they fight for; the greatest part of us fight for we know not what: like the two <hi>Paduan</hi> Brethren the one supposing he had as many Oxen as there were Starres, and the other supposing that he had a Pasture as large as the Heavens; the mortall quarrell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them was, whether the ones conceited Oxen might feed in the others supposed ground. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb facs="tcp:48224:114"/>
it, they that cannot make rationall Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, why they put them by the eares together, have secret reasons to themselves, that they dare not manifest to others.</p>
            <p>The last passage concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> is an Answer to His Majestyes Objection, <hi>That if the Major part of both Houses in</hi> Ireland, <hi>should vote a danger to their Religion, or that Kingdome, and thereupon by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance settle the</hi> Militia, <hi>in the hands of such Persons as they may confide in, of the Romane Communion;</hi> they had the same grounds and pretences that our Men have. The Observer answers, That <hi>this is improperly urged, for</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>are the same Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> That <hi>there is as true and intimate an Union betwixt them, as between</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Wales. <hi>And though they doe not meet in one Parliament, yet their Parliaments to some purposes, are not to be held severall: And therefore if the Papists in</hi> Ireland <hi>were Stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and had more Votes, yet they would want. Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to overrule any thing voted and established here in</hi> England. <hi>The reason why the minor Part in all Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges subscribes to the Major, is that blood may not be shed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in probability the Major part will prevaile, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Strife and Bloodshed would be endlesse, wherefore the Major part in</hi> Ireland <hi>ought to sit down and acquiesce, because</hi> Ireland <hi>is not a severall Monarchy from</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. <hi>Nor is that a Major part of</hi> Ireland <hi>and</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>too, for if it were, it would give Law to us, as we now give Law there, and their Statutes would be of as much virtue here as ours are there,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Such Doctrin as this, hath helped to bring poore <hi>Ireland,</hi> to that miserable condition wherein now it
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48224:114"/>
is. Will you heare with Patience, what the <hi>Irish</hi> themselves say of this? If any Ordinance may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon us, without an approbative, or so much as a receptive power in our selves, where is our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty then? Our Government is meerely Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, our condition is slavish. We had <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> granted to us as well as <hi>England,</hi> and since that time, all other Liberties and Privileges of the <hi>English</hi> Subject: Shall that which is ours be taken from us without our own Act, or our owne Fault; and we never heard either in our Persons or by our Proctors? We desire the Observer to remember what he said before, <hi>That which concerns all, ought to be approved by all;</hi> We have no Burgesses nor representatives there: and that it is <hi>unnaturall for any Nation to contribute its own inherent puissance, meerely to support Slavery.</hi> Let the Definition be according to the Major Part of the Votes; but shall the Minor Part be denyed a Liberty to discusse or vote at all? As we deny not but the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> is united and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated to the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> So we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not, by what right any power derived from the <hi>English</hi> Subject, can extend it selfe over us. That power which they have over us is relative, as they are the Kings Councell, wherein he confides: or by virtue of his Delegation to his Judges representing his own Person. Thus they.</p>
            <p>For further Answer. First, this is a meere trifling and declining of the Force of His Majestyes Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which lyes not in this, whether <hi>Ireland</hi> be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> distinct Kingdome: but supposing it to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Kingdome, (as without doubt it either is or
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48224:115"/>
might be,) whether that in such a case as is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by His Majesty, it were lawfull for them to assume such a Power contrary to the Law of God and of Nations; or if <hi>Ireland</hi> were as much bigger then <hi>England</hi> as <hi>France</hi> is, (it is no strange thing for a greater Kingdome to be conquered by a lesser,) whether in such a case they might give Law to us, or their Statutes be of as great virtue here, as ours are there, meerely because it is so voted, by the Major part of the representative Body. An absurd incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Assertion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is not the like reason of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales. Wales</hi> is incircled with the same Sea, a part of the same Island, and originally in the Dayes of the <hi>Brittaines,</hi> a branch of the same Kingdome. <hi>Wales</hi> was incorporated to the Realme of <hi>England</hi> by Act of Parliament 27. <hi>Henrici 8. cap.</hi> 26: so was not <hi>Ireland. Wales</hi> have their Peers and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses sitting in the English Parliament: so hath not <hi>Ireland. Wales</hi> hath no distinct Parliaments of its own: but <hi>Ireland</hi> hath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as the <hi>Irish</hi> readily grant, that their Common Law is the same with ours: so they will not easily believe, that the <hi>English</hi> Statutes are all of force in <hi>Ireland.</hi> What all? even to an Act of Subsidies? who ever heard that. It is true, there hath been a question moved among some Lawyers, and those perhaps who were not the most concerned or versed in it, of the <hi>English</hi> Statutes, what Statutes and in what cases, and how farre they are binding to the <hi>Irish</hi> Subject? but I have not heard their opinion was so high as the Observers, or that ever the Bell
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48224:115"/>
was rung out yet. If all <hi>English</hi> Statutes be of force in <hi>Ireland,</hi> what need was there for <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh to make an expresse Statute in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to authorize and introduce all the <hi>English</hi> Statutes before his time to be of force in that Kingdome? this Act had been supervacaneous and superfluous. And since that time we see many Statutes of force in <hi>England,</hi> that are of no force at all in <hi>Ireland:</hi> and many both before and since that time of force in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that have no power in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, this Observer might be well one of Father <hi>Garnets</hi> Disciples; when he was asked about the Powder-Treason, whether it was lawfull to take away some Innocents with many Nocents? he answered yes; so it was compensated by a greater benefit or profit, which may perhaps be true sometimes (as in time of Warre) accidentally, in publique and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, but not in private and voluntary Agents. So the Observer makes profit and strength, to be the onely rule and measure, of all actions of State: Justice and Piety are banished by an <hi>Ostracisme</hi> out of his <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topia.</hi> This is to inslave Reason, and Crown bodily strength; to silence Law and Justice, and to Deifie Force and Power.</p>
            <p>The Observer is every where girding at the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; it is well that his new superstition reversed, will allow them that name. Have they not great cause to thank him, as the poor <hi>Persians</hi> did their King, when they were condemned, That he was pleased to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them? Sometimes he scoffes at the Tribe; There were seditious Schismaticks of all Tribes. Sometimes he derides their Pulpetting, (it may be he likes a

                  </gap> Publique Acts and Pacts of Men.</hi> He that accuseth another, should first examine himselfe. I doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that ever there was any Divine in the World, that made Kings such unlimited Creatures, as this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server doth the People. I have read some discourses of this subject, but I did never see any one so pernitious to a setled society of men, or so destructive to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane compacts, as this <hi>seditious bundle of Observations;</hi> which makes the Law of <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> to be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation from Heaven, for the breach of all Oathes of Allegiance, and all other Obligations whatsoever; which measures Justice by the major part, and makes strength and power the rule of what is lawfull; which gives the People the last Judgement of necessity, and upon this Judgement a power to rise in Arms. If any Divine have unwittingly slipped into any such er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, in not distinguishing between an absolute and respective Soveraignty, (which I can hardly beleeve,) yet the Observer might have held his peace for shame; The one is so intent upon the Law of God, the other upon the Law of Nature, that they both forget the known Laws of the Land.</p>

Or perhaps the Observer is for none of all these wayes, but as errant an Independent in the Church, as he desires to be in the Common-wealth. Here are many things very considerable in this businesse.</p>
            <p>First, That in doubtfull cases, <hi>Melior est conditio vossident is,</hi> Possession is a strong plea, especially if it be of long continuance, as this of Episcop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>cy is; ever since Christianity was planted in this Kingdome. This is certain, <hi>Brittish</hi> Bishops have been of Note in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Councells, since the second Councell of <hi>Arles,</hi> which is above thirteen hundred yeares; to say nothing of <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> mentioned in the Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> whom some good Authors make a Bishop in this Island. They that shall goe about to shake in pieces
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48224:117"/>
such an ancient Institution, which was brought into the Church, either by the Authority, or at least, by the approbation of the Apostles, had need to bring cleare proofes, not blind conjectures, about which they themselves cannot agree one with another. Bishops flourished long in this Kingdom, even when the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Church enjoyed the Cyprian privilege, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged no subjection to any forrein See what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That which the Observer saith of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, that <hi>our Laws are locked and Cabinetted in it, in such manner, that the wounding of the one, is the blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the other,</hi> (though he forget it throughout his Discourse,) is likewise true of Episcopacy, that it is woven and riveted into the body of our Law.

It was as wisely as charitably said of Saint <hi>Cyprian, If any of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours through ignorance or simplicity have not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that which our Lord hath taught, the mercy of the Lord might pardon them,</hi> &amp;c: So if any Churches through necessity, or ignorance, or newfanglednesse, or Covetousnesse, or Practise of some Persons, have swerved from the Apostolicall rule, or Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive institution, the Lord may pardon them, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect of Man; but we must not therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume. It is Charity to thinke well of our Neighbours, and good Divinity to looke well to our selves. But the chief reason is, because I do not make this way to be simply necessary, but onely shew, what is safest where so many Christians are of another mind. I know that there is great difference between a valid and a regular Ordination, and what some choise Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do write of case of Necessity: and for my part am apt to believe, that God looks upon his People in mercy, with all their Prejudices, and that there is a great Latitude left to particular Churches, in the constitution of their Ecclesiasticall Regiment, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exigence of Time and Place and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, So as Order and his own Institution be observed.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, those Blessings which the English Nation

have received from that Order, do deserve an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement. By them the Gospell was first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the most parts of <hi>England:</hi> By their Doctrine and Blood, Religion was reformed and restored to us: By the learned writings of them and their Successors, it hath been principally defended; <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper,</hi> were all Bishops, <hi>Coverdale</hi> excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised Episcopall Jurisdiction.

It requires good advise before we expell that Order which of Infidells made us Christians, and that the the reasons should appear to the World. An Act of any Society how eminent soever, wherein are none
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48224:122"/>
of the Clergy, may sooner produce submission then satisfaction to the Conscience.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, we have had long experience of Episcopall Government: if it have been accidentally subject to some abuses; I desire to know what Government in the World is free from abuses: yet late and deare experience hath taught us, that much of that rigour which we complained of, was in some sort necessary. If the Independents should prevail, who are now so busy breaking down the Walls of the Church, to bring in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse of their Democracy, or rather Anarchy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe but imagine what a confused mixture of Religions we should have: <hi>Affricke</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver produced such store of diversified Monsters. But to passe by them as unworthy of our stay, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist onely in that Forme of Church Regiment, which of all new Forms is most received. I intend not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall abuses, which from ignorant and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Governours must needs be many: but some of those many Grievances which flow essentially from the Doctrin it selfe. First for one High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, we shall have a Presbytery or younge High Commission in every Parish. Our Bishops are bound to proceed according to Law: but this new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is meerely Arbitrary, bounded by no Law but their own Consciences. If the Bishops did us wrong we had our Remedy by way of appeale or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition: but they admit no appeale, except to a Synod, which in a short Session cannot heare the twentieth part of just grievances. Our Law allowes not a Judge to ride a Circuit in his own Country, least Kindred, or Hatred, or Favour might draw him
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48224:123"/>
to injustice: what may we then expect from so many Domesticall Judges, whose affections are so much stronger then their reasons, but siding and Partiality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they blush not to tell us, that <hi>this is the Tribunall of Christ:</hi> Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That their <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is the Sentence of Christ:</hi> alas, there is too much Faction, and Passion, and Ignorance. Heretofore we accused the Pope, for saying that he had one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory with Christ: doe we now goe about to set up Petty Popes in every Parish? and are they also become infallible in their Consistoryes, at least in their conclusion, not onely in matters of Faith, but also of Fact? These are generall Grievances.</p>

            <p>Eightly, those Arguments which they urge out of Scripture against Episcopacy, are meere mistakes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the power of Superiority itselfe, with the vitious affectation or Tyrannicall abuse of it; and are none of them to the purpose. As those two Texts that are most hotly urged, <hi>The Kings of the</hi>

               <hi>Gentiles excercise Dominion over them, but ye shall not be so:</hi> and that of Saint <hi>Peter, Neither as being Lords</hi>

               <hi>over Gods Heritage, but being Ensamples to the Flock;</hi> do admit as many Answers almost as there are words in each of them, but they are not needfull. For no man that ever I read of, did say that Bishops had any such <hi>Despoticall</hi> or Lordly Dominion annexed to their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but onely a Fatherly power. And if these Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be to be understood in that sense which they would have them, they doe as much overthrow all their new Presidents, and Moderators, and Visiters, and their whole Presbytery, as they would have them to doe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy. Neither Christ nor Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did ever distinguish between temporary and perpetuall Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: between the Regiment of a single Person, and a Society or Corporation. They like not the name of Lord, but that of Master they love dearely: yet that is forbidden as much as the other, <hi>Neither be ye called Master, for one is your Master, even Christ.</hi>

            <p>Ninthly, waving all these and all other advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Scriptures, Fathers, Councells, Historyes, Schoolemen: because it is alledged that all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches are against Episcopacy, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to joyn the issue, whether Bishops, or no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops have the major number of Protestant Votes. First the practise of all the Protestant Churches in the Dominions of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denwarke,</hi> and the most of them in <hi>High Germany,</hi> doe plainly prove it; each of which three singly, is almost as much as all the Protestant Churches which want Bishops,
<pb facs="tcp:48224:124"/>
hut together, (to say nothing of His Majesties Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions;) all these have their Bishops or Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents, which is all one. But for the point of practise, heare Reverend <hi>Zanchy,</hi> a Favourer of the Disciplinarian way, <hi>In Ecclesiis Protestanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um non desunt reipsa Episcopi,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In the Churches of the Protestants, Bishops, and Arch-Bishops are not really wanting, (whom changing the good Greek Names into bad Latine Names) they call Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and generall Superintendents. Where neither the good Greek names, nor bad Latine names take place, yet there also there use to be some principall Persons, in whose hands almost all the authority doth rest.</hi> Neither is their practise disagreeing from their Doctrin. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with those who first were honoured with the name of Protestants, who subscribed the <hi>Augustane</hi> Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, among whom were two Dukes of <hi>Saxony,</hi> two Dukes of <hi>Luneburge,</hi> the Marquesse of <hi>Brandburge,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> and many other Princes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks, and Divines: Thus they, <hi>Facile possent Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi legitimam obedientiam retinere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bishops might easily retein lawfull obedience, if they did not urge us to keep Traditions, which with a good Conscience cannot be kept.</hi> Again, <hi>Nunc non id agitnr,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is not now</hi>

               <hi>What else is here decreed, but that order which we desire to be restored in all Churches?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appeares then plainly, by the confessions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches, by the Testimonyes of the most learned Divines, yea, even of those that lived under another Government, that if Bishops be not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, yet at the least they are lawfull. It appeares that three parts of fower of the Protestant Churches, have either Bishops or Superintendents, which is all one: and that those Churches which have neither, yet they have some principall Men, <hi>Primarios,</hi> which have as much power as Bishops, <hi>viis &amp; modis.</hi> But if we should be contented to leave three parts of Protestants to joyn with the the fourth, shall we find them unanimous in this? No such thing. The <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetian</hi> and other Churches ascribe the Government of the Church to the Magistrate and allow no Lay-Elders: But <hi>Genevah</hi> and her Daughters to their Pre byteries, yet neither the Mother is like the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor the Daughters very like one another; as hath been shewed in part before in this Treatise: and the Independents are for neither of these wayes: And all learned men doe acknowledge our English Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy to be lawfull, yea even the present President and Pastors of <hi>Genevah</hi> do the same.

Symbolicall Church; it is best for us to keepe us where we are.</p>
            <p>My tenth and last Consideration riseth higher, That according to their grounds, who have been the greatest Oppugners of Episcopacy, the Government of our English Bishops is not onely lawfull, but for the most part necessary, nor onely necessary but even an Apostolicall and Divine Institution.

For the clearer manifestation whereof, we must know.</p>
            <p>First that the greatest impugners of Episcopacy, do not seek to bring such a Parity into the Church: but that by the <hi>Ordinance of God</hi> and <hi>Dictate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> one Presbyter ought to be President above the rest, <hi>Ex Dei ordinatione perpetua, necesse fuit, est &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if these old neglected Observations, were a little quickned and reduced to their primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious temper and constitution,: perhaps it might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy sundry inconveniences, and adde a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Moderation and Authority to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.

power, of a Consull in the Senate, of a Praetor in the Court, of a Provost in a College, of a Steward in a Family: They ought to looke upon him as their Superiour and Governor, and be upon them as Brethren and Fellow-Elders. This is that which our English Bishops claime, whereunto they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled by the Fundamentall Laws of the Land. How farre the power of the keyes, of Ordination or Jurisdiction, is appropriated or committed to them, singly or joyntly by Divine Ordinance, (of which Subject great Authors upon great reasons have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselves:) yet in our case it is not so questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, where another Lawfull Right is certain: and this clear satisfaction of Conscience they want, who are so busy seeking after new devised forms of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Regiment. And herein I may as justly admire the excellent temper of our Church Government, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Observer doth of the Civill; I hope it is not in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us, <hi>ut Pueri Iunonis avem,</hi> As Boyes praise the <hi>Peacock,</hi> with a desire to pluck his feathers. The Clergy present, the Bishops approve, His Majesty confirmes, the Parliament receives: all parties have their concurrence, so as no Man can be prejudiced without his own act. If we alter this Frame, we shall have a better in Heaven; I fear not upon Earth.</p>
            <p>So then we see that upon these very grounds, which have been laide by the greatest Opposers of Bishops in this Age, 1 there is a subordination of many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors to one President by Divine Ordinance, 2 This Presidency, or Superintendency, or Episcopacy, (all is one,) may without violation of Divine Ordinance be setled upon one Man for his life, 3 This Person
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48224:130"/>
so qualified, hath a power essentially belonging to his place, to rule and moderate the publick meetings and Actions of the Church; yea to execute the decrees of the whole College, 4 This executive power may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a further latitude or extent, from the positive Laws of Men. What is the result of all this? but that as Presbyterate or the Office of a Priest, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Minister, (I shall wrangle with no man about a name, whilest we agree upon the thing) is of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, yet neverthelesse there is something Humane annexed to it; as for instance the Assignation of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Pastor to a particular Parish, (which custome was first introduced by <hi>Evaristus,</hi> long after Bishops were spread over the World:) so likewise Episcopacy it selfe is of Divine Right, yet something may be added to it, some extent of Power which is humane, and yet very lawfull and expedient; wherein every Church is to be its owne Judge. If to this which hath been said of the Antiquity, Universality, Aptitude, Security, of this way, &amp;c, we shall adde that <hi>Ambrose, Austin, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, Cyprian, Basile, Athanasius,</hi> and very many others, the lights of their times, were not onely Defenders of Episcopacy, but Bishops themselves; there can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main no scruple to us of this Nation what Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment is to be desired.</p>
            <p>But some do say, why then doe sundry eminent Protestant Authors inveigh so much against Bishops?

<pb facs="tcp:48224:131"/>
contrarywise we may say of Governours that in this respect they are most unhappy Men, for the Sun reveales all their infirmities: nay more, all the Ennormities of the Times, and the aberrations of their Inferiours, are imputed to them; but the Earth buries all their cures. Episcopacy hath been so farre from being an adjument to the Pope, in his Tyrannicall invasion of the Libertyes of the Church, that on the other side it was a principall meanes to stay and retard his usurpation; as did well appeare at the Councell of <hi>Treat,</hi> how little he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to that Order, and by the Example of <hi>Grodsted</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> who was <hi>malleus Romano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and many others. And now much the rather when Bishops acknowledge no dependency upon him. No Forme of Government was ever so absolute as to keep out all abuses. Errors in Religion, are not presently to be imputed to the Government of the Church; <hi>Arrius, Pelagius,</hi> &amp;c. were no Bishops: but on the other side if Bishops had not been, God knows what Churches, what Religion, what Sacraments, what Christ we should have had at this Day. And wee may easily conjecture by that inundation of Sects, which hath almost quite overwhelmed our poor Church on a suddain, since the Authority of Bishops was suspended. The present condition of <hi>England</hi> doth plead more powerfully for Bishops, then all that have writ for Episcopacy since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of our Church.</p>
            <p>I have made this digression by occasion of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers so often girding at Bishops; he may either passe by it or take notice of it at his pleasure. There are some small remainders of his worke, but of no great moment; as this, That <hi>there is a disparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb facs="tcp:48224:132"/>
naturall Fathers, Lords, Heads, &amp;c. and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall.</hi> Most true, (though the Observer hath not met with the most apposite instances) otherwise they should be the very same thing; every like is also dislike. He conceives that there is onely some sleight resemblance between them: but our Law saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly otherwise, That His Majesty is <hi>very Head, King, Lord, and Ruler</hi> of this Realme, and that <hi>of meer droit and very right.</hi> First <hi>very Head and Lord,</hi> and then <hi>of meer droit and very right:</hi> It is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Law should speake more fully. But the maine difference which may come near the question is this, that the Power which is in a <hi>Father, Lord,</hi> &amp;c. moderately and distinctly, is joyntly and more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in a Soveraigne Prince; as was long since de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the case between <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> and his Sonne. No Father could deserve more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence from a Sonne: yet he knew that Domestick command, must veile and submit to Politicall, and that the Authority of a Father of a Family, doth disappear in the presence of the Father of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as lesser Starres do at the rising of the Sun. But his maine ground is, that the King is the <hi>Father, Lord, Head,</hi> &amp;c. of His Subjects <hi>divisim,</hi> but not <hi>conjunctim,</hi> if you take them singly one by one, but not of an intire collective Body. So it seemes His Majesty is the King of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> not of <hi>England,</hi> nor yet so much as of a whole Towne or Village: yet the Observer himselfe can be contented to be the Lord of a whole Manour. I conceive he learned this doctrine out of <hi>Schola Salerni, Anglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Regi,</hi> &amp;c. If this assertion were true, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trmely

hath the World been deceived hitherto? and we have all forsworne our selves in our Oaths of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy and Allegiance. His Majesty is much bound to him for making him King of so many pretty lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Kingdoms: but as <hi>Titus Quinctius</hi> said of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> his Souldiers, when their Friends did set them out by parcells, for Armies of <hi>Medes, Elemites, Cadusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>  That all these in one word were but <hi>Syrians.</hi> So His Majesty is well contented to reduce all these Kingdoms of <hi>Microcosmes,</hi> into one Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> if he may hold that in peace.</p>
            <p>Such another <hi>Paradox</hi> is that which follows, that <note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Treason or Rebellion in Subjects is not so horrid in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as oppression in Superiours.</hi> One of the most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd opinions, and most destructive to all Societies, that ever was devised. By this new learning, when the Master shall correct his Servant, without suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground in the Servants conceit; he may take the Rod by the other end, give His Master some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances, to teach him his Office better: If it be a little irregular, yet it is the lesse fault upon these grounds. Doth any Man think that the Observer instructs his Family with this doctrin, at home out of his chaire? beleeve it not. By the very equity of this conclusion it should be a greater sinne, for a Man to mispend what is his owne, then to robbe or steale that which is not his own. The Superiour though he abuse his power, yet hath a right to it, but the inferiour hath none. How discrepant is this from the judgement of former times? they thought no crime could be so great, as that it ought to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Parracide: or that for discovery thereof,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48224:133"/>
a Servant should be examined against his Master, or a Child against his Parent. The Law of Parricides denyed, <hi>lucem vivo, fluctuanti mare, naufrago portum, morienti terram, defuncto Sepulchrum. Tully</hi> saith, they were to be sowed up quick in a Sack, and so cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River: not to the wild Beasts, least the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beasts should become more inhumane by such nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, not naked least they should pollute that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement which purgeth all things. Our Saviour cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Judas</hi> a Devill, <hi>Have not I chosen you twelve and one of you is a Devill?</hi> why a Devill? because he was a Traytour. Let the Observer find out a worse name if he can.</p>
            <p>Such another is his comparison, between the thirty Tyrants at <hi>Athens</hi> and the Cavaleers at <hi>Yorke.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons are odious, I desire not to meddle with them. But it is well known what the thirty Tyrants were. 1 They were a Company packed together by <hi>Lysan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> for his purpose. 2 They were called <hi>Optimi,</hi> good Patriots, and <hi>Administratores Reipublicae,</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrators of the Commonwealth. 3 They had the placing and disposing of the Senators or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells. 4 They made the Magistrates of <hi>Athens</hi> out of their own Faction and Clients. 5 They were great Profaners of Temples and Contemners of Religion, as appeared by their command to pull <hi>Theramenes</hi> from the Altar. 6 They armed 3000 of their own party, and disarmed all others. 7 They filled all <hi>Greece</hi> with <hi>Athenian</hi> Exiles. 8 They killed more in eight Moneths, then the <hi>Spartan</hi> Warres had done in ten yeares. 9 <hi>Condebant Leges,</hi> They usurped both the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative power; and more then that, an Arbitrary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48224:133"/>
without Law,: so as there was need of a Law, that <hi>no Man whose name was written in such a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, should be slain</hi> sine judicio <hi>without lawfull triall;</hi> other Men might. And yet as if both these were not sufficient, they assumed an absolute Power over the Law and against the Law: <hi>ego vero ne lege hac se tueri possit, nomen ejus deleo &amp; morte condemno,</hi> to depriye him of the benefit of this Law, I blotte out his name and condemne him to dye. Lastly, they had their turnes, according to that Prophetick Praediction of <hi>Theramenes,</hi> when he had drunke up the cuppe of poison and cast the snuffe upon the ground, saying, <hi>propino hoc Critiae pulchro, a health to gallant</hi> Critias the Arch-Tyrant; (which Story saith <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>Tuscula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Such flowers as these we find strawed here and <note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> there in his Book. And so he concludes abruptly, <hi>I find my reason already captivated, I can no further—.</hi> Whether it were done to amuse the World, as if he had much more matter, but that the Presse preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; or that all this while he hath been uttering, his misterious Enthusiasmes and Oracles, and now <hi>(propiore Deo,)</hi> he is rapt into an extasie or trance: or lastly, because he was as confident of the successe of his Observations, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of their <hi>Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Armado.
