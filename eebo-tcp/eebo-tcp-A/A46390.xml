            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Have now neither time to write the particulars of the Hiſtory of that Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> nor conveniency to inſert it into this Book of the Laws of that Country, becauſe I ſhould thereby make it to ſwell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the intended convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a Pocket-Book. But for the better ſatisfaction of any that may be inclin'd to remove themſelves to that Iſland, I have been deſired to write
<pb facs="tcp:61745:3"/>this ſhort (but true) account of that Country; which pleaſe to take as followeth.</p>
            <p>The Iſland of <hi>Jamaica</hi> fell firſt into the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the 10th. day of <hi>May,</hi> in the year 1655. The Middle of it is ſituated neareſt in 17 degrees 40 minutes of North Latitude, ſo that their longeſt day from Sun Riſing to Sun Setting is 13 hours 4 minutes, and their ſhorteſt 10 hours 56 minutes, The difference of Longitude, from the Meridian of <hi>London,</hi> to the Meridian which paſſes over <hi>Port-Royal</hi> (the chiefeſt Town there,) is 78 degrees 45 minutes Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which cauſes 5 hours 15 minutes difference in time, ſo that when it is Noon-day
<pb facs="tcp:61745:3"/>there, it is a quarter of an hour paſt 5 in the Afternoon in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> The length of the Iſland lies neareſt Eaſt and Weſt, and is accounted to be 180 Miles, and the bredth in the broadeſt part of it 45 Miles, ſo that its Figure is neareſt an Oval. It lies under that which is called the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the Air is moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temperate, occaſion'd by the long abſence of the Sun every night, by the ſtrong Eaſterly <hi>Breezes</hi> which generally blow from 8 or 9 in the Morning to 4 or 5 in the Afternoon, and by the Land Wind, which is a ſmall cool <hi>Breeze</hi> that comes off the Shoar from all parts of the Iſland in the Evening, and blows gently all
<pb facs="tcp:61745:4"/>Night. The Nights are for the moſt part fair, and not a Cloud to be ſeen in the Sky, ſo that by their clearneſs and coolneſs they are exceedingly pleaſant; The Day time is much more hot and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, by reaſon of the Sun, and the Sea Wind, which moſt days blows very hard; If the weather be ſuch as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſeaſonable, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly rains a ſhower in the inland parts under the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more or leſs every Day, about 1 or 2 a Clock, from the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> to the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> with Thunder and Lightning, and this makes the Iſland fertile, eſpecially if accompanied with thoſe they call the general ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb facs="tcp:61745:4"/>which are commonly great rains in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> that continue Night and day with ſmall intermiſſion for 8 or 10 Days together, but theſe failing (as ſometimes they do) is prejudicial to all things in the Country; the reſt of the Year is for the moſt part very fair and delicate weather, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much rain. Thunder, or Lightning, and not at all too hot. There are Earthquakes ſometimes, two or three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in a Year, but ſo moderate that they are over before one can well be ſenſible what they are, and never have yet been ſo violent to do any harm, The Middle parts of the Iſland are very full of Mountains, which towards the Eaſtward
<pb facs="tcp:61745:5"/>end of it, are ſo high that they are not habitable, ſcarce acceſſible, Theſe Mountains for the moſt part are covered with large Timber-trees of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of Wood fitting for building and ſeveral uſes, as well as for bearing many ſorts of Fruits, which maintain great plenty of Pigeons, Doves, Parots, and other ſorts of Birds, and alſo of wild Hoggs, all very good for food, betwixt theſe Mountains there run many Rivers, ſeveral whereof by the acquiſition of divers of the ſmaller Rivulets become large, but few Navigable, by reaſon they are for the moſt part barr'd at their falling into the Sea, and many of them ſinking into the ground (when
<pb facs="tcp:61745:5"/>they come into the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands) before they can reach thither; theſe Rivers are well ſtored with good Fiſh, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Creafiſh, and Eeles, ſuch as are in <hi>England,</hi> the reſt ſtrangers to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, though all very ſitting to be eaten. The Sea about this Iſland is alſo plentifully ſtored with many ſorts of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Fiſh, and likewiſe with Tortoiſe, and Manates, both pleaſant and delicious Food. The Low-lands and Plain grounds, are where the People generally Inhabit, and in theſe are Level tracts of ſeveral Miles in length and bredth, like our Meadows, (full of Graſs) called <hi>Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> (which Name they retain
<pb facs="tcp:61745:6"/>from the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) in theſe are bred great plenty of Cattle, Sheep, Horſes, Aſſes and Mules, ſufficient both for food and ſervice, there is alſo in the Country great ſtocks of Hogs, Hens, Ducks, Pigeons, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, Turkeys, and divers kinds of wild Fowl, and alſo ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtores of all ſorts of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Herbs and Roots, Pulſe and Sallads, and with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Fruits, ſome known here, as Grapes of divers ſorts, and from ſeveral Countries, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Oranges, Citrons, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats, and Musk Mellons, beſides other very good Fruits, proper to that Country, as the Celebrated Pine, &amp; many more not much inferiour to that incomparable Fruit, and that
<pb facs="tcp:61745:6"/>which makes theſe Fruits of the more uſe and beauty, and the Country thereby the more pleaſant, is, that they (as well as the leaves on all the Trees) continue all the Year, there being no Winter, or decay, but a continual Spring, on every ſeaſonable ſhower of rain, ſo that there is nothing wanting, for a neceſſary, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, or delicate living; In this Iſland are many conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Harbours for Shipping, beſides ſeveral Bays and Roads fitting for the landing or take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off of Goods: The chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of theſe is <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> which in its ſafety for Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, depth of Water clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Ground, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of the Shore and
<pb facs="tcp:61745:7"/>Wharfs, for lading and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lading of Shipping, may compare with any in the known World, and to add the more to the ſecurity of this, and the other Harbours of this Iſland, thoſe dreadful Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, which often afflict the Iſlands of <hi>Barbados, Nevis,</hi> &amp;c. never yet came near this Country. Adjoyning to this Harbour, on an <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of Land, is a handſome Town of the ſame Name, built from the Foundation by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> the ground it ſtands on is but 53 Acres, and cannot be inlarged in its buildings o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then what the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants gain by the height of their Houſes, for it's incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed all round with the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb facs="tcp:61745:7"/>and Sea, unleſs on the Eaſt part, and there the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> being narrow, is cut off from the Sea to the Harbour, with a ſtrong and well fortified Wall, built with Brick and Stone, and ſufficiently Gunn'd, to ſecure the Town from any attempt from the Land part, without which Wall none are ſuffered to build, that ſo there may be no ſhelter for an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; This Town for its bigneſs is very Populous, and contains about a 1000 Houſes, many of which are built with Bricks, and beautified with Balconies, after the modern way of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>London;</hi> the Streets are alſo regular, and kept very clean; there is alſo in it a fair Church built with Brick
<pb facs="tcp:61745:8"/>and Stone, and handſomely finiſhed within, and for the defence of the Town and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, there are 5 Forts ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built with Stone, on which are mounted about 110 large Guns, all kept in good order; hither reſort moſt of the Ships, here is the Cuſtom-houſe, here live the Merchants, and here is mannaged the chiefeſt part of the Trade of the Iſland; To this Harbour belongs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 100 fine ſailing Sloops, from about 12 Tuns to 40 Tuns in bigneſs, moſt of them built in the Country, which find very good imployment in trading and carrying goods about the Iſland, and to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> catching of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe, and other ways, by which
<pb facs="tcp:61745:8"/>their owners live very well. About 7 Leagues to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of this is an old Harbour, a very large, good and ſafe Harbour for Shipping, and here alſo is a ſmall Town built, which daily encreaſes, as the inland parts of the Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, are more and more ſetled and planted; More Weſterly is <hi>Carliſle Bay,</hi> a ſafe Road for Shipping, and there is likewiſe built a pretty Town of that name, of about 100 Houſes, which has a fine Trade, that alſo increaſes, as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try does in Plantations; farther Weſt is <hi>Bluefields Bay,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Roads, and the like there is alſo in St. <hi>James</hi>'s, St. <hi>Anns,</hi> and St. <hi>Maries,</hi> on the North ſide of the Iſland, and
<pb facs="tcp:61745:9"/>in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Georges</hi> in the North-Eaſt parts, is <hi>Port Antonio,</hi> a ſafe and good Harbour, and ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the South-Eaſt part, called <hi>Port Morant,</hi> beſides divers good Bays more on the South ſide, as <hi>Morant Yallahs,</hi> &amp;c. So that there want not conveniencies for the Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Exporting of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, in any part of the Country. There are no Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous or hurtful Creatures known to be in this Iſland, nor any voracious but the <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codil,</hi> of which though there are many in the Sea, and the Rivers, yet it is rare to hear of any injury done by them. There is but one Town in the inland parts of the Country,
<pb facs="tcp:61745:9"/>and that is called St. <hi>Jago de la Vega,</hi> it is ſeated near the banks of a fine River on the one ſide, and on the other is A large Plain, or <hi>Savanna</hi> of ſeveral Miles extent, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 6 Miles from the Sea of <hi>Port Royal</hi> Harbour, and was built by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> many years ſince, and in their time was a large Town, and well built after their manner, but on the firſt Peopling of the Iſland by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> (when they were only an Army) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Houſes were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by the Souldiers, and have not ſince been rebuilt, becauſe the trade of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try conſiſting wholly of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Merchandizing, the one ſort whereof living ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:61745:10"/>about the Country as Farmers do in <hi>England,</hi> and the other dwelling in the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Towns, there is no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Inland parts for ſuch a Community of Men to dwell together, as that Town would have receiv'd had it continued in its former greatneſs, yet here are ſtill many Streets, and fair Houſes, here is alſo the ſeat of the Government; The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours Houſe and Chief Courts of Juſtice, here the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly met, and here are kept all the Records of the Iſland.</p>
            <p>The chiefeſt Commodity that this Iſland makes, is a ſort of Muſcovadoe Sugar, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells any that is made in any other of his Majeſties Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the quantity of which

<pb facs="tcp:61745:11"/>Pieces of Eight, Gold, Pearl, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraulds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by means of which Manufactory and Trade, there is not leſs then 20 Sail of Ships of 300 Tuns a piece Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and upwards, beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which only uſe that Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and of all ſorts above 100 ſail of Ships now laden every Year, and as the Iſland fills with <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and is ſupplyed with <hi>Negroes,</hi> the Trade and Shipping will both encreaſe; This Iſland depends wholly on His Majeſty, without any other Proprietors or Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and ever ſince His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties happy Reſtoration, he has been graciouſly pleaſed it ſhould be Govern'd by a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour fully Impowered by His Majeſties Commiſſion,
<pb facs="tcp:61745:11"/>who has a Council conſiſting of 13 of the graveſt and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Gentlemen of the Iſland, to adviſe with on all occaſions, and to them, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, there is called an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Two and thirty of the Gentlemen of the Country, choſen by the Free-holders from among themſelves, by vertue of His Majeſties writ, which to that end is Iſſu'd out by the Governour, into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Precincts of the Country; Theſe together with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and Council make ſuch Laws as are neceſſary for the well Governing of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, and to the making of any Law, there muſt be the conſent of the Governour, Council, and Aſſembly, as
<pb facs="tcp:61745:12"/>three diſtinct States, of which if any one diſſent, no Bill can paſs into an Act, ſo that the making of Laws there, is Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilated as near as may be, to that of our Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>England,</hi> and theſe Laws ſo made, are of Force at all times, until His Majeſty be pleaſed to declare his pleaſure to the contrary, And for the Incouragement of any of His Majeſties Subjects to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with intent to ſettle and Plant, His Majeſty is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed, to give every Man for himſelf, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Servants, and all he brings with him (or ſhall at any time after import) 30 Acres of Land for every head, in any part of the Iſland, that
<pb facs="tcp:61745:12"/>they themſelves ſhall chooſe, which is not already poſſeſt by others, they paying only the common charges of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying and the Patent; and this paſſes to the Poſſeſſor, his Heirs, or Aſſigns for ever, by his Majeſties ſaid Grant, under the great Seal of the Iſland, in common Soccage, which Patent being enrolled, in the Office for that purpoſe eſtabliſhed there, is good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt His Majeſties claim, or any pretenders whatſoever, though the Patent it ſelf, ſhould happen to be Loſt, Burnt, or any otherwiſe deſtroyed, the manner of the civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is as in <hi>England,</hi> by Seſſions of the Peace, Juſtices, Conſtables, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:61745:13"/>neceſſary Officers, which are appointed in the ſeveral parts of the Country, as there is occaſion, that Juſtice may be equally diſtributed; And for the Military Government, and defence of the Iſland, every Man from 16 years old to 60, is obliged (in 6 weeks after arrival with intent to ſettle there) to liſt himſelf in what Company of Foot, or Troop of Horſe, he pleaſes, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liſted himſelf, he is not to remove at his pleaſure, except he goes to dwell in ſome other part of the Country, and then he muſt liſt himſelf in that Regiment, where he goes to reſide; Of this Militia (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no otherwiſe) the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is Captain General, who
<pb facs="tcp:61745:13"/>is impower'd by his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to make under him Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, Captains, and all other Officers, which Train and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline their reſpective Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and take care that they keep good Arms, well fixt, and ſufficient ſtores of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition always by them, that ſo they may be ready on any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. The Town of <hi>Port Royal</hi> has in it one intire Regiment of this Militia, conſiſting of 10 Companies, one of which Companies mounts the Guard ſucceſſively every night, and keeps Watch in the ſeveral Forts, in as good order as is uſed in any regular Garriſon, that is in pay.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HIS Majeſty having been graciouſly pleaſed (with the advice of the Lords of the Privy Council appointed a Committee for Trade and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations) to give His Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſeveral Acts made by the Governour, Council and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>Jamaica;</hi> it was thought fit to Publiſh the ſame, as well for the benefit of its Inhabitants, as all others His Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects who may Trade or be any ways concern'd there; but for prevention of Miſtakes (leſt
<pb facs="tcp:61745:15"/>ſtrangers to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> might think theſe few Acts were all the Laws and Privileges of that Iſland, which might leſſen it in their eſteem, and diſcourage ſome from adventuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their fortunes thither) I was deſired by ſome Perſons of Quality, to give a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account thereof, in obſervance of whoſe commands, and reſpect I bear the place, I promiſed my endeavours, but muſt be very brief, for that the Book is in the Preſs ready to come forth; wherein I may be the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable ſince a Gentleman who has lived long in, and very well knows that flouriſhing Country, hath here already given ſo good a deſcription of the Iſland which (as he ſaith) was taken from the
<pb facs="tcp:61745:15"/>
               <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Year 1655, and I may add in the <hi>7th.</hi> year of his now Majeſties Reign, who when he came to exerciſe His Royal Authority was pleaſed to own what his Subjects had done (which was the ſame as if he had Commiſſionated them) and among other his glorious Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles deſcended to ſtile himſelf Lord of <hi>Jamaica</hi> by whoſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace and favour we have hitherto all the Laws and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and continued amongſt us there. Theſe Acts now Printed being only By-Laws for better Government of the Plantation (which in ſome caſe requires diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Regulations from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England,</hi> as ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for Stanneries, Fens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61745:16"/>do here) and for raiſing ſuch neceſſary cuſtoms as may defray the Publick charge of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for all Judges and Juſtices in <hi>Jamaica</hi> determine all Pleas there according to the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> purſuant whereunto that Iſland hath been Govern'd, except ſome little Variations for eaſe and benefit of a new ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as our proceedings being all in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> our pleading ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Iſſues and giving ſpecial matters in evidence, our ſuits being more conciſe and far leſs chargeable than in <hi>England,</hi> the Practice of our Courts there much more plain and intelligible. To begin with his Majeſties Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Court of <hi>Judicature</hi> (ſo called) which hath the ſame Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction with the <hi>Kings-Bench,
<pb facs="tcp:61745:16"/>Common-Pleas, and Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi> at Weſtminſter, and is held <hi>4</hi> times in the year as the Terms in <hi>England, viz.</hi> every laſt Tueſday in <hi>February, May, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue each time about a Week, and therein are firſt determin'd all Pleas of the Crown, then follow <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> &amp;c. The Judges of that Court being Commiſſion'd by his Majeſty or his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are always <hi>5</hi> or <hi>7</hi> whereof not leſs than <hi>3</hi> can try any cauſe and they conſiſt of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Gentlemen of the Iſland both for Parts and Eſtates, and uſually the Chief Juſtice is one of the beſt Quality, who hath practiſed and is well read in the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> tho few of them are ſo learned as the Judges
<pb facs="tcp:61745:17"/>here, yet they are Men of the greateſt ſenſe and reaſon (whereon all Law is or ſhould be grounded) This Court is not Burthen'd with many Officers, for one called the Clerk of the Grand Court is <hi>Prothonotary Cuſtos brevium,</hi> &amp;c. Nor do we trouble our ſelves with many ſorts of Writs, as <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, Capias, Alias</hi> or <hi>Pluries,</hi> very rarely or never, arreſting any Perſon of known reſidence, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſend him a Summons to appear next Court, and that he may come provided, a Copy of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is always left with the Summons, which being ſerved <hi>8</hi> days at leaſt before the Court, the Defendant is bound to appear, plead, joyn iſſue, and come to Tryal the very next Court, or Judgment will paſs by default,
<pb facs="tcp:61745:17"/>no Imparlance being allowed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecial cauſe, as on oath that he hath material Witneſſes, and hath endeavoured, but cannot <hi>Subpoena</hi> them. In Tryals we have not ſeveral <hi>Venire's</hi> nor a particular Jury for every cauſe, unleſs in ſome ſpecial matter of great import, but by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Venire,</hi> the Marſhal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares enough for four or five ſetts of Jurors, not knowing what iſſues they are to Try (which prevents packing or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial returns) who are impannel'd in Court, and put upon the Crown ſide, or Common Pleas, in ſuch cauſes as the Judges extempore direct. And the ſame Jury uſually Tries Six or more at a time, as the Court thinks their Memory, may well
<pb facs="tcp:61745:18"/>bear, for help whereof ſome of them take Notes; alſo they are permitted to take with them the Record it ſelf with all Papers or Deeds proved in Court, moſt of our actions there being plain matters of Debt or Accompt and ſome few Ejectments, Writs of Dower, Partition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors indorſe their Verdict on each Record which is deliver'd in Court to the Clark, who of courſe enters Judgment unleſs it be arreſted, which every one may move the laſt day of the Court, but is rarely granted without very ſpecial cauſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently made appear; but if ſuch motions are ever favoured it is in exceſſive damages on action of Slander or frivolous Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes which are uſually diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced;
<pb facs="tcp:61745:18"/>we are not intreagu'd with dilatory Writs of Inquiry, but when any judgment is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd or paſſeth by <hi>nil dicit</hi> in caſe, &amp;c. the next Jury happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be trying iſſues in Court take the Record and Aſſeſs Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages preſently. And for eaſe of thoſe who live by their labour to prevent unneceſſary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and expences, all Actions depending that Court or Term, are called and tryed alphabeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally beginning with the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs names; ſo all parties witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may gueſs on what day ſuch a letter may come on, and accordingly give their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Fourteen days after the beginning of the Court Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion iſſues, for which we have but one Writ comprehending both
<pb facs="tcp:61745:19"/>a <hi>Fieri fac</hi> and <hi>Capias ad ſat. (viz.)</hi> to levy the Debt and Coſts of the Defendants Goods, or if he have none, then, to take his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but becauſe no general Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance is allowed before, we in a Manner give one after Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For that no man may be ruined by haſty ſurpriſe and ſale of his goods, the ſame after ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure in Execution may be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but muſt be left in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants hands to diſpoſe to moſt advantage (if he end not with the Plaintiff) ſo as to bring the money into next Court, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if he fails, then a <hi>Venditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oni exponas</hi> iſſues to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal to ſell them or any other goods or take his body: Before or after which the Defendant is at liberty to bring his Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb facs="tcp:61745:19"/>returnable before the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Council though it is very rarely practiſed, ſuch Writs meeting with very little encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in juſt Debts. His Majeſty hath alſo conſtituted in this Iſland a Court of <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> wherein the Governour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf always ſits as Chancellour, aſſiſted by ſeveral diſcreet Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of eminency as Maſters, where Cauſes are ſpeedily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined without thoſe delays and expences uſed in <hi>England</hi> There are alſo in every Pariſh or County monthly Courts erected for tryal of all Actions under Twenty pounds, or <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> with a <hi>Juſticies</hi> out of <hi>Chancery,</hi> which the Governour cautiouſly grants on ſpecial occaſions. Of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:61745:20"/>in theſe Courts Writs of Error lie retornable at the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Court, but rarely brought for reaſon aforeſaid. Then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Juſtice of Peace (beſides the authority of a Juſtice in <hi>England</hi>) hath power of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Court of Conſcience for all matters not exceeding Fourty ſhillings value. The Quarter Seſſions are alſo held in each Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh or County after the manner of <hi>England,</hi> and there is a Court of Admiralty at the Town of <hi>Port Royal</hi> for tryal of Piracy and deciding other Maritime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, from whence we have the liberty of appealing to the Governour there, or to his Majeſty in Council here for redreſs. The Governour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb facs="tcp:61745:20"/>hath power (as Ordinary of the Dioceſs) for <hi>probate</hi> of Wills, granting Adminiſtrations and determining all controverſies concerning the ſame; But Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical or Spiritual Courts are not yet known in this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, Nor are Purchaſers here incumbred with bad Titles for that Regiſter (ſo much wiſhed for in <hi>England</hi>) is here eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where all Conveyances being acknowledged are to be enroll'd within three months, if the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſors inhabit there; But if any perſons Feme Coverts or others reſiding in <hi>England,</hi> and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in any Lands or Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there ſhall deſire to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the ſame here, they muſt ſeal and deliver their deeds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two or more credible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb facs="tcp:61745:21"/>going for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting the ſame before a Judge there, the ſame may be enrolled in Six months, and ſhall be as <hi>valid</hi> in Law, as if done by Fine, Recovery or otherwiſe. In which caſe I ſhould adviſe the Purchaſer to take by way of Leaſe and Releaſe, and to have two parts at leaſt of each, with Covenants for further aſſurance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that if one part happen to miſcarry, he may require ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet ſo as always to keep one here, leſt any breach of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants ſhould happen. And ſince this publick Regiſter or Office of Enrolments is found of ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral uſe, that no Purchaſer or Lender of money can be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his Title, it may not be unſeaſonable (for advancement
<pb facs="tcp:61745:21"/>of our Plantation Trade, and conſequently enriching our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country of <hi>England,</hi> the great Receptacle of all our wealth) to encourage monied men (who expoſe it here at <hi>4,</hi> and <hi>5. per cent.</hi> yet cannot get ſatisfactory ſecurity) to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſome of it for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> where they may have unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſecurity, by men of viſible eſtates, or good Mortgages, for neither Perſons nor Eſtates can be there incumbred, but they muſt be diſcover'd either by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Regiſter or report of their Neighbours, who generally more intimately know and better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve each others Affairs than they can in <hi>England.</hi> Nor was it ever known that any Mortgage hath been defeated or Title pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb facs="tcp:61745:22"/>defective where compared and agreeing with the Regiſter, ſo that any Perſons having mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies here to put out, may remit the ſame to <hi>Jamaica</hi> by Bills of of Exchange at <hi>20 per cent.</hi> or in Commodities (by advice of Merchants here) at <hi>40,</hi> or <hi>50 per cent.</hi> or more advance, and lend the ſame at <hi>10 per cent.</hi> running only (in Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) the riſque of the Sea which alſo is ſo inconſiderable, that it may be enſured for about <hi>2 per cent.</hi> But when they recal their moneys they may expect <hi>15,</hi> or <hi>20 per cent.</hi> loſs on their returns though ſometimes they gain alſo back which loſs when it happens may be attributed to the difference of our Coyns here and there, <hi>Jamaica</hi> money being
<pb facs="tcp:61745:22"/>about ⅕ more in value there than it will yield in <hi>England.</hi> And ſuch Adventurers have this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encouragement, that all real Securities there are <hi>meliorated</hi> (being certainly emprovable) the longer they continue planted, whereas lands here uſually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in value. It might alſo turn to much greater advantage then the beſt way of employing money in <hi>England</hi> To purchaſe Plantations there, many good penniworths frequently offering, as may be found by inquiry here of ſuch as have eſtates there, though uſually thoſe that have leaſt do moſt undervalue the place: For if <hi>Jamaica</hi> lie under any ill character ſhe owes it to ſome few Prodigals who having Riotouſly conſumed that little
<pb facs="tcp:61745:23"/>they carried thither, and being through ignorance or lazineſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any imploy, come home and rail againſt the Country, to juſtifie their unprofitable voyage and return. There is alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imputation on <hi>Jamaica,</hi> viz. the difficulty of getting due returns and recovery of juſt Debts. To the firſt it hath uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more noiſe than ſubſtance, for many men of declining fortunes, to deceive their Creditors, or otherwiſe, boaſt of great concerns there, and diſappointments by their Factors and Agents, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> when really they have little or nothing in the Iſland, for if they had, the Law is open and much more cheap and expeditious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to be uſed there than in <hi>England,</hi> though indeed as to
<pb facs="tcp:61745:23"/>the ſecond ſome have herein met with obſtructions partly occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a former Law indulging all new Comers for <hi>5</hi> years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt proſecutions for forreign Debts: But that being now thought a diſparagement to ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous and opulent a Colony, was diſlik't by the Lords Committees and is not confirmed: Other inconveniencies ſome have met with for want of due infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation how to draw their proofs an procurations: I would not encourage any litigious ſuits, but for inſtruction of honeſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors againſt able Debtors, I ſhould preſcribe this method, that all Letters of Attorny be Atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Perſons going thither, who may prove the ſame <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> which being recorded there, is
<pb facs="tcp:61745:24"/>good though the witneſſes die or return, whereas Perſons uſually ſend procurations under Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſeals which are not there admitted for that better proofs may be eaſily had as aforeſaid; But ſuch cannot always be found for Debt: In ſuch caſe the Law there is ſo favourable to admit depoſitions atteſted under the ſeal of the City of <hi>London</hi> or other Corporations, but then the Plaintiff would do well to give due credit on Oath for what he hath received, or elſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant may have juſt occaſion (with ſecurity) to delay him by Injunction till he anſwer his Bill in <hi>Chancery:</hi> Or if the Debt accrews by <hi>Specialtie,</hi> the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal bond it ſelf muſt go over, it being unreaſonable to recover
<pb facs="tcp:61745:24"/>againſt any man on a Copy, yet the Bond it ſelf lie out againſt him; nor can indorſments nor truth ſo well appear unleſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Court. If any Bill of exchange be drawn from <hi>Jamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> which will not be paid here, one of the original Bills muſt go back doubly proteſted as well for <hi>non acceptance</hi> as for <hi>non pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and in miſtaking theſe or ſuch like meaſures (grounded upon Law and Reaſon) many have been baffled or delayed and then cauſleſly reflect on the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Iſland. This is what occurs at preſent about our Temporal Laws. I may alſo add that the People are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and I am confident, in no part of the Kings Dominions hath his
<pb facs="tcp:61745:25"/>Majeſty more truly Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for the number of its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, than are in <hi>Jamaica:</hi> We have very few Papiſts or Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for neither Jeſuits or Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt Parſons do or can live among us; ſome few have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, but never could gain Proſelytes enough to afford them ſuſtenance (though all except Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts may freely exerciſe what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they pleaſe without diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance) But for able orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines there is ſo great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it's to be admired ſo many can content themſelves with ſuch mean or no Benefices in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when they may ſo comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſubſiſt in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> for that they are certainly provided for by an Act intituled, <hi>For Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Miniſters,</hi> which ſee in
<pb facs="tcp:61745:25"/>this Book <hi>Folio 124.</hi> Beſides which allowances, in moſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes the Contingencies by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary preſents for Chriſtenings, Marriages, Buryings, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with Houſes taking Boarders, Schooling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make conſiderable additions. So that they may live comfortably and lay up; Victuals being as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and of the ſame ſorts for Butchers meat, tame and wild Fowl, Fiſh, Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (with more variety) as in <hi>England,</hi> with this difference that we have green Peas, Beans, Cherries, Aſparagus, Musk and water Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, Pines, Grapes, Oranges, Pomgranats, Citrons, Lemons and hundreds of ſeveral other ſorts of Fruits in ſeaſon all the year long. But ſome are apt to
<pb facs="tcp:61745:26"/>object the hazard of the Voyage, and unhealthineſs of the place; as to the firſt, It's as ſafe going to <hi>Jamaica</hi> as to go in a Wherry on the River <hi>Thames,</hi> where more Boats are caſt away in proportion than Ships going for that Iſland, for we ſoon come into a trade Wind and preſently ſail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, almoſt conſtantly blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Eaſt to Weſt, that is from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Jamaica.</hi> It being rarely known that any Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels miſcarry going thither. And this is evident enough if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the common rate of Enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers at two <hi>per cent.</hi> who are men of foreſight and experience never propoſing leſs then doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their money which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do if but one Ship in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miſcarry, yet that doth not
<pb facs="tcp:61745:26"/>happen in time of Peace. Then as to the unhealthineſs of the Climate, (there are ſome who never were abroad think all places beyond Sea much alike, ſo that having heard of ſickneſs and ſeaſonings for new comers in places lately ſetled they are apt to impute it without any reaſon to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> the Air being always ſerene and weather conſtantly temperate, though uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted very hot, yet it's only ſo comparatively in reſpect of theſe Northern Climates, being with us always Summer as if every Month were <hi>June.</hi> I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and can experimentally affirm for Twelve years laſt paſt <hi>Jamaica</hi> to be as healthful a place as any part of <hi>England,</hi> for ſober temperate perſons, who
<pb facs="tcp:61745:27"/>have command of themſelves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially at firſt arrival, and can moderately drink one third Wine with two thirds Water, but one the other ſide I think it as pernicious a place to debauch in, as any in the World, and this ſo neceſſary vertue of ſobriety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more habitual in the other Sex, makes the place far leſs fatal to them then men, whereof uſually ten dye in proportion for one Woman, as appears by the yearly Bills of Mortality on <hi>Port Royal</hi> (which is the <hi>London</hi> of <hi>Jamaica</hi>) and it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, if we alſo conſider the nature of the Climate (as it really is,) moſt propitious to Child-bearing Women who are not ſo ſubject to Miſcarriages, Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Pains or Difficulties before,
<pb facs="tcp:61745:27"/>at or after Delivery, as they are in <hi>England,</hi> for being always Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, there is no danger of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colds, nor need of Fires in their Chambers, no Rooms there having any Chimnies except the Kitchen which is uſually apart from the dwelling houſe. In <hi>Jamaica</hi> the Women after Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed are ſtrong and luſty at three days end, and about Houſe again in a week; nay ſome <hi>Negro</hi> Women are at work in the Field the ſame or next day. I have been often queſtioned about the Natives of our Iſland whether they were not a terror to us, <hi>&amp;c</hi> It may not therefore be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to declare that <hi>Jamaica</hi> is wholly Inhabited with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> who found none there but <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which were ſoon
<pb facs="tcp:61745:28"/>beaten off, and are long ſince in battel or by flight extirpated, though perhaps it was formerly very populous with <hi>Indians,</hi> but thoſe were deſtroyed by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> ſo that we have no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives at preſent but Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or their <hi>Negro</hi> Slaves (which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thither as Merchandize from <hi>Guiney</hi> and other parts of <hi>Africa</hi>) of whom we are in no ſuch fear or danger as in leſſer Iſlands. But <hi>Jamaica</hi> is of too vaſt an extent for any ſuch ſurprize, being in many places divided with mountains of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult acceſs, and great Rivers not paſſable but by Boats or Ferries, which dare carry no <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> without a written Tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et or Licence from their Maſter
<pb facs="tcp:61745:28"/>or Overſeer. And if any Slave be found wandring out of his Maſters Plantation any perſon may ſeize and carry him to his Owner or next Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer and receive a certain reward. By which and other expedient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, it's ſafer living or travelling in <hi>Jamaica</hi> than <hi>England,</hi> we having rarely any Houſe-breaking or Robbery, for want of receivers, moſt perſons there generally knowing each other as they do in Country Cities here, though there are few Inns for Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, yet they are better and cheaper accommodated at Planter Houſes, who are generally very Hoſpitable and are conveniently diſperſed over the whole Iſland, for all <hi>Jamaica</hi> is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from one end to the other, though in ſome places more thin than others. The Houſes indeed are not ſo cloſe as in ſome parts of <hi>England,</hi> yet uſually the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are contiguous, for a great Sugar work requires ſome hundreds of Acres for Canes, Wood, Proviſions, Paſture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet moſt of the Planters, are
<pb facs="tcp:61745:29"/>forward enough to ſpare ſome of it to a good Neighbour on reaſonable terms. The Wood-lands are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared and uſed for Planting, but there are vaſt even Meadows called <hi>Savannas,</hi> for grazing of Horſes, Cattel, Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we never cut nor make any Hay of, having Graſs all the year long, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a little too much dryed or ſcorched by the Sun, when many pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely ſet it one Fire, the aſhes whereof mannure and emprove the Ground againſt another Crop, which will ſuddenly ſpring again with the next gentle ſhowers or without, by the great dews which there fall in the night, and in the mean time the Cattle retire to other paſtures in ſhady Woods or lower Marſhes; it is alſo obſervable that our Horſes are generally ſwift, but few or none of them ſhod, yet will gallop the moſt ſtony way, and climb ſteep Rocks like Goats, nor are they troubled with near ſo many diſtempers as Horſes in <hi>England,</hi> it being common (though
<pb facs="tcp:61745:29"/>never ſo hot or hard ridden) to turn them preſently grazing, but the Horſes are uſually of ſo ſmall a breed that all Gentlemens Coaches (which are there very numerous) go with ſix Horſes a piece, we have alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hackney-Coaches. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living there for gallantry, good Houſekeeping and Recreations (as Horſe-Races, Bowls, Dancing, Muſick, Plays at a publick Theatre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſufficiently demonſtrate the flouriſhing condition of the Iſland, yearly increaſing as well in number of Inhabitants as in wealth and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being moſt commodiouſly ſeated in the midſt of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſo that we drain the benefits of their Gold and Silver Mines without their Labour and expences. The Town of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> being as it were the Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe or Treaſury of the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> is always like a continual Mart or Fair where all ſorts of choice Merchandizes are daily imported not only to furniſh the Iſland, but vaſt quantities are thence again Tranſported to ſupply
<pb facs="tcp:61745:30"/>the <hi>Spaniards, Indians,</hi> and other Nations, who in exchange return us bars and cakes of Gold, wedges and piggs of Silver, Piſtols, Pieces of Eight, and ſeveral other Coyns of both Mettles, with ſtore of wrought Plate, Jewels, rich Pearl Necklaces, and of Pearl unſorted or undrill'd ſeveral Buſhels; beſides which, we are furniſhed with the pureſt and moſt fine ſorts of duſt Gold from <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> by the <hi>Negro</hi> Ships, who firſt come to <hi>Jamaica</hi> to deliver their Blacks, and there uſually refit and ſtay to reload three or four Months, in which time (though the Companies Gold may be partly ſent home) yet the Merchants, Maſters of Ships, and almoſt every Mariner (having pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Cargoes) take occaſion to ſell or exchange great quantities; ſome of which our Goldſmiths there work up (who being yet but few) grow very wealthy, for almoſt every Houſe hath a rich Cupboard of Plate which they careleſly expoſe, ſcarce ſhutting their doors in the night, being in no
<pb facs="tcp:61745:30"/>apprehenſion of Thieves for want of Receivers as aforeſaid. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as moſt other Plantations ever did and now do keep their accounts in Sugar, or the proper Commodities of the place, for want of Money, it is otherwiſe in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> for in <hi>Port Royal</hi> there is more plenty of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Caſh (Proportionally to the number of its Inhabitants than is in <hi>London,</hi> which (among other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Acts) we chiefly owe to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident care of his excellency Sir <hi>Thomas Lynch</hi> our preſent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Governour, who about Ten years ago (by advice of his Majeſties Council there) raiſed the value of our current Coyns about ⅕ more than they will yield in any other part of Chriſtendom, ſo that none care to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Money off but bring great quantities thither, which occaſions the daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our Sugar works and other profitable Plantations, and gives great incouragement to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Planters in other adjacent Iſlands and Plantatione to remove
<pb facs="tcp:61745:31"/>and ſettle amongſt us, being there obliged to uſe traſh, and Sea-Coals to boyl their Sugar (which renders it not ſo good as when made with quick wood fires;) nor are they here at ſo great charge for Horſes and Cattle to do their work, nor pent up in ſuch narrow Plantations for want of Land as in thoſe ſmall Iſlands, nor ſubject to many other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies incident to little Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and ſmall numbers of People. This Iſland of <hi>Jamaica</hi> being very Capacious, and ſupply'd both from abroad and in it ſelf with great Plenty of all things neceſſary.</p>
