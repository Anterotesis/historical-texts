            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Some thought it a mighty and gracious Deed,</l>

               <l>By all, it appears from the first to the last,</l>
               <l>To be as Revenge and as Malice forecast,</l>

               <l>Yet all do assure that the <hi>King</hi> is much worse:</l>
               <l>And some by the Likeness, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> suspect,</l>
               <l>That he did for the <hi>K</hi>—his own Statue erect.</l>
               <l>To see him so disguis'd, the Herb-women chide,</l>
               <l>Who upon their <hi>Panniers</hi> more decently ride:</l>
               <l>And so loose are his feet, that all men agree</l>
               <l>Sir <hi>William Peak</hi> sits more faster than he:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40273:7"/>But a Market they say doth fit the King well,</l>

               <l>And others, to make the Similitude hold,</l>
               <l>Say his Majesty himself is oft bought and sold.</l>
               <l>Surely this Statue is more dangerous far,</l>
               <l>Than all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Pictures that caused the War;</l>
               <l>And what the Exchequer for that took on trust,</l>
               <l>May henceforth be confiscated for Reasons most just.</l>
               <l>But Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> to take the Scandal away,</l>
               <l>Doth the fault upon the Artificer lay;</l>
               <l>And alledges the thing is none of his own;</l>
               <l>For he counterfeits only in <hi>Gold,</hi> not in <hi>Stone.</hi>

               <l>Hath <hi>Blood</hi> him away, as his Crown he convey'd?</l>
               <l>Or is he to <hi>Clayton</hi>'s gone in Masquerade?</l>
               <l>Or is he in his Cabal in his —set?</l>
               <l>Or have you to the Compter remov'd him for Debt?</l>
               <l>Methinks for the Equipage of this vile Scene,</l>
               <l>That to change him into a <hi>Iack-Pudding</hi> you mean,</l>
               <l>Or else thus expose him to Popular Flout,</l>
               <l>As tho' we had as good have a <hi>King</hi> of a Clout.</l>
               <l>Or do you his Errors out of Modesty vail</l>
               <l>With three shatter'd Planks, and the Rags of a Sail,</l>
               <l>To expose how his Navy was shatter'd and torn,</l>
               <l>The day that he was restored and born?</l>
               <l>If the Judges and Parliament do not him enrich,</l>
               <l>They will scarcely afford him a Rag to his Breech.</l>
               <l>Sir <hi>Robert</hi> affirms they do him much wrong;</l>
               <l>'Tis the Gravers Work to reform so long.</l>
               <l>But alas, he will never arrive at his End;</l>
               <l>For 'tis such a King no Chizzel can mend:</l>
               <l>But with all his Faults pray give us our King,</l>

               <p>SEing you are pleased to think fit that these Papers should come into the publick, which were at first design'd to live only in a Desk, or some private Friends Hands; I humbly take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to commit them to the security, which your Name and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection will give them, with the most knowing part of the World. There are two things especially, in which they stand in need of your defence: One is, That they fall so infinitely below the full and lofty <hi>Genius</hi> of that excellent Poet, who made this way of Writing, Free of our Nation: The other, That they are so little proportioned and equal to the renown of that Prince, on whom they were written. Such great Actions and Lives, deserving rather to be the subjects of the noblest Pens and most Divine Phansies, than of such small Beginners and weak Essayers in Poetry as my self. Against these dangerous prejudices, there remains no other shield, than the Vniversal Esteem and Authority, which your Iudgment and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation carries with it. The right you have to them, Sir, is not only on the account of the Relation you had to this great Person, nor of the general favour which all arts receive from you; but more particularly by reason of that Obligation and Zeal, with which I am bound to delicate my self to your service: For having been a long time the Object of your Care and Indulgence towards the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of my Studies and Fortune, having been moulded (as it were) by your own Hands, and formed under your Government; not to intitle you to any thing which my meanness produces, would not only be Injustice, but Sacrilege: So that if there be any thing here tolerably said, which deserves Pardon, it is yours Sir, as well as he, who is</p>
