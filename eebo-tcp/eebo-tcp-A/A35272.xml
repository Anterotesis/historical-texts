         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> what I ſhall now, will appear Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and a flouriſhing the Colours after Victory;
but I think it not prudent to lay down Arms,
when there is an Enemy in the Field: ſeveral
Stories that once wounded my Reputation, and
half ſmother'd this <hi>Play,</hi> ſtill March up and down and do me
private Miſchief, and every Day they get new Detachments of
additional Inventions; ſome of theſe I think my ſelf bound to
deal withal. 'Tis ſaid, I openly confeſt, who I meant by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Characters in the <hi>Play,</hi> particularly by that of <hi>Bartoline.</hi>
That this is falſe, common ſence, and the Character it ſelf will
prove. Is it poſſible, I ſhou'd be ſuch a <hi>Bartholomew-Cokes,</hi> to
pull out my Purſe in a Fair, and as ſoon as ever a Knave
tickled my Ear with a Sraw (a little ſilly Flattery) I ſhou'd let
go my Diſcretion and perhaps my Fortune? (for Libels may
prove coſtly things.) They that made this Fool's Coat for me,
ſhou'd firſt have been ſure it wou'd fit me, leaſt it be turn'd on
their Hands, and they made to wear it themſelves. 'Tis known,
I am too guilty of the other, extream of Reſerv'dneſs, I do not
often expoſe my Writings, much leſs my Thoughts naked; And
for the ſame reaſon that Beggars keep out of the way, when
they find the Officers ſevere, the Overſeers of the Folly of the
Pariſh, have ſo often Whipt an undreſt poor piece of mine round
the Town, when I brought it to beg a little Charitable Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that I care not to come at 'em. If I had nothing to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I ſhou'd be miſerable. If therefore I find ſuch ill Entertainment,
from thoſe who pretend to provide for us, cou'd I hope for good
from Strangers and Enemies? In the next place, is it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
I ſhou'd make my ſelf worſe then I am, and accuſe my ſelf
of Miſchief I never intended? That I never deſign'd to perſona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Judges, indeed the whole Town, cou'd with as much eaſe have
Pictur'd any Mans particular qualities, which I wou'd not hear of,
though ſome would have entic'd me to it. That I have made my
Lawyer old and Married to a young Wife, is of no more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to any Gentleman in thoſe Circumſtances, then the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a <hi>Thief</hi> in a <hi>Gazette,</hi> by his Wigg and Coat, is to an Honeſt

agree in ſome thing with thoſe in the Advertiſement, ſhall
think him a Thief, and draw his Sword to defend him from every
Conſtable, deſerves to be laugh'd at for an Aſs. I had a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Opinion of thoſe who are ſaid to be perſonated, then
to ſuſpect any one, wou'd Apprehend them by Two ſuch Lewd
Characters as <hi>Barroline</hi> and <hi>Lucinda;</hi> to which they are ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
oppoſite in all things, but what is innocent and common,
Age and Marriage. If I muſt have ſtript my Characters of theſe for
fear of giving offence, I muſt not bring'd Villain on the Stage with
a Noſe, becauſe many honeſt Men have Noſes, and ſome of 'em may
be thought to be aim'd at. Nor is any one old Man, more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
mimiqued by Mr. <hi>Lee</hi>'s way of ſpeaking, which all the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
can witneſs was my own invention, and Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> was taught
it by me; to prove this farther, I have Printed <hi>Bartoline</hi>'s part
in that manner of ſpelling, by which I taught it Mr. <hi>Lee.</hi> They who
have no Teeth cannot pronounce many Letters plain, but perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
liſp, and break their words; and ſome words they cannot bring out
at all. As for inſtance; th, is pronounc'd by thruſting the Tongue
hard to the Teeth, therefore that ſound they cannot make, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like it. For that reaſon you will often find in <hi>Bartoline</hi>'s part,
inſtead of th, a y, as yat for that, yiſh for this, yoſh for thoſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a t is left out, as houſhand for thouſand, hirchy for thirty;
ſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they pronounce like ſh, as Sher for Sir, muſht for muſt; t, they
ſpeak like ch; therefore you will find, chrue for true, Chreaſon for
Treaſon, cho for to, choo for two, chen for ten, chake for take. And
this ch is not to be pronounc'd like k, as 'tis in Christian but as
in Child, Church, Cheſt. I deſire the Reader to obſerve theſe things,
becauſe otherwiſe he will hardly underſtand much of the Lawyers
part, which in the opinion of all is the moſt divertiſing in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;
but when this ridiculous way of ſpelling is familiar with
him, it will render the part more pleaſant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51450:3"/>
The next ſuſpitious Character is that of the Doctor; ſome ſay I
have abus'd an Eminent Divine to whom this Nation is much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieg'd,
and are greatly offended: Either that Divine is guilty of
the faults I have expos'd, or not; if he be not, they abuſe him by
applying them to him; if he be, he is not wrong'd at all. If a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine's
Coat be foul, is it Sacriledge to bruſh it, and make him fit for
Chriſtian Society? ſtrangely preposterous is the zeal of ſome Men,
they will burn the Picture of Chriſt wherever they find it, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Picture of the Devil if it be in the poſſeſſion of one of their
Friends. And St. <hi>Jude</hi> tells us, <hi>A Railer and Deſpiſer of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
is not like a good Angel,</hi> for St. <hi>Michael</hi> wou'd not rayl at
the Devil; but I charge no Man with theſe Crimes, they who have
a mind to beſtow 'em on their Friends may. The other Characters
I ſhall not trouble my ſelf withal, but leave 'em to be ſhar'd among
the Party as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Having thus vindicated my Innocence, I muſt ſay ſomething in
behalf of my Diſcretion. Suppoſe I have not injur'd particulars,
yet in aſſaulting a whole powerful Party, I appear little leſs than a
Mad Man, at least in their opinion; perhaps I was ſo, when I firſt
wrote this <hi>Play,</hi> then half the Nation was mad, and no Man that
I ſaw had cauſe to be ſo but the Poets; our Trades and Lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Authours of theſe Confuſions ſhou'd upbraid us with a Diſtemper
themſelves occaſion'd, nay, encourag'd in their Friends, whom they
endeavour'd to make as Mad as they cou'd; and truly when I ſaw
ſo many Mad Men, I thought it a Shame for a Poet not to be as Mad
as any one elſe. Tameneſs in a Poet is as great a Diſeaſe as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

When all Mens brains were a Galloping, I cou'd not hold in mine,

Lawful, and I at unlawful Powers; Mechaniques leapt over the
Heads of Princes, and I over the Heads of Mechaniques; and I was

held in ſo long, till they were taken many holes lower, that now I
may be accounted a very ſober Rider, and neither my Neck nor Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
in danger. I am threatned by a <hi>Parliament,</hi> but they have a
Childiſh opinion of that wiſe Aſſembly, who think they will concern
themſelves for ſuch Poppets as I have made ſport with. No doubt
they will endeavour to tune the Nation, but not with ſuch clattering
Keys as mine; they will maintain the Laws, but not the Knavery
and corruption of Lawyers; they will defend the Liberties of the
Subject, but rayling, faction and ſawcineſs, are no part of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
that I know of; they will encourage the Evidences of the
late <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> againſt our Religion, but neither them or others in
a <hi>Plot</hi> againſt good Manners. No doubt 'tis hateful to ſee <hi>Popes</hi>
tread on the Necks of <hi>Princes,</hi> but 'tis as odious to ſee a Rabble fling
dirt in their Faces: they will ſuppreſs the enemies of our Religion
and Government, than they will encourage this Comedy, for it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes

if your Eyes be not as good in ſeeing <hi>Plots</hi> as theirs, and
by twenty other marks in the Face or Hand: but they are ſo often
miſtaken in their predictions, their Art is become ridiculous. The
Lines in my hand I do not underſtand, but I do perfectly thoſe in
my Comedy, and I am certain by them to ſuffer no miſchief from good
