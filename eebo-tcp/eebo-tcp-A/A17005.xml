            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N humane affayres (gentle Reader) of Princes reigne, the yeres wherin thinges fall out, are noted of common necesſitie for diſtinction and certaynety ariſing by recorde of tyme. But this recorde hath not of ancientie conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to poſteritie. For the Lord, who altereth times and ſeaſons, changeth ſtates in ſuch varietie, that the true report of theyr me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory periſhed with them. For Diuine ſtories, tymes haue more vſe then for humane affayres: no leſſe then heauenly thinges ouermatch earthly. And as the worke of God is perfect: ſo he beginneth and continueth times regiſter, from the Creation to the Redemption. The golden Chayne which <hi>Salomon</hi> drew before the dore of the moſt holy <hi>Debyr,</hi> hath not ſo much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as this Chayne: continued from ſince Paradiſe was ſhut to <hi>Adam,</hi> vntyll the Lord opened the heauens vnto the Thiefe, that craued remembrance in his kingdome. The Fathers in the nobleſt lyne, draw in their age theſe yeeres, ſlyding by the Sunnes courſe, from the promiſe made to <hi>Eue,</hi> vntyll one of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:6165:3"/>
Fathers fell once away from hope of that promiſe. <hi>Terah</hi> was he that fell away: after whoſe death the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is reuiued to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Thence the Lynkes of this holy Chayne are faſtened on other poyntes: ſtately in ſtory, to be ſoner marked: few in number, to be eaſely remembred: deepe in ſignification, to be carefully ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died. Theſe are, the Lambe and the Temple: fit ſtarres to draw out the tymes, vntyll the true Lambe buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Temple, rayſing vp the temple of his body. For the diſtance from the Promiſe vnto the Lambe, euen the very day is by <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet downe. Likewyſe the diſtance thence, vntyll the buyldyng of the Temple by <hi>Salomon.</hi> Thence the whole yeres of <hi>Salomons</hi> reigne: and from the departure of ten Tribes vnto the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the Temble. <hi>Ezek</hi> 4. How long the Temple lay without any decree of buyldyng it agayne, we may certainely gather by the whole Captiuity which <hi>Iudah</hi> ſuffered in <hi>Babylon.</hi> For <hi>Nebuchad-nezars</hi> houſe was to reigne Seuentie yeeres: and <hi>Iudah</hi> ſo long to be in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie. VVherefore the beginnyng of that Captiuity muſt needes be, when <hi>Nebuchad-nezar</hi> tooke <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> in the firſt of his reigne, and brought the nobleſt to <hi>Babylon.</hi> In the ninteenth yeere of <hi>Nebuchad-nezar</hi> the Temple was brent: and thereupon the thirde Captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie folowed. VVherfore fiftie ful yeres are to finyſh the Seuenty, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> came vp, and made a decree to buylde the Temple againe. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was not mooued ſo to do, vntyll <hi>Daniel</hi> was taught by an Angel, when Chriſt the true Temple woulde conſecrate him ſelfe. That he was taught: for the very houre, when he prayed, at the tyme of the euenyng offeryng, how long it ſhoulde be vntyll the Lord did make hymſelfe the euenyng Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng, when the vayle of the Temple rented. For this laſt part, the Lord hath taken ſpeciall care, ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

tellyng the matter playnely: and ceasſing further particulers beyonde that age, that men ſhoulde reſt in the playnnes of his worde, as his holy Prophetes then taught of Redemption.</p>
            <p>Holy writynges touching theſe poyntes, I haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togeather. The playnnes whereof, yf any ſtryue to ouerthrow, I wyll no more yeelde to him, then <hi>Iob</hi> woulde to <hi>Eliphaz, Zophar,</hi> and <hi>Bildad.</hi> Although many differ in their Chronicles, yet theſe places onely being noted, all ſtrife ceaſſeth. One, that after <hi>Terahs</hi> death, <hi>Abraham</hi> at ſeuentie and fiue yeeres olde, receyued the Promiſe: whereof I haue diſputed at large in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Melchiſedek.</hi> An other, that three hundreth and ninetie yeeres. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. are from <hi>Ieroboams</hi> drawyng <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> away to the burnyng of the Temple, with the third captiuitie: which time, both in particulers, many haue caſt aright: and for the general ſumme theſe agree: <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> vpon <hi>Ezek 4. Gerard Mercator, Clement Schu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Math. Beroald, Ioſeph Scaliger, Henry Bunting.</hi> An other is, that <hi>Nebuchad-nezars</hi> houſe reigned but ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeres: which the <hi>Talmud,</hi> wherin lieth all Countrey-Iewes conſent, expreſſely holdeth: alſo olde <hi>Tatianus</hi> in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and old <hi>Grecians</hi> commonly, no leſſe of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity then the Apoſtles age: in hym, and in <hi>Clemens,</hi> with late writers very many, from <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. and the common rate of ages, in ſuch as were caried captiue: and ſaw both the fyrſt Temple, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde buylded.
