            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> but euen of all the whole Gospell it selfe, and of all our Christian life and duetie, as wherein the effect and summe of all is contriued and knit vp. Which although it contain matter more copious and plentifull, then can exactly be discussed at one time; Yet for our better and more orderly proceeding in so large a fielde and compasse, may well be deuided into two generall partes and braunches. First a theoretical position or doctrine of knowledge, respecting our beleefe and faith, as how neere the Lorde in mercie by the reconciliation of his sonne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth downe vnto vs; And secondly an application of this doctrine or hortatorie illation to the performaunce of all suche dueties as are answerable thereunto, and requisite to the direction of our conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and life. The first againe conteineth chiefely two thinges. First the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iewish Priesthoode, of their dayly sacrifices and legall obseruations and rights: and secondly a confirmation of our finall attonement wrought with God, and redemption by the bloud of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus once offered for all vpon the Alter of the Crosse, wherby he hath made perfect
<pb facs="tcp:17066:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for euer those that shall bee saued; Both which bicause by way of allution or colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are here set downe and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in one. I will also so proceede ioyntly to handle them in one, and not deuide them in discourse of my speache. In the second part again to be performed in our behalf, whereby wee shall approche and come neare in obedience vnto God, are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red specially three thinges, faith to enter and conduct vs in the way, hope to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and vphold vs to the end, and thirdly loue and charitie to the comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement both of our selues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Our faith must not be naked or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie, but clothed and accompanied with attendaunce of these properties, a true harte and a good conscience, so as both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur bodies and mindes maye be sprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and washed from all contagion of sin; our hope must not bee wauering and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant fitting and turning like our earthly affections, after the variable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the obiect wheron they are placed, but stedfast and vnmoueable grounded on the faithfull, and vnchaungeable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of almightie God. And our loue must not be famed, ydle or vnfruitfull in
<pb facs="tcp:17066:5"/>
pretence and outwarde showe, but in all points such as is described to quenche all bitternes and discord, and to fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and spring forth into all practise and exercise of godlinesse and good woorkes, whereuntoo for conclusion is annexed a forcible motiue the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to induce vs thereunto, for that the ende it selfe approcheth, and the day draweth neare.</p>

but a new way and a liuing way, a newe way, not in respect of the time of making, but for the most absolute perfection and vnchaungeable continuance thereof; not as though there were a time when it was not, but because there neuer shall be time wherin it shal not be.
