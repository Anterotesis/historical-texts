            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He maine scope (as I apprehend) of this Militarie Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is; First, to discover out of Gods Book the nature of Rebellion, and rebellious men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to encourage from the Lord the Kings loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Subjects, and true hearted Souldiers in their opposing such.</p>
            <p>Now the first of these is the Doctrine of this Text, and the second is the use of it.</p>
            <p>A Rebell is an evill or wicked man; for such a one is he, (saith the Text) <hi>That seeks Rebellion:</hi> sure then Rebellion it self must needs be a wicked worke, or a worke of wickednesse, because 'tis that which in the judgement of Gods spirit, wicked men onely seek for, or thirst after: there is your Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The use followes naturally, and 'tis this; If it be so, then 'tis the duty of all good men to oppose Rebellion, and to endeavour the suppression of all Rebellious men; yea, if extreme severity be exercised upon such, they have but their due portion alloted them of the Lord: for saies the Text, <hi>a cruell Messenger shall be sent unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see the Text doth well sute the occasion, if my discourse shall but as well sure the Text, and your attention (noble Gentlemen and Souldiers) my discourse; I hope through, Gods blessing, our meeting will not be altogether fruitlesse and unprofitable.</p>
            <p>But for the better knowledge of the Rebells and their work: of your selves and your owne duty, Ile give you a more full description of both, and that from the Text too; which to my apprehension doth offer a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble discoverie; one of the Kings enemies, and another of his friends or good Souldiers.</p>

            <p>And indeed the distinction is good, onely give me leave to adde this, I doe believe (for my part) that every wicked man who is a Rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God in <hi>esse,</hi> is also a Rebell against the King in <hi>posse</hi>: he that is not converted to God by grace, may in time prove a rebell unto his King: He that loves not the King for conscience sake, in regard of the Oath or Command of God, is neither a good man, nor a truly good subject; they that hold with the King for their wealth sake, to keep that, or that serve him onely for their pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I make no question, but if others could give them better security for their Estates, or would give them better wages, they would make no matter to cast off their present obedience: such men are but like the Cananites in the booke of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> who when they could get ability and advantage to themselves, did shake off the yoak of <hi>Israel,</hi> and took part with the enemies against their Governours: I wish these present times had not spoken too loudly to this purpose; surely as <hi>feare God and the King,</hi> so <hi>love God and the King</hi> go together.</p>
            <p>But further I grant this, 'tis one thing <hi>facere malum,</hi> and another thing <hi>quaerere malum</hi>; even a good man may unadvisedly or through weaknesse doe evill, but not purposely seek to do it: He may be an assister <hi>in,</hi> but not a contriver of Rebellion, and such a one may be recovered out of the snare of Satan, (as those are who are come from the Rebells unto us,) for why? Rebellion is but adventitious unto such a one, whereas unto the other, 'tis naturall, yea 'tis his naturall disposition to rebell, and of such a Rebell, the Text speaks: and him I affirme to be a most wicked man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a man of a most malignant disposition, which I prove thus.</p>
            <p>This rebellious disposition or inclination is bred and borne with him, and so 'tis rivetted into his very soul. <hi>David</hi> speaking of such, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58.3, 4, &amp;c. saies, <hi>They are refractory from he Wombe, so soon as they are borne, they go astray, and speak lies,</hi> (the true practice of all Rebells) <hi>the poyson of their lipps is the poyson of a serpent,</hi> (blasting the credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of their betters,) <hi>they are like the deafe adder which stoppeth her eare, and will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charme they never so wisely, i. e.</hi> they will not be perswaded by any good couns<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the former Chapter <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.27, 28, 29. this rebellious man is well set forth by his titles, and by his practices, these we shall note in the next point but observe his titles now.</p>

            <p>And since the Holy Ghost doth so clearly note the pains and diligence of rebellious men, do but you in your secret thoughts consider how well the <hi>Kings enemies</hi> (the <hi>men of Westminster</hi> I meane) have approved themselves to be fully such by their caraiages.</p>
            <p>First consider how painfull and diligent they were at first, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kingdome, to get themselves chosen to be Members: then how cunning they were to get leave to sit so long as they listed: then how politike they were to drive from the House all that were not of their own faction: then how subtill they were to get the strength and <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom into their own hands: then how impudent they were in working suspicious thoughts in peoples hearts, against their lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and religious Soveraigne: and then how industrious they were to get the vulgar ingaged with themselves in their rebellious way: what digging, what sowing, what whispering, what inticing, and what vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent waies did, and still do they use to perpetuate this Rebellion? But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all devices and tricks, one (to my apprehension) is the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable: when they had seized upon the Kings Revenues and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies (granted to another end,) and had borrowed much money upon the pretended sale of <hi>Irish Lands,</hi> and had collected a great deale more upon preaence to relieve the poore Protestants of that Kingdome; after these, and manie other purse-milking stratagems, (before they came to downright plunder, and to leavie by way of Excise, and to weekly or monethly taxations, they did set up for advantage, a certain counterfeit puppet stiled <hi>Publique Faith,</hi> who like a wise-woman (whom they call a witch) did extremelie cozen and cheat the vulgar: for upon her bare word, promising repaiment, (and with interest too) out of the Estates of the Nobilitie and Gentrie with the King, (which were alreadie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the same tenure with <hi>Irish lands,</hi> and nearer home,) they (the common people I meane) brought in their plate and money with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme greedinesse, whereby they have so deeplie ingaged themselves in the Rebellion with these Craftmasters, that these wise-men can and do now urge it upon them, as the strongest argument of all, to keep them to themselves; <hi>All is gone</hi> (say they) <hi>and you will be beggers, and never have

            <p>Nay alas they have digged down the walls of many bodies, and beene occasions of the slaughter of many thousand men; they have digged down the walls of many of their consciences, (who are still living) by their execrable oaths and accursed covenants; nay more then this, they have in a manner digged up the most reformed Church in the woorld, by their prophanenesse and Atheisme; and the most flourishing Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in Christendome, by their cruelties and combustions.</p>
            <p>They have digged and searched into all the practices of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> for policies, into the conspiracies and conditions of <hi>Catiline, Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and <hi>Sejanus,</hi> they have looked into all the actions of <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> into the Schooles of <hi>Machiavel</hi> and the Jesuites, for tricks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises to further their designes: I durst undertake to evidence somewhat of all these in their doings. Yea so diligent and industrious have they been, that they have acted Satans part, in rebelling themselves, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing others: <hi>Cains</hi> part in slaying and murdering their brethren; <hi>Chams</hi> part in mocking their Father, their common Father: they have acted <hi>Achitophels</hi> part in devising destruction unto their Soveraigne: <hi>Absolom</hi> and <hi>Sheba's</hi> part, in lifting up the hand against him, <hi>Doegs</hi> part in slandering and murdering the Priests of God: they have acted <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi> part in their endeavours to rent the Kingdome from the house of <hi>David,</hi> in their defiling the worship and service of God, and in their set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up to be Priests the lowest and basest of the people: they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Rabshakehs</hi> part in railing against the Lords Annointed, in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Subjects, even on purpose to stirre them up to rebell against him: and <hi>Iudas</hi> his part in betraying their Master, at least in betraying that trust which he reposed in them. Well (friends) I say but this, doe you consider seriously of these things, and then judge in your secret thoughts, whether the Kings enemies, those <hi>men of Westminster,</hi> be not exceeding diligent and industrious Rebels. And so I come to the third thing in their discription;</p>

            <p>And it must of necessity be so, that rebellion is a worke of mischief,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> we are told that all the good men be on their side, whom you call the Rebells, and the best Preachers, whose Doctrines and lives have been most unblameable, yea our selves know many honest and good men who are ingaged in that way: and we are told also, that none but Papists, swearers, drunkards, and uncleane livers are on the Kings sid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and we see (God helpe) many of this sort with our owne eyes; wherefore either those you account Rebells are not such, or else your Doctrine is not true.</p>
            <p>To this I Answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Those I call Rebells are truly such,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> for rebellion (as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) is a resisting the Authority, and a violent opposing the will and person of the lawfull Governour; and none can deny, but these doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Authority, and violently oppose the will and person of the King, which is the lawfull Governour, therefore they are truly called and counted Rebells.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49725:9"/>2. I answer concerning those wicked on this side, we will not deny but we have of them too many, and as they are our shame, I wish also they were more our sorrow; the Lord give them all hearts and grace to amend their conditions, that they may cease at length to discredit a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious King, and a righteous Caus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For those known good men who are ingaged on the Enemies side, I Answer, (according to my former distinction) <hi>facere malum</hi> is one thing, and <hi>quaerere malum</hi> is another; good men through deception may be assisters <hi>in,</hi> but they are not the contrivers <hi>of</hi> this black Rebellion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For those eminent Preachers whose diligence in their callings, and commendable lives, have so bewitched people, as to thinke well of this rebellious way for their sakes, because they walke in it, I answer; I'le not deny their good gifts, but this I'le say, that gifts and grace doe not alway bed together, Satan hath more abilities and gifts then any man: Nor doe I deny their restraining graces, but doe confesse that many of their lives (like those of the Pharisees in the Gospell, that loved the praise of men) were outwardly very commendable before this Rebellion did begin: But you must know that Satans tricke hath alwai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> been (when he hath endeavoured, or done most mischiefe to the Church of God) to appeare in the shape of an Angell of light; to worke by the persons of such well reputed men; He that could make use of <hi>Peters</hi> tongue to tempt our Saviour, (when Christ bad that great Apostle, <hi>get thee behind me Satan,</hi>) no doubt but he can and will, and doth make use of the tongues and examples of these men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to deceive the common people: <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> from the Lord saies, that <hi>Rebellion is as the sinne of Witch-craft,</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis exceeding apt to entice and bewitch people to it self, by those specious and religious shewes which the fomenters of it shall make unto the World.</p>
            <p>Or perhaps because people did too much adore the abilities of those men, would heare the word onely (for their sakes) when they preached it; and would look upon their examples more for their imitation, then upon the word it selfe for their direction: God as a punishment on such people, hath suffred those whom they so admired, to be the instruments to lead them into those of misery and errour, that others might learne by their harmes afterward, to love men for the words sake, and to trust more unto that then unto them.</p>
            <p>But (in short) I would have you all consider but two things out of Scripture, which must bee the rule to judge both men and their waies by.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Consider that grace and peace, or truth and peace, goe alway
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49725:9"/>
together in holy Writ, and what God hath joyned together there, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes joyned in every truly honest heart; therefore if you see men that do not know, or will not own the way of peace to walk therein, you may well conclude, that they are surely out of the paths of truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider what S. <hi>Iames</hi> saies of sinfull and heavenly wisdome;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> the former he saies is <hi>earthly, sensuall, divellish,</hi> and the fruits of it are <hi>envy, strife, confusion,</hi> and <hi>every evill worke:</hi> but the other, that <hi>which is from above, is pure, peaceable, gentle, easie to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and hypocrisie</hi>: yea, <hi>the fruit of it is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and peace</hi>; and hereupon do you but judge in your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences whether the course which those admired Ministers take doth savour more of that earthly and diabolicall, or of this divine and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wisdome.</p>
            <p>And last of all remember, that 'tis some comfort to men who have indiscreetly thrust themselves into a mierie way, to have many compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the same, that so part of the blame and shame might be on them, which els would lie wholly on their own heads: you have heard the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Fox, who having lost his own taile, perswaded other Foxes to cut off their tailes too: faire p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Let the use of the point therefore be to work an hatred in you of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion by any means, do not countenance the devils worke,<note place="margin">

               </gap>t, according to their oath and duty, and stirred no more to the molestation of their gracious and mercifull King; but we see they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their former vomit: Rebellion, as was said before, is called witch-craft, and another reason (beside that already alledged) is because if a man be once intangled in its charmes, he can hardly get free or loose againe: 'tis no small mercy of God to those men that are come out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49725:10"/>
from them, who were once of them: O let such offer unto God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall praises.</p>
            <p>And thus have you seen from the former part of the verse, the enemie discovered:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Part</hi> 2.</note> I come now to describe the Kings true Souldier, nay the Text also describes him, by his Office, by his Commission, and by his imployment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By his Office, he is <hi>Nuncius,</hi> a Messenger, or <hi>Angelus,</hi> so some read it, and an Angell is a Messenger of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so is he, being an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of Justice to punish evill; and that shall be the lesson,
<q>
                  <note place="margin">Doct.</note>The Executioners of Iustice are the Messengers of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>God is King of all the world, and as by his providence and mercy he preserves the innocent, so by his Angels both good and bad he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict punishment upon the wicked; the Devills are his bad Angels to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his Justice upon the damned, and so perhaps shall the Rebels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be, to lay his vengeance upon some of you, who are wicked and ungodly men: for though you be on the right side, yet God may suffer your persons to fall by the hands of those men for your own sins; he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually sets one wicked man to punish another. But the good Angels also are executioners of Gods justice at some times, it was a good Angell that smote the Host of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> and so was that which smote <hi>Herod</hi> with wormes, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. so in like sort good men are somtimes imployed as instruments of justice to punish the wicked; the Prince or Magistrate is the Angell or <hi>Minister of God, and carries the sword for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evill doers,</hi> and so are all they who being imployed by him, doe neither abuse themselves nor their Authority, of which number are all honest martiall men, sent by the King, Gods Vicegerent; <hi>David</hi> and his men being authorized by <hi>Saul</hi> against the Philistines, were said to fight Gods battels.</p>
            <p>I must be brief (for the time runs,) wherefore let the use of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration be,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse.</hi>
               </note> to perswade you all, who are men of war, to walk worthy the honour which God hath put upon you; you are his Messengers to execute his will, I beseech you remember that he is an holy God; and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse becomes all his servants: you'l think we Ministers, who are Gods Messengers in another kind, should much dishonour him our Master, if we should not live holy lives, but should drink, and sweare, and commit evill; why be pleased to remember, that your selves are Messengers to the same Master, and holinesse is comely in the camp, and is required thereto, as well as in the Church: read at your leisure in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. from Vers. 9. to the 15. Nay believe it, (Gentlemen and Souldiers) your practice of vice and sin will both dishonour God, and your selves, in that service
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49725:10"/>
wherein you are imployed; the maine Argument which the Enemies have to keep the people in rebellion in, is, their Declarations to them of the wicked and deboist lives of the Cavaliers: O say they, do you think such wretched swearers, such vicious livers, as the Cavaliers be, are of Gods sending? will they maintain Christian Religion, that shew so little of it in their carriages? thus they argue: Indeed I know they vent many of their own fiction, and also that they inlarge the faults of some upon all, wherein they deale most unjustly with us, and should we but deal so with them, they would (as well they might) exclaime much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Because one of them was lately taken in the act, and hang'd for the sin of Buggerie, here in this Town, if we Preachers should hereupon tell you from the Pulpits, that all these blessed Reformers, (for so they are called by their adorers) are even such men, and guiltie of that horrid sin, I believe (for my part) we should much abuse them in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and yet thus divers of their Ministers are pleased to deale with the Kings Friends: the Lord in his good time rebuke them for it.</p>
            <p>But alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (gallant Gentlemen and Christian people) you all know that there are too great, and too manie occasions given by some amongst us to our enemies to report evill of us: I beseech you therefore in the feare of God, as manie of you are better borne and bred then those are who do accuse you, and as all of you are imploied in a more righteous cause then they, by your holie God, and by your religious King, so that you would all indeavour to be more holie in your carriages then they be, to walk worthie your imploiment: and you that be Commanders, (I beg of you, that you would more strictlie punish sin in those that are under you, according to those Militarie Orders set forth by His sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties your religious Master.</p>
            <p>The profession of a Souldier, as 'tis honourable, so it may be holie if you please; we read of holie men of that profession: <hi>David</hi> was a man of warre, and did (as you do) fight the <hi>Battailes of the Lord,</hi> and he was an holie man; that great sin which did so blemish his reputation, was committed by him afterward, when he had left off to follow the Camp: the Centurion in the Gospell was a man of your profession, and our Saviour himself gives this testimonie of him, <hi>that he had not found his like</hi> (for goodnesse) <hi>in all Israel</hi>: and so that Captain <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>was one that feared God with all his houshold, and whose prayers and almes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended daily into Gods presence. Abraham</hi> himselfe the Father of the faithfull, was a brave Souldier; he with the number of 318. assaulted five Kings with their Armies, vanquished them, and took the spoile: you may read the storie in the 14. Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where you may

also see, who were the first men whom the Scripture notes, did run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the day of battell, and hid themselves, I do not say in Saw-pits, but the Text saies, <hi>in Slime-pits,</hi> they were men full of guilt and sin, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Princes of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and Gentlemen of <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay to speak all that can be said in one word, for the honour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a Souldier; God himselfe is called a man of warre, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15 3. <hi>The Lord is a man of Warre, and</hi> JEHOVAH <hi>is his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I tell you (Gentlemen) there is not to an honest eye in these sad and dismall daies, a more gallant sight, then a valiant and religious Souldier; Religion causeth courage in a good cause, and giveth an high lustre to it, especially in men of birth and place: what true English heart is not warm'd with joy to see the living flames of ancient valour conjoined with generous minds in Gentile bloud? but if thereto be also annex'd Religion, I dare say, to a trulie pious loyall eye the Sun it selfe is not more glorious.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, your enemies call you Cavaliers, a name, as they take it, of great reproach (els you may be sure they would not call you by it) will you give me leave in briefe, to give you your owne Character; or at least the Character of such a man as everie of you ought to be, and as we your friends and servants in Christ desire to conceive of you: why listen to it, 'tis this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A complete Cavalier is a Child of Honour, a Gentleman well borne and bred; that loves his King for conscience sake, of a clearer counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and bolder looke then other men, because of a more loyall heart: He dares neither oppose his Princes will, nor yet disgrace his righteous cause, by his carriage or expressions: He is furnished with the qualities of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Prudence, Iustice, Liberality, Goodnesse, Honesty; He is amiable in his behaviour, couragious in his undertakings, discreet and gallant in all his executions: he is throughly sensible of the least wrong that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to his Soveraigne, and is a professed enemy to all Rebells: the aimes of his sword are onely to dissever the malignity of those forces that have conspired the ruine of Monarchy and Innocency: he feares no evill thing to come upon himselfe, but contemns all dangers that look towards him: he dares accept of deaths challenge to meet it in the field, and yet can em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it as a speciall friend when it comes into his chamber, where he is alwayes making provision for its better entertainment: in a word, he is the onely Reserve of English Gentility and ancient valour, and hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chose to burie himselfe in the Tombe of Honour, then to see the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Nation vassalaged, the Dignity of his Countrey captivated by any base domesticke enemy, or by any forraigne fore-conquered foe.</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49725:11"/>
This is a compleat Cavalier, and if any of you be not according to this Character, believe me you are not right, nor the men you ought to be: And so much (Gentlemen) for the first particular in your description.</p>
            <p>I come to the second, and that is your Commission in the word <hi>sent: shall be sent</hi>: namely by him who hath power from God to send, and that is only the King, or Supreme Magistrate all the Commissions which God grants to Souldiers, are signed by the Kings hand, who is (as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was) <hi>the mouth of God</hi> unto his Subjects, in things of this nature, and such a Commission so signed, doth constitute a lawfull Souldier: the Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is this:
<q>A right Commission makes a lawfull Souldier.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yea,<note place="margin">5 <hi>Doct.</hi>

            <p>This truth doth more stownd the Rebells, and more puzzell them, then any one that I know; and therefore to perswade their followers that themselves can give a right Commission, they are faine to deny the King to be the Supreme Magistrate, cleane contrary to the testimony of Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, (where the King is called the Supreme) and like him who chose himself Pope, they are so bold as to say; the Supreme Authority is seated in themselves, which is such a transcendent fancy, that all the Traitors in the world (that I read of) durst never vent it, till these sate: But being driven to so great a streight, that they must of necessity either yield their warre to be unlawfull; for want of a right Commission; or else thus exalt themselves above him that is called God, this second course being the more Antichristian and furthest from the

            <p>This may serve to stirre up you, who are rightly authorized to be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, in the Execution of your charge: all the incouragement which the Rebells your Enemies have against you, and against the King, is from the evill lives of some of you, (who are the Kings Souldiers:) but you have to animate you, against them in their way, not onely their ill lives, but also their ill Cause, and their lacke of a lawfull Warrant; And most especially of all, you have the Justice of your own Cause, the lawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your owne call, and to these I may adde the goodnesse of your King.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Your Cause</hi> is to defend him, whom God hath exalted, to keepe the King in the Throne wherein God hath set him, against those that would remove him from it; 'tis to maintaine Religion, the Lawes and Dignity of your Nation, and to suppresse Rebellion that Child of Hell, that Parent and Nurse of all Mischiefe.</p>

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49725:13"/>Severe punishment is the assured portion of Rebellious men.</q>
I could evidence and affirme this truth many waies, as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the exemplarie punishment of Rebells in all ages; I could tell you how the earth swallowed up <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> (who rebelled against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aron)</hi> together with their Wives, Children, and Substance; a typicall Lesson (no doubt) it was to teach all after Ages that utter extirpation is the due portion allotted of God unto such men.</p>

            <p n="2">2. I could assure the downfall of the Rebells, as they are men delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Warre, from <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.30. <hi>Rebuke the company of the speare-men, the multitude of the Bulls, with the Calves of the people, till every one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himself with pieces of Silver, scatter thou the people that delight in warre:</hi> It is a rule in Divinity that a propheticall prayer is of the nature of a prophesie: Rebuke thou O Lord, is as much, as the Lord will rebuke; and scatter O Lord, is as much, as the Lord will scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: now by the <hi>speare-men,</hi> in that verse, you may understand those degenerate Gentlemen that have lifted up the hand against their Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne, or have consulted in this Rebellion: by the <hi>multitude of Bulls,</hi> you may understand the rich fat Citizens, who by their wealth and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney have administred strength to this Rebellion: and by <hi>Calves of the people,</hi> you may understand those Country folk, that came bleating up to <hi>London,</hi> (from the adjoining Counties) with their Petitions against the present established Government; all these, or all such as these, shall bee <hi>rebuked by the Lord</hi> (as the Psalmist teacheth) and made to <hi>submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with pieces of silver,</hi> they shall be glad to offer money, for the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of their lives, even because they are <hi>a people that delight in warre,</hi> and they that will not do so, shall be <hi>scattered,</hi> and blowne away, as dust is before the wind.</p>

            <p n="4">4. I could pormise their assured punishment, as they are bloudy and deceitfull men, from <hi>Psalm.</hi> 5.6. where 'tis said, that <hi>God shall destroy them that speak leasing, the Lords abhorres the bloudy and deceitfull man,</hi> and Psal. 55.23.

            <p>But Ile take these men only in the notion of Rebells, to evidence their assured ruine; for in that respect they are the people of Gods curse, the Lord himselfe doth so call them <hi>Esay</hi> 34 5. <hi>My sword</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall be bathed in heaven, behold it shall come downe upon Idumea, upon the people of my Curse to judgement.</hi> The <hi>Idume<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In all which words of the Prophet, beside the certainty of <hi>Edoms</hi> ruine evidenced by the oath of God twice over, <hi>as I live,</hi> observe these their conditions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They did not hate bloud,</hi> they delighted to make themselves instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of wrath when they had no call thereto, God did at sundry times punish the <hi>Israelites</hi> by all their neighbour Nations, by the <hi>Egyptians, Moabites, Midianites, Philistims,</hi> and the rest, but never by the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> these were alwaies voluntiers in wars aginst <hi>Israel,</hi> never imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord in that businesse, for they were brethren to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> (being the children of <hi>Esau Iacobs</hi> brother) and they were to live in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to them by Gods ordination disposing the superioritie to <hi>Iacob</hi> and his seed, and 'tis not Gods Custome to set Brethren at odds, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, or Subjects against their Soveraignes; the God of nature and order, is no breaker of natures bonds, or of his own Laws: that is Satans work rather the father of divisions, so that the <hi>Edomites</hi> were Rebells, unnaturall and bloudy Rebels, <hi>they did not hate bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They were also sacrilegious and covetous rebels, they were the <hi>Edomites</hi> that cryed out against the Temple, (as some do now against Churches) <hi>down with it down with it even to the ground,</hi> and they were these, that swallowed up in their expectation the estates of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iuda,</hi> (after that manner as the <hi>men of Westminster</hi> with their Abettors, do the Inheritances of the Lords and Gentlemen that are with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty) they said, <hi>these two Nations shall be ours:</hi> which is a sin mightily provokeing God to wrath and jealousie, <hi>the fire of my jealousie</hi> (saies, he <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 3.5.) <hi>is against the Idumeans, because they have</hi> (in their own thoughts) <hi>appointed my land</hi> (for the land bestowed by my providence upon such men) <hi>unto their owne possession, as a prey unto themselves, with the joy of their hearts and with despightfull mindes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Observe that God (in punishing wicked Rebells,) doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the law of retaliation (as 'tis lawfull for the King (Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent) to do in cases of like nature:) because they were men of bloud, therefore they shall meet with bloud, <hi>because thou hast not hated bloud</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>even bloud shall pursue thee,</hi> and againe, I <hi>will even do to thee, according to thine anger, and envy unto them,</hi> as if he had said, I will enable them, whom thou didst hate and envy, and whose Lands and revenues thou didst covet, to deale so with thee, as thou in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pightfulnesse of thine heart didst purpose and resolve to deale with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49725:14"/>And indeed you may observe (by the way,) that though God doth not usually imploy his owne people as instruments of wrath to punish, but rather of mercy to comfort, yet he imploied <hi>Israel</hi> in speciall to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish <hi>Edom</hi>: see <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25.12, 14. <hi>Because Edom hath dealt against the house of Iudah,</hi> (unbidden) <hi>and hath taken vengeance,</hi> (for some concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wrongs,) <hi>and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them,</hi> (whereas being their brethren and superious, they should rather (if wronged by them) have referred the same to God:) <hi>therefore</hi> (saies the Lord) <hi>I will stretch out my hand against Edom. And I will lay my ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall do in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, according to mine anger, and according to my fury, and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord God:</hi> and the reasons of this are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because 'tis according to the course of ordinary Providence, to punish Rebellious Subjects, by their owne Princes, against whom they do rebell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because 'tis according to ordinary Justice, that they who injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously encroach upon other mens rights, should forfeit their owne, (as a punishment for their injustice) to these very persons; <hi>qui invadunt alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na merentur perdere sua,</hi> and therefore 'tis said by <hi>Obediah,</hi> that <hi>the house of Iacob shall be a fire, and the House of Ioseph a flame, and the House of Esau for Stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devoure them, yea they shall possesse their possessions, even the mount of Esau, and Saviours shall come out of mount Sion to judge the mount of Esau.</hi> The applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these things I leave to your selves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is one thing more that I would have you observe from that place before quoted, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 35. the last words, where God tells <hi>Edom,</hi> that he will make himself known amongst Israel, by his judgements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: <hi>I will make my self knowne among them when I have judged thee:</hi> for indeed God was not knowne or acknowledged before, as he ought to have been among them: the Israelites were growne a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boish'd, prophane, impudent, and ungodly people (the major part of them,) which made the Lord give them up to be punished by the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi>: but by his giving into his Israels hands, the rebellious, bloody, treacherous <hi>Edomites,</hi> (who had no call nor cause to warre upon them, or to joine with the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> against them;) the Lord did meane so to gaine upon their hearts and spirits, that they should learne thereby to know him truly, and for after times to serve him (better then ever they had done before) in humility and holinesse.</p>
            <p>And truly (friends) I have an hope that when the great and mighty God shall have subdued under your power these <hi>Edomites</hi> our Enemies,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49725:15"/>
who are so full of spight, and so thirsty after blood, and shall have brought on their heads, what themselves did purpose against others; you will all gaine more knowledge of God, and serve, feare, honour and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him in holinesse, and righteousnesse, more then ever you yet did in all your lives, the Lord sanctifie the observance of his judgements so unto you that you may. And thus have you seen the certainty, and in part the severity of the Judgement which shall be executed upon Rebells evidenced.</p>
            <p>Now if you demand the Reason why the God of mercie and bowels should be so severe.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, 'tis no such severity in God, to beat men with their owne rods, to do to them according as they determined to do to others, beside 'tis but equity and justice to proportionate punishment in weight and measure, according to the height or weight of sin: But there is no such sin as Rebellion, this is <hi>ingens &amp; supremum scelus,</hi> the most huge and highest sin; and therefore doth merit the sharpest and surest punishment: Rebellion is a sinne that strikes at Gods owne self, at the face of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie: there is no such expresse Image of God in the world, as a King is; every Christian is the Image of Christ as man, every Minister of the Gospell is (or ought to be) the Image of Christ as Mediator, but a King is the Image of Christ as God, and to rebell against a King is to strike at the face of Christ as God; which was more then they that crucified him durst dare to do,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8.</note> 
               <hi>for had they knowne</hi> (saies the great Apostle) <hi>they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory:</hi> therefore no marvaile if a cruell messenger be sent against a Rebell, if severe and sharpe punishment be the proper portion of such men.</p>
            <p>Perhaps now you expect that by way of use, I should stir you up to be cruell:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse.</hi>
               </note> But (noble Gentlemen and Souldiers:) If I should do so, I should forget my self to be a Minister of the Prince of mercie, and to be a Subject of a most mercifull King, whose meeke and gentle Spirit; as we all honour and admire, so should we strive to imitate. And I blesse God for it, I could never yet speake that language of <hi>Kill, Slay, and Destroy,</hi> which the Ministers of the Rebells side are so skilfull in; I durst never excite men to fight up to the back in blood; the spirit of the Gospell is no bloody spirit; <hi>we</hi> (saies the Apostle, speaking of himself, and all true Ministers) <hi>have the mind of Christ,</hi> which endeavoured the salvation, not destruction of men; wherefore I beseech you give mee leave (as the Minister of Jesus Christ, for your souls good,) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound a few such particulars to your consideration and remembrance, as shall tend both to your present honour, and to your everlasting peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49725:15"/>I am confident (through the strength and goodnesse of God) that these rebellious enemies of the King, whom you oppose, (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their height of pride, and their studie to be auke, crosse, perverse, and peevish, and to vex the spirit of a mild, and gracious King, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their multitude of Armes and men, and their diligence in their way) shall ere long, (if your sinfull and unsutable carriages do not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,) be brought to beg, their lives at your hands; and at that time I pray remember.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That though it be true Gallantry, and noblenesse of spirit, to bee fierce and contagious in the Battaile, yet 'tis no true valour to set your foot too hard upon the neck of a fallen foe, that beggs your mercy; the generous Lion scornes to exercise his fury upon an enemy that's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate before him: I would have the Kings men do nothing but what is Kingly, let Rebells practice basenesse, it best becomes them: Beside the Scripture saies, that <hi>mercy pleaseth God;</hi> and in that, we are bidden to be like him, who in the midst of judgement remembers mercie: <hi>Be yee mercifull as your heavenly Father is mercifull,</hi> for (as in another place) <hi>there shall be judgement mercilesse to them that shew no mercy:</hi> as men do to others, so shall it be done to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Remember to distinguish between <hi>quaerentes &amp; facientes malum,</hi> the plotters and contrivers of, or the leaders in this Rebellion, and they that by seduction onely are drawne into it; between your sturdy Rebels and those that by a kind of inforcement are made to take their parts: the Text speaks only of the former, that severitie is to be used against them, which if it be, men may call it cruelty if they please, but 'tis ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice rather, and the prevention of mischief and cruelty, for as such have been meanes alreadie to undoe and murder many by leading them into paths of death, so if they should continue they would destroy more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Remember I pray to shew respect to Women, Children, and aged persons, to the first in regard of the weaknesse of their Sex; to the second sort, in regard of the minority of their yeares, and to the latter sort, in regard of their gray haires: 'tis said of the barbarous Chaldeans, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.17. <hi>That they had no compassion on the young Children, on the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or on the old man, on him that stooped for age,</hi> indeed though God did deliver the nation into their hands to punish, yet he looked they should have showne some pittie on such as these, and because they did not, he threatned to punish them; <hi>Esai.</hi> 47.6. <hi>O Daughter of Chaldea,</hi> I <hi>was wrath with Israel, and I gave them into thy hand, and thou didst shew them no mercie, but upon the ancient thou didst lay very heavily the yoke, therefore</hi> (v. 9.) <hi>these two things shall come upon thee, in one day, losse of Children and widdow-hood.</hi>

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49725:16"/>4. Remember for the honour of your King and Cause, and for your own inward peace and outward credit sake, that you neither do, nor (so much as in you lieth) suffer to be done, in coole blood, to the most impious Rebels, any thing that savours of immodestie, barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or inhumanitie. To uncloath men and women of their garments, and to expose their nakednesse to open view, as the enemies did in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, is most immodest, and offensive to God and all good men: to be an houre or two in hacking and torturing a wofull wretch, or in taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that miserable life which might be concluded in a moment; or to wreak ones furie upon a dead carkas, is a most barbarous, cowardly thing, and odious to God, though offered to an <hi>Edomite,</hi> as appears by that his threat unto the <hi>Moabites,</hi> for their <hi>burning the bones of the King of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to lime, Amos</hi> 2.1. so to use reviling speeches, and cursed execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, against them that are readie to die, or are in going out of the world, full of wounds and paines, is most inhumane: nay 'tis plainly diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to insult over men in miserie, be they never so vile, never such wretched enemies.</p>
            <p>The ancient Romans (the bravest Souldiers in the world) were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to absteine from all kinde of harsh words in such cases, (as <hi>kill him, hang him, knocke him down, rogue, villain,</hi> or the like:) as also from all kind of barbarousnesse and inhumanitie in their executions, for they said they acknowledged their enemies to be men, not Tigers: <hi>Metius Suffetius</hi> was drawn in pieces with foure horses for his Treason, from which (as a spectacle of great horrour) the people turned their eyes. The storie sayes, as it was the first, so it was the last punishment in this kind of rigour that was exercised amongst them; for <hi>nulli gentium mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores plaeuisse poenas</hi> (saies <hi>Titus Livius</hi> of them,) no Nation so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to preserve the reputation of humanity as they: Be you also carefull (noble Gentlemen and Souldiers) to abstein from all such unworthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: object not, that the enemies deal so shamefully with our men, when they get them into their power, for I'le assure you, basenesse doth better become them, and their cause, then ever it will become you.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Take heed you do not do any thing against the enemies out of your own private hatred: remember that you are the Kings men, and your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies are the Kings enemies, and them you are to oppose as such, and as the enemies of your Countrey: even in battaile it self, you must strike and shoot as at the common foe, let God direct the bullet or arrow as it pleaseth him, as he did that which being shot at a venture slew <hi>Ahab,</hi> and then 'tis God, and not man that killeth: for to levell at any knowne men, or to pursue any out of particular malice, may be found murder in Gods account at the great day. The Lord threatens to execute great ven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49725:16"/>
upon the <hi>Philistines</hi> with furious rebukes, <hi>because</hi> (saies the Text) <hi>thou didst take vengeance upon thine enemies with a despightfull heart, for the old hatred, and private grudge that was betwixt you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25.15, 16.</note> Though God imploys men as his instruments to punish the publike ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Church and State, yet never to revenge themselves: he never gave any man a Commission to do this, he would have us all to referre such wrongs to him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Remember what ever you do, you do it with a publike spirit, and do it valiantly, and in that manner as may no whit discredit the Kings cause, or blemish your own reputation, nor occasion griefe to your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits afterward: and to this end remember the graciousnesse of the Kings spirit and disposition, how he hath hitherto looked upon the vilest of them all with an eye of pitie: and look you to your Commission (which you have from His Majestie,) which (let the enemies bawle never so,) is far more mild then they deserve it should be: and remember too, that though they have by their actions renounced the Doctrine of Jesus Christ, and offered despight to the patient, obedient, and peaceable spirit of the Gospell, and have forgotten you to be their brethren, of the same nation, and of the same Religion too, which themselves professed foure years ago, and do in their Turkish charity, call you nothing but Dogs, Popish Dogs: yet be not you like them, but yeeld them still to be your Brethren, though rebellious and degenerate, and approve your selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them to be Christians.</p>
            <p>And these be the Mementoes which as Gods Minister I do here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound unto you, yea which I do in the name of God charge upon you.</p>
            <p>But perhaps some of you will say, if we should follow this Counsell,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> how shall we make your Text good, and approve our selves cruell mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers?</p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> that the Text is rather a Declaration then a precept, it doth not command you to be cruell, but doth declare that a Rebell shall meet with crueltie, <hi>i.e.</hi> with sure and sharp punishment, and when such a one doth meet with such a portion, who ever be the inflicter of it, we are taught by the Text to conclude, that 'tis sent him of God: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed do what we can, there are wicked men enow in an Armie, who will extend their furie even to crueltie, which when we have observed, we may see Gods hand therein against the Rebels: though I confesse this too, that somtime God hath (in their heat of bloud) infused into good and holy men a certain spirit, which hath appeared as a cruell spirit; for example, such was that which shew'd it self in <hi>David,</hi> when the Citie <hi>Rabbah</hi> of the Ammonites was taken: <hi>He put the people under Sawes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49725:17"/>
and Harrowes of iron, and axes of iron, and made them passe through the Brick-kilne.</hi> Now I say when by the effects we see such a spirit in any, we are to note the hand of God therein.</p>
            <p>But here let me advise you of one necessarie thing from the Text, <hi>A cruell messenger shall be sent against him, scil.</hi> against the rebellious man: your severitie therefore must be onelie against such, and not against anie of the Kings loyall and good subjects, that bed you, and board you, and give you house-roome for your selves and horses: 'tis the custome of too many (but I affirm they are no true Gentlemen, no true Cavaliers,) when they have had free quarter in a place, and perhaps have devoured up all the provision in the house, then to requite their Landlord with eobbing and plundering him of his houshold commodities, or els threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so to do, unlesse he will give them money to forbeare: O these car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages do speak such men to be sent rather to make the King enemies, then to rid him of his enemies: but, Gentlemen and Souldiers, if you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge your selves the Kings Messengers, remember your imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccording to your Commission, is to punish rebels, and not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse good Subjects. And in your actions against the Rebels, I can, from the Text, excite you to be couragious: for they being such as they be, the people of Gods curse, and you having the Kings Commission, and fighting in defence of his sacred Person, Crown and dignity against them; what ever bloud of theirs you shed in battell, is not innocent bloud, but as guiltie bloud as ever was shed by Christians in a just warre since the beginning of Christianity: for concerning the heads of this Rebellion, the <hi>men of Westminster,</hi> or the faction there, who to vex their religious King, have bestowed their best care to lose <hi>Ireland,</hi> to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to destroy <hi>England:</hi> these men, I say, together with their bloud-thirstie Chaplains, by whose venemous tongues they belch out so much blasphemie, treason, and crueltie, against God, the King, and the Kings people: and by whose witcherie and specious pretences, they have conjured so manie of the poore vulgar into their desperate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive circles: if ever any combination of men upon earth, since the Scribes and Pharisees of Christs time did sin the sin against the Holy Ghost, I feare these are they: for they do knowingly resist the doctrine of Gods Word and Spirit, and studiously oppose the light of their own consciences and former professions. How often have they charged it upon His sacred Majestie to intend that mischiefe which themselves were in practice of, and in plotting to performe? How have they hood-winked the poore Commonaltie of <hi>England,</hi> with suspitions of the Kings calling in Forraigners to invade the Land, and of aiming to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49725:17"/>
destroy the Priviledges of Parliament, and Liberty of the Subject, till themselves have effected the very same things?</p>
            <p>What peevish constructions have they made of all His Majesties most honest and candid expressions? How have they studied most irreligiously to thwart him in all his pious and peaceable desires? all this doth plainly speak to every discerning eye, that their labours are, against their owne consciences, to grieve the Holy Ghost in the bosome of Gods Annointed.</p>
            <p>Nay let every man judge of their spirits, and of the nature of their sin by two things in particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By their forcing their late Oath and Covenant upon people; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as themselves did most highly condemne and oppose that new Oath made by the Convocation some five yeares ago, to be taken by the Clergie, as most ungodly, unreasonable, and illegall; affirming that the proceedings in the urging thereof were too extremely violent, and the penaltie annexed thereto upon the refusall thereof was too cruell: and many arguments (specially those called the <hi>London Quaeres</hi>) were framed and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them against the same: themselves have now point-blank against those their own Arguments inforced an Oath far more ungodly, more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, and more illegall, with more extremitie of violence, and with heavier penalties, upon more people, all in generall, more ignorant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have indangered millions of soules, and deposed many faithfull Ministers, and others, from their places, means, and maintenance, because they dare not offend God and their own consciences in taking of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By that common Answer of theirs, which hath been so often given by so many of them; when they have beene moved to restraine Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists, Hereticks, and vicious persons (whereof there be such swarmes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them) namely, <hi>that these serve to advantage the Cause, to promote the great designe in hand (scil.</hi> to depose the King, and murder all his friends) <hi>therefore they must be borne withall for the season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From these, and many other such particulars, it may be concluded, that your Enemies are the Enemies not onely of peace, but also of Gods truth and Spirit; and as you have God, and a righteous Cause on your side, so have you their own Consciences against themselves, and the praiers of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere-hearted men pleading for you: wherefore be you confident and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, more are for you, then against you, <hi>be holy, be valiant:</hi> Yea be holie, that you may be valiant; nay be holie, and you shall be valiant, the Spirit of Holinesse is the Spirit of fortitude, and the Authour of good successe: Remember that precept, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.9. <hi>When the Host goeth forth against the enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing:</hi> Nay let me assure you, you cannot gall your enemies, or prejudice them more, then by being upright and holie; for they (I mean the seekers of Rebellion) are such imbittered enemies against the truth of grace, (what ever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49725:18"/>
that they gnash their very teeth at those whom they cannot vitiate with their rebellion, or darken with their lies and slanders. Yea friends, let me assure you that holinesse in you will quite disarme and unweapon them, wheras your sins do set an edge both upon their tongues and swords; your holinesse shall take away the edge of both, or els turn the same upon themselves: wherefore I say and say againe, and I do beseech you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for the good of your soules, and for the Honour of your King, whom you love and reverence (gallant Gentlemen and Christian Souldiers) <hi>be holy, be valiant</hi>; and be you sure, though you do but your duty in opposing these men of bloud (who will have nothing but <hi>war, war,</hi>) yet you shall not lose your reward: God will see them paid that are imploied in his work, you may observe in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.18.19. That God takes order for <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> and his Armie, <hi>That they should be paid for the service they had done against Tyrus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps some of you will say, how shall we do in the mean time? To answer this, I must turn my speech to other persons.</p>
            <p>You Gentlemen of the Countrey, Townsmen, and others who are not Souldiers, and do not assist personally in this righteous way, be it knowne unto you, that you are bound in dutie and conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to afford the liberall and willing aid of your purses: for is it just that these your Countrimen should (like <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Nephthali, Iudg.</hi> 4.) <hi>jeopard their lives unto death in the high places of the field,</hi> while you in the mean time, like the men of <hi>Reuben, abide in your sheepfolds, hearing the bleatings of your flocks</hi>; or be striving among your selves who shall afford the least assistance to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing these enemies of your King? I confesse you have been loyall, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarie to others in many things; I beseech you all to persevere, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that all you have lies at the stake, and he deserves to lose all, that is not willing to part with some to preserve the rest; nay (Sirs) let men think as they please of themselves, I believe he is no true Subject, nor hath such an heart as he should have, that desires any thing more then a bare being, till his Soveraigne be again setled in the throne of his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I beg of you all (whom God hath blessed above others with wealth and substance) approve your selves right, and like those <hi>Governours of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people</hi>; that we (as the Prophetesse there did) may rejoice in you, and blesse God for you: <hi>Mine heart</hi> (saies she) <hi>is towards the Governours of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people, blesse ye the Lord:</hi> For be assured that otherwise the curse of <hi>Meroz</hi> will be your portion, <hi>Curse ye Meroz</hi> (saies the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the Lord) <hi>curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to help the Lord</hi> (the Captain of the Lord, the Annointed of the Lord) <hi>against the mighty,</hi> or against his ungodly enemies, that did so mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and so mightily exalt themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:49725:18"/>And you (good people all) of what ranke or condition, sex or degree, soever you be: be carefull (I pray) to afford the assistance of your praiers, that the spirit of the Lord may come upon that Princely Generall whom God hath sent for your protection into these parts,<note place="margin">

            <p>And now last of all, to the Governour, Major, and Officers of this Towne, I would speak a word: Sirs, you are fortifying your Town, and have spent much money about it, to little purpose hitherto, your Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires have fallen downe, and your labour hath been in vaine: and wot you what is the cause of all? why even the uncontrouled sinnes within it; such cursing and such swearing, even by women and children, as well as by men, did I never heare, as in this place, sure these oaths and curses be the bullets that have battered down your Fortifications; O that you would for your owne safetie and for the honour of the King, and for the blessing of God upon his righteous Cause, take some order to reforme these abuses, <hi>quantum in vobis est,</hi> beside you might save some Money by it, your works would stand the better; yea if you would take the course which I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, you would spare your selves a great deal of trouble in another kind, and some charges too; 'tis this.</p>
            <p>You are full of suspicions here in the Towne, (I perceive) that you have treacherous persons among you, such as are better affected to the Enemies, then to the King: and many have bin imprisoned upon jealousies and fears, and nothing that I see yet can be proved against them, insomuch that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they may prove honester men then some of those that have molested them. Now one true way (as I take it) to find out the Kings Enemies amongst you is this, appoint Officers in everie street (let the Church-Wardens and Constables assist therein,) to inflict and leavie (according to Statute) a pecuniarie mulct upon every Townsman, for everie oath that is sworne either by himself, or by any that is under his charge, and also upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie Alehouse-keeper, who shall suffer any in his house to sit drinking on the Lords daie, or on the Fast daie, while they should be at Church; and this Monie thus leavied, I would have imploied to buy food &amp; victuals for the Prisoners of the Rebells party, (some of whom we have in the Town alreadie, and manie more I do not doubt by the help of God but we shall have shortly:) so shall you save the charge which you are at for them; and also thereby easily learne who are the most affected to them, and to their side; for without question they that afford them most monie in this kinde, most reliefe, that feast their bodies best, may be yeelded their best friends, and the Kings greater Enemies: This is all I had to say, now the Lord give you all a right understanding in all things. <hi>Amen.</hi>
