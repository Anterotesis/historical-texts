            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AS the Stars would have it, I happen'd to be a hopefull branch of that ancient and renown'd Family of the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Gotam</hi>; my Father was a <hi>Moorfields</hi>-Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger, and my Mother a <hi>Lancashire</hi>-Witch; and I being the first-born of both, are thought by most People to be a <hi>Conjurer:</hi> I have a natural propensity to Sleep in the Day time, and Sit up at Night, to observe the Aspects and Motions of the Planets: By the frequent use of which, I have peep'd a wonderful height into the dark Mystery of <hi>Star-gazing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When, by long Study and Experience, I had Cunningly crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the supernatural Knack of <hi>Fortune-telling;</hi> and by the help of Heaven's Lamps could resolve all Lawful Questions, to the full satisfaction of Prentice-Boys or Servant-Wenches, I hung up the Sign of the Golden-Ball; and profess'd my self as knowing a Wizard as ever foretold the downfall of the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the prosperity of the <hi>Protestant Religion:</hi> But thought it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, like the rest of my Fraternity, to have two Strings to my Bow; and being luckily furnish'd with a few Worm-eaten Receipts to make a <hi>Powder-le-pimp,</hi> to Charm away an <hi>Ague,</hi> stop a <hi>Gonorhea,</hi> prevent or further <hi>Conception,</hi> or cause <hi>Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;</hi> I also turn'd <hi>Medicine-Munger,</hi> having acquir'd the true Method of Sifting Nurses, pretending to discover the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by the Patients Vrine.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:99921:3"/>Thus Qualifi'd as a Student in <hi>Physick</hi> and <hi>Astrology,</hi> I supply'd half the Town with Bumfodder, till I had made my self so Eminent by my own Praises, and a false Catalogue of my Cures, that every minute of the Day I had some Twelve-penny Fool or other at my Knocker. Having now rais'd my self to a Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Reputation amongst <hi>Strumpets, Idiots</hi> and <hi>Rope-dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> I thought it high time to manifest my wonderful Foresight of future <hi>Chances</hi> and <hi>Changes,</hi> by some infallible <hi>Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> for the present Year; which if they happen not according to my Calculation, I'll be bound to acknowledge the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is all <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> the <hi>Professors</hi> of it to be <hi>Knaves,</hi> and those who <hi>Believe</hi> in't to be arrant <hi>Fools.</hi>

               <p>You are mistaken, Sir, it was not the Stars that set us together by the Ears, our Quarrel was occasion'd by the Pride, Ignorance, and Sauciness of that Cobbling Predicter there, who understands the Sowling of a Shooe much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Motion of the Planets; and never could Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell any thing by the Heavens, but what was Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him upon Earth by wiser Noddles than his own, or else the Prophecies in his <hi>Mene-Tekel</hi> would have prov'd as false as his Calculation of the late Kings Nativity, who was to dye, according to his Judgment, many Years ago; but is still living in spight of his croud of Directions.</p>

               <p>This is Malice in perfection, Envy without paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, a pack of Lies without Colour, the very suggestions of the Devil; and begging your attention Sir, I will justifie my Innocence, against these Villanous Reproaches, to the face of him who was the original Projector of all these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies against me. In the first place, I was no more a <hi>Quaker,</hi> than my Adversary a <hi>Good Christian,</hi> tho the latter part of my Education was amongst 'em; I never conform'd to their Faith, Discipline, or Preciseness: Tho I acknowledge I have been often at their Meetings, yet my Opinion was always as foreign from their Principles, as my Opposite's Practice is distant from the Rules of True Religion and Morality. In the next place, I never liv'd in <hi>Newgate-street</hi> till I was Married, but in <hi>Newgate-Market</hi>; and my Shop was as much bigger than a Butter-firkin, as the best Room in his House is larger than a Meal-tub (He knows my meaning.) In the Third place, I never had Threescore Pound with my Wife, instead of three Hundred; and all my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours know, to the satisfaction of my own Conscience, I us'd her with that Lenity and Love, as the best Husband could possibly show, tho' to the worst of Wives; who with an unnatural aversion sought the Ruin of her Husband, and Beggary of her Children, in as many Impious Designs and Detestable Contrivances, as my Rebellious Enemy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver engaged in to destroy King <hi>Charles,</hi> and Subvert the Government. And lastly, Instead of my turning her out of doors, she shamefully deserted me and her Children, as he did the Kingdom, both equally laden with insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble guilt of wrongs, which the one had done to his King and Country, and the other to her Spouse and Family.</p>

                  <hi>I am very glad to hear you have so handsomly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd your self of these scandalous Accusations your Opponent has brought against you: And the deep concern with which you seem to deliver your Vindication, begets in me a more than ordinary Credulity of your Innocence. For I believe your Adversary, like other partial Prognosticators, does not always confine his Tongue and Pen within the strict Bounds of Truth, and Rules of Iustice.</hi>

               <p>How Sir! what do you mistrust me? Do you think I would tell a Lie for the matter? I'd have you to know I scorn it. What I have said is truth, Sir, I can bring three or four as honest people to Swear it, upon Occasion, as ever were Evidence in the <hi>Popish-Plot.</hi> I'll warrant you he'll with the same Impudence deny that ever he Poison'd his wife in a mess of Water-gruel, or that ever he hid Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and carry'd her before a Justice of Peace, and swore she Rob'd him.</p>

I wonder with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence you can insinuate these things to the World in your <hi>Merlinus Liberatus,</hi> except you are desirous of robbing the Devil of his Glory; and be reckon'd amongst mankind the greatest Liar in the Universe. To be plain, both with you and her, she has often (be it to her Conscience) defrauded me of both Goods and Money, and I have often detected her in it; but as for hiding of any thing and laying it to her charge, I look upon it to be equally ridiculous with the harshness of that Father, who having burnt his Bible on the <hi>Saturday,</hi> beat his Son on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> because the Boy could not find it to read a Chapter. For a Man to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a fault with his Right-hand, and Swear it upon his Left, I cannot imagine the drift of such a senseless projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Poison in her Water-gruel, I always lov'd her too well to do her a Mischief, and my self too well to be hang'd for her: Tho I confess I have oftentimes prepar'd her a Mess for Breakfast, but never put any thing worse in it than <hi>Bread, Butter, Sugar,</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi>; and for what harm this could do her, I am answerable: So that all your Envious Darts are thrown in Vain, and return, like Balls pelted at a Stone Wall, to him that cast 'em.</p>

is living to this day? Did you not Treacherously flatter your great Friend the Duke of <hi>M—th</hi> with the assurance of the Crown, till you and the rest of his Seducers had brought him to a sad Catastrophe?

            <head>Infallible Predictions For the Year 1699.</head>
            <p>AStrologers this Year will Err very much in their gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to the great Scandal of a pack of Prophesying <hi>Knaves,</hi> and grievous disapointment of abundance of <hi>Fools</hi>: And he that puts his Faith in the Stars, as well as those who give Credit to a Star-gazer, will thro' the whole course of his life be liable to be cheated.</p>
            <p>He or She that loses either Goods or Money by the Rapparees, and consults a <hi>Cunning-Man,</hi> or <hi>Woman,</hi> about the recovery of 'em, flings Good Money after Bad; for I have discover'd by the Motion of <hi>Mercury,</hi> the God of Thieves, 'tis a Thousand to one whether ever they find them.</p>
            <p>Who ever have their Nativities Calculated, will be as much the Wiser, as if they had kept their Money in their Pockets, but if they will be generous, and fling away a large Gratuity, they need not fear but their crafty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer will assign them <hi>Long-Life, Health,</hi> and <hi>Good-Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Innocent Young Lady who thinks her Virginity unsafe without a <hi>Charm</hi> or <hi>Sigil</hi> to secure her from the fraud of insinuating Tongues, and other Amorous Temptations, and buys a Fools-bauble of a Fortune-teller for half a piece, or a Guinea, to protect her Virtue, if she be so Silly to be Cozen'd out of her <hi>Money,</hi> may the next hour, if <hi>Mars</hi> proves Ascendant over <hi>Venus,</hi> be cheated out of her <hi>Maiden-head,</hi> in spight of her Guardian Angel, if Opportunity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity concur in the Misfortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:99921:9"/>This year will arise great disputes among <hi>Prentice-boys, Chamber-maids,</hi> and <hi>Cook-wenches,</hi> about which tell Fortunes truest, <hi>Gipsies</hi> or <hi>Astrologers.</hi> To the Saffron-colour'd Diviners the Preheminence will be given, because they dispatch their business for less Money; and tell you as much Truth by the inside of your Hands, as the other can do by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the Heavens. When <hi>Almanacks</hi> have done Selling, both their Conditions will be equal, for the Stars being angry they are false Read by their Interpreters, are resolv'd, before <hi>Sol</hi> has run half his Annual Progress, to make 'em all as poor as <hi>Gipsies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An abundance of Country Attorneys will flock up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> the latter End of this Term, to the great Consumption of <hi>Prick'd Wines,</hi> and <hi>Temple-barr Puddings</hi>; who will fill the Town for a time, with such a Crow'd of Scribletoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they'll be scarce able to live honestly one by another. <hi>Westminster Hall</hi> will be as full of <hi>Rooks,</hi> as the <hi>Change</hi> at two a Clock is of <hi>Owles</hi>: And that unhappy Bird who falls into their clutches, will be sure to be well pluck'd before he gets out again. Many Fools go thither to look for an Honest Man, but may search, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> did in <hi>Athens,</hi> a long time before they find one fit for their Business, It is a common saying, a good <hi>Lawyer</hi> must be a great <hi>Lyar</hi>; for which reason the <hi>Devil</hi> and a <hi>Pleadsr</hi> wear both one Colour.</p>
            <p>The Malice of Law-Adversarys will be pretty well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swag'd when the Term's over: The long Bills of <hi>Attorneys</hi> and <hi>Petty Foggers</hi> will make them agree to call themselves Fools, and their Lawyers Knaves: Promising to renounce Law for the future, as good Christians do the <hi>Devil and all his Works.</hi> A Married State and a Chancery Sute, the World may account equal; for most People, before the Snaky Year has clap'd her Tail in her Mouth, will heartily repent that ever they engag'd in either.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:99921:9"/>Old <hi>Buffet-Stools</hi> will come again into Fashion, and be much in Request. The true <hi>Saxon Tennis,</hi> will now be put in Practice, and Balls will fly about in every Street without the help of a Racket: Many Servant Wenches will have Sorer Palms by Playing, than ever they had by Working. She that puts a Ball furthest, will be reckon'd a good Play-fellow, and he that can strike furthest at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of Stool-ball, will be accounted by the Maids, a good Bed-fellow. Those who could not purchase New Cloathes at <hi>Easter,</hi> will be glad to have them at <hi>Whitson-Tide,</hi> and if they fail of 'em then, especially Women, they'll go near to be had in their minds a Month after.</p>
            <p>Abundance of time will be now spent in Bot'ling of Ale, and Baking of Cakes, and a great deal of Money, by such who have more Wealth than Brains, will be be flung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way upon these alluring Commodities. Many a Maid will go a Mile or two out of Town, and forgetting her self, will lose that which she had better have brought home than have left behind her.</p>
            <p>Loose Livers, and Loiterers, will now begin to grow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and walk on a Sunday to <hi>Pancrass</hi>'s Church, with a great deal of Devotion, though in Town, if they live next Door to the Lord's Temple, they will go a Mile out of the way to spend their time at an Ale-house; for they Love no Preaching, unless it be over their Liquor.</p>
            <p>Every Gardener will now be as busy as Father <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice, to turn Horse-dung into Radishes, and Ram's-Horns into Sparrow-grass; and will be very Angry if any of his Family should lay a Sir-R—ce out of his own Ground. Abundance of Dung-hills on 'tother side the Water will be painfully Improv'd to raise a Summer's
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99921:10"/>
Feast for Taylors, but the first, of their Product must be Sauce for my Lady. Abundance of Distemper'd Blood will be buried at the roots of Vines, therefore Drink not too much of the Juice of the Grape, lest it brings your Body into disorder.</p>
            <p>Poverty and Pride next <hi>Easter,</hi> will go hand in hand, many will pinch their Bellies to adorn their Backs, and tumble upon their Backs to please their Bellies. Whoring will be much Rail'd against in Churches, but never more Practis'd in Chambers. Many <hi>London</hi>-Prentices will be forc'd to Eat <hi>Suffolk</hi> Cheese, that their Masters Daughters may be kept at a Boarding-School. Honesty will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to a low Condition, and be forc'd to tug many a Knave by the Sleeve, to put him in mind of his Promise; and Virtue, in plain Dress, must Pin up Vice's fine Gown for a Livelyhood. Justice will be in every Man's Mouth, but in few Mens Hearts; we shall hear often of her Name, but know not where to find her, and where she ought to dwell we shall not dare to look for her.</p>
            <p>Many Limber-ham'd Leachers, and their Ladies of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, will in the Spring enter into <hi>Aesculapius</hi>'s Powdering Tub, where with Swelled Heads, and Loose Teeth, they will make slabbering Protestations against the Wicked Sin of Whoring, but soon as they're well pursue the same Vice, till at last with Rotten Bones, Infectious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Stinking Breaths, and Stinking Noses, they fall Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in <hi>Venus</hi>'s Cause, coveting Death to avoid Shame and Misery.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99921:10"/>
               <hi>Marmulet</hi> Madams, will be met stroling in the Fields, than Honest Women in the Streets: Ladies will begin to think of <hi>Tunbridge, Epsom, Richmond, Dullidge,</hi> &amp;c. to fill their Bodies with those Impurities, of which they pretend to cleanse them. Any handsome, lusty young Fellow, that has been in a Starving Condition all Winter, if he will show himself at the afore-mention'd places, need not Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in a little time of getting Cloathes to his Back, and Money in his Pocket, if he can but work hard and keep Council. Citizens with Jealous Hearts, and Horned Heads, begin now to be Tormented with Curtain-Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures for New Gowns, Petticoats, and Nick-knacks, and he that refuseth to comply with his Wife's Request, shall lead as bad a Life as a sturdy Beggar in a House of Correction.</p>
            <p>Those who have bucksome Daughters, must take care to provide 'em Husbands, or guide 'em with a strait Rein, lost the active motion of their Spirits, this Spring-season, begets such an Itch in their Tails, that will make 'em Dote on your Prentices, or suffer their Heels to be Tript up by your Serving-men, the first Opportunity.</p>
            <p>Punks that are Poor, will begin to dread the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Summer, for a long Vacation is as terrible to them as to Lawyers of the lower Degree; an empty Town soon brings them to empty Purses, and want of Money to the worst of Infamy. So that she who had the Honour to be Debauch'd by a Duke, may in a little time after, (without the kind Influence of her Stars prevent it) be Kick'd by his Foot-man, or Kiss'd by a Porter. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Topping Curtesan, now at a Guinea Purchase, will dwindle from her Velvet Scarf into Rusty Lute-String, and will be at a Hackney Coachman's Service, the next
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99921:11"/>
Vacation, for a Cast of his Office and a Quartern of <hi>Brandy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We shall find a great Emulation between Pawn-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and Tally-men, who should be thought the Honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est men, though both in their Dealings, according to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, will dayly strive who should run first to the Devil head-long. Usurers in old time were Damn'd by all good Men for Ten in the Hundred, but we shall find e'er long, every honest Citizen will with a safe Conscience take Thirty, and think him self in as fair a way to Heaven as the Parson of the Parish.</p>
            <p>Women of all Ranks and Qualities will this Year be very forgetful of their Prayers, and very mindful of their Paint and Patches, some to Plaister up the Wrinkles of Age and Debauchery, others to hide Imperfections as great men do Faults, by making greater; some like true <hi>English</hi> Painters, not knowing when the Face is well, by endeavouring to mend it, will daub on till they spoil the Piece: She that begins at Seven a Clock in the Morning, and can get thorowly Drest by Dinner time, will be look'd upon by her Sex to be a nimble Gentlewoman; and she who confines herself to one Gallant at a time, though she Discards every Month, will be reckon'd, as times go, a Lady of great Honour and Constancy.</p>
            <p>Pretty Women this Year will be very plenty, and that generous Gentleman, who has a mind to have a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Wife with nothing, because she should be the more Humble, and not upbraid him with her Portion, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily meet with one that has not so much as a Smock to her back, and when he has her, I'd advise him to keep her so, for then he need not fear any body else should take up her Linnen.</p>
