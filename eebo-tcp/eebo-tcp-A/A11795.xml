         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the liberty of these times
(wherein your <hi>Currants, Gazettas,
Pasquils,</hi> and the like, swarme too
too abundantly) hath made all
Newes (how serious or substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
soeuer) lyable to the iealous
imputation of falshood, yet this relation I assure
you (although in some circumstances it may
leane too neare the florish of inuention, yet for
the pith or marrowe thereof, it is as iustly allyed
and knit to truth, as the light is to the day, or
night to darkenesse.</p>
            <p>To hold thee then (Gentle Reader) in no further
suspence, be pleased to vnderstand, that some
fewe dayes after the solemnitie of the <hi>Purification</hi>
of the blessed Virgin (according to the Roman
and Spanish computation) It pleased the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
of <hi>Spaine, Philip</hi> the fourth, to retire himselfe to
his delicate house of pleasure, called <hi>Casa del
Campo,</hi> situated neare vnto the towne of <hi>Madrid</hi> or
<hi>Madrill,</hi> where his standing Court for the most
part continually remaineth: And the nearest in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
vnto him (next to the <hi>Cound de Oliuares</hi>)
was the <hi>Cound de Gondomar,</hi> the Archenemie to
the florishing Estate of our <hi>England,</hi> and the Foxe
whose stench hath not cured the <hi>Palsey,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17511:3"/>
impoisoned &amp; brought into an <hi>Apoplexie</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Noble and some times well deseruing English
hearts. Neither was the King for his pleasure rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to this house of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> but rather through the
necessity of some special affaires, the greatest wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
seemed to be gathered from the last attempt of
the English vpon the Fort &amp; Castle of <hi>Punetall</hi> &amp;
the town of <hi>Cadiz</hi> or <hi>Cales,</hi> wherin though the losse
was not so great or materiall as might either make
the Assailant or Assailed offer Roses, or Nettles
vpon the Altar of Fortune; yet the affront seemed
to strike a more deepe impression in the hearts of
the Spaniards, then could be well taken away
with scorne (which is the ensigne of their pride)
or with the hope of future aduantage (which only
giues life vnto their <hi>Enuie</hi> and <hi>Malice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therfore now at this time &amp; in this place, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
many consultations held with the Earle of <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domar,</hi>
whom the whole world Baptized the <hi>Butte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaue</hi>
or <hi>Incendiarie</hi> of Christendome, the Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
<hi>Ambassadour</hi> &amp; <hi>Iesuiticall Archbishop Leadger</hi> (as
his practises in our Nation hath well witnessed)
touching some notable reuenge to be had against
the State of Great <hi>Britaine,</hi> being the onely Iewell
on which <hi>Spaine</hi> had long since fixed her heart, to
make her vniuersall Monarchie euery way full and
perfect, he is by command from the King (in the
person of the <hi>Cound Oliuares</hi>) to make his appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce
before the Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Cea,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Infantasgo</hi> &amp; the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of <hi>Castila,</hi> who had a speciall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mission signed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17511:3"/>
for that purpose, &amp; to deliuer vnto them all those
secret aduantages, which he had either by the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of time, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tinuall labor of his braine, the
corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of his bribes, the threatnings &amp; insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s
of his Popish Priests, the petulent flatteries of
his Papisticall English Mistrisses dyuing into their
husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ds Counsels, or by any other direct or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
meanes, wonne vnto him selfe a knowledge or
instruction for the alteration or subuerssion of that
braue &amp; florishing <hi>British</hi> Monarchie. And in this
charge the <hi>C. de Oliuares</hi> according to the state and
magnificence of the Spanish reseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s, began to
make a great florish of many demure &amp; austere cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
vnto the E. of <hi>Gondomar,</hi> concerning
the greatnes of his ingageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, the high Trust repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in his singular knowledge, &amp; the infinit expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
the King and the whole State had fixed
vpon the wisedom of his proceeding; adding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
sundrie admonishments or Caueats to call
into his remembrance, touching many alterations
in the State of Great <hi>Britaine,</hi> some defenciue,
some offenciue since his last aboad or comerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the same; And amongst the rest as a
thing of most especiall note, the <hi>Cound</hi> began to
repeate many relations which <hi>Gondomar</hi> himselfe
had deliuered vnto him touching the generall, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likenesse
of the <hi>British</hi> Nation, affirming that he
had heard him say, that he had seene the very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and boys in the streete, make their sport and
play a schoole of warre, and by imitation from el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
knowledges to expresse in childe play, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17511:4"/>
very excellencie and perfection of Martiall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
which had summoned in him both matter of
passion &amp; admiration, that he had often cryed out,
<hi>What will the English doe, euery childe will be an</hi> Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
<hi>and kill a Serpent in his cradle:</hi> This, <hi>Oliuares</hi> tould
him was but a small shadow or little pricke to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
a much greater substance now in vse: for
since the death of King <hi>Iames,</hi> of euer-liuing and
famous memorie, the Englishmen, who for the
space of twenty two yeares before, had but as it
were dallyed and plaid with Armes, rather seeking
to affect it for nouelty then necessity, were now in
one yeares deliberate and materiall exercise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so singular and exquisite, that the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
blusht to see themselues ouergone in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp; that to be made familiar in an insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t at which
they had laboured to obtaine to in diuers ages.</p>
            <p>Besides <hi>Oliuares</hi> assured him that he had receiued
infallible intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce out of the Archduches Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
that a hundred &amp; odde of the best experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ced
souldiers or firemen (being all <hi>English</hi>) were sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
the States of the Vnited prouinces, into <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi>
to educate and instruct in Martiall discipline
euery seuerall Country and Prouince, in so much
that the whole Iland was nothing now but a Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery
of excellent and exquisite Souldiers.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Gondomar</hi> replyed that he had from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Iesuites in <hi>England,</hi> receiued the like intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and with this addition, that those excellent
elected men in the Low-countries found their
equall Schoole-followes, nay many Tutors and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17511:4"/>
experienced Masters when they came into <hi>England,</hi>
so that indeed their necessitie did but conuerte to
superfluity and a little losse, to some that were of
much better deseruing.</p>
            <p>Yet said <hi>Gondomar</hi> further, for mine owne part
though this make much for our terror &amp; amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that we must with <hi>Curtius</hi> leape wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into a Gulphe of certaine ruine ere we can hope
of reuenge or triumphe, yet doth this new Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
course little moue my blood; for though I must
confesse the Nether-lands to be the onely vnpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld
Schoole of warre in the whole world, yet the
onely thing it teacheth is <hi>Forme</hi> and <hi>Fire, Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>Besiegement;</hi> but for the <hi>vse of the Sword,
push of the Pike, bringing of Grosses bodie to bodie and
hand to hand, the exercise of euery priuate strength, and
the fortune of Battles;</hi> Things which the <hi>English</hi> must
of necessitie be exposed vnto, <hi>Hoc raro aut nunquam;</hi>
And therefore (my Lord) I tell you, I more quake
when I see an old Irish Commander drilling an
English Company, who neuer beheld an enemie
but he felt his Sword and knew his Target, then
when I see infinits of golden fellows, teaching
men onely dance to the tune of <hi>Posture,</hi> or framing
<hi>Chimeras</hi> in their braines, whether the Pike and the
Bowe, or the Pike and Dragoone, or Pike and
long Pistoll be of greater importance: But of
these things wee shall haue a larger time to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
&amp; thinke vpon, it sufficeth me that I knowe
my Royall Masters pleasure &amp; your honorable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions;
all which I will studie, to satisfie onely
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17511:5"/>
diuers things are (through other imployment,
laid as it were aside from my memory, not vtterly
forgotten, therefore I beseech I may haue the res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite
of some fewe houres to recken with my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
knowledge, `and so yeeld vp the whole summe
of my duty and seruice.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Oliuares</hi> seemed exceeding willing, &amp; so
the Earle to make choise of his best time, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
one from the other, <hi>Oliuares</hi> returning to
satisfie the King, &amp; <hi>Gondomar</hi> taking his Litter, went
backe to <hi>Madrill,</hi> where what contention grew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him &amp; his old acquainted mischieues, how
euery minute hee produced new and vnnaturall
Cocks-egges, brooded them from the heat of his
malice, hatche them with the deuilishnes of his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,</hi>
and brought forth Serpents able to poyson
all <hi>Europe,</hi> is a Discourse monstrous and almost
inexpressable; I will therefore omit this mutinie
of his troubled thoughts and onely pitch vpon this
one accident, no lesse strange then memorable;
wherein as in a Mirror euery eye may behold the
weakenesse of a guilty thought, and how easily
frailty is surprised and ouercome, when it encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with these two maine enemies of our blood,
<hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Amazement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It so fell out, that the Morning before the
Noone on which <hi>Gondomar</hi> was to appeare before
the designed Commissioners, partly to refresh
his perturbed spirits with the pure Ayre, and
to recollect vnto himselfe all those thoughts
and circumstances which might make a glorious
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17511:5"/>
passage for the huge and monstrous bodie of
mischiefe where withall he was that day in labour;
he caused his attendants to bring him in his Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the <hi>Prada,</hi> neare vnto the Cittie of <hi>Madrill,</hi>
being a place of recreation and pleasure for the
Nobilitie and Gallantrie of Spaine, not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to our new <hi>More field</hi> walkes, neare to the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>London,</hi> onely that this is more priuate and
reserued; for as ours is common to all men of all
sorts, so is this <hi>Prada</hi> onely but for the King, the
<hi>Grandies</hi> of Spaine, the Nobilitie and some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the vppermost or best qualitie.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Gondomar</hi> had in this place of recreation
taken a turne or two in his Litter, whether hee
found his ruminations disturbed with the vneasie
pace of his Mules, or that he had not elbow roome
enough in his Litter, to giue action and grace to
many of those damnable thoughts which in that
houre gaue him singular contentment, for the
Spaniard is not of our dull English qualitie, to let
his words passe from him as neglected strangers or
thoughts out of the compasse of his dearest fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie,
but rather as deare children or choicest
friends, to lend them admiration with his eyes and
hands, to adorne them with expectation in the
shrugge of his shoulders, and with a thousand
other minicke gestures, to make a speech that is as
triuiall and vnseasoned as folly it selfe, to appeare
as serious as if it were a <hi>Delphan</hi> Oracle: vpon
some one or other of these Spanish disgusts, this
Fox (our Earle) vnkennels himselfe and makes his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17511:6"/>
seruants take him from his Litter, then placing
his chaire (the true sworne brother, or at least the
nearest kinsman that might be to a closse-stoole)
vnder the shadowe of certaine trees, in a walke
more reserued then the rest, he commanded his
attendants to withdraw themselues; and he had
reason so to doe for two principall respects: the
first, least his anticke postures, mumps, moes and
Munkey-like wrye faces might drawe laughter or
scorne from his vassals, or lastly least the violence
of his studie and meditations might make some
words fall from him, which he thought too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
for another mans bosome.</p>
            <p>Being obeyed in all his commandements, and
seated thus alone by himselfe, onely guarded by
his two choise friends <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Mischiefe,</hi> he had
not cald vp many euill thoughts to appeare before
him, when on a sodaine (according to the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his apprehension) there shined round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him a most glorious and extraordinary light;
which might be taken rather for fire or flaming,
then shine or glittering: and this appeared so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely,
spred it selfe so largely and increased so
violently, that terror, feare and amazement at one
instant raised vpon the heart of the Earle, and with
their colde qualities did so stupifie, dull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracte
all his spirits, that as if he had seene <hi>Medusas</hi>
head, the poore <hi>Don</hi> was become altogether a
peece of yce or marble; he had no spirit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
there were spirits, his crossings and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
his holy water and his <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> his Monks
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17511:6"/>
charmes, and his Iesuites coniurations were all
now turnd to quaking and trembling, to staring &amp;
starke madnes, to gaping and groaning, to wante
of words through strife for words, and indeed to
what not that might shew the singularnesse of a
perplexed astonishment? his night-cap throwes
his hat in the dust, and his haire makes his cap fly
into the aire like a feather; he doth reuerence but
sees no Saint, would faine vtter either salutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s or
curses, but knows not by what name to cal his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller:
In the end starting and standing vpright,
seeming to see what he would not see, or to finde
out that with curiositie, which he had rather loose
with the best care of his spirits; stradling like a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losses,
as if he neither respected present perils, nor
feared those which were further off, he lookt as if
he would look through the pure ayre, and though
it haue truely no colour, yet was his searche so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
that he appeared to find out a constant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion;
yet all was but his new feare, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the manner of his life (which had euer beene
desperate, subtile, and reserued) the condition of
the times (at that time and in that place free from
perplexities and incumberance) the state of his
affaires (rather rising then declining) nor his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
negotiations strong enough to haue encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
with any <hi>Goliahs</hi> amazement, was able now to
keepe constant any one ioynt about him: I haue
read that the Duke of <hi>Burgundie</hi> had like to haue
dyed at the sight of the nine Worthies, which a
Magician had discouered but: our <hi>Don Gondomar</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:17511:7"/>
is like now to dye at the sight of nothing but aire
and his owne imagination; for he had euery symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of death about him, as a body trembling,
a stomach swelling, fore-head turnd yellow, eyes
dead or sinking, a mouth gaping, &amp; what not that
could say our <hi>Don</hi> is now vpon the pitch of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting.
They say that great Princes should neuer
see the portraiture of feare but vpon their enemies
backes; sure I am <hi>Gondomar</hi> now sawe both feare
and cowardise vpon his owne heart. But why
should I driue you off with more circumstance?
the nakednes of the truth is, that as he gazed thus
fearefully about, there appeared or seemed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before him the Ghost of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>
Knight, a Noble famous English-man and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Souldier: at this apparition the Earle fell
downe flat to the earth vpon his face (for backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
he durst not, least he might giue an offence
to his Surgion) and yet the posture in which this
Noble Gentleman appeared, how euer fearefull to
the guilte of <hi>Gondomars</hi> conscience, yet it was
amiable and louely to any pure and honest compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
for he was armed at all peeces, and those
peeces of siluer, which is the ensigne of innocence
and harmlesnesse: In his right hand he brandished
his sword, which was an instrument that had beene
euer fatall to Spanish practises, and had not the
edge beene taken off by this Foxes subtilities, I
perswade my selfe (by this time) it had neere made a
new conquest of the West Indies; in his left ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d
be seemed to carry a cup of gold fild with blood,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17511:7"/>
which blood he sprinkled, some vpon <hi>Gondomar</hi>
and some vpon the ground, vttering in an hollow
and vnpleasant voyce, these or the like words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>Cresce Cruor, Sanguis satietur sanguine Cresce, quod
Spero Sitio, ah Sitio, Sitio.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gondomars</hi> attendants who had all this while (a
farre off) beheld their Lords actions, seeing him
now falling downe in this trance, came with all
possible speede running vnto him, but ere they
could offer an hand to his assistance, they might
heare him vtter words of that strange nature and
qualitie, that their feares bridled their charities,
and they were rather willing to let him lye still,
bending their atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tions to his words, then by a too
officious disturbance to break off any parte of that
discourse which might either make for the bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the knowledge of the State, or otherwise
be applyed to future seruice, at which these vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
and abortiue accidents euer point, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fixing their eyes and their eares constantly
vpon him (as he lay groueling on the earth) they
might heare these, or like words much like vnto
these, proceed from his perplexed and amazed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>Blessed soule (Noble Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>) what
haue I to doe with thy goodnesse, or wherefore
hast thou left the peacefulnesse of thy rest, to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and call me to account ere the prefixed and
full day of my tryall be comed, and that I must
stand face to face with thee and a world of others
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17511:8"/>
before the greatest Tribunall, I can confesse mine
iniquities, and that I haue beene to the King my
master, as <hi>Borgia Caesar</hi> was to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the
sixt, an instrument willing to take vpon me any or
all manner of sinnes how odious or vild soeuer, so
I might but make <hi>Spaine</hi> looke fresh, &amp; that those
imputations (which otherwise might haue drownd
her) might be but put into the Catalogue of my
seruices, though defame and curses were heaped
vpon me, in much greater quantities then <hi>Ossa,
Pelion</hi> or <hi>Pindus.</hi> I doe confesse I haue beene the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Nose of the Spanish State, through which hath
beene voyded all the excrements both of the head
and the whole body: I haue beene a channell or
a Common-shoare to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
what either Pope, Priest, Knaue or Iesuite could
inuent, I haue not left to put in practise: I knew the
odiousnesse of conspiracies, and how hatefull they
are both to God and man, yet had I neuer the
power to leaue conspiring: I knew both that the
Law of God and the law of <hi>Honour,</hi> tyed Princes
to detest conspiracies, and had many times read
ouer that notable Historie of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth,
and could my selfe repeate the noble and famous
praises which all <hi>Europe</hi> gaue him for aduertising
his Arch-enemie the Duke of <hi>Burgundie</hi> of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
against his person: but what hath this
wrought in me? certes nothing but more flame
and more fuell, so long as my thoughts were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
with the studie and remembrance of an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
Monarchie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:17511:8"/>I confesse I haue many times said (how euer I
haue beleeued) that those great ones which seeke
to make away their enemies otherwise then by Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
or the euent of warre, shewes mind base and
coward, and that their soules are emptie of true
courage, fearing that which they should scorne: I
confesse I haue admired the goodnesse of <hi>Fari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>
who deliuered into <hi>Pirrhus</hi> hand the slaue that
should haue poysoned him: I haue made <hi>Tiberius
Caesar</hi> a demy-god, for answering a King of the
<hi>Celtes</hi> which made him an offer to poyson <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
That Rome did not vse to be reuenged of her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
secretly and by deceite, but openly and by armes;</hi>
but haue I pursued this honorable tracte: haue any
of my ghostly fathers the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> or my masters the
<hi>Inquisitors</hi> giuen examples for these restrictions?
no, their lessons are of a cleane contrarie nature;
they say <hi>Flaminius</hi> was an honest man when hee
made <hi>Prusias</hi> the King of <hi>Bithinia</hi> violate all the
lawes of hospitalitie and vertue, in the murther of
<hi>Haniball,</hi> but the whole <hi>Senate</hi> condemd the action
for most odious, accusd <hi>Flaminius</hi> of crueltie and
coueteousnesse, of vaine glory and of ostentation:
and questionlesse had they had any touche or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Diuinitie or Christianitie they could not
haue found any other ranke for him, then that next
vnto <hi>Iudas:</hi> these faire paths I haue knowne, but
these I haue forsaken: and as <hi>Flaminius</hi> was the
cause of <hi>Hanibals</hi> death out of an ambitious emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
that he might in the Histories of succeeding
times be made notorious and eminent for so soule
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17511:9"/>
an action. So I must confesse I that haue the whole
course of my life labourd continually in the deep
myne of pollicie; haue not spared any blood (how
excellent soeuer) so I might be remembred in our
after Annals, for one of the chiefe master worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
which went to the building vp of the King
my masters <hi>Vniuersal Monarchy:</hi> And in this I must
confesse, most blessed soule, that thy death, thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
(&amp; to the Kingdom of Great <hi>Britane</hi>) much
too early death (which with all violence &amp; with all
the coniurations, perswasions &amp; exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ples that could
tye &amp; bind together the hearts and bodies of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
I did both plot, pursue, effect and consumate)
was one of the greatest masters peeces in which I
euer triumphed; I haue made my selfe fat with thy
downefall: and the blood which issued from thy
wound, was <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambrosia</hi> to my soule; for
from thy ending I knew rightwell must proceed
<hi>Spaines</hi> beginning: for neuer could the Spanish
King say as the French King did, <hi>Iesuis Roy seul,</hi> I am
King alone of the <hi>Indies</hi> as long as <hi>Rawleigh</hi> liued,
whose knowledge and experience was able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert,
conuert and turne topsie turuie all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
all his proceedings. I say the tottering
ground wheron my King title to the <hi>Indies</hi> stood,
that it was nothing but violence and force, tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
and vsurpation, and that if a stranger or more
gentle army should enter, how easie it was to set
vs besides the cushion; this I knew thou knowest,
and what not besides which belongeth to so great
an attempt and triumphe? I must confesse I haue
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17511:9"/>
called vp into my minde the honour, the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and greatnesse of thy great Familie, how rich
thou wert in blood and friends, the whole West
of the English Nation depending on thine ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
The manner of thine education, which was
not part but wholy Gentleman, wholy Souldier,
the edowments of thy vertues, which was Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Wisedome; the aduancement of those
endowments, which was to be the greatest, the
best, the most renowned Princesse that euer
breathed in <hi>Europe;</hi> and in the greatest time of
the greatest actions, the busiest time of the most
troubled Estates, the wisest time for the discussion
of the most difficult affaires, and the onely time
that did produce the excellencie and perfection
of <hi>wisedome, Warre</hi> and <hi>Gouernment,</hi> so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be hid from thy knowledge, neither
wouldst thou suffer any thing to be concealed
from thine experience, for thou hadst euer a mind
actiuely disposed; and howsoeuer thy fortune
was accompanyed with all manner of felicities,
things able in themselues to haue drawne thy
minde from all other obiects, and to haue setled
thee vpon this Theorie, and solitarinesse is the
most excellentest condition belonging vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
in as much as in it he onely findeth the true
tranquilitie of the minde, for nothing is wanting
in that quiet habitation; <hi>Manna</hi> fals there, the
Rauens bring bread from heauen; if the waters
be bitter, there is wood to sweeten them: If the
combate of <hi>Amalec &amp; Edom</hi> be there, the triumphs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17511:10"/>
of <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Iosua</hi> are likwise there, for what cannot
a life retired either suffer or care in its contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet all this thou didst neglect, and both
contradict and disproue: thou knewest this life
vnfit for thy greatnesse, and thou wert not borne
for thy selfe but thy Countrie, thou knewest the
Sea, wherein euery great soule should wander:
had not hauen but the graue, and that as they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
so they ought euer to dye in action. Hence
it came, that euen in the very florish and glorie of
all thy great estate, thou betookest thy selfe to the
Seas, and what thou hast before by thy purse and
infinit great charge in the actions of other men
wonne and annexed to the Diademe of thy great
Mistris, now thou doest in thine owne person
take a vewe. and sutuay of the same, applying
knowledge to report, and making thine owne
experience a controller to other mens relations:
I dare not (for the honour of my Nation) vnfolde
the woefull perplexitie in which Spaine stood du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this tedious voyage, how she quaked to
thinke of the generall viewe which thou hadst ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
without impeachement of all the West <hi>Indies;</hi>
but most of all when shee was aduertised of thy
long and laborious passage vpon the riuer <hi>Or ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi>
the distinguishments which thou hadst made
betwixt it and the riuer of <hi>Amazons;</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences
which thou hadst gotten for thine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
to the great Cittie of <hi>Manoa</hi> and Kingdome
of <hi>Guyana;</hi> defignes which if they had beene pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
according to thy willingnes and knowledge,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17511:10"/>
we had not at this day acknowledged one foote of
earth for ours in all the West <hi>Indies:</hi> O the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
estate of Spaine if these things had procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded!
she had then, which now threatens all, begd
of all; and the Pistolets of gold and peeces of plate
wherewith it now corrupts and conquers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
had then beene turnd to Leather or Iron,
or some other Spanish stuffe more base and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible:
Was it not now high time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
against thee, to digge mine vnder-mine, to
enter into familiaritie with malcontents, to seduce
some, to bribe others, to flatter all; to preache a
thousand most damnable false doctrines, for the
subuersion of Princes and the destruction of their
faithfull seruants: was it not time for vs to make
Religion a cloake for our villanie, and vnder-the
Lambs Furre to couer the Wolues policies? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
me (blessed shadow) had we either made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of sin, or scruples for the maintenance of
Honour, we had not subsisted as we doe, but had
sadly Laine like those which now lye captiued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
vs, can Spaine euer forget thine attempt vpon
her owne confines and in her most securest places,
call vp <hi>Cadiz</hi> to witnesse, she will shew you some
of her ashes; call the Kings great <hi>Armada</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
which was led by his twelue (supposed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
Apostles) and the most of them must rise
from the bottome of the seas, some must desim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogue
from your our owne harbours: Let <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
in <hi>Portugall</hi> speake, and she will confesse that her
Church will yet hardly couer her Idols. When I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17511:11"/>
looke vpon the Ilands of the <hi>Azores,</hi> me thinkes I
see <hi>Fiall</hi> burning in the flames which you cast vpon
her, whilst all the rest bring in the tributs of their
best wealths, to saue themselues from perishing.
Lastly but not least, for from it I raisd the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
of thy fatall destruction; I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
thine action vpon the Towne of St <hi>Thoma</hi>
standing vpon the riuer of <hi>Oronoque,</hi> how fit it lay
as a bayte to drawe thee into mischiefe, and how
brauely it gaue me occasion neuer to desist till I
saw thy ruine; alas, was that despised Towne to be
prised with thy life, with thine experience, with
thine abilitie to direct, or with the least parte of
thine actions? no, it was not onely my malice
made it inestimable, and my continuall solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
mine imprecations, my vowes, mine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
vpon Iustice, mine instances on the
actions of pious and religious Kings, and the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of too bold and ambitious Subiects, was so
importune and violent, that but the great forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of thy blood, my furie could finde no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
hence you fell, and that fall was to me more
then a double Banquet; for now mee thought I
saw all things secure about me: Now said I to my
selfe, who shall shake any one stone in our building?
who shall giue vs affright by sea, or shew vs the
terrors of the land? what shall hinder vs now to
bring home our gold in Caruiles, and our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
in Hoys and Flyboats? all is ours, the
Ocean is ours, and the <hi>Indies</hi> are ours: this
could wee neuer boast before, yet this was my
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17511:11"/>
worke, and in this I triumphed.</p>
            <p>At these words the Ghost appeared to shewe
anger, and menacying him with frownes and the
shaking of his sword, the poore <hi>Don</hi> lifting vp his
armes vnder his cloake, shewd his red badge of the
Order of <hi>Colotrauta;</hi> but finding the crosse vtterly
void of vertue to diuert that charme, he began to
crye out againe in this manner.</p>
            <p>Doe not mistake me (blessed Soule) in that I
<unclear>haue</unclear> said I triumphed, for I will now with griefe
and repentance buy from thy mercy my absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It is true that then I triumphed, for what is
he that takes in hand any labor or worke of high
consequence, but when he hath finished it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
hee sits downe and reioyceth? So I that
saw (not a farre off but neare at hand) the infinite
hinderances, rubs and impediments, which thy
knowledge, thy valour, thy command and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
might bring to any worke vndertaken by
my King, for the aduancement or bringing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of his vniuersall Monarchie: and when I
pondred with my selfe, that no Nation vnder
heauen was so able in power, so apt in the nature
and disposition of the people, nor so plentifull
in all accomodations, both for sea and land, as
this Iland of Great <hi>Britaine,</hi> to oppose or beate
backe any or all of our vndertakings, When I saw
<hi>France</hi> bufie both at home and abroad, the Lowe-Countries
carefull to keepe their owne, not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to increase their owne; when I saw <hi>Germany</hi>
afflicted with ciuill anger, <hi>Denmarke</hi> troubled to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17511:12"/>
take trouble from his dearest kinsman: the <hi>Polen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
watching of the <hi>Turke,</hi> and the <hi>Turke</hi> through
former losses, fearefull to giue any new attempt
vpon Christendome, and that in all these we had
a maine and particular interest: when I saw euery
way smooth for vs to passe, and that nothing
could keepe the Garland from our heads; or the
Goale from our purchase but onely the anger or
discontent of this fortunate British Iland; blame
me not then if I fell to practises vnlawfull, to fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
deceitfull, to briberie most hurtefull, and
to other enchantments most shamefull, by which
Imight either winne mine owne ends, or make
my worke prosperous in the opinion of my Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.
I confesse I haue many times abused the
Maiestie of Great <hi>Britaine</hi> with curious falshoods,
I haue protested against my knowledge, and vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vowes and promises which I knew could neuer
be reconciled: I haue made delayes, sharpe spurs
to hasten on mine owne purposes, &amp; haue brought
the swiftest designes to so slowe a pace, that they
haue beene lost like shadowes, and neither known
nor regarded: I lookt into your Common-wealth,
and saw that two and twenty yeares ease had made
her grow idle; I saw the East <hi>Indies</hi> eate vp and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure
your Mariners &amp; Sea-men, &amp; time and old
age consume and take away your land Captaines;
and of all, none more materiall then your selfe:
Blame me not then if I made thine end my begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
thy <unclear>fall</unclear> the fulnesse of my perfection, and
thy destruction the last worke or master-peece of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17511:12"/>
all my wisedome and pollicie. This is the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of my confession, and but from this sinne
absolue me, and I will dye thy penitent in sacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath
and ashes.</p>
            <p>At these words the apparition seemed (in the
fearefull imagination of the poore <hi>Don</hi>) to be
more then exceeding angrie, and lookt vpon him
with such terror and amazement, that <hi>Gondomar</hi>
fell (with the affright) into a trance or deadly
sound, whilest the Ghost seemed to vtter vnto
him these or these like words following.</p>
            <p>To hee whom base flatterie, wante and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse

to Truth and Iustice; yet in this accusation,
shame and thine owne putrified conscience shall
be witnesses so powerfull and vndaunted, that

            <p>To begin then with mine owne end, though I

yet poore despised mortall, know, it was not
you, but a more diuine and inserutable finger
which pointed out my destinie to this manner of
end &amp; destruction, neither is it fit for the humility
of ignorant man to open his eyes, as daring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to gaze on the radiant beames of that soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
power, which disposeth of seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d causes as he
pleaseth: neither doe I afflict thee as my particular
executioner, but as my Countries generall enemy:
It sufficeth me that the great God who is Iudge of
life &amp; death, hath disposed of my life, &amp; after this
early manner, that in it he might expres the effects
of his Iustice; therefore trouble not thy selfe with
my death which was thy comfort, but be vexed at
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17511:14"/>
thine owne life, which is nothing but a continuall
pilgrimage to Ambition, and an vndermining
Moale to digge downe the Church of God, and
to bring the Gospell of our blessed Sauiour into
eternall captiuitie. Hast not thou beene an vnti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
packe-horse, trauelling night and day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a baite, and loaden like ad Asse, till thy
knees haue bowed vnder the burthen of strange
and vnnaturall designes, by which to aduance
thy Master to the vniuersall Monarchie of all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi>
This thy feare hath made thee confesse, but
this thy flatterie and falshood will deny, should
not the efficacie of truth make it most apparant
and pregnant: Therefore to enter into the first
streames from whence <hi>Spaine</hi> hath gathered the
great Ocean of its Soueraigntie, there is no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
more remarkable then the Battle of <hi>Alcazar</hi>
in <hi>Barbarie,</hi> where the too forward <hi>Don Sebastian</hi>
King of <hi>Portugall</hi> (whether slaine or not slaine) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
himselfe too vnfortunately, gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to <hi>Philip</hi> the second of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to enter and
vsurpe vpon his kinsmans Kingdomes, to expell
<hi>Don Antonio</hi> from his right and inheritance, and
as it is strongly supposed, to cause the true King
himselfe to dye in the Gallies; hence he became
King of all the <hi>Spaines</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> puld to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the Soueraignetie both of the Ilands of the
<hi>Canaries</hi> and of the <hi>Azores,</hi> the one securing his
way forth, the other securing his way home from
the West <hi>Indies,</hi> and so made the conquest thereof
more safe and vndoubded: hee tooke also by the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17511:14"/>
same interest many strong holds &amp; marchantable
places in the East <hi>Indies,</hi> so that sitting now alone
in <hi>Spaine</hi> without a competitor, and hauing trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
from the West <hi>Indies</hi> wherewith to pay Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and marchandize from the East <hi>Indies</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to enrich his owne subiects, what could he,
or what did hee contemplate vpon but the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
of his Monarchie: Hence it came that
his waare grewe violent vpon the Low-Countries
and vnder the Gouernments of the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi>
and <hi>Don Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> the tyrannies so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable,
that all manner of freedomes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
to slaueries, and the blood of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
made only foode for the slaughter-house, yea
such as were remote and stood farther off from
his crueltie, depending vpon their owne rights
and vnder the couert of their owne guards, were
not yet safe from <hi>Spaines</hi> conspiracies, and that
witnesseth the death and murther of the famous
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the imprisonment and death of
his eldest sonne, and a world of infamous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
against the life of Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> the last
Prince deceased, and against the safetie of Count
<hi>Henrike</hi> the Prince now suruiuing: what incroch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were daily made vpon these distressed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces,
all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> blush to behold,
and had not <hi>Elizabeth</hi> my dread Ladie and Mistris
of famous and blessed memorie, taken them to
her Royall protection, they had long since beene
swallowed vp in the gulphe of his tyrannie; and
none of them now liuing had knowne the name of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17511:15"/>
free Princes: and as this worke was begun by
<hi>Philip</hi> the second, so it was continued by <hi>Philip</hi>
the third, and is now at this houre as earnestly
pursued by <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth and his sister the
Archduchesse, and rather with gaining then loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
so that should <hi>England</hi> but turne its face a
little away from their succour, there would be a
great breache made in the hope of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting.</p>
            <p>But you will answere, that if <hi>Spaine</hi> had fixed
down its resolution vpon an vniuersall Monarchy,
they had neuer then harkned to a peace with the
Nether-Lands: to this thine owne conscience is
ten thousand witnesses, that the peace which it
entertained was nothing else but a politicke delay
to bring other and impersit ends and designes, to
a more fit and solid purpose, for effecting of his
generall conquest: for what did this Truce, but
diuert the eyes of the Nether-lands (which at
that time were growing to be infinit great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of shipping) from taking a suruay of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and brought a securitie to the transportation
of his plate and treasure, and made him settle and
reinforce his Garrisons which then were growne
weake and ouertoyled, besides a world of other
aduantages, which too plainely discouered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
assoone as the warre was new commenced.</p>
            <p>As he had thus gotten his feete into the Nether-lands,
had not <hi>Spaine</hi> in the same manner, and
with as much vsurpation, thrust his whole body
into <hi>Italy?</hi> let <hi>Naples</hi> speake, let <hi>Sicill,</hi> let the Ilands
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17511:15"/>
of <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Corfica,</hi> the Dukedome of <hi>Millan,</hi>
the reuolte of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> and a world of other
places, some possest, some lying vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of strange Titles, but come to giue vp their
account, and it will be more then manifest, that
no Signorie in all: <hi>Italie</hi> but stood vpon his guard,
and howerly expected when the Spanish storme
should fall vpon them; how many quarrels hath
beene piled against the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> some by
the <hi>Pope,</hi> some by the King of <hi>Spaine?</hi> how many
doubts haue beene throwne vpon <hi>Tuscanie?</hi> what
protestations haue flowne to <hi>Genoa,</hi> and what
threatnings against <hi>Geneua?</hi> and all to put <hi>Italy</hi>
into conbustion, whilst the <hi>Popes</hi> holinesse, and
his Catholicke Maiestie, like <hi>Saturnes</hi> sonnes, sat
full gordgd with expectation to deuide heauen
and earth betweene them.</p>
            <p>O was it not a braue politicke tricke of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
(neither was thine aduice absent from the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe)
when the difference fell betweene <hi>Henry</hi>
the Great of <hi>France</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Sauoye,</hi> about
the Marquisate of <hi>Saluses;</hi> the King then your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
vnder pretence of aiding the Duke his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Law, sent diuers Regiments of Spaniards
which were quartered some in <hi>Garbonieres,</hi> some
in <hi>Montemellion, Sauillan, Pignoroll</hi> and diuers
other places about <hi>Sauoye</hi> and <hi>Piemont,</hi> but when
the Truce was concluded, could the Duke vpon
any intreatie, potent or message make these Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
to quit his Countrie? no, by no meanes,
for they were so farre from leauing <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>heir foot-hold,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17511:16"/>
hauing receiued dtuers commandments to keepe
it, both from the Count <hi>de Fuentes</hi> (at that time
Vice-roy of <hi>Millan</hi>) from thee by priuate letters,
and from the King your Master by sundrie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions;
that the chiefes of those Troopes, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
answered the Duke, that they would
hould their gettings, in despight of all opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and were indeed full as good as their words
for a long time, till at last the Duke (inforced
thereunto) raised vp a strong Army, and in a fewe
dayes put them all to the sword, I would here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate
the Spanish attempt against the Castle of
<hi>Nice,</hi> being the very key or opener of an entrance
into the very bowels of <hi>Italie;</hi> I could speake of
the dangerous quarrel raisd betweene the Duke of
<hi>Sauoye</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mantoa,</hi> for the Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate
of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and how fatall it was likely to
haue beene to the whole state of <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein
<hi>Fuentes</hi> and thy selfe, shewd all the arte of practise
that might be, which, should become the master
worke-man; but these things are so pregnant and
apparant that they neede little discussion.</p>
            <p>Let mee now awaken thy memory with some
stirrings vp or practises against the Kingdome of
<hi>France,</hi> no lesse but more pernitious then any of
the former; who was the head or chiefe soueraigne
(after the the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third King of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi>) of that most vnchristian like
combination, intituled the <hi>Holy,</hi> but truely <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy
League,</hi> was it not <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> one of your
most Catholike Masters, who made the great and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17511:16"/>
valiant <hi>Guise</hi> his sword and seruant, the ould
Queene mother his intelligencer and admirer,
the Cardinals his Ministers and seducers, and the
Pope himselfe a Prodigall childe, to bestow and
giue away whatsoeuer hee required? was not all
this <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> your Catholike Master? How
long did he keepe <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth surnamed the
Great, from his lawfull Throne and inheritance?
what Citties did hee possesse? euen the greatest
that <hi>France</hi> could number: what Countries vnder
his command? all that were rich or fruitfull: and
what Nobilitie had hee drawne from their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?
those that were more powerfull and best
beloued; in so much, that had not my most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Mistris <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of blessed and famous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
like a strong Rocke against the rage of a
furious sea, taken the quarrell into her hand, and
by her Royall protection, first vnder the conduct
of the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> after vnder the conduct of
the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> staid and supported that ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Estate, <hi>France</hi> it is feared, at this houre had
onely spoken the Spanish language: but God in
his great mercie had otherwise disposed of these
practises, and though with some difficulties,
brought the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> to its true owner;
a Prince so absolutely excellent in euery perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of true honour and magnimitie, that his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell
hath not beene found in all the Historie of
<hi>France,</hi> and although hee had in his very youth
and almost child-hood preuailed in diuers Battles,
as that at <hi>Montconter,</hi> and at <hi>Rene-le-duke;</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17511:17"/>
although hee had beene assayled in the dayes of
<hi>Henry</hi> the third, and in the space of foure yeares,
by ten Royall Armies successiuely one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and sent one to refresh the other, and vnder
the conduct of great and most glorious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
against all which he preuailed, as witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his victorie at the Battle of <hi>Coutras</hi> and other
places, though he had giuen succour to <hi>Henry</hi> the
third, and deliuered him from his great danger
at <hi>Tours,</hi> bringing to his obedience <hi>Gargeau, Gien,
La Charite, Fluuiers, Estampes, Deurdan</hi> and diuers
other places: though hee had beene generally
fortunate in all his great actions, yet after the
death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, this deuillish combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Spanish knot of the <hi>League</hi> is more omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
fatall and troublesome vnto him, then all
his former vndertakings; and hee found that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee might haue come to the Crowne of
<hi>France</hi> by succession, which was the easiest way,
yet God to trie his courage, to exercise the force
of his minde, and to make a foolish shadowe or
<hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> of <hi>Spaines</hi> Ambition, presented the
most painefull and difficult vnto him, which was
that of Conquest: Hee was forst to raise on foote
(by the helpe of our E<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>glish Nation) three Royall
Armies, which he disperst in three Prouinces; the
first, into <hi>Normandie,</hi> where he was assisted by the
Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> the second into <hi>Champaigne,</hi> and
the third into <hi>Picardie,</hi> where hee was seconded
by the Lord <hi>Willoughbie,</hi> who brought him trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly
into the suburbs of <hi>Paris,</hi> and by the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17511:17"/>
blowing vp of a Porte, offerd to deliuer the whole
Cittie to his subiection; the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> did as
much at <hi>Roan,</hi> but the King desired to winne
<hi>France,</hi> not to destroy <hi>France,</hi> yet ere the Earle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
he chafed rebellion out of the most part
of <hi>Normandie:</hi> the King gaue his enemis (the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
faction) battle vpon the plaine of <hi>Yury</hi> and
wonne it, by which he regained in lesse then two
months fifteene or sixteene great Townes, brought
<hi>Paris</hi> to infinit extreamitie, made the Spaniards
wish themselues on the other side of the <hi>Pereneans:</hi>
and indeede such a generall amazement to all the
vnhappie <hi>Leaguers,</hi> that all stood agast, as vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
which way to turne them.</p>
            <p>This when your great Master beheld, and saw
that all his hopes were dying in an instant, like a
cunning Coniurer hee seekes to drawe fire and
lightning from heauen, to consume what his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
durst not approach or disualewe, whence it
came, that he rouses vp <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13. then Pope,
who indeed was the Oracle, or rather the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Philip</hi> your master, and makes him of a
common Father betweene the head of a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
and vsurping partie, casting forth his fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
with such violence and iniustice, that the
Buls were taken and burnt both at <hi>Tours</hi> and at
<hi>Chalons;</hi> neither sent he out these Buls by his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
and bloodie Ministers the Iesuites, or such
like desperate and obscure mal-contents, but with
an Army of a thousand cassacks of watchet veluet,
imbrodred with gold, and Ciphers of Keys ioyned
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17511:18"/>
vnto swords (whose errand was, to demand the
execution of these Buls) now seing the difficultie
wherein affaires stood, vpon the vew of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
horse of the French Kings white Cornet,
dare not for all the Pope or the King of <hi>Spaines</hi>
hopes or commandements abandon the very sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
of the walles of <hi>Verdun,</hi> but like so many
Foxes lay lurking in their kennels of security,
knowing they had to deale with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, whose swords
were so well steeld, that they feared not the lead
of <hi>Rome,</hi> onely like so many Furies of hell they
seeke to breake all treaties of peace, and made it an
action treasonable and most impious, to talke of
an vnity betweene the Soueraigne and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</p>
            <p>But for all this, great <hi>Henry</hi> lost no time, for
first, he passed into <hi>Normandy,</hi> secured his friends
there, thence hee went into <hi>Picardie,</hi> besieged
<hi>Noyon</hi> and tooke it, euen in the view of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Armie, who although they were three to
one, yet durst not to hazard the Battle: which
aduantage the King wisely taking, and turning
head vpon his enemies, albeit hee was aduised to
the contrary by his chiefest seruants, yet his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
bound him rather to follow the path of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
with honour, then that of safety with shame,
saying as <hi>Pompey</hi> said, <hi>That in striking his foot against
the earth he would raise vp Legions:</hi> so the Armies
met together at <hi>Aumale,</hi> where though vpon the
first approach the King was hurt with a shot, yet
he had <unclear>strongth</unclear> enough to crye <hi>Charge, Charge,</hi> and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17511:18"/>
breaking through his enemies, he put the Duke of
<hi>Parma</hi> and all his Spaniards to a shamefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traite;
as this, so he beat his enemies at <hi>Bellencombe,</hi>
he stripes them at <hi>Bure,</hi> and made them to quit
<hi>Tuetot</hi> with much shame and losse.</p>
            <p>Thus this Royall Kings quarrell being iust, and
maintained by a good sword, the pride of <hi>Spaine</hi>
found that if the warre contained longer, her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
greatnesse, could haue more wood to heat
her Ouen, then corne to send to the Mill.</p>
            <p>Tis purposelesse to speake of the ruine of
<hi>Quibeuf,</hi> the recouerie of <hi>Espernay,</hi> or that braue
assault, where eight Horses put three hundred to
route; let it suffice me in one word to conclude,
that in despight of all the engines which the Pope
or the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> could vse, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France</hi>
became triumphant, and your Masters vniuersall
Monarchie was turnd topsie turuie: nay, the
<hi>League</hi> the <hi>Typhon</hi> of sedition from whence sprung
so many Serpents and Vipers of disloyalty, was
smothered vnder the <hi>AEtna</hi> of her owne presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
and pride.</p>
            <p>But did either <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> here stay their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice?
fie no, but rather <hi>Anteus</hi> like, they rose vp
with double vigor, and what publique warre
could not effect, priuate practise and conspiracie
must bring to passe, for ere the Great <hi>Henry</hi> was
well warmed in his Throne, <hi>Hell</hi> and the Spanish
gold stird vp a wretch, who vndertooke to kill
him; the Tyger staid his hand at the shining of a
glasse, and after his apprehension, confest that hee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17511:19"/>
sawe so much pietie and zeale shining in the eyes
of this Prince, that he felt horrour in himselfe to
offend the Soueraigne dignity ordained of God
among Angels and Men. Hence it came that all
<hi>France</hi> beheld and tooke notice of <hi>Spaines</hi> Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp; that indeed all their labour was but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that florishing Nation to a priuate Prouince,
which the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> (after it had vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the phlegme of temporizing) taking to heart,
made forth a Decree for the dispersing and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of all the Spanish Regiments: and now
fiue great Dukes, formerly bewitched with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
incantations, fall at the foote of this
great King, and confesse how they were beguy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>The first, was the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a generall Peace for his Estate, through
the mediation of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Archduke of <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canie;</hi>
the second was the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi>
who abtained pardon through the wisedome of
his carryage, hauing still a watchfull eye, that no
generall ruine might happen to the Kingdome;
The third, was the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> the losse of
whose father and vnckle, made his interest the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
in this quarrell, yet had he the honour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Kings first imbraces; The fourth was the
Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> who as soone as hee had kist the
Kings hand, forsooke the troubles of the world,
betooke himselfe to a solitary life; and the last was
the Duke <hi>Mercure,</hi> who brought to the King, not
himselfe alone, but with him the reduction of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17511:19"/>
goodlyest Prouince in all <hi>France:</hi> To conclude
<hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> your Master, seing vpon what false
wheeles his engins ranne, was content to intreate
for peace of this great Cheiftaine.</p>
            <p>But did here conspiracies and Spanish plots
end? no, nothing so: for to come nearer to your
owne touche, and to repeate matters of thine
owne prosecution, Is it not an Historie most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
and to <hi>Spaine</hi> most infamous, of that
desperate vilaine borne at <hi>Negre-pelisse,</hi> who
going into <hi>Spaine</hi> vpon some discontents concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
against this great <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and as it
was strongly supposed, hauing taken some dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
from you, but full and materiall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
from the Deuils post horses your masters
the Iesuites, did with all violence prostitute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to murther this most Christian King; but the
matter being so important, and carryed through
so many seuerall hands, had lost so much strength
of secrecie, that an inckling thereof came to the
eares of <hi>de Barrant,</hi> then ordinarie Ambassadour in
<hi>Spaine</hi> for the King of <hi>France,</hi> who instantly out
of dutie, and the hatred which euery true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
ought to beare against these odious and most
Atheisticall practises, complained to the Popes
<hi>Nuntio,</hi> hoping of redresse, both against the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine
himselfe, your selfe and the Iesuites, who
are both vilaines and your selfe; but the matter
was fully blancht, and your impious eare (that
had listned to this abhominable sinne) was excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and the whole offence of subornation was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17511:20"/>
laid vpon a creature of yours; but one of the King
of <hi>Spaines</hi> Esquiers, named by the place of his
birth <hi>Valdomoro,</hi> who vpon examination (hauing
his lesson fore taught him, confest all the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> and that not onely this
slaue, but diuers others had tendred themselues to
the like seruice, yet this with the greatest vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
assuring him that he knew the meanes how
to kill the King; which proposition, vpon some
conference with a Iesuite (who neuer take distast at
such a practise) he had accepted of, but yet with
that caution and delay that nothing proceeded
therein, neither was likely to proceed, and so all
things were shut vp without any further discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
onely that <hi>de Barraut</hi> aduertised the King his
Master thereof: but was this honorable or pious
in <hi>Spaine?</hi> no, the praise had beene more perfect,
and the merit more plaine and euident for the
Spaniards, if they had punished the Traytor,
made thy selfe <hi>Valdomoro,</hi> and the Iesuite exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
not to listen or giue eare to such odious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies,
and by a carefull aduertisement to the
King, made others dread the entering into so
odious a businesse, for it is true in all the lawes of
hospitalitie, that this slaue ought not to haue
come out of <hi>Spaine</hi> vnchastised, for all Kings are
brothers, and all Kingdomes interessed in these
attemps. But the designes of <hi>Spaine</hi> lookt now an
other way, and the Traytor had leaue to escape,
who returning afterwards into <hi>France,</hi> was by <hi>de
Verdun</hi> first President of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> apprehended
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17511:20"/>
at <hi>Tholouse</hi> and there executed, and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
condemnd to the Gallies. O how farre was
this action shorte, of that Royall and Princely
acte of the famous late Queene <hi>Elizabeth!</hi> who
hauing receiued intelligence of some Spanish mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieues
pretended against this great King, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
gaue him intelligence, that a strange Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
who was one of his followers, had no
good meaning towards his person, and related
vnto him euery circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce as she had receiued it;
but such was the bountie of this great King, that
allbe reason would that he should haue bin appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
yet the King neuer discouered vnto him
a frowne, but he still remained in the Court well
entertained, was mounted out of the Kings stable,
and honoured with many of his trustie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
till in the end torturd with his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
he stole away from the Court, &amp; durst no
longer abuse so Royall a bountie; that this was a
Fauorite of <hi>Spaine</hi> your selfe cannot deny, that he
fled from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> your one Cabanet
is a witnesse, and that you did preserue him for the
like exploits in others places: the marke on his
face, the colour of his beard, and his cloaths cut
after the <hi>Walloone</hi> fashion were too apparant testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
            <p>I might here recounte this great Kings death
by <hi>Rauiliac,</hi> from whose blood, neither thy selfe
nor <hi>Spaine</hi> can wash themselues, though all the
Riuers in the world were exhausted and thrust into
one entyer Bath, and so spent vpon your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17511:21"/>
cleansings; but these truths are so fresh in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
they need neither repeating, nor ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>I could to these adde a world of others, as the
attempts vpon the life and safety of the late
Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memorie, and the
making of all those inhumane creatures Pentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who had either by rebellion or
other treasonable practise, attempted any thing
for her vntimely and sad destruction.</p>
            <p>Was our late dread Soueraigne, King <hi>Iames</hi>
of blessed and happy memorie, that <hi>Salomon</hi> of his
time, a Prince so indulgent and carefull for euery
good thing that might happen to <hi>Spaine,</hi> a man so
tender and vigilant for her reputation, that hee
euer plac'd it in the next rancke to his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
was he I say? was this good King free from
the bloody practises of <hi>Spaine?</hi> no, to the eternall
infamie of ingratefull and bloody <hi>Spaine;</hi> I may
euer proclaime it that he was more deepely plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and his like, more bitterly besieged and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted,
then any whatsoeuer before rehearsed: and
to this I call vp the plot of all plots, that Deuill
of many legions of Deuils, the Gun-pouder cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piracie,
that which should haue destroyed all,
not a single Prince or a single man, but many
Princes, many mens whole generations; here
was cruell <hi>Spaine</hi> and here indeed (had not God
preuented) was a strong foundation for an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
Monarchie; and that <hi>Spaine</hi> may not in this,
pleade not guilty: let her discouer to the world

            </p>
            <p>Thus I haue brought <hi>Spaines</hi> attemps for an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
Monarchie, from <hi>Portugall</hi> to the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
thence through <hi>Italy,</hi> so into <hi>France; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
was lookt vpon by the way, in the yeare
1588. but shee was not so drowfie as others:
there is now but <hi>Germanie</hi> betwixt him and the end
of his Ambition, but is that free and vntouched?
woe to speake it, that of all is the worst and most
horred: O the lamentable estate, of those once
most happie Princes! how hath the house of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi>
drownd them in blood? and by the worke of
ciuill dissention, made them in their furies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure
one another. Is there any thing in this age
more lamentable or remarquable, then the losse
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17511:22"/>
of the <hi>Palatinate?</hi> or is there any thing in which
thy villany can so much triumph as in that poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
defeature? why, the lyes which thou didst
vtter to abuse the Maiestie of <hi>England,</hi> and to
breed delayes till thy Masters designes were effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
were so curious and so cunning, so apte to
catch, and so strong in the holding, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
(who was formerly the author of lyes) hath
now from thee taken new presidents for lying. I
would here speake of thy Archduchesses dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
but shee is a great Lady, and their errours
at the worst are weake vertues.</p>
            <p>Therefore to thee that hast lent both fuell and
flame to all the mischiefes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that art
now bigge in labour with new troubles and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
arise and collect thy spirits, become once

               </gap>st and religious, let thy seruices depend
vpon good and necessarie affaires, and not vpon
malicious and bloody practises: for behold, I
thy <hi>Tormentor</hi> will neuer be absent from thine el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,
and whatsoeuer thou shalt contriue or plot
for the hurt of Great <hi>Britaine,</hi> I with the helpe of
the holy Angels will returne vpon thine owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and the bosome of thy Countrie, for the

therefore if thou desirest to liue and see good

no hurt.</p>
            <p>At these words, the glorious aparition (wauing

and the poore <hi>Don</hi> as if awakened from a deadly

such gastly amazednesse as affrighted all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him. In the end espying his owne seruants,
with teares in his eyes, terrour in his heart, and a
generall trembling ouer all his body, he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
