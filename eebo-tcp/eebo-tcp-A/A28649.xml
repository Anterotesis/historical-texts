            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>TThe firſt thing wée will begin withall is to find the length of the mayne maſt, for any ſhip whoſe length at the keele, the breadth at the beame, and the depth in hold is knowne, which is done two ſeverall wayes: The firſt, which is the moſt Rationall way, is to adde the breadth and the depth of the ſhip together and double it, and divide the product by 3. and the quotient is the length of the Maine Maſt in Yards. Example in the ſhip we have propounded, the bredth 29 ½ the depth 13 foote, thoſe two added is 42 ½ the double of 42 ½ is 85. that divided by 3. the quotient is 28 1/<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Yards, that is 85 foote, but we have propounded out Maſt to be but 84 foote.</p>
               <p>A ſecond way is thus, adde the length of the Kéele, the breadth of the beame and the depth together, and to that Sum adde the difference betweene the breadth &amp; twice the depth, and multiply the whole Sum by the breadth at the beame, and the product divide by the former whole Sum, and the quotient is the length of the Mayne Maſt in Yardes. Example in the Ship we have propounded, the length of the Keele 75 foote, the breadth of the beame 29 ½ foote, and the depth 13 foote added together the Sum is 117 ½ unto which adde the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene twice the depth 26 and the breadth 29 ½ which is 3 ½ and the whole Sum is 121. which multiplyed by 29 ½ the breadth at the beame and the product is 3569 ½ which divided by 121. the former whole Sum the quotient is 29 ½ Yards, which is a yard more &amp; better, then it was the other way, but it is too long, and therefore we commend the firſt way for the more rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall way, and doe perſwade thoſe that have occaſion to make uſe of that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48352:7"/>Now having found the length of the Mayne Maſt in this manner for any Shipp; we have ſet downe a Table of the lengths and thickneſſe of all the Maſtes and Yards of the Ship we have propounded by meanes whereof, after the length and thickneſſe, at the partners of the Mayne Maſt for any Sip is found. The lengthes and thickneſſe of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maſtes and Yards may be found by our Table as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: Suppoſe a Ship 63 foote by the the Keele, 25 foote breadth at the beame, and 11 foote déepe in hold, we deſire to know the length and the thickneſſe of all the Maſtes and yards; and firſt for the Mayne Maſt, the breadth at beame 25 foote, the depth 11 foote, their Sum 36. their double 72. which divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by 3 the quotient is 24 Yardes, the length of the Mayne Maſt, which is 72 foote. To finde the lengths and thickneſſe of all the other, you may doe it by the Rule of Thrée, the lengthes in féete and the thickneſſe in inches, and the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from the lengthes and the thickneſſe of the Maſts and Yardes, for they are but a lineall proportion: That is:</p>
               <p>As, 8, the length of our Maine-maſt in the Table is to 72. the length of the Maine-maſt found ſo is 28, the thickneſſe of our Mayne-maſt in the Table to 24. the thickneſſe of the Maine-maſt found at the partners; the thickneſſe or the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter at the hounes muſt be ⅔ two third parts of that which it is at the partners which in this, is 16 inches thicknes or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter. Or this proportion of the lengths of the Maſtes may be abreviated, for it is as 7 to 6. ſo is 28 to 24. and ſo we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed to finde all the reſt, as 7 to 6 ſo is 75 our foremaſt to 74. the length of the foremaſt required; and ſo wee may procéed for all the other lengthes and thickneſſe both of the Maſts &amp; Yards: but becauſe this is ſome-what troubleſome, and every one is not able to worke the Rule of Thrée in numbers, wee have conſidered of a more eaſie and ſpéedy way for the performing of it, which is by an opening ſcale, having two lines drawne, one on each ſide from the center, each line divided into 150. parts: and each part into two parts, whoſe uſe is thus, take 72 from the Center on one ſide of the ſcale in your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes the length of the Maine-maſt found, and put it over in

84 and 84 the length of our Maine-maſt in the Table, and kéeping the ſcale ſtill at the ſame diſtance without altering it take the diſtance over with your compaſſes betwéene 28 and 28 the thickneſſe of our Maine-maſt in the Table, and meaſure it on the ſide of the ſcale from the center, and it will end in 24. the thickneſſe of the Maſt ſought; and take it over in 75. the length of our fore-maſt and it will end in 64 the length of the fore-maſt required, and take it over in 25. the thickneſſe of our fore-maſt and it will end in 21 ½ the thickneſſe of the fore-maſt required, and in 74 the length of our Maine-yard in the Tables, and it will end in 63. the length of the Maine-yard required, and in 24. for the thickneſſe and it will end in 21 the thickneſſe required: and ſo procéed for all the reſt of the lengths and thickneſſe without altering the ſcale, and you ſhall finde 56 the length of the bowſprite and 19 thickneſſe, and 53 the length of the fore-yard, and 17 ½ the thickneſſe, and 44 the length of the Mizon-yard and 13 thickneſſe, and 45 the length of the Mizon Maſt, and 15 the thickneſſe, and 43 the length of the Spritſaile yard, and 14 the thickneſſe, and 36 the length of the maine Top-maſt, and 12 the thickneſſe, and 31 ½ the length of the fore Top-maſt, and 11 the thickneſſe, and 31 the length of the maine Top-ſaile, and Croſſieck yards, and 9, the thickneſſe of the maine Top-ſaile yard, and 6 ½ the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Croſſieck yard, and 27 the length of the fore Top-ſaile yard, and 7 ½ the thickneſſe, and 23 ½ the length of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon Top-maſt, and 6 ½ the thickneſſe, and 18 ½ the length of the maine Topgallant maſt and 6 the thickneſſe, and 17 ½ the length of the mizon Top-ſaile yard, and 4 ¼ the thickneſſe, and 17 the length of the fore Top-gallant maſt, and 5 the thickneſſe, and 16 the length of the main Top-gallant yard, and 5 the thickneſſe, and 14 ½ the length of the fore Top-gallant yard, and 4 ¼ the thickneſſe, and 14 ½ the length of the Spritſaile Top-maſt, and 4 ¼ the thickneſſe, and 12 the length of the Spritſaile Top-ſaile yard, and 3 ½ the thicknes: By this meanes we have performed the finding the lengthes and the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all the maſtes and yardes belonging to our ſuppoſed ſhip of 63 foote by the kéele, 25 foote by the beame, and 11

foote déepe in hold, with wonderfull eaſe and ſpéed, very exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and now we will goe forwards, firſt to finde the ſizes of our Rigging: ſecondly, to find the quantitie of Rope of each ſize that will ſerve our turne to rigge the ſhip compleatly: and thirdly, to find the length of each Rope, that we ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make uſe of in Rigging: all which ſhall be performed with as much eaſe and ſpéede as the former was for the maſtes and yardes, (number for number.) Héere note by the way, that wée could have given the lengths of all the maſtes and yardes by proportions from the length of the maine maſt, and ſo from one to another, but becauſe our way that we have propounded is far more eaſie and ſpeedy in performance, I rather make uſe of it, then of the other way.</p>
               <p>Now firſt for the ſizes of our Rigging wee are to conſider that it is but a lineall proportion betweene the Diameter of the maine maſt in our Table, and the Diameter of the maſt found, which proportion is, being abbreviated, as 7 to 6. ſo is one inch one tenth part the ſmalleſt Cordidge in our Table, to nine tenths of one inch our ſmalleſt Cordidge for out ſuppoſed ſhip of 6<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for the ſmalleſt Cordidge of one inch, and one tenth part, take the diſtance over betwéene 11 and 11. which meaſured from the center will end in 9. and more almoſt one halfe, which is 9 tenths of one inch, &amp; then put it over in 13 and 13. for our ſecond ſize Cordidg of one inch and 1/10 in our Table, which meaſured from the center will end in 11. which is one inch, and one tenth part for our ſecond ſize, for our ſuppoſed ſhip, and ſo procéeding on in the ſame manner for all the reſt of our ſizes, taking for one inch, and 1/10 parts 18 and for two inches and 1/10 parts 22. and for 2 inches <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to 150. how then ſhall we do if we were to fit a ſhip, whoſe ſize of Cordidge would goe beyond the end of our ſcale? To which I anſwer, it may be done thrée wayes: firſt, it may be done by the Rule of Thrée in numbers, or elſe, ſecondly, (which is more pertinent to our way of performing) by the ſcale, which is thus, I have a Ship to be Rigged, the thickneſſe of whoſe Maine-maſt at the partners is 35 inches, I demand the ſize of the maine ſtay, the ſize of the maine ſtay in our Tables is but 14 inches, this that we ſeeke for muſt be more, the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwéene the thickneſſe of the Maſts is as 18 to 35, which is as 4 to 5. In this caſe becauſe our ſcale goes but 150. wée take the diſtance over betwéene 70 and 70. which is halfe the ſize of our maine ſtay and meaſure it from the center, and it will end in 87 ½ that is halfe the circumference of the Maine ſtay required which being doubled is 175. that is 17 inches and one halfe, the circumference of the maine ſtay required.</p>
               <p>A third way by the ſcale, we may take the diſtance over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene 14 and 14, as the ſcale is numbred, which meaſured from the center, will end in 17 ½ the ſize of our maine ſtay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>

               <p>YOu are to take notice that theſe laſt Cords and Ropes are ſized and their lengths are proportioned according to our Ship that we have propounded of 75 foote by the Keele, for which our former Tables are made. Now it remaines that wee ſpeake ſomewhat of the ſizing of Cables.</p>
               <p>Your ſheat Cable is commonly ſo many halfe inches about as your ſhip is bredth in feete at the midſhip Beame.</p>
               <p>Now our propounded Ship to which our Tables are made is 29 ½ foote at the midſhip Beame, therefore the Sheate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble muſt be 15 inches about, and to finde the ſizes of the reſt of your Cables, you may do it by the weight of your Anchors in this manner.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe your ſheate Anchor be 15 hundred weight, and your Cable 12 inches, and you have another Anchor 9 hundred weight, you deſire the ſize of your Cable for it.</p>
               <p>For the anſwer to this and the like demands, I have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed two lines to be put downe on the ſide of the ſcale; the one of equall parts containing 385 parts, and the Tens and Fives drawne out, and it is numbred at every 50, thus, 50, 100, 150, &amp;c.

               <p>Firſt I take 9 upon the opening ſcale from the center, the weight of the ſecond Anchor, and put it over in 15, and 15, the weight of the firſt Anchor, and kéeping the ſcale ſo, I looke againſt 12 in the unequall parts, and in the equall parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it are 72. then I take the diſtance over upon the opening ſcale betwéene 72, and 72, and meaſure it from the center, and it ends in 43 ½ Laſtly, I looke 4<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Or otherwiſe the Cables may be proportioned from the burthen of the Ships in this manner.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe that a Ship of 300. Tun have a ſheate Cable of 15 inches about, what ſhall be the Circumference about of the

Here becauſe the greater number of Tuns is more then is upon our ſcale, wée take one quarter of 300. which is 75. and one quarter of 115 which is 29 néereſt, and the proportion is all one: ſo I take 29. from the center and put it over in 75, and 75, and ſo kéepe the ſcale. Next I looke againſt 15, in the unequall parts, and againſt it in the equall parts is 112 ½. then I take over the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwéene 1112 ½ and 112 ½ &amp; meaſure it from the center and it ends in 43 ½ then I looke againſt 43 ½ and in the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall parts, againſt it are 9 3/10 that is 9 3/10 inches, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about of a Sheate Cable for a ſhip of 115 Tunne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former ſuppoſition, and as it was found before; and ſo the ſizes of all the reſt of the Cables may be found from one ſhip to another after the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>It may be obiected that the ſtaies of the middle maſts may faile to hold in proportion according to the lengths of the midle maſts in all ſhips, becauſe the diſtance betwéene the maine maſt and the fore maſt may not be proportionable in all ſhips according to their lengths, wée ſuppoſe it to be ſo, yet our ſcale performes it exactly.</p>
