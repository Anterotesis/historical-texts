            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The prevention of Poverty:</hi> OR, A Diſcourſe of the Cauſes of the Decay of Trade, Fall of Lands, and Want of Money throughout the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with certain Expedients for remedying the ſame.</head>
            <p>SO general and loud, for diverſe years paſt, have been the complaints, for want of Trade and Money throughout this Nation; and ſo preſſing are the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of moſt men, that there is ſcarce any perſon can be inſenſible of it: And this is not only in time of War, (though then more eſpecially,) but alſo in time of <hi>Peace,</hi> when the Seas were open, and we might promiſe our ſelves the largeſt ſhare of Proſperity. Whence 'tis evident, that the Cauſes are not wholly Outward or Accidental, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Internal, and as it were in our own Bowels, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume us, and have reduced us to ſuch a low Ebb, that a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Poverty ſeems to have invaded the whole Nation, <hi>Leaſes being continually thrown up in the Countrey, and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men daily Breaking in the City.</hi> In brief, all conditions of men ſeem to have chang'd their ſtations, and ſunk below themſelves; the Gentry, by reaſon of the <hi>fall of their Lands,</hi> and <hi>uncertainty of Rents,</hi> being brought to live at the rate of a Yeoman; the Yeoman can ſcarce maintain himſelf ſo well as an ordinary Farmer heretofore; the Farmer is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to live as hard as a poor Labourer anciently; and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers generally, if they have Families, are ready to run a begging, the Poverty of moſt Pariſhes being ſuch, that they can hardly ſupply or relieve them.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61601:5"/>
            <p>The conſideration whereof, and that no man is born for himſelf, but ought to do what in him lies to promote the publick Good, and general Welfare of his Countrey, has invited me (though uncapable, and not ſufficiently qualified to do any conſiderable Service, yet however) to teſtifie my well-wiſhes, and throw in my mite into the publick Treaſury, by endeavouring ſome Expedients for raiſing the Trade of the Nation, and advancing the temporal proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all its Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>In order whereunto I firſt applied my ſelf to find out the Cauſes of ſuch National <hi>Poverty,</hi> which like an <hi>armed</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath threatned to <hi>invade</hi> the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to diſcover a Remedy, if poſſible, that might not only ſubdue this potent Adverſary, but alſo introduce and maintain a conſtant ſtock of Trade and plenty of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ſo conſequently Riches and Honour both to King and Kingdom, and Proſperity to all Eſtates whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I do humbly conceive, that the General Cauſes of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty (unleſs it be <hi>purpoſed</hi> by the Lord by reaſon of <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>) are</p>
            <p>Firſt the daily <hi>Decreaſe</hi> of Goods and Commodities of our own Growth fit for Exportation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>double Increaſe</hi> of <hi>Forreign</hi> coſtly Goods and Commodities, brought over <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, <hi>viz.</hi> Iron, Timber, Brandy, French-wines, Linnen-Cloth, and other <hi>French</hi> Commodities: and alſo Mum, Coffee, Chocolet, Salt, &amp; Salt-petre, with many more. All which Expenſive Commodities have been brought into General Uſe, and Imported in this Nation, within the ſpace of Forty years laſt paſt, or little more, (Linnen-Cloth and Wine only excepted.)</p>
            <p>The value of theſe Commodities Imported cannot but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a vaſt Summe, we may modeſtly (though at ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) gueſs it Twenty or Thirty Hundred Thouſand Pounds
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61601:5"/>
every year; which mighty Sums of Money, thirty or forty years ago, were for the greateſt part kept at home.</p>
            <p>Now eaſily obſervable it is, that ever ſince ſuch <hi>prodigious Increaſe</hi> of new Imported Goods, our own moſt great and richeſt Manufactories have <hi>decreaſed,</hi> and the Manufactors become <hi>impoveriſhed,</hi> eſpecially in thoſe of Woollen Cloth and Iron; and foraſmuch as no Commodities <hi>anſwerable</hi> have been raiſed in their ſtead, equally to ballance what we have therein loſt of our own Growth and Production.</p>
            <p>It remains then, that of <hi>neceſſity</hi> thoſe <hi>vaſt Sums of Money</hi> aforeſaid, muſt every year go out of the Nation to make the Ballance of Trade even, and this for the greateſt part in ready Coin, as may, I conceive evidently be demonſtrated. Thus, if Money were not tranſported, then our own Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories, which are much diminiſhed, and become far leſs than what they were thirty or forty years ago, would now find quick Markets, and yeild good Prizes, to the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Manufactors; but the <hi>contrary is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:</hi> wherefore I conclude, that according to the preſent courſe. Money every year muſt <hi>unavoidably</hi> decreaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, to the great impoveriſhing of the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be alledged, that I miſtake the Cauſe of this National Conſumption, and that the great Taxes and many Impoſitions laid upon the Nation, obliging us to part with ſo much Money for his Majeſties uſes, ought to be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the grand Cauſe of this great ſcarcity of Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> I humbly Anſwer, that this cannot be the Cauſe for this Reaſon becauſe what Moneys are given by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the Nation to his Majeſty, are but like the Moiſtures drawn up by the Beams of the Sun from the Earth, which ſoon return down again in ſhowers to refreſh the Ground, or like the Blood in its Circulation; for what is carried out of the Countrey goes but into the City, and is there expended again; and foraſmuch as it <hi>goes not beyond</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61601:6"/>
               <hi>the Seas,</hi> ſoon returns again. So that in the <hi>Nation there is not one Groat the leſs</hi> to be beſtowed on what the Farmer, or any others have to ſpare: wherefore, and for that the Publick Coffers do not hoard or keep up any extraordinary Sums, I humbly hope I may conclude, That this is not the <hi>proper</hi> Cauſe. why the Nation is ſo empty of Money, and that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral want of this neceſſary thing (which beneath Grace, and Glory, and what is conducing thereunto) is moſt to be deſired.</p>
            <p>But doubtleſs it is the many <hi>Hundred thouſnd Pounds,</hi> which our <hi>bad Husbandry</hi> and <hi>ill Conduct</hi> ſends every year <hi>beyond the Seas,</hi> which we ſee again no more , this is the <hi>grand Cauſe</hi> of our <hi>Miſeries,</hi> waſting thus our nobleſt ſpirits, that hath brought the Body Politick into this pining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and makes us ſo loudly complain of bad Trade and empty Pockets, and that the Nation is become thus indigent and diſcontented. But alas! what advantage is it only to complain? Diſeaſes are not cured with Out-cries, but rather increaſed; let us then wipe our Eyes, and make uſe of our Heads and our Hands to get out of this quagmire of Neceſſity, wherein we are unhappily plunged.</p>
            <p>Too true it is, that we are very poor, and, as I conceive, 'tis no leſs plain, that the reaſon of it is the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every year with vaſt Sums of Money, to make the Ballance of Trade even, becauſe we Import much more than we Export, and therefore I humbly apprehend the beſt means to prevent this <hi>growing Evil,</hi> muſt be</p>
            <p>Firſt, to raiſe new Manufactures, whereby to improve what doth or may ariſe of our own <hi>Engliſh</hi> Growth: by which means our Lands may ſome <hi>other</hi> way be imployed, beſides that of Corn and Cattle.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, to ſhut the door of Importation againſt thoſe new imported Goods, <hi>eſpecially</hi> ſuch as are ſuperfluous and injurious to the <hi>well-being</hi> of the Kingdom.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61601:6"/>
            <p>Thus the firſt Manufacture to be prohibited that may be made of our own Growth, and moſt advantageous to the general Good and Profit of perfons of all Eſtates, is <hi>Linnen Cloth:</hi> for it is moſt certain, that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ground will produce Hemp and Flax in ſuch abundance, as may make Linnen-Cloth ſuſicient for all occaſions; whence feverall great Conveniences, of much advantage to the Publick will ariſe. As</p>
            <p>Firſt, it will improve the Lands, which are proper for Hemp and Flax, to that degree, that what before was worth but twenty ſhillings <hi>per</hi> Acre for Corn or Paſture, by this means will be worth forty or fifty ſillings the. Acre <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, great numbers of poor Families, who have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to do from the beginning of the Year to the end there of, unleſs ſome few of them in the Countrey, in time of Harveſt, might hereby moſt profitably be ſet to work conſtantly, by raiſing a continual ſtock of Imployment, not only for Men, but alfo Women, Boyes, &amp; Girles, that can do little thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it; whereas for want thereof moſt of them now are trained up in Idleneſs, and live by the labours of others, whoſe number by computation, after the rate of threeſcore in each Pariſh throughout the Kingdom, doth amount unto five Hundred and Eighty Thouſand people, and upwards. Thirdly, by this means every Pariſh, which by reaſon of Poverty is not able to ſet up a Manufactory for the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Poor, in making of Wolen Cloth, according to the Statute in that caſe made and provided , may eaſily provide Imployment for them in making of Linnen, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many thouſands that now wholly rely on the Pariſh wherein they live for maintenance, might very well ſupport themſelves.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, ſome thouſands of wandring perſons that go from door to door, to the great diſhonour &amp; diſadvantage of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61601:7"/>
the Nation, might by this means become Inſtruments for the enriching of the ſame. And though there be very whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Laws in being for preventing this intolerable Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of Vagrants, yet Officers are generally too remiſs, and to avoid trouble, or the imputation of being over-buſie, and the ill effects thereon depending, ſeldom put the ſame in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. For this to my knowledge is true, that ſeveral Officers, who willingly would do their Office, and put the Laws in Execution, have told me, that the number of them were ſo great, and dangerous, that they were afraid that their Houſes and Barns might be ſet on fire, whilſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were aſleep, or that ſome perſonal miſchief ſhould be done them. And indeed no ſmall cauſe there is for theſe Jealouſies, their confidence is ſo very great: for no longer ago than the laſt Aſſizes, holden for the County of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> ſo impudent they were, as to appear in the very face of the Court, inſomuch as to ſtand in the ſight of the Lord <hi>Twiſden,</hi> one of his Majeſties Juſtices of <hi>Niſi prius</hi> for that Circuit, whilſt he was giving his Charge; and although upon this occaſion his Lordſhip ſufficiently and loudly preſt for the putting the Laws in execution with ſeverity againſt them, yet notwithſtanding the Town was ſtill haunted by numbers of them, all the time the Aſſizes laſted. For remedy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it might poſſibly be convenient to propoſe a ſufficient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Reward to be paid every ſuch poor perſon or perſons, that ſhall ſeize any ſuch Vagrants, by the Overſeers of the poor of that Pariſh where they are taken, and that a ſevere Penalty be impoſed on Conſtables, and other Officers neglecting their duties, when any perſons ſo apprehended are brought to them; by which means thoſe many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, which are idle, may be imployed to their; own good, and the Nations advantage, ſo that in ſix Months time, there might not be a Beggar in the Kingdom, if ſuch Enconrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were given.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61601:7"/>
            <p>Laſtly, beſides all theſe Advantages, ſeveral hundred thouſand Pounds, which are now expended and ſent out of the Nation for <hi>Linnen,</hi> might hereby be kept at Home, or better Improved, to the great advantage of His Majeſties Subjects. Beſides, a farther advantage by this planting of Hemp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will accrue towards making of Sails, Cables, and other Cordage neceſſary for Shipping, of which ſufficient may be made at home, without being beholden to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for a Commodity ſo important for Navigation, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with our Money to Strangers for it, as we uſually do to a very great yearly value.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If any alledge, that this planting of Hemp and Flax, imploying a great part of the beſt Lands, will create an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, by cauſing both Corn and Cattel to be leſs plenty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, that I apprehend no grounds for ſuch fear. For as for Corn, great quantities of rich Lands being broken up to be planted with Flax, may after Flax be moſt properly ſown with Corn, and that to great advantage; ſo that on the contrary , Corn will be hereby the more plenty. Then as for the decreaſe of Cattle, it is eaſily cured; for Land, kind for Corn, when by long ſowing 'tis impoveriſhed, ſo that 'twill bear Corn no longer, may be ſown with Trefoil, or Clover, and then one Acre ſhall produce as much Hay or paſture as two or three Acres did before; and as ſoon as that is decayed, the Land will bear Corn more kindly than before (provided it be plowed up before the Couch-graſs gets in it;) for Clover and Trefoil, I know by Experience, prepares the Ground for Wheat, as much as a good Crop of Tares or <hi>French</hi>-wheat, otherwiſe called <hi>Buck-wheat,</hi> can do. Beſides, if Cattel ſhould fail, the remedy is eaſie and cheap; for when the King and Parliament pleaſe, <hi>Ireland</hi> is ready, and will be glad to ſupply us ſpeedily.</p>
            <p>A ſecond thing to be prohibited coming over, is the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61601:8"/>
               <hi>growing trade</hi> of that <hi>outlandiſh, robbing,</hi> and (by reaſon of its abuſe) <hi>Mankilling-Liquor,</hi> called BRANDY, which will promote the Conſumption of our own Commodities, as Beer, and Ale; or if ſuch a Liquor be thought neceſſary for Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or the like, then to raiſe ſome Commodity of the like nature and ſtrength at home: for (as I am credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by perſons well experienced that way) as good and as ſtrong Liquor may be made with what doth abound at home. Which if ſo, the Profit will not be inconſiderable, ſince Three hundred thouſand Pounds, that Brandy now coſts us every year, will be kept at home.</p>
            <p>A Third thing to be prohibited, may be <hi>Bay-salt</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas: for it is well known, that Salt for all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and as good for all intents and purpoſes, may be made at home; and that not only to the great Improvement of much Land on the Sea-Coaſt, which now lyeth waſt, and is of no profit either to King or Subject; but will alſo preſerve in the Nation Fifty thouſand Pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to the great enriching of the Kingdom, and may be done with very much eaſe, and as little difficulty.</p>
            <p>A Fourth commodity to be prohibited may be <hi>Salt-petre,</hi> of which we might make and raiſe in our Nation ſufficient for all occaſions.</p>
            <p>A Fifth Improvement, which I conceive may be made, is in <hi>Iron,</hi> which moſt certainly might, as well now as heretofore, be raiſed at home, the benefit whereof would be very great; becauſe ſome Hundred thouſand Pounds might hereby eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year be ſaved, or otherwiſe improved, (and many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of His Majeſties Subjects imployed) which now is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in that Commodity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But if it be ſuppoſed, that ſuch Iron works would too much conſume our Woods, I muſt ſo far beg leave to think otherwiſe; that I conceive, and many well skill'd in thoſe works, are of opinion, That the neglect of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61601:8"/>
Iron-work has been a main Cauſe, that our Woods are ſo much decayed, and ſo many Coppices grubb'd up, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Tillage. For when Iron-works were carried on, both Wood and Coals would yeild ready Moneys, which incouraged the Owners not only to preſerve the Coppices and Woods from deſtruction, but alſo to plant and promote more; whereas now without doubt in a few years, our Oak-Timber (deſervedly accounted the beſt in the world, and a great ſtrength and ornament to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) will be ſo far deſtroyed, that little will be to be had; and the reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>only Nurſe</hi> that maketh the Oak, and other Timber to flouriſh, is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-woods,</hi> and where <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-woods are not,</hi> there cannot (or very rarely is) any good Timber; ſo that although great quantities of Wood may be conſumed by Iron-works, yet Woods becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby more carefully preſerved, they grow again, and conſequently there is no leſs plenty, but for want of Iron-works they are deſtroyed, both Wood and Timber, Root and Branch, and that more and more every year.</p>
            <p>And this the rather, and more to the deſtruction of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe people in diverſe Countries have got a miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Trick, to elude and avoid that wholſom Statute, whereby it is Enacted, That on every Fall of Under-woods they ſhould leave ſo many Standels, Tellows, or young Trees to grow for Timber; which indeed they will do, but then at the next Fall of the ſame Wood, <hi>viz.</hi> about nine or ten years after, they will cut thoſe very Standels or Tellows leſt before, (ſo that they never become Timber) and then they leave new ones, and this ſucceſſively, whereby the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Statute is unworthily defeated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But if it be objected, that Iron ſufficient for the whole Nation cannot be made, except much Land be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from Arable and Paſture to Woods, which will cauſe Depopulation and Dearth.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61601:9"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> I Anſwer, that there are Woods ſufficient in the Nation already growing to compaſs the work, without plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any more, (provided they were improved, and not needleſly conſumed otherwiſe, as they are now in too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places.) Beſides, it would encourage the planting of Woods in places, which are now otherwiſe of little or no uſe. And doubtleſs it might be convenient and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the whole Kingdom, if all the Inhabitants, who live within ſome few Miles of the Sea and navigable Rivers, were prohibited burning of Wood for any general uſe, as Kitching-Service, brewing of Beer, or the like, whereby many hundred thouſand Loads of Wood would be ſpared every Year, and that to the great advantage of the Nation for the uſe aforeſaid. Nor will ſuch Inhabitants have any juſt cauſe to complain, ſince they might be ſupplied with Sea-Coal upon cheaper terms, and thoſe veſſels which bring Sea-Coal, may in many places carry away their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal to places of uſe for ſuch Iron-works, and ſo Boats, Ships, and Seamen, will be increaſed and imployed, to the great advantage and ſafety of the Kingdom, and the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will abound with this neceſſary Commodity of Iron, which now coſts us at leaſt five hundred thouſand Pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> whereas otherwiſe for want of Iron and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, we ſhall in ſhort time be reduced to ſuch a kind of condition, as the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> truckling under <hi>Philiſtin</hi> ſlavery,<note place="margin">Sam, 13 o.</note> were in; they were forced to go into another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſharpen every man his Share, his Coulter, and his Axe, only with this difference, They had Iron but no Smiths, by reaſon of the oppreſſion of an Enemy, we have Smiths and Carpenters enough, yet ſhall have no Iron, and but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Timber, by reaſon of our own fatal ill Husbandry; ſo that for want of Iron and Timber, our Shipping will be dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer continually, and we beholding to others for materials, athing of very pernicious conſequence. I well remember,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61601:9"/>
I have ſomewhere read in Hiſtory, that <hi>Edgar</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did take greater delight in his Shipping, than any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation whatſoever. And no ſmall reaſon had he ſo to do, conſidering of what ſtrength, wealth, and ſafety the ſame is to any Nation, much more to an Iſland as ours is; and therefore once every year he would ſail round his Kingdom with a Navy of ſtout Ships, conſiſting of four thouſand Sail, which (ſaith the Hiſtorian) we find upon Record.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But I ſuppoſe here may ariſe an Objection againſt the Trade of Iron and Linnen Cloth both together, <hi>viz.</hi> both theſe Commodities may be bought cheaper from a broad, than we can make them at home; and doubtleſs 'tis the beſt Husbandry to buy all Commodities where they may be had moſt cheap.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I humbly Anſwer, That although the Inhabitants of this Nation may have thoſe Commodities from beyond the Seas cheaper at preſent, than yet they can be bought being made at home; yet I conceive if we would induſtriouſly ſet upon it, it might in ſhort time be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And beſides it is much better Husbandry to give Twenty pounds for that of our own Growth, than but Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen for what comes from beyond the Seas; becauſe in the laſt caſe our Money is quite gone, and will return no more; in the firſt it ſtill remains, within the Nation, and will come again, and beſides imploys Thouſands of his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that otherwiſe be chargeable and burthenſome. And as by one Trade Money decreaſeth, ſo by the other Money will increaſe, when our Commodities are for Treaſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; and eaſier it is to part with twenty Pounds, when Money is plenty, than with Fifteen when money is ſcarce, as at preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But if it be farther objected, that I am all this while miſtaken, for that it is not Money, but Goods, that pays for all theſe Commodities, by means whereof we have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61601:10"/>
Trade for what we have to ſpare; but if this Trade be loſt, then our own Goods which we have to ſpare, will be of little worth, and ſo our Caſe becomes much worſe than now it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whereunto I humbly Anſwer, that I ſtill conceive otherwiſe, and that the Objection is under a miſtake; for what the Nation hath <hi>now to ſpare,</hi> and fit for Exportation, is <hi>much leſs</hi> than was forty or fifty years ago, as aforeſaid; and yet then, when <hi>none</hi> of theſe things, with many more, did come into the Kingdom, there was a <hi>better Trade</hi> by far than what is now; for Commodities then went for Commodities of greater worth, without parting with <hi>any Moneys,</hi> and in thoſe days our Commodities went farther from home, and inſtead of Brandy, Iron, and the like, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced far better returns: ſo that then, both Silver and Gold, not originally produced in <hi>England,</hi> was very <hi>plenty,</hi> but now our Moneys and Commodities are <hi>carried forth,</hi> and in concluſion turn to little or no account.</p>
            <p>And unleſs our Commodities for Exportation did <hi>increaſe</hi> anſwerable to the <hi>Increaſe</hi> of Commodities Imported, <hi>As it is most certainly true that they do not, then of neceſſity out goes</hi> MONEY, <hi>and in comes</hi> POVERTY; <hi>the truth whereof doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear hy ſad Experience. For all that our Goods and Money bring in is ſoon conſumed, and comes as it were to the Dunghill, whilst our Wealth becomes a prey to other Nations.</hi> Whereas if the door of Importation for thoſe unneceſſary and <hi>injurious</hi> Commodities were ſhut. Money would be prevented from going out, and people unavoidably would apply themſelves to the making them at home, whereby there would be a <hi>far better and quick Trade,</hi> and all people would have <hi>ſufficient Imployment</hi> to gain a comfortable <hi>Livelihood,</hi> and the ſaid Commodities in a little time become as good and as cheap of our own Manufacture, as now we have them from beyond the Seas, and the Importation of <hi>Bullion</hi> no way
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61601:10"/>
hindred, but greatly promoted hereby, and the Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof prevented, and conſequently Money much more plenty than ever it was.</p>
            <p>To theſe ſeveral Commodities, which I humbly conceive fit to be prohibited to be Imported, might be added Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which neceſſarily ſhould on greater Penalties be forbidden to be exported, and ſome better means uſed for that end than what hath yet been appointed. Such are <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Earth</hi> and <hi>Wool,</hi> the one of excellent uſe, the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very plentiful Commodity of this Kingdom, which to be converted into Cloth would imploy great numbers of our people, and bring in much wealth to the Nation; but by reaſon of the Exportation thereof privately from hence, or growth of Wool in other Nations, thoſe vaſt Advantages formerly ariſing hereby, are now greatly diminiſhed, others furniſhing thoſe Markets where formerly our Commodities found quick Trade and good Prizes. And ſince 'tis well known, that Woollen Cloth cannot be made without <hi>Fullers Earth,</hi> and that <hi>Fullers Earth</hi> is no where to be had but in our Nation; Then to prevent <hi>Fullers Earth</hi> from going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, muſt <hi>infallibly revive</hi> the former flouriſhing Trade of Woollen Cloth, without which many Nations can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt, and by which we may become very rich; which if ſo, what care ought not to be taken, to ſecure this one thing, ſo uſeful, that Silver Oar by way of Exchange is not to be accepted for it.</p>
            <p>We might likewiſe add the conveniency, though not of a total Prohibition, yet of ſome Reſtraint of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Importation of <hi>French Wines,</hi> for the incouragement of the Manufactories of this Kingdom, which abounds with Excellent Liquors, as Beer, Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the conſumption of which ought to be promoted, and forreign Drinks diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. Beſides, the want of French Wines might be eaſily ſupplied (in ſome meaſure by Wines made at home, for ſome
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61601:11"/>
Gentlemen have experienced it with very good ſucceſs, or however) by excellent Ciders, which being produced in our own Climate, may be more agreeable and wholſome for our bodies than thoſe forreign Liquors, eſpecially when adulterated. But I dare not launch out too far into this Ocean, for me thinks I ſee a <hi>powerful</hi> Objection ariſing, that like a Tempeſt ſeems to threaten no leſs than the <hi>Blaſting</hi> of all our Projects, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If Linnen-Cloth, Iron, Brandy, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be wholly prohibited from being Imported, His Majeſties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue ariſing out of the Cuſtoms will be much impaired and diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which moſt Important Objection I humbly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That having by the Expedients before mentioned ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a conſtant and ſure method of Trading, Commodities for Commodities, His Majeſties Revenue may for the future ſtand upon a firmer <hi>Baſis,</hi> and our own Commodities fit for Exportation being hereby increaſed, will doubtleſs bring home greater Returns than formerly in other Commodities, and thoſe of a richer nature, and ſuch as our Induſtry at home cannot ſupply us with. For inſtead of things before mentioned to be prohibited from being Imported, out of which Cuſtoms now ariſe, we may have <hi>Spices,</hi> and other <hi>Indian</hi> Commodities brought in, and afterwards again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from hence to other Nations; as is practiſed in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which thereby is become the common Spicery for the Northern Nations, and moſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> which way of Trade may, as 'tis conceived, ſupply His Majeſties Cuſtoms, ſo as in <hi>ſome meaſure</hi> to ballance the loſs in the Cuſtoms of Brandy, Linnen, Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially if that Ancient ſtaple Trade of this Nation, the Making and Exporting of Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Cloth, were but incouraged and promoted as in former Ages, and <hi>Fullers Earth</hi> ſecured, as poſſibly it may.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That ſince ſuch prohibition tends to the great
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61601:11"/>
Advantage of the whole Nation, and that His Majeſty in kindneſs to his People ſhall part with ſuch part of His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, His Subjects will be obliged not only in Duty but Gratitude to ſupply His Majeſty; and the wiſdom of their Repreſentatives may find out ſome other way by Taxes, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, or the like, to compenſate ſuch His Majeſties loſs, which now may with <hi>great advantage, and more eaſily and cheerfully be born and paid, ſeeing all people by this means only,</hi> may enjoy a <hi>quick Trade,</hi> and <hi>plenty of Money,</hi> nor may it be given upon a better conſideration.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if it were not too much a preſumption, I would willingly (though ſtill with all humble ſubmiſſion to thoſe in Authority, in whoſe power alone it lies to make the Alteration) propoſe a way and means more advantagious, which in my Apprehenſion, <hi>if it may be approv'd of by better Judgments,</hi> may ſerve conſiderably towards His Majeſties ſupply, and alſo be a means to raiſe and preſerve plenty of Money, and alſo tend much to the wealth and proſperity of the whole Nation, which is thus. If all His Majeſties Coin were called into the Tower, and Three-pence taken out of every Twelve-pence, and then new coined for a Shilling, then might His Majeſty have five Shillings out of every Pound: and ſo ſuppoſe that in the whole Nation there be Eightſcore hundred Thouſand Pounds, a fourth part being taken out of it, will amount to forty hundred thouſand Pounds, or four Millions of Money for His Majeſties uſe, charges of Coinage only deducted. And for as much as 9<hi rend="sup">d</hi> in Weight is made 12<hi rend="sup">d</hi> in Value, no Subject may complain that he is hereby a Penny the worſe.</p>
            <p>But if Threepence be thought too much, inſtead thereof ſuppoſe it but Three-Halfpence, there will ariſe for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties uſe thereby, two Millions of Money, Coinage dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>What Inconveniences may hereby ariſe I confeſs I cannot
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61601:12"/>
foreſee, but to me it ſeems that theſe Conveniences and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages will not fail to be the conſequents of it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It will enrich the whole Nation, ſince there will be neer a fourth part as much Money more than was before.</item>
               <item>2. After all Money's new Coin'd, it will invite perſons, who have ſtocks of Plate, to melt it down, and have it put into Coin.</item>
               <item>3. As it <hi>increaſes</hi> Money, ſo it will <hi>ſecure</hi> it from going <hi>beyond the Seas;</hi> for by its being made more in value, and leſs in weight, all Nations will ceaſe to rob us of it, as in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they have done of our <hi>Guinny</hi> Gold, which by reaſon of its being lighter than others keeps at home the better.</item>
               <item>4. Whereas before, His Majeſties Coin, being more in weight and leſs in value than that of His Neighbours, the <hi>profit thereby</hi> to be made, gave great incouragement to them to covet our Moneys and <hi>refuſe</hi> to take our Goods for their Commodities, thoſe very ill effects will now ceaſe.</item>
               <item>5. By this means thoſe very Merchants, who carried away Money from us, will now rather bring Money to us; becauſe that as before it was for their advantage to carry our Money, being heavieſt and leaſt in value, ſo now on the contrary it may be their advantage to bring their Money, being now the heavieſt, to us, where it may ſuffer the ſame Improvement.</item>
               <item>6. As by this means only, Money will <hi>increaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,</hi> ſo all Commodities that we have to ſpare, and fit for Tranſportation, will <hi>unavoidably find quicks and good Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, ſo as to incourage all people cheerfully to manage their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7. By means of this variation of Coin, a conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance will ariſe to His Majeſties Revenue; for if <hi>Bullion</hi> be brought into the Tower at the Rates as heretofore, then ſo much as Money is made leſs than formerly, ſo much profit and advantage will ariſe to the Crown.</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61601:12"/>
            <p>And now behold how <hi>happily</hi> would the Tide be turn'd, ſeeing our Moneys will hereby be <hi>ſecured</hi> within our own Borders? What abundance of Goods and Commodities now muſt the <hi>French</hi> take of us for their Wines, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were paid for with ready Money, and the like in many other caſes. So that whereas at preſent our Moneys go out to enrich others, and poverty like a deſtroying Torrent comes in upon us, now of neceſſity (our Coin being kept at home) <hi>out</hi> go all our ſuperfluous Goods and Commodities which we have to ſpare, and conſequently <hi>in</hi> comes a quick Trade, Wealth and Proſperity, like a <hi>refreſhing ſtream,</hi> ſpreading it ſelf all over the Nation, adding <hi>life, courage,</hi> and <hi>cheerfulneſs</hi> to its <hi>weary</hi> and greatly <hi>diſcouraged</hi> Inhabitants, who as yet lye <hi>groaning</hi> under the <hi>grievous</hi> Tyranny of that <hi>Intolerable Oppreſſor,</hi> every where known by the name of <hi>Poverty,</hi> whoſe power is now increaſing, and ſtoutly guarded and ſupported by that <hi>only growing</hi> Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> Beggars, and Vagrants, together with the <hi>daily increaſe</hi> of diſtreſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in each Pariſh; but by the means aforeſaid how ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might his Guards be forced, <hi>himſelf totally vanquiſh'd,</hi> and <hi>Proſperity, Wealth, and Honour flouriſhing in his ſtead.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſay ſome, the <hi>French</hi> are ſo Deviliſh wiſe, and politick, that they will keep their Wines from us, rather than part with them on that conſideration. They will not be pleaſed with toyes and fancies as we are with theirs; they <hi>muſt</hi> drink <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>no Beer, wear wooden Shooes rather than Leathern ones, and Leathern Jackets not Cloth,</hi> rather than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us their Wines to us to pleaſe and make us merry, <hi>unleſs it be for our ready Money,</hi> and conſequently we ſhall have no wines at all for Phyſical uſe and neceſſary occaſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I anſwer, that if this be true, I am very ſorry for it; for I fancy <hi>French</hi> Wines are good to cauſe Appetite, and help Digeſtion: but ſince Experience tells us, that <hi>Cider will do the ſame thing,</hi> and alſo that a Glaſs

of <hi>Sack</hi> is more Cordial and cheerful, and both may be had upon terms <hi>much more advantagious to the Nation,</hi> it would doubtleſs be as <hi>great Wiſdom</hi> for us to deal with them as they with us, (that is) to have no more Wines <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of them, than they have Goods of us to pay for them. And if they ſhall indeed keep their Wines <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from us, the <hi>worſt</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it is only this, that we ſhall thereby <hi>ſave</hi> at leaſt Ten hundred thouſand pounds (or one Million) of Money yearly, and yet have ſufficient for more than neceſſary uſe; for it is reaſonably ſuppoſed, and alſo affirmed, that the value of <hi>French</hi> Wines which are ſpent in this Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no leſs than Twenty hundred thouſand pounds <hi>per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But if not withſtanding all theſe <hi>Conveniences,</hi> (and the Exemplary practice of moſt neighbour Princes and States, who uſually raiſe their Coin when themſelves want it, and abate it again as they find greater plenty, and leſs oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,) it ſhall ſtill be objected, That making Money leſs than what it ought to be by our preſent ſtandard, will be diſhonourable to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I would <hi>humbly</hi> intreat that it may be conſidered, whether that National Policy, when it compaſſeth <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> be not more <hi>honourable</hi> than that which in ſelf may be <hi>brave,</hi> and only eſteemed <hi>honourable,</hi> but proves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed according to our preſent condition <hi>injurious to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wealth and proſperity in general?</hi> And whereas it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as an Honour, that the Coin of <hi>England</hi> is heavier than any in the world; would it not be a far greater diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if it ſhould be truly reported to be the <hi>pooreſt Kingdom of Europe,</hi> as by the conſequence it ſeems to be threatned? But now by this means His Majeſties Coin will continue in this Kingdom, to the great advantage of after-Generations. For ſuppoſing one of His Majeſties late Predeceſſors had done ſuch a thing in their times, would it not have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61601:13"/>
the preſent ſcarcity of Money? For although One of their Half Crowns had been worn as thin as a Shilling, and a Shilling as thin as a Sixpence, yet would it have paſſed as well as doth an Old Groat, which hath not ſo much Silver in it as a Two-pence, and yet continues Currant and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be objected, that by reaſon of this raiſing the value of our Coin, both our People at home, and Strangers trading hither, will raiſe all commodities proportionably.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I humbly Anſwer, that MONEY is <hi>principally</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the Conveniency of Traffique between perſons of the <hi>ſame Nation</hi> onely, and to them it is all one, ſince the ſame is made <hi>Currant</hi> by <hi>Authority,</hi> and the ſmall Piece to purchaſe as <hi>much</hi> as when it was greater: and as for <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> when they bring Commodities, though we ſometimes pay them with Money <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> yet it is not intended they ſhould carry it away, but beſtow it here on Commodities, which they may buy with the ſame at the Rates <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed,</hi> not with ſtanding this Variation of our Money, and ſo be no Loſers at all thereby, but onely in reſpect of the opportunities they have heretofore had of defrauding us, by carrying away our Money <hi>in ſpecie</hi> to their advantage, and our vaſt detriment as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If it ſhall be farther objected, That there is a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company to export Cold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in their courſe of Trade;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I humbly Anſwer, by referring it to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Authority, whether there be (at leaſt when our own Manufactures are incouraged and increaſed by the means aforeſaid) any ſuch ncceſſity at all. But if there ſhall, then its humbly propoſed that ſuch Gold and Silver may be Exported thither in Ingots, or the Maſs fitted for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and not in Coin, as hath been of late accuſtomed, which renders ready money ſcarce amongſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61601:14"/>But if after all this, there ſhould as many Inconveniences be found attending this <hi>Means</hi> as there are Advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing by it, which I think improbable, or that I ſhould be miſtaken in all or any the Propoſals before diſcourſed; yet ſhould I hope that my labour herein may not be wholly loſt: for ſince, as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſomewhere ſays, <hi>it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Commendations to make even Wiſhes that are not abſurd,</hi> I truſt my Endeavours may obtain a Pardon, though in all points it's poſſible they may not anſwer Expectation, being undertaken upon no other motive than an <hi>unfeigned deſire</hi> to <hi>ſerve</hi> His Majeſty, and the Nation wherein I live, and to <hi>promote</hi> the Honour and Proſperity of them both; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repining or envying at the glory of more happy diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, ſhall reſt ſatisfied, although this ſmall Eſſay of mine prove but like a Whetſtone, (which ſharpens other things, though blunt and dull it ſelf) ſtirring up the Induſtry of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Wits, and better Experienc'd Heads, to find out more plauſible, profitable, and feaſible Expedients.</p>
            <p>However, for a Concluſion of this brief Diſcourſe, give me leave to add a few words to take off the edge of one Objection that may yet poſſibly be levied, alledging,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> That Corn and Cattel are now got to a good price, by means of which we in the Country hope to pay our Landlord's Rent, and alſo be enabled to provide well for our Families; ſo that neither Landlord not Tenant may complain, and conſequently we ſhould do well enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of theſe Projects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I Anſwer, That what is now by this means gotten, is little better than pinched out of the bellies of the Poor; ſo that as the Landlords and Land-occupiers Proſperity increaſeth, in like manner the Poverty and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Poor increaſeth; and like the Scales of a Ballance, look how much the one is raiſed, the other is depreſſed. For ſuppoſe that at preſent all Corn, Cattel, and Clothing were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61601:14"/>
very cheap, by means of which the Landlord and Farmer are greatly impoveriſhed; yet might the Poor in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſay, What reaſon have we to complain? for we enjoy all things at eaſie rates to the full: and therefore the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Rich is envied by the Poor, and the Well-being of the Poor neglected and deſpiſed by the Rich, becauſe that what is in this caſe good for one is injurious to the other; but by the means aforeſaid, I would hope that the <hi>Proſperity</hi> of both may be equally promoted, and the <hi>Advantage</hi> of the one be to the <hi>comfortable Encouragement</hi> and <hi>well-being</hi> of the other, ſo that the <hi>Landlord,</hi> the <hi>Tenant,</hi> and all others may live happily and in love together.</p>
            <p>And oh how glad ſhould I be, if I might in an any wiſe be an Inſtrument to promote the future Honour, Safety, and Well being of the Land of my Nativity, and its Inhabitants! yet if my deſires therein ſhould be anſwered, let God have the Glory; and thoſe who are under him in Authority, that ſhall approve of the Means, and proſecute the ſame, receive the <hi>whole Praiſe and Honour;</hi> for to my ſelf Nothing is to be aſcribed, ſince I have done but what is my Duty, as I am a Subject enjoying my Chriſtian Liberty, and Civil Rights and Priviledges.</p>
