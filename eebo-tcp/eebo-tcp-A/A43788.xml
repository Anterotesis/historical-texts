            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> That after thirty years ſtudying the Scriptures, with the help of the moſt Judicious Expoſitors, yet he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood onely two or three Chapters of this Book; and hence was wont to ſay; That the Expoſitors were as difficult to be underſtood as the Text, there being many Comments that may be more properly termed Obſcurities, than Expoſitions, on the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Yet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49699:3"/>though ſome things are laid down myſtically in abſtruſe terms, to exerciſe the Judgment of the wiſeſt; yet others are more familiarly expreſſed, to ſuccour the infirmity of the weakeſt. Some indeed are ſuch Depths, wherein Elephants may ſwim; but there are others ſuch Shallows, wherein Lambs may wade. My Text is one of thoſe through which an ordinary Ingenuity may wade; neither are the words cloathed with thoſe difficulties which are originally incident to other places of this book.</p>
            <p>The preceding Chapter gives you a deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of that Mother of Fornications, the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as ſhe was repreſented to the Apoſtle in a Viſion.

            <p>The words need not much explication; and I love not to make Truths, plain in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, difficult by my obſcure handling of them. It was the unhappineſs of the School-men, to ravel and enſnarl the plaineſt truths of the Goſpel, with their nice diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and perplexed abſtruſe notions; (wherein, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> Orators, <hi>Multa loquuntur, ſed nihil dicunt;</hi>) which otherwiſe might be wound off by an ordinary Underſtanding. But what Explication they need, you ſhall have in this ſhort Paraphraſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Come out of her,] Exite ex illâ, mi popule.</hi> 'Tis not to be ſo much underſtood of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily departure, in regard of a cohabitation and Preſence, as of a ſpiritual ſeparation, in reſpect of Faith and Religion.

               <hi>My people] i.e.</hi> By ſingular care, reſpect, and affection; <hi>my people,</hi> by ſpecial favour and covenant; you that have owned my Name, profeſſed Religion in the power and purity of it, O go out of her; defile not your garments by <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Idolatries; for if you touch her, you will pollute your ſelves.</p>

            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Babylon</hi> of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> ſtanding on the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where was the confuſion of Languages, and where the <hi>Jews</hi> were in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity; which place is taxed in Scripture for Idolatry, and other Heaven-daring Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</item>

But of this, more anon.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>That ye be not partakers of her ſins.</hi>] Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract not her guilt; which you may do by contriving for her, complying with, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving at her Idolatries: Though you act not with them, yet if you like, love, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of her Villanies, 'tis enough to make you partakers with her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That you receive not of her plagues,] Ne in eâdem involvemini ruinâ,</hi> leſt you be invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ſame deſtruction. For there are three things in every ſin:
<list>
                  <item>(1.) There is <hi>actus, qui tranſit.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>(2.) <hi>Macula, quae manet.</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49699:5"/>And,</item>
                  <item>(3.) <hi>Poena, quae debetur.</hi> The act is tranſient, but yet reflects guilt, and guilt bindes over to puniſhment. And hence, in the Original, ſin and puniſhment have one and the ſame name; to note to us, that where ſin is in the Premiſes, there deſtruction will be in the Concluſion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>From the words thus explained, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult theſe four Doctrinal Concluſions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That Chriſtians muſt be very careful leſt they communicate with idolatrous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</item>
               <item>2. That thoſe perſons, of all others, who have owned and profeſſed the Name of God, aſſerted his Cauſe, and born teſtimony to his Truth, ſhould be moſt careful of defiling themſelves with idolatrous practices.</item>
               <item>3. That the Idolatry practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is a ſufficient ground for our ſeparation from her.</item>
               <item>4. That to partake of a peoples fin, is to be involved in that peoples ruine.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I ſhall wrap up all theſe in this one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:</p>
            <p>That it muſt be the great care of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49699:5"/>who would not run the hazard of their Eternal Salvation, to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to ſeparate themſelves from the Faith and Religion of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the proſecution whereof, I ſhall do theſe three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. I ſhall ſhew that <hi>Babylon</hi> here is meant of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. What defection this myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> hath made from her Primitive Purity and Integrity.</item>
               <item>3. The Grounds of our Separation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the impoſſibility of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt, that <hi>Babylon</hi> here is meant of <hi>Rome,</hi> is moſt excellently done to my hand, both by Ancient and Modern Writers: So that to ſay any thing after them, were but to light a Candle to the Sun when ſhe appears in her Meridian glory. If you do but caſt your eye on the former Chapter, you will finde enough, and I ſhall need no more to prove it. Then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Woman, that is, the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is ſaid to be a City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth; and this was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49699:6"/>onely the Roman Monarchy at that time, there being no other City in the world but this, that had ſuch a Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>And ſo it is expounded not onely by ſome Greek Authors, but by moſt Latine Writers; as <hi>Iraeneus, Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>

            <p n="2">II. In the ſeventh verſe, ſhe is ſaid to ſit <hi>on a beaſt having ſeven heads and ten horns;</hi> which ſeven heads be<note n="*" place="margin">Coelius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventinus, Exquilinus, Tarpeius, Capitoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Vimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis, Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus, Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinalis.</note> ſeven hills where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the woman ſitteth. Now 'tis well known not onely to learned Chriſtians, but to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themſelves, that <hi>Rome</hi> alone is a City builton ſeven hills.</p>
            <p>This is thought to be a very ſilly Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by that Renegado <hi>Sanders</hi> and others, by the ſeven hills to prove the See of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to be at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe the City is now gone from the Hills, and ſtandeth in the Plain of <hi>Campus Martius;</hi> and the Pope ſitteth on the other ſide of the River. To which it is well anſwered, That though the greateſt part of the City be not now on the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49699:7"/>ſeven Hills, and his Unholineſs his Palace of Pleaſure be on the other ſide the River, yet on theſe hills ſtand Churches,<note place="margin">

               </note> Abbeys, and Monaſteries, where the Papal Authority is put in execution; and there is never an one of thoſe hills whereon the preſent Religion of <hi>Rome</hi> is not practiſed. Being galled with this, they make two <hi>Romes; Rome</hi> Pagan, and <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſtian. The Whore ſpoken of, is, they ſay, Heatheniſh <hi>Rome,</hi> which was ruled by thoſe Monſters of mankind, <hi>Nero, Domitian, Calignla,</hi> &amp;c. who writ their Laws, and rouled their Garments in the bloud of Chriſtians: but the Chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi> is not here meant. Whereas 'tis obvious to every one that hath but common rational notions alive within him, whoſe Conſcience is not quite vitiated, and Minde putrified with noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Luſts, but muſt ſee, that the preſent <hi>Rome,</hi> in reſpect of State, Princely Dominion, and Cruelty in perſecuting the Saints of God, is all one with the Heatheniſh Empire; the See of the Biſhop being turned into the Court of the Emperour, and Shambles of the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</p>
            <p>To avoid this,<note place="margin">Chap. 17.6.11.8.</note> they farther ſay, That <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49699:7"/>is drunk with the bloud of the Saints and Martyrs, ſhed not in <hi>Rome,</hi> but in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the Lord was crucified; and the two Prophets being ſlain, lie there in the ſtreets.</p>
            <p>This is excellently anſwered by St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> who ſaith, That it is not meant of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> but of <hi>Rome;</hi> and Chriſt is ſaid to be crucified there, either,

                  <item>2. Becauſe Chriſt in his Members was, and is dayly there crucified, though locally in his own perſon he was crucified at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> But beſides the Authority of Scripture in this caſe, it were eaſie to adde, (in the third place,)</item>
                  <item>3. The favour and defence which this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition hath received from a multitude of Antient and Modern learned men.

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This brings me to the ſecond thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the great defection this Church hath made from her Primitive Purity and Integrity.</p>
            <p>The Spouſe is now become an Harlot, and the chaſt Virgin a Mother of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: her Apoſtacy is now as <hi>infamous</hi> as ever <hi>her Faith was glorious.</hi> Some things ſhe is confeſſed to hold right; as, a true God in three Perſons; true Scripture, though with additions; a true Chriſt, though mangled with foul and erroneous conſequences; true Baptiſm, though ſhamefully deformed with rotten Traditions: and if you compare <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſtian with <hi>Rome</hi> Roman, you will ſee her defection in theſe five grand inſtances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49699:8"/>
            <p n="1">1. In the unlimited Juriſdiction of the Triple-Crown. The Councils of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Conſtance</hi> decreed, that a general Council was of greater Authority than the Pope, and that he ought to be ſubject to it.</p>
            <p>The Council of <hi>Nice</hi> appointed him his bounds and limits; and the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> made the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with him in Authority and Juriſdiction. And <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf, who ſate in the Papal Chair, writes, That whoever ſtiles himſelf Univerſal Biſhop, or deſires to be called ſo, is the forerunner of Antichriſt; and many learned Papiſts believed this to be true. But ſince that time the caſe is much altered: for the Councils of <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the contrary; inſomuch that he whoſe Primitive ſtile was <hi>Servant of ſervants,</hi> doth now <hi>exalt himſelf above all that is called God.</hi> The beginning of this Supremacy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver other Biſhops, was in <hi>Boniface</hi> the third's time; who, with great ado, obtained of <hi>Phocas</hi> (a fit Maſter to prefer ſuch a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant) to be made Oecumenical Biſhop: Which Authority his Succeſſors have enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and now his Janizaries, the Jeſuits, tell
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49699:9"/>us he is that Statue in <hi>Daniel, which ſhall cruſh in pieces all the Kings and Kingdoms of the Earth.</hi> He may, as <hi>Boſius</hi> ſaith, depoſe Kings for juſt cauſes, and without any cauſe alſo. It belongs to him (ſaith <hi>Sunders</hi>) to pronounce Kings Hereticks, to declare their Subjects exempt from Allegiance, and that they ought to be depoſed, if they will not Blade it for Chriſt; that is, for the Popes Tyranny and Luſt. And this is not onely matter of their Faith, but Fact.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not onely in the Supremacy, but alſo in the Holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper; for at firſt the people received it under both kinds, for the ſpace of a thouſand years. And (ſaith <hi>Myraldus</hi>) <hi>The Roman Order comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Wine to be conſerated, that the People might fully communicate.</hi> And the antient Liturgies of their own Church do tell us, that <hi>the People received the Wine as well as the Bread.</hi> Nay, <hi>Cajetan</hi> (as eminent a Member as ever their Church boaſted of) confeſſeth, that the Cuſtom endured a long time in the Church, even until their ſo-much-admired Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> forbad it; and then the Romaniſts altered their minde.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49699:9"/>
            <p n="3">3. Her defection hath been moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in that monſtrous Tenet of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; a Doctrine lately brought in, and made matter of Faith by <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, within theſe four hundred years: before which time no man was obliged to believe it, but all men were left to their own liberties; whereas now 'tis accounted Hereſie to deny it, and worthy of Bonds, the Inquiſition, a Stake, and Hell.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the Worſhip of Images; for at firſt that Church admitted of no Image at all, <hi>either painted or carved; no not the Image of Chriſt himſelf</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eraſmus) to be ſet up in Churches:</hi> And when they began to be uſed, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf forbad any Worſhip to be given to them, as appears by <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Epiſtles to <hi>Severus.</hi> And <hi>Polydore</hi> (a great admirer of the Romiſh Church) confeſſeth, that <hi>all the Fathers condemned the Worſhip of Images, for fear of Idolatry:</hi> And when the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council brought them in for ornament, even then they denied them Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the great Article of Juſtification, the moſt eminent Pillars of their Church
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49699:10"/>having denied Juſtification by Works, (as <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and others) yet the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> varied from them, and thruſt in mans inherent Righteouſneſs as the formal cauſe of his Juſtification.</p>
            <p>Now a Church that hath made theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and hath introduced ſuch horrid Errours, ſhould be ſeparated from; <hi>Come out of her, my people:</hi> which leads me to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the various Cauſes of this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy; which may be referred either to,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Her Pride and Ambition. 'Tis well known what arrogance that Church became guilty of, when <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained <hi>de Inſolentia Cleri Romani.</hi> And <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> calls them Silk and Sattin Divines, to whoſe proud Spirits the poor and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible way of Chriſt could not comport. In that Aſſertion of theirs, how do they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol their Prieſthood! <hi>Creatura paruit Joſhuae, at Presbyteris Creator; Sol illi, at his Deus quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſcunque verba ſacra pronuntiat: The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obeyed</hi> Joſhua, <hi>but the Creator doth the Prieſts; the Sun yielded to him, but to theſe as often as they pronounce the words of Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth God yield.</hi> On this conceit it is,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49699:10"/>that they degrade all Temporal Princes (thoſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbratiles Dii</hi>) making them ſtand bare-foot at their great Biſhops gate, hold his Stirrup, yea their own Crowns at his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie; exempting all their Eccleſiaſtical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their Juriſdiction, and all the reſt from their Allegiance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fraud and Perfidiouſneſs the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts had fully learned, that <hi>Regnandi Cauſa,</hi> all Oaths were to be violated. How groſly were the Pope and his Adherents taken in forging ſome Canons of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> for their preheminent Dignity. And being conſcious of their own falſhood, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to deprave all Authors that might give in Evidence againſt them; outfacing all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Truths, and foiſting in <hi>Gibeoniſh</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of their own forging; and leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unattempted againſt Heaven or Earth, that might advance their Faction. Take a view of her carriage to thoſe that diffent from her. How hath ſhe abuſed all that oppoſed her! charging. <hi>Wickliffe</hi> with Blaſphemy, <hi>Luther</hi> to have had his Advice from the Devil. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Epiſcopal Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſecret Fruitfulneſs; our Biſhops
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49699:11"/>to have been conſecrated in Taverns; oun ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the Cruſt of the Sacramental Bread to Dogs: With a thouſand more of this nature, maliciouſly raiſed and defended againſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Conſcience, for the diſgrace of thoſe that diffent from them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Covetouſneſs: For if you look on all their Opinions about Indulgences, Private Maſſes, Auricular Confeſſion, you will find love to Money the cauſe of them all. Hence the humour of that Church was well hinted to us, in the anſwer of a<note n="*" place="margin">M. P. Nar.</note> Prieſt to his Friend, who asking him why he would not Abſolve a Penitent without a great ſum of Money, replyed, They get Heaven by us, and we muſt get Money by them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Neglect of Scripture: And this hath ſee open a flood-gate, whereby all the world was drowned in Errours: For take the Eyes out of the Body, the Sun out of the Firmament, the Compaſs from the Ship, and what can follow but darkneſs, blackneſs, and confuſion? Therefore they wiſh that there had never been Scripture; and ſay, <hi>That the Church could have done well enough with Traditions onely.</hi> They call the Bible that Book which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49699:11"/>hath made all the ſtirs in the world; and ſay, <hi>That all the Faith a man can have by it, is meerly humane, and no more.</hi> O! the great patience of God, that bears ſuch Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies from theſe Monſters of Men!</p>
            <p n="5">5. Nouriſhing of ſin: Of which this Church hath been guilty two ſeveral ways.
<list>
                  <item>(1.) By her common practice of encouraging thoſe who had been cenſured in the Eaſtern Churches for foul Miſcarriages, to appeal to her, and ſhe would Abſolve them; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe did inflict Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, they were in a great part Pecuniary, and meerly to the macerating of the Body, no ways to the ſaving of the Soul: which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned us to tell them, that <hi>peccata raduntur, non eradicantur,</hi> and Heathen-like they did <hi>vitia abſcondere, non abſcindere:</hi> by this Penance there was ſomething done about ſin, nothing done againſt ſin; it being like <hi>Sampſons</hi> Hair, cut off, yet becauſe the Roots remained, they ſprung up to their full ſtrength again.</item>
                  <item>2. By the ſuitableneſs of her Doctrine to the carnal and ſenſual part of man.</item>
               </list>
Particularly,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That Doctrine of extenuating original ſin, making motions to ſin unconſented to,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49699:12"/>no ſin at all: That a man hath power to keep the Commandments: That to love God, binds onely at ſome times: That actual inadvertency in holy Duties, doth not hinder the Fruit of them: That Prayers ſaid in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, though we do not underſtand them, are very acceptable unto God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. That Doctrine of advancing the pride of Nature; which tells her, that ſhe can merit her own Glory, without being much beholding to Gods Mercy; that ſhe can ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Royal Law, and ſo brave God in the face, as if ſhe needed no pardon from his hands. O how ſweet a Leſſon is this to fleſh and bloud, even enough to make her run mad of Self-conceit!</item>
               <item>3. That of commending Ignorance as the Mother of Devotion: And thus when they had taken away the Scriptures, they ſet up Pictures in their room. All their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is no other than a pack of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, meerly outward and ſenſible, adapted to the humour of their ignorant and ſenſual Votaries: for, <hi>homo eſt magis ſenſus quam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectus;</hi> to worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, can no more be underſtood by them, than an
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49699:12"/>Eye can ſee Spirit. How ridiculous are their ſuperſtitious Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>toms. Yet not to do what Fathers and Grandfathers have done, is to profane their Canonized duſt: And indeed, had not the Scripture foretold what an Eclipſe would be upon the whole Church we ſhould think it impoſſible that ſuch ridiculous things ſhould be taken up. Becauſe Chriſt is the Light, therefore they have Light at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: and becauſe Chriſt ſaid, We muſt be like little Children, therefore the Monks wear Cowls like childrens Swadling-clouts: And one Pope made a ſerious Motion in the Conclave, That he and his Cardinals might ride in a ſolemn day on Aſſes, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſts humility; but the Conclave thought that the Aſ too much rode the Pope already. And thus you have had the ſeveral Inſtances and Cauſes of <hi>Rome</hi> Defection from her Primitive Purity and Integrity. I now proceed to the third thing propoſed to be ſhewn, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is confeſſed to be antient, but not her Errours; neither do we in any thing differ from her, wherein ſhe hath not departed from her ſelf. Here conſider theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was never a Mother to our Church; and we never had ſuch dependance on her, as the Romaniſts pretend we had. Our Chriſtian Faith came not from the ſeven Hills, neither was it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, or Pope <hi>Gregory. Britain</hi> had a worthy Church,<note place="margin">Nicephorus. Euſebius. Eccleſiaſt. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> Iſaacſ. <hi>Chron.</hi>
               </note> before either of them look'd into the world built on the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles: And the account that Hiſtorians give of it, is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49699:13"/>thus; <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſtianity was propagated here immediately after the death of that Proto-Martyr St. <hi>Steven.</hi> Which appears by divers paſſages out of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian. Gildas</hi> the Hiſtorian of our own Nation (called <hi>Sapiens</hi>) affimeth, That in the time of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> (who died thirty ſeven years after Chriſt was crucified) this Iſland of <hi>Britain</hi> received the Faith.<note place="margin">Theodoret. Sophronius.</note> Some there are (and not improbably) who conjecture, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf preached the Goſpel here after his firſt Impriſonment at <hi>Rome;</hi> which was <hi>quinto Neronis.</hi> This is confirmed by a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Venantius Honorius,</hi> viz.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In what ſtate Chriſtianity ſtood after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, appears not in any footſtep of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,

                  </item>

            <p>What horrid Blaſphemy is this? Doth not God command us to conſult his Oracles? to apply our ſelves <hi>unto the Law, and to the Teſtimony?</hi> Iſa. 8.19, 20. and makes it a renunciation of our Allegiance to him, to go any where elſe for Counſel or Direction, than to the written Word. But we know wherein the inſufficiency of the Scripture lyes; they are ſufficient enough for God's ends, but not for the Pope's ends; they are able to furniſh every Chriſtian in the world with Wiſdom enough how he ſhould ſave his Soul, but they are not ſo uſeful to the Pope's triple Crown; this Armory furniſheth him with no Artillery to defend the Lordly Power and God-like Infallibility that he claims; and this is the only defect he charges them with. To ſupply which, the rabble-rout of Traditions is brought into the Church; this way their fine Wits, with the Devils help, have taken, that the Scripture may be declared as inſufficient, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>minima particula revelatae veritatis,</hi> (as one of them impudently writes;) and ſo it needs the patchery of their Traditions to make it perfect. Juſt as <hi>Andronicus</hi> ſerved
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49699:18"/>the Emperour <hi>Alexius,</hi> who gave out that he was weak, and inſufficient to govern alone, and ſo firſt got a joynt power with him, and at laſt an abſolute power over him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne him. And whether their Traditions have dealt better with the Scriptures, let the world judge; when Theſe go up, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures go down. That we may ſay to them as Chriſt ſaid to the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.6. You have made void the Commandments of God by your Traditions; you have unlorded (as the Septuagint renders it) and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted its authority in the minds of men, who leave Gods Word to hearken to your Traditions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider farther, that moſt parts of Popery are directly abſurd, and offer violence to common Senſe, and the very light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For who can rationally conceive, <hi>That it ſhould be the Popes right to Lord it over Scriptures, Fathers, Councils, Church, and all the World? What poſſibility is there, that the Kingdoms of the world ſhould be ſubject unto him? What probability, that Images ſhould be worſhipped? Our Works merit Heaven? That the body of Chriſt ſhould be in a thouſand places
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49699:19"/>at one time? That the Prieſt hath Judicial Power to forgive ſins? That the Saints in Heaven ſhould be Mediators for us to God?</hi> He that will but indifferently compare theſe, ſhall finde them manifeſtly repugnant not onely to the Principles of Religion, but offer violence to the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider farther, that in this Church the moſt horrid Cruelties are not onely tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and approved, but rewarded, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted meritorious. It teacheth Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to murder Kings, to undermine States, and to blow up Parliaments; it diſpenſeth with Murder, Inceſt, Sodomy, and all this accounted <hi>Licitum &amp; Solenne.</hi> From hence proceeds ſuch Conſpiracies againſt our King, ſuch Plots. againſt our Church and State; 'tis not Religion they ſtrive for, but Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and this they will have, or they will make all Proteſtant Nations their Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and ſwim to it through Oceans of Blood; and they will this way (if others fail) reduce the Conſciences of Subjects, and the Crowns and Scepters of Princes, to their Devotion. This brands them with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible Characters of the Miniſters of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49699:19"/>who being but Prieſts, and confined to their Books, having no other Commiſſion than <hi>to go and preach the Goſpel,</hi> ſhould thus creep into Thrones, filling the world with Anarchy and Confuſion; and thoſe whoſe Souls they ſhould win to God, by miniſtring the Word and Sacraments, their Bloud they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Devil, by ſtirring them up to Treaſon and Rebellion; perſwading them, that they ſhall be Canoniz'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> though they be hang'd at <hi>Tyburn;</hi> and be glorious Saints in Heaven, though they died great Rogues and Rebels on Earth.</p>
            <p>Theſe things duely conſidered in general, will tell you that there is hazard, not onely of Temporal Safety, but of Eternal Salvation, in our Communion with ſuch a Church: and therefore, <hi>Come out of her,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This will the better appear, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſecondly, and more particularly, this one Argument, drawn from the Religion it ſelf practiſed in that Church; And this I will conſider two ways.</p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As they have painted it, and thereby recommended it to the view of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant admirers. We read of ſtrange things of certain Painters, how admirably they caſt and ſhadowed their works; but the skilfulleſt Painters that ever were, are the Jeſuits and School-men, the workmen of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> not the famous <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> or antient <hi>Polignotus,</hi> or <hi>Phidias,</hi> did ever beſtow ſuch pains on their Images, as theſe have done on their Idol the Papacie: They have made choice of the moſt exquiſite devices that all the Hereſies in the world could afford, to put the ſame into their Religion. No Policy in <hi>Machiavel,</hi> no Sophiſtry in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or Eloquence in <hi>Tully,</hi> but they have contrived it into their Image: and, ſave Truth and Sincerity, there is nothing wanting.</p>
            <p>The Evangelical Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſets down a lively deſcription of this matter; whereby (deriding the folly of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) he fitly ſhews us the Idolatry of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the manner how the Idol-Religion thereof was framed and ſet on foot: For at the firſt (you ſee) it was but a rude Block, rough-hewn by bungling Workmen that were not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49699:20"/>their Crafts-maſters, till the Smith, Carpenter, and Painter came, every one in his place, and ſhewed his skill. This is ingeniouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by a very learned man of our own,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>W.</hi> in his Preface to the way of the true Church.</note> to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Canoniſts, like Black-ſmiths, blew with the Bellows of their Decrees, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and hammered it in the Coals of the Popes Conſtitutions. Theſe were <hi>Gratian,</hi> Pope <hi>John, Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Boniface,</hi> with their Apprentices that ſerved them; <hi>Hoſtienſis, Innocent, Panormitane,</hi> and others of that black and <hi>ſmutty</hi> Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Carpenters that took it in hand, were the Fryars and School-men: Theſe ſtretched their line of Method over it, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it with Diſtinctions where it was rough; and by their Logick and Philoſophy, brought it into better ſhape and form: Theſe were <hi>T. Aquinas, Scotus, Bonaventure, Alexander Hales,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Having thus gotten an handſome ſhape and faſhion, the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> poliſhed it over again, gave it Joynts to ſtand upon: The Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> altered the faſhion of it in ſome particular parts;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49699:21"/>for <hi>Senenſis</hi> and <hi>Cuſanus</hi> thought the head ſtood too high above the ſhoulders, and would have it bowed down a little lower. At laſt they brought it to <hi>Trent,</hi> to the hands of their beſt Workmen, who moulded it <hi>à capite ad calcem,</hi> and ſet it up again, when the worms had well-nigh conſumed it: Since which, came in the third ſort of Workmen, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Painters <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Jeſuits; and there is no colour which they have not tried, to render it beautiful. Some with Varniſh and Plaiſter, ſtop up the cracks; and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was happily born to do them this ſervice. Others, as <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Surius,</hi> caſt a ſhadow over it with other colours. <hi>Sextus Senenſis,</hi> and <hi>Poſſevine,</hi> brag of the Workmanſhip, flatter the Workmen, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol the Idol. And thus at laſt they have poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed their <hi>Idol, and ſet it before the Lord</hi>'s <hi>Ark:</hi> And by this means they have attracted the eyes and hearts of their deluded followers, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that all that worſhip not this Image, muſt into the fiery Furnace, and be offered as a Sacrifice to the fury of their <hi>Romiſh Moloch.</hi> Now that which they are ſo fond of in this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49699:21"/>Religion, is its ſuitableneſs to their ſenſual inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and affections; the greateſt part of which, eaſeth them from taking any pains in ſpiritual things. As for Example: They muſt ſerve God, but there be ways to diſpence and turn the Spiritual Service into a Corporal, which is much eaſier. Sinners muſt have Gods pardon, or they cannot be ſaved, but the diſpenſation hereof is committed, with the Keys, to Chriſts Vicar, who hath power to releaſe them by the Sacraments of the Altar and Penance. Hence the Pope hath mens Conſciences at his devotion; into which he ſlides, under the pretence of being St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor; then blindes their eyes, by taking away the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; and ſtops their ears, by perſwading them to hear none but himſelf: And hereby thouſands are betrayed into the hands of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ruine. This is the firſt thing ſhewn, <hi>viz.</hi> that part of their Religion as ſet forth with Romiſh Gloſſes and Varniſhes.</p>
            <p>I am next to ſhew it you in its native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, as ſtript naked of all adventitious Ornaments; and then you will eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be the moſt monſtrous and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, the moſt bloudy and blaſphemous Religion in the whole world.</p>

            <p>Can there be greater Superſtition, Magick, or Blaſphemy? and all this practiſed by the very Heads of that Church.

            <p n="2">2. A Religion that profeſſeth to be a Bawd to Sin, whilſt in practice it tolerates open Stews, and prefers Fornication, in ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, before honourable Matrimony; and gently blancheth over the breaches of the Commandments with the name of Venials, and favourable titles of Dimmution, daring to affirm, <hi>That venial ſins are no hindrance to a mans Integrity and Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A Religion that indeed deſerves not the name of Religion; the Ape and Mimick
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49699:23"/>of it; a very outſide of Chriſtianity; at beſt, a meer formality of Devotion: all whoſe Prayers, Faſtings, Pilgrimages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are no other than a going to Hell in more pomp and ſtate. For look into their Churches, there you will ſee idle Apiſhneſs in the moſt ſolemn works. The poor Laity in the mean while returning empty of all ſound Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and only full of confuſed intentions; yet are they taught to think this Sacrifice of Fools to be meritorious. From thence look into their houſes and cloſets, there you will ſee ſuch a trade of careleſs and lazie Holineſs, that there is but little difference between the Image and the Suppliant; Piety it ſelf being lulled aſleep with their heartleſs and ſleepy Veſpers. And if you ſtep a little farther, and caſt your eyes into the melancholy Cells of ſome auſtere, Recluſes, there you may finde, perhaps, an <hi>Hair-cloath, a Whip, an Hurdle,</hi> or the Rope about the waſte; But where in all this is true Mortification? A pious Proteſtant takes more pains with his Heart in a day than a ſuperſtitious Papiſt doth with his Skin in a year: the one indeed whips himſelf, but the other denies himſelf; the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49699:24"/>draws Bloud from his Fleſh, the other from his Luſts. And therefore if you look into the whole Courſe of the Roman Catholick life, you ſhall finde the Commandments of God profeſſedly broken, beſides the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary practice of Idolatry, and frequencie of Oaths: Men whoſe ſinful rebellions are ever and anon ſmoaking againſt Heaven, dare meet God in his loudeſt Thunder, and venture on Damnation in its moſt terrible form; ſo that God can no where diſplay the Enſignes of his Power, but theſe audacious wretches hang out their Flags of defiance.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to the ſecond thing, how blaſphemous a Religion this is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God and Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Of God: and that as (1.) it teacheth men to worſhip Stocks and Stones with the ſame honour that is due to their Creator. Hence they worſhip God under the Image of an Old man, Chriſt under the Image of a Lamb, the Holy Ghoſt under the reſemblance of a Dove. And <hi>Cajeran</hi> doth confeſs, <hi>That they draw the Images by the Trinity not onely to ſhew, but to adore and worſhip them.</hi> Now leſt this ſhould appear to her ſimple Clients
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49699:24"/>how palpably oppoſite it is to the ſecond Commandment, they have cunningly left it out, as a needleſs Illuſtration, in all their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſms, and Prayer-books of the Vulgar</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As it aſſerts the Prieſts Judicial Power in pardoning ſins, and abſolving ſinners, and openly allows and tolerates the buying of Pardons and Indulgences from them. So that now Purgatorie can have no rich men in it, but fools and friendleſs: Devils are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented here, yet men can command Devils, and Money can command men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As it advandeth Nature to a co-part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip with God in our Juſtification and Salvation, and idly puffs her up into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of her ability to keep more Laws than ever God made. And for this, requires no other Faith than may be ſound in the Devils themſelves, who beſides a confuſed appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, can aſſent unto the truth of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: And Popery requires no more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As it relies on the Infallibility of thoſe whom they grant to have been, and may be, monſtrous in their lives and diſpoſitions; moſt of their Popes having been the moſt monſtrous notorious wretches that ever the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49699:25"/>Earth groaned under; (O that it were rid of the burdend |) How many of theſe Heirs of St. <hi>Peter</hi> (if their own Records deceive us not) have by Bribes Whores, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, dimb'd into that Chair | yet for any to ſay, that thoſe men (who are confeſſed to have given their Souls to the Devil that they might be Popes) can erre, whilſt they are ſuch, is Hereſie worthy a Stake and Hell. Thus of its Blaſphemy, in reſpect of God.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In reſpect of Chriſt; and that theſe four ways.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In overthrowing the Perfection of Chriſts Humanity, while they give unto it ſo many Places at one time, and yet no Place, Fleſh, and no Fleſh, ſeveral Members without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, a ſubſtance without quantity, and other accidents or ſubſtance and accidents, that cannot be ſeen, felt, or perceived: So that they make their ſaviour either a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or Nothing.</item>
               <item>2. In overthrowing the Perfection of Chriſts Satisfaction; for if all be not paid, how hath Chriſt ſatisfied. If temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments in Hell be yet due, how is all paid? And if theſe be paid by us, how are they ſatisfied by Chriſt?</item>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49699:25"/>
               <item>3. In preſumptuouſly mangling Chriſts ſacred Inſtitution; by which they ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly rob his people of one half of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Proviſion, which he left as his laſt and deareſt Legacy to his Church: As if Chriſts Ordinance were ſuperfluous, or any ſhaveling Prieſt could be wiſer than his Redeemer.</item>
               <item>4. In impoſing heavier burdens than ever Chriſt deſigned. Hence the conſcience of their Proſelytes are overladen with infinite unneceſſary Traditions, far more than ever <hi>Moſes,</hi> commented on by the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbies;</hi> they impoſing them with no leſs Authority, and exacting them with far more Rigour, than any of the Royal Laws of their Maker. And this brings me to the third thing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, <hi>viz.</hi> As,</item>
            </list>
            <p n="3">III. It is a bloudy and cruel Religion to all that have, and do oppoſe her. Even ſince <hi>Cain</hi> ſet the Knife to <hi>Abet</hi>'s throat, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Veins have bled. <hi>Rome,</hi> was firſt of all founded in Bloud and ſtill endeavours to erect its ſelf by the ſame method of Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Deſignes, and Dragon-like Rage and Gruelty. This will clearly appear unto you, by taking a view of her, either in her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49699:26"/>or Practices. Firſt, her Principles, in theſe ſeven things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In aſſerting the Power of the Pope over all Temporal Princes and Kingdoms;</hi> for he (like his Father the Devil) will ſhew all the glory of a Kingdom, and give it to ſome Creature of his own, if he will fall down and worſhip him, They account it not onely lawful, but meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torlous, to murder a Proteſtant Prince (whom they call heretical) hereby to introduce a Popiſh Succeſſor, and advance the intereſt of their own Cauſe throughout the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That an Heretick, (for Hereſies ſake, and in point of Conſcience, though he troubles not the State) ought to be put to death.</hi> This alſo cauſeth the effuſion of much Bloud; and when the Pope hath anathematiz'd a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Perſon <hi>(nè brut a eſſent fulmine)</hi> they inflame Kings, and provoke them to deſtroy all with Fire and Fagot. And theſe we have ſadly found to be their <hi>Arguments both to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings and inform our Judgments in the Popiſh Religion.</hi> For, as one ingeniouſly obſerved, <hi>They convince by a Dagger, and enlighten by a Faggot.</hi> Hence they call an <hi>utter Deſolation a Reſtauration
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49699:26"/>and the ſubverſion of three Kingdoms, no other than the converſion of them.</hi> How much Proteſtant Bloud this Doctrine hath ſhed in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and how many Engliſh throats have bled by this Knife, is not eaſie to judge.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That no publick Faith is to be kept with Hereticks;</hi> as if <hi>Chriſtiana Fides</hi> and <hi>Punica,</hi> were all <hi>one.</hi> The Heathens, by the Ruſh-candle of Nature, could perceive, that <hi>Truth in mens words and promiſes, is the beſt Ligament in a body politick; and the very joynts and nerves of all Civil Conſtitutions.</hi> How much admired is that <hi>Roman,</hi> who kept his Faith with <hi>Carthage,</hi> though he knew it would be his very ruine! But <hi>Johannes</hi> a Roman Prieſt could ſay, <hi>That in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the</hi> Lutherans, <hi>Judges were not bound to follow either Law, Promiſe, or Reaſon.</hi> How ſad is it, that <hi>Romana Fides</hi> might be depended on when <hi>Rome</hi> was Heatheniſh, but not now it is become Chriſtian | and that the moral Honeſty of the poor blinde Heathens, ſhould ſo much exceed the Piety of theſe Catholick Pretenders!</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That mental Reſervations and Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49699:27"/>are lawful.</hi> This muſt needs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Civil Conſtitutions, were they almoſt Adamantine: For what deluſions of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, what evaſions of righteous Judgments, what enſnaring of innocent men, what doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Oaths will there be by this means? How can an Oath be the end of Strife and Controverſie, if this be allowed? O ye holy Martyrs! lay aſide your glorious Robes of Immortality! You died like fools, and were guilty of your own Blood; whenas you might have denied and forſworn all, by men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Reſervations and Equivocations.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A fifth bloudy Poſition of theirs, is, <hi>An abſolute neceſſity of concealing all things revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Auricular Confeſſion.</hi> This Doctrine hath been a private back-way to let in the moſt horrible Conſpiracies and Murders. Hence 'tis a received Maxime amongſt them, That, <hi>Nullum lantum malum eſſe poteſt, cujus vitandi cauſa Confeſſionem prodere liceat: That Confeſſion is not to be revealed, whatever pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment be endured. Bellarmine</hi> praiſeth <hi>Garnet</hi> the Jeſuit, that would not reveal the Gunpowder-Treaſon, becauſe (as he ſaith) <hi>Confeſſion is Jure Divino;</hi> and <hi>Temporal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49699:27"/>Jure Humano.</hi> And <hi>Caſanbon</hi> tells us, <hi>That it was a Jeſuits Speech to him, De Jure humano, leviori damno Reges omnes quot-quot ſunt occiderentur, quam vel una Confeſſio revelaretur: That it was a far leſs Offence to deſtroy many Princes, than to reveal one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wonder whether they would hide it, if there were a Conſpiracy againſt the life of their Triple-crowned Monarch. But there was one that eſcaped well in this matter of Confeſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> Father <hi>Aubigney;</hi> who in the bloudy fact of <hi>Ravilliack</hi> being called in queſtion, and demanded what was revealed to him in Confeſſion, he replied, <hi>That God had given him this grace: That whatſoever was revealed to him in Confeſſion, he preſently by a miracle forgot it, and for all the world, could not remember it again.</hi> I think if this Anſwer ſaved him, it was the beſt Grace that ever God beſtowed on him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the Clergy are exempted from ſubjection, and ſo cannot be guilty of treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable practices. <hi>Clerici rebellio in Regem non eſt Crimen b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſae Majeſtatis, quia non eſt Subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Regi; The rebellion of a Prieſt againſt his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49699:28"/>Prince is not Treaſon, becauſe he is not his Subject: for they are by her affirmed to be ſo the Inheritance and Portion of God, that they are exampt from all Temporal Juriſdiction to Civil Princes and States.</hi> If ſo, what wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs may not be committed by ſuch men? How doth the Pope herein oppoſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers.</hi> And it is a known Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s, <hi>Every Soul, though he be a Monk, a Prieſt, though he be never ſo Spiritual</hi> (as they call it) <hi>is here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and cannot draw his ſhoulder from the yoak of Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>That blinde obedience unto Governours, is neceſſary.</hi> And let in this once upon a People, and you let in the <hi>Trojan Horſe,</hi> full of armed Enemies in his bowels: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Pope and his Officers ſhall command to be done (be it to deſtroy a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nay, ſubvert three Kingdoms at one time) muſt not be diſputed, but obeyed. Thus what <hi>Seneca</hi> complained of as a great weakneſs among the Vulgar, (that <hi>homines malunt credere quam judicare;</hi> and that they do receive all worſhip of their Gods, <hi>tanquam
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49699:28"/>legihus juſſum,</hi> rather than <hi>Diis gratum,</hi>) will be made a Vertue in their Votaries; yea, that they merit gloriouſly, by believing thus ſtupidly: and when once theſe <hi>Philiſtims</hi> have put out mens eyes, they will make them drudge in what Mills they pleaſe.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>That</hi> (that Monſter of men, and Heir of all Miſchief) <hi>the Pope, may diſpence with all Vows, Promiſes, and Obligations.</hi> Tis this that would lately have made <hi>England</hi> like <hi>Egypt,</hi> all the Waters thereof to be turned into Bloud: For the Papiſts being abſolved from all Oaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to their Prince, were thereby the more encouraged to Treaſon and Rebellion againſt him. And how can we truſt their Oaths and Proteſtations, when the Pope abſolves them from them? Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that Antichriſt ſet forth by the<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 12.</note> Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> who is both ſubtile and bloudy; and his Jeſuits like thoſe heathen Prieſts, that have Snakes in one hand, and Firebrands in the other. That whch St. <hi>Bern.</hi> ſaid of the Devil in tempting mens Souls, the ſame may we ſay of the Pope, in reference to Body and Soul, Eſtate and all: <hi>Vereor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis Serpentem gliſcentent, quam Leonem ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gientem:</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49699:29"/>That we fear him more, as he is a ſhining glittering Serpent, than as a roaring raging Lion.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>That to ſlay their Enemies, it is lawful to kill their Friends, if as much good will come by the one, as hurt by the other.</hi> This was propoſed as a Caſe of Conſcience to <hi>Garnet</hi> in the <hi>Gunpowder-Plot,</hi> (that Contrivance wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy onely of Hell and a Jeſuit) <hi>Whether it were lawful at that time to blow up the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent with the Nocent;</hi> who anſwered it in the Affirmative, <hi>That it was lawful to kill Friends in the deſtruction of Enemies, if ſo much good would ariſe as might recompence the ſlaughter of the Innocent.</hi> Somewhat like this, is that ſtory of a <hi>Popiſh Duke,</hi> | who when he was asked by his Souldiers, <hi>Whether they ſhould kill their Friends in the deſtruction of their Enemies,</hi> returned them this anſwer, <hi>Yes: Deus enim novit qui ejus ſunt: God will know well enough at the day of Judgment who are bis.</hi> How cruel and bloudy then muſt they needs be, who will kill their own, to deſtroy others lives, and at laſt will praiſe and defend thoſe who have dyed their bands in Bloud; voting inhumane Conſpirators, to have been glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49699:29"/>Martyrs? And thus, by what hath been ſaid, you ſee how all theſe Aſſertions are written in Blood.</p>
            <p>But if from the Root of thoſe Principles I ſhould acquaint you | with the Branches of its ſeveral bloudy practices, you would finde no corner of the world wherein the Pope and his Agents have had to do, but all hath ended in Bloud. Among many thouſand particular Inſtances, take theſe few.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and poor <hi>Albingenſes.</hi> Although we have no certainty of their Opinions, (they being for the moſt part delivered us by Popiſh Authors) yet of the Cruelty uſed againſt them, we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſad Witneſſes. It would make your hair ſtand upright with horrour, to conſider how many thouſands of them have been murdered in a day; and not content with their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood, they did wafte all the Trees and Foreſts, as if they had run into the wilde conceit of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who thought the Trees to have a rational life, and that to cut down a Tree, had been <hi>Homicidium,</hi> as they fancied.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the <hi>American</hi> Iſlands, as <hi>Hiſpaniola,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49699:30"/>Jamaica,</hi> and others, what barbarous uſages had the poor Savages from thoſe Catholick Chriſtians? ſuch actions (if Hiſtorians do not deceive us) as were not fit for Men or Chriſtians, but Bruits and Devils. For it had been better (as they obſerve) that thoſe Iſlands had been given to the Devils, than to the Spaniards, who ſpared neither Sex nor Age, Women with Childe, or ſuch as lay in Child-bed; inſomuch that that one Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> with that of <hi>Portico Rico,</hi> loſt in few years Sixty thouſand Souls by Popiſh Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and they were ſuch as not onely raged upon the Men, but deſtroyed Poſterity. The Women here and elſewhere, ſo abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating their ſad conditions, that they ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled their Children in the birth, to the end that they might not live to ſerve ſuch a cruel People.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In <hi>France.</hi> What an ocean of Bloud hath been ſhed there, ſometimes by open and hoſtile ways, otherwhiles by private Plots, Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, and Maſſacres! wherein Brother but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher'd Brother, Sons their Fathers, and Daughters their Mothers? As in the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Maſſacre, wherein one would think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49699:30"/>(as one obſerves) <hi>That a Race of People adoring one God, fellow-ſubjects to one Prince, born in one Country, breathing the ſame Air; nay, a Chriſtian People, truſiing in the ſame God, redeemed by the ſame Bloud, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſame holy Laws, ſhould prove ſuch Monſters each to other. Thuanus,</hi> Preſident of the Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> abhors the very memory of it, applying moſt appoſitely thoſe Verſes of the Poet to it, and crying out,
<q>
                  <l>Excidat illa dies, aevo nec Poſtera credant</l>
                  <l>Saecula, nos certè taceamus, &amp; obruta multa</l>
                  <l>Nocte legi propriae, Patiamur crimine gentis.</l>
               </q> Let that black day be razed out of our Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar for ever, that it may die with us, and never come to the knowledge of our Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In <hi>Ireland.</hi> Whoſe heart hath not been affected with the doleful Tragedies acted on that Stage? How have they cruelly devoured, and ſpared no more than Tygers and Wolves? O what a loud Cry has gone to Heaven from the Bloud ſpilt there! Every drop hath a voice, which cries aloud in the ears of God for Vengeance on them.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49699:31"/>
            <p n="5">5. In their Attempts on <hi>England</hi> ever ſince the Reformation. That at this very day, King and Kingdom, Liberty and Eſtate, Life and Religion, are deſigned for Sacrifices to Popiſh Cruelty. Think, O <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, O Prince of Darkneſs, a more helliſh deſigne, if thou canſt! What darkneſs would cover our Land, when our Sun and Moon (the great Ones of the State) ſhould be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Bloud? What would become of us, if theſe <hi>Philiſtims had taken our Ark?</hi> How ſoon would our Miniſters be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into corners, or ſent to Heaven <hi>in fiery Chariots?</hi> Our Bibles turned into Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, our Tables to Altars, and our Heaven immediately into a Hell? <hi>O innocent</hi> Cataline <hi>and</hi> Verres, <hi>to theſe men! Livie</hi> tells us of a deſigne to diſpatch the whole Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> in an hour; And at <hi>Carthage</hi> there was a Project ſet on foot to cut off at once the Nobleſt and Loyaleſt Families in the State. But had not this been abortive (which God grant it may ever be) it would have proved the Funeral of all our Sanctuaries, the Grave of all our Religion, the Dooms-day of all our Liberties, the Ruine of King
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49699:31"/>and Kingdom; a Treaſon made up of ſuch monſtrous complicated Circumſtances, that all others ſeemed to be drown'd and loſe their name in this. Thus much as to the Doctrinal part.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, may naturally be inferred,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The impoſſibility of Reconciliation to ſuch an Apoſtatiz'd Church. I know there are ſome who think that there is little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the two Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and undertake to ſhew us the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Advances the one hath made towards the other; and theſe are either,
<list>
                  <item>1. Some Politick Romaniſts, who hereby would extenuate the foulneſs of Popery; or,</item>
                  <item>2. Some ignorant and looſe Proteſtants, who live void of the knowledge and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Religion; men who live <hi>tanquam poeniterent non pecudes natos,</hi> as if they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they were not made Beaſts; whoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is their burden, and light of mind their offence; who are ſo given up to their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Appetites, as if they were all fleſh, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49699:32"/>had no Spirit; who rake up (thoſe heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sparks) their Souls in aſhes, never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their original capacity and end, or that <hi>Viaticum Aeternitatis,</hi> proviſion that is to be made for them unto Eternity. Theſe men are moulded for Heatheniſh as well as Popiſh Impreſſions.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But if we rightly conſider the Purity of our own Church, and the Apoſtacy and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> you will finde an impoſſibility of Reconciliation: For <hi>(rebus ſic ſtantibus)</hi> as the caſe is, that Church muſt put off it ſelf, and ceaſe to be what it is, ere it can begin to be once again what it was; for Subſtance, Credit, Fame, Vertue, and Honour have at once forſaken her, and by long diſuſe have left her worſe than naught. Neither can we ſee how theſe houſes can be repaired, but they muſt be pulled down to the very foundations, and then built from the ground: But if there be any poſſibility, it muſt come either from her ſelf or others; not from her ſelf, becauſe ſhe obſtinately defends her Errours not onely with Tongue and Pen, but with Fire and Sword, and will not yield ſo much as that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49699:32"/>ſhe can erre; refuſing to amend thoſe noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Abuſes which by the moderate Verdict of her elect Cardinals are condemned, and by the palpable Flatteries of her laſt and worſt Paraſites <hi>(the Jeſuits)</hi> is grown not onely ſecure, but more proud and arrogant than ever ſhe was. Can it be then from others? How oft hath this been endeavoured to no purpoſe? <hi>Rome</hi> may be ſacked and battered (as it hath often been) by Military Forces, but purged by Admonitions, Convictions, and Cenſures, it will never be. Now the impoſſibility of our Reconciliation (beſides theſe things I have already named) ariſeth from the pride and uſurpation of the Head of their Church, being armed with that Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That he cannot Erre.</hi> This, without hope of Reconciliation, divideth <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and many other Doctrinal Controverſies are ſubtilly kept on foot, to be a Stalking-horſe for this.</p>
            <p>Adde to this, their hatred againſt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion above all others: <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> are tolerated in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Synagogues, Services, yea, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion it ſelf adminiſtred to the dead as well
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49699:33"/>as to the living; by which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves to be better friends to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> than to the <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> not to inſiſt on that deteſtable Virulence of their Tongues, and Gall in their Ink, againſt our firſt Reformers; which hath not ſtayed there, but broken out into their moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Butcheries and cruel Bloud-ſheddings.</p>
            <p>They oblige the Conſciences of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks to a Separation from all our Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Aſſemblies, are afraid that any of our Books (eſpecially our Tranſlations of the Bible) ſhould be read in any of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; and where they cannot turn, will be ſure to burn Proteſtants. O the many miſerable Maſſacres, <hi>Canibal</hi>-like Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and tragical Murders, that they have been guilty of! Who are ignorant what Fierceneſs, Fears, and Fires were raiſed to conſume the innocent bodies of the Saints living and dead; and that in ſuch ſort, as every corner of the Land ſeemed as hot as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Furnace, even ſeven times hotter than it uſed to be; wherein were to be caſt whoſoever would not fall down and worſhip the Image which that Romiſh <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> had erected.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:49699:33"/>
            <p>Now what Arguments can be uſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us of their Reconciliation to us, either in the whole or in part of our Religion, ſince they deem it no other than a peccant humour neceſſary to be purged out every few years, either by Murder, if it prevail in the Head, or by Maſſacre, if in the Body of any Nation? And rather than it ſhould not, they will not ſtick with <hi>Blaſſius</hi> (at the Commandment of their great <hi>Gracchus</hi>) to ſet on fire the Capitol it ſelf, to lay hands on ſacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and to imbrue them in his Royal bloud; to ſubvert Religion, to ſacrifice our Lives, Liberties, and all, to their ambitious Luſts and Revenge. When then you are willing that your Souls ſhall be damned, and Bodies deſtroyed, then think of Reconciliation.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us now ſee our duty; which is, firſt, to hate and oppoſe the Popiſh, and to embrace and keep cloſe to the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Hate and oppoſe the Popiſh Religion. <hi>Let the high praiſes of God be in our mouths, and a two-edged ſword in our hands, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on that Scarlet Whore, that Mother of Fornications, that hath made her ſelf drunk
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49699:34"/>with the bloud of the Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus.</hi> They muſt be puniſhed by us, or we ſhall be ſo by them. Let's make no friendſhip with angry men, much leſs with bloody men: 'Tis the greateſt honour that can be put upon us, to be Inſtruments of their deſtruction. This duty reſpects us in whatever relations we are, be we either Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Miniſters, or private Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates, by repreſſing thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of our Faith, and encouraging Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Principles and Practices. 'Tis not Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State, but Ruine of State, to gratifie thoſe men who would rejoyce to ſee our Glory in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Miniſters, by preaching up the excellency of this way, <hi>preſerving the pattern of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words, and ſpeaking the things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſound Doctrine;</hi> to take heed of their own mixtures, and not adulterate the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith to <hi>pleaſe men.</hi> The beauty of heavenly Truths wants not the paint ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Humane or Heretical Additions. The Babes of Chriſt muſt be fed with ſincere Milk; and the ſoreneſs of mens eyes muſt not hinder the Lights of the Church from ſhining.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49699:34"/>And next by confuting <hi>Gain-ſayers,</hi> not onely have a voice to <hi>call their Sheep, but to drive away Wolves;</hi> one to eſtabliſh Truth, and another to oppoſe Errour; one of their hands muſt work, the other hold the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. Their breaſts ſhould be Store-houſes of Spiritual Armour, be furniſhed with skill in Scripture, in which they <hi>ſhould be mighty;</hi> and in the writings of men, even of Hereticks themſelves, to beat them with their own weapons, to kill <hi>Goliah with his own ſword.</hi> Are we in the lower Orb of private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? We muſt oppoſe this many-headed Monſter, and that,
<list>
                  <item>1. By confuting the debauched Romaniſts with the Language of our heavenly lives.</item>
                  <item>2. By an holy and ſtout confeſſion of the Faith: a dumb Faith is not a divine Faith, but the Faith of Devils; 'tis not enough to confeſs Chriſt in times of encouragement, but in times of contradiction. This is the onely boldneſs, and curſed be that modeſty which makes us aſhamed of our Maſter.</item>
                  <item>3. By ſuffering for it: if God calls us to it follow our Captain, <hi>who was made perfect by ſuffering;</hi> and ſeal Proteſtant Truths with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49699:35"/>our deareſt Blouds. He that ſaveth his Life, and forſaketh his Faith, never liveth comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably; yet thouſands that have loſt their Lives, and kept their Faith, have died joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they could welcome the Croſs of Chriſt, and Everlaſting Life.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this oppoſition we are to act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and valiantly: Dangers muſt be deſpiſed, Difficulties adventured on, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours contemned, vigorouſly and fervently, Zeal being the beauty of Chriſtian Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, unanimouſly, and with one conſent: For how eaſily will Errour prevail, when the Proteſtant Champions are divided among themſelves? And how can they venture their lives one for another in War, who will not do ſo much as love one another in Peace? Let's obſerve the Apoſtles counſel, and <hi>ſtand faſt in one ſpirit, with one minde, ſtriving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the faith of the Goſpel,</hi> Phil. 1.27. Can there be greater encouragements to this, than our preſent Fears and Dangers? And O that now we did all appear as one Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this common Enemy! O that <hi>Babyton</hi>'s Towers were humbled, her Pillars and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations razed, her Vaults digged up, her
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49699:35"/>Monuments defaced, and her Altars ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Deſolation! In a word, That all her Buildings were demoliſhed, and not a Stone left upon a Stone, but in rude and ruinous heaps, to tell us, that <hi>here once</hi> Babylon <hi>ſtood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Embrace and keep cloſe to the Principles and Practices of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. 'Tis obſerved by an eminent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of our own,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>B.N.</hi> in his Epiſtles.</note> that (among many others that go under that name) there are five Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions on Earth which ſtand in competition for Truth, <hi>viz. Jewiſh, Turkiſh, Greekiſh, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh,</hi> and <hi>Reformed;</hi> whereof each pleads for it ſelf, with diſgrace of each other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion. Theſe men have very little to ſay for themſelves, but impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent denials of Jeſus Chriſt; whoſe very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of him, proves him ſtrongly to be the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> And were there no other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet God himſelf hath ſo ſtrongly confuted them by the voice of his Judgments, that the whole world doth hiſs at their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, their fin being written in capital Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their deſolation and contempt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion (if it deſerves
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49699:36"/>that name amongſt Chriſtians) and this ſtands upon barbarous Ignorance, and palpable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture; yet loe here a ſubtile Devil in a groſs Religion: for when he ſaw that he could not by ſingle twiſts of Hereſie, put down the well-built Walls of the Church, he windes them all up into one Cable, to try if his Cord of ſo many folds might prevail. As with <hi>Sabellius, to deny the diſtinction of perſons in the Trinity;</hi> with <hi>Arius, Chriſts Divinity;</hi> with <hi>Macedonius, the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> with <hi>Sergius, two Wills in Chriſt;</hi> with <hi>Marcion, Chriſts Sufferings:</hi> And theſe Policies ſeconded with Violence and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. O damnable mixture (as one obſerves) miſerably ſucceſsful! Their Alchoran, a Fardle of fooliſh Impoſſibilities; their whole Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, a mongrel Iſſue of an <hi>Arian, Jew, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian,</hi> and <hi>Arabian;</hi> a Monſter of many Seeds, and all accurſed: Nature hath light enough to condemn a <hi>Turk</hi> as the worſt of <hi>Pagans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Greekiſh</hi> Church puts in the next claim, but with little better ſucceſs; who are become the baſeſt Drogs of all Chriſtians, being little ſuperiour to the <hi>Turks</hi> in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49699:36"/>more idolatrous than Heathens, and ſuperſtitious than Papiſts: the very Name of them is Confutation enough. From thence I deſcend to the main Rival of Truth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Religion (or rather Faction) of the <hi>Papacie.</hi> Now whereto tends this, but to make Nature vainly proud, or careleſsly wanton?
<list>
                  <item>(1) Vainly proud, by telling her, <hi>She hath free will to do good, can go of her ſelf, morit Heaven, and pay God ſatisfaction.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>(2) Careleſsly wanton, in that it teacheth, <hi>That Chriſt died effectually for all: That men may ſave the labour of trying and examining themſelves, and believe onely as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves: That the ſacrifice of the Maſs, in the very work wrought, avails to obtain pardon, not in this life onely, but when they lie frying in Purgatory: That Alms given, merit Heaven: That abſtinence from ſome Meats and Drinks, is meritorious: That one man may deliver ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Soul out of purging Torments;</hi> ſo that he that wants not both Money and Friends, need not fear the ſmart of his ſins. O Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion! ſweet to the Wealthy, but ſad to the Poor! Who will now care how lazy his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, or how lewd his Life be, that knows theſe Refuges to flie to?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:49699:37"/>
            <p n="5">5. Next comes in the Religion I perſwade you to ſtick cloſe to <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Reformed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Religion; which you may ſee in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all theſe.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> in acknowledging Jeſus Chriſt come into the world, and depending on him alone for Life and Salvation.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> in caſting aſide all her Blaſphemies and ridiculous Fopperies.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Greekiſh,</hi> in pitying her Ignorance, and lamenting her Ruine.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Popiſh,</hi> firſt, in depretiating Nature; ſecondly, in advancing Grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. She depretiates Nature, kneads her in the Duſt, ſpoils her of her proud Rags, loads her with Reproaches, and gives Glory to him who ſays he will not give his Glory to another; acknowledging her beſt Actions to be faulty, her Satisfactions Debts, and her Deſerts Damnation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In advancing Grace:<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 2.8.</note> 
               <hi>By this we are ſaved, not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> Every ſtep in our aſcent to Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> is Free-ſtone; and the golden Chain of mans Salvation, is richly enamelled with free Grace. This lays the foundation and top-ſtone of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49699:37"/>Glory; this is the Religion we muſt ſtick to in its Principles and Practices. We muſt not be Proteſtants in the Bark, and Papiſts in the Core; Lambs and Doves without, and Lions and Bears within. This is the Religion we muſt be ſaved by, and in this of all others is the ſureſt Path to Everlaſting Happineſs. Let me perſwade you then, in the words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. to <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound words, which you have heard in faith and love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In faith towards God, and Love towards man; or Faith in Chriſt, and Love to Chriſt; or Faith, as comprehending the <hi>Credenda,</hi> and Love the <hi>Facienda</hi> of every Chriſtian. Theſe are the two hands with which you muſt hold faſt the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Paith; and that three ways.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. As it ſecures our ſtanding; this is an hold-faſt Grace. Unbelief is the root of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy, but Faith is the ſpring of Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. This will keep us cloſe to Proteſtant Principles.</item>
               <item>2. As it doth realize all the truths of the Goſpel: So that though the petty notions and fooleries in Popery may gratifie your
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49699:38"/>fancies, yet can they have no influence on your Conſciences. By this we can both live upon the Truth, and (when God calls) die for it.</item>
               <item>3. As it helps to fetch ſtrength from Chriſt, to do and ſuffer, to live and die for him. This inveſts the Soul with a kind of Omnipotency, inſomuch that other mens Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities are Faiths Triumphs.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Love: Your love will hold faſt the Truth, when (happily) your learning may let it go.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fox</hi> Acts &amp; Monum.</note> You may not (with the Martyr) be able to diſpute for the Truth; but if you love it, you will die for it, Learning lies in the head, but Love lies in the heart. This will make you ſay to the Proteſtant Intereſt, as ſhe to her Mother-in-law, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Whither thou goeſt. I will go; and where thou lodgeſt, I will lodge: thy people ſhall be my people, and thy God my God: Where thou dieſt, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do ſo to me, and more alſo, if ought but death part me and thee.</hi> 'Tis for want of this, that <hi>God gives men over to believe a lye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.6.</note> 
               <hi>to be led captive by divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.16.</note> 
               <hi>to follow cunningly deviſed fables, and to hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:49699:38"/>
            <p>Let us now love the Proteſtant Truth both in the Purity and in the Profeſſors of it: And truly if ever there were a time for our Union, this is it. May we not fear that the neglect of Proteſtant, Unity will make way for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Unity? That Party cannot be ſtrong, but by our weakneſs; nor armed, but by our nakedneſs, or come in amongſt us, but by that lane of our own diviſions. O that we might conſider theſe things; that by ſo much the greater her ſubtilties are to divide us, we may the more firmly be united in our Prayers to God, and in concord between our ſelves; that we may not expoſe our Perſons, Eſtates, Lives, Poſterities, Religion and all, to the craſty and Bloudy advantages of theſe Enemies of the Proteſtant Church! Shall <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron; Abrahani</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> fall out, eſpecially, when the <hi>Canaanites</hi> are in the land? Shall <hi>Gebal, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> at <hi>Tyre,</hi> agree; And ſhall Lambs and Doves rend, tear, and ſcratch one another? <hi>O let it not be ſpoken in Gath, nor publiſhed in the ſtreets of Askelon?</hi> Let us now <hi>endeavour to keep the nuity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</hi> It will be our Duty
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49699:39"/>and Honour, as well as Happineſs and Safety, to love one another, and appear as one man againſt the common Enemy. O that now we might beging, <hi>Go on, and proſper!</hi> 'tis not the Contention, but Conſtancy, that ſets the Grown on the Chriſtians head. It will be an unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable <hi>Dilemma,</hi> If the Proteſtant Religion were had, why did you profeſs it? if good, why did you deſert it? To conſirm you the more in the conſtant Profeſſion of it, conſider that,
<list>
                  <item>1. We have the Scriptures on our ſide, in moſt places free from ambiguiry: we live under the cleareft diſpenſations of the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenant, and the Light thereof is not yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed (and we hope never, will) with lewiſh Mifts, or Popiſh Fogs.</item>
                  <item>2. We have the Principles of Religion, which directly lead to every point of our Faith, and inſtructs us in our way to Salvation.</item>
                  <item>3. We have the antient Fathers, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of elden times, and reverend countenanor of the firſt <hi>Antiquity;</hi> ſo that all their glory therein, hath (by our <hi>Reformers</hi>) been turned into their ſhame.</item>
                  <item>4. And laſtly, which may perſwade any
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49699:39"/>man (not drunk with prejudice) we have had the mercies of God to plead for us, whereby our Church hath been miraculouſly upheld. When <hi>Rome</hi> and Hell threatned us, then God defended us; when our Neck hath even been on the block, and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death prepared to cut off our lives and hopes together, then God diſappointed them, and reſcued us. What remains now? but that <hi>we break off our Iniquities by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> put a Bill of Divorce into the hands of our deareſt Luſts, run them thorough with the ſacrificing Knife of Mortification; that we no longer <hi>turn Grace into Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> nor theſe miraculous Preſervations into ingrateful Apoſtacies.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>By this way onely it is, that we can be true to our own happineſs, be laſting Monuments of Mercy unto Poſterity, and erect Trophies of Victory over all <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm</hi> amongſt us. Then would the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Foundations of the Kingdom be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in a ſound and flouriſhing Conſtitution: For then Piety would be the Pillar to every Profeſſion; Learning adorned with Piety,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49699:40"/>Law adminiſtred with Piety, and Councils managed with Piety; then would Religion flouriſh, Peace ſettle, and the Goſpel ring in the Ears of the Generations unborn. How quickly would our Darkneſs be diſpelled, our Shades flee away, our Diſtractions be removed, and an happy Calinneſs and Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cover the face of the whole Nation? Which that it may, the Lord of his infinite mercy grant: To whom with the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
