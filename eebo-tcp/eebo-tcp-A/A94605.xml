            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE COUNCIL OF STATE,
Appointed by Authority of
PARLIAMENT,
For the Government of theſe three Kingdoms, during the interval of Parliaments,</head>
            <head type="sub">The Humble Petition of many thouſand Citizens and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

of the Nations Peace,</head>
            <opener>Humbly Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioners have a very great ſenſe of the many afflictions, inflicted upon theſe poor diſtreſſed Nations,
and of the many endeavours of the Mad and Fanatick Party, to intrench upon their Liberties, and to involve them
ſtill into more and more ruine, to their utter fall and deſtruction, had not the Almighty God, of his infinite Mercy
been pleaſed to reſtrain in ſome meaſure his afflicting hand, and reſtore their breaches, by re-calling the Secluded
Members, of the late Parliament, and re-eſtating them in their truſts, to the Confuſion we hope of thoſe Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Spirits, who for the furtherance <gap reason="blank" extent="1+ words">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> own private ends and Intereſts, have indeavoured the Ruine and Deſtruction of
theſe three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Parliament, having devolved their power into the Hands of this Right Honorable Council, during the preſent
interval, we cannot but hope that your Honours will be pleaſed ſtill to proceed in thoſe good waies which the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
for the ſettlement of theſe Nations in Peace and Quietneſſe, and for the depreſſing the deſigns of the <hi>Anabaptiſts, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
Fift-Monarchy men, Quakers,</hi> and the reſt of the Sectarian Rabble, whoſe Malevolent Spirits can never be content with
any Government but their own, and who have ſo often endeavoured to uſurp an unjuſt, illegal, and Tyrannical power over
the Nations, and reduce them to a ſlavery under them and their Heretical Opinions.</p>
            <p>That your honours cannot but be highly ſenſible of theſe their many and violent endeavours, fomented by the Envy and
Ambition of ſuch men, who though they cannot allow of their Opinions, yet would willingly condeſcend unto them, ſo that
they do but contribute to the accompliſhing of their ends and deſires; and who ſeeing that their Ambition fails them, Extend
their Envy to the utmoſt, reſolving, that if they cannot govern themſelves, they will endeavour the ruine of any Government,
though never ſo well eſtabliſhed either in Church or State.</p>
            <p>That though it hath pleaſed our mercifull God and Father, hitherto to fruſtrate all the deſigns and deſires of that Factious and
Malignant Party, yet we have reaſon to fear (Conſidering their late intentions, the many Arms and Ammunition, &amp;c. taken from
them) that their hopes of reign are not yet Quell'd, but that they will ſtill ſeek all poſſible means and opportunities, to ſubvert
any Government, which may but in probability tend to the Quiet and ſettlement of theſe Nations, as being neceſſarily contrary
to the deſigns and Intereſts of thoſe turbulent minded men.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners upon ſerious Conſideration of theſe things, as Lovers of their Countries Peace and Quietneſſe, have
thought fit humbly to preſent theſe things to your Honours, eſpecially weighing the great incouragement which will be given
to theſe Sectaries and Fanaticks, by the Releaſement of Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> their Head and Chief out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they will be emboldened to attempt and endeavour more deſperate and dangerous things to the Diſturbance of our Reſt
and Peace.</p>
            <p>That we likewiſe humbly conceive, that the ſaid General <hi>Lambert</hi> may legally ſtand indicted of High Treaſon, if the breach
of the Privileges of Parliament (upon which pretence Our late Glorious King ſuffered Martyrdome) may be ſo deemed, he
having by no Law, but only that of Arms, infringed that which ſate as a Parliament of their Privileges and Sitting, and by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
force driven them out of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray, (ſince the Vote of the late Parliament leaves it wholly to your Honours Pleaſure, whether
the ſaid </hi>Lambert<hi> ſhall be releaſed upon Security, Paroll, or not,) that your Honours would ſo far regard the Good and Wellfare
of theſe Nations, as not to permit the Releaſement of a Perſon, whoſe turbulent and ambitious Spirit might ſo far diſquiet our
Peace, but to bring him to a ſpeedy tryal to anſwer for his Rebellions and Treaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>And your Petitioners ſhall ever pray, &amp;c.</closer>
