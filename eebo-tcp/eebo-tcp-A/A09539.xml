            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

May it please you to vnderstand, that the great desire I haue to procure your delight, hath caused me somwhat to transgresse the boundes of faithfull freindship: for hauinge with great earnestnesse obtained of my very freinde Master <hi>George Pettie</hi> the copie of certaine Histories by himself vpon his owne and certaine of his freinds priuate occasions drawn into discourses, I saw sutch wittie &amp; pithie pleasantnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that I thought I could not any way do greater pleasure or better seruice to your noble sexe, then to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish them in print, to your common profit &amp; pleasure. And though I am sure hereby to incur his displeasure, for that he willed me in any wise to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> secret: yet if it please you thankfully to accept my goodwill, I force the lesse of his ill wil. For to speake my fancy without feigninge, I care not to displease twentie men, to please one woman: for the freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship amongst men, is to be counted but colde kindnesse, in respect of the feruent affection beetweene men and women: and our nature, is rather to doate of women, then to loue men. And yet it lyeth in your powers so to thinke of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to yeeld him sutch courteous consideration for the same, that hee shal haue more cause to thank me, then think ill of my faithles dealing towards him. Which if your cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies shall perfourme, you shall increase my dutie towardes you, and his good will towards mee: you shall make me shew my will and him his skill another time to pleasure you: you shall binde both of vs to remaine ready at your commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.

For mine owne part, I can chaleng no part of praise or thankes for this woorke, for that I haue taken no paines therein, neither by addinge Argument, Note, or any thinge, but euen haue set them forth as they were sent mee: only I haue christened them with the name of a <hi>Pallace of Pleasure.</hi> I dare not compare this woorke with the former Pallaces of Pleasure, because comparisons are odious, and because they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine Histories, translated out of graue authors &amp; learned writers: and this containeth discourses, deuised by a greene youthfull capacitie, and reported in a manner <hi>ex tempore,</hi> as I my selfe for diuers of them am able to testifie. I dare not commende them beecause I am partiall, I dare dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them to you Gentlewomen, beecause you are curteous. And that you may the better vnderstande the drift of these deuises, I haue caused the letter also which my freinde sent mee with this worke, to be set downe to your sight. Thus commending mine owne faithles enterprise, and my freinds fruitfull labour and learning, to your courteous protection, I wish you all, beuty with bounty, and cumlinesse with curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, from my lodging in Fleetstreete.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orced by your ernest importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and furthered by mine owne idle opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, I haue set downe in writinge, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to your request, sent vnto you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of those Tragicall trifles, whiche you haue heard mee in sundrie companies at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye times report, and so neare as I could I haue written them word for word as I then told them: but if any of them seeme bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto you now then they did then, you must attribute it to my lisping lips, which perchaunce did somewhat disgrace the grace of them: and yf any seeme worse now then than, you must impute it to this, that perchaunce there was then some <hi>Pallas</hi> in place which furthered my inuention. For I am in that point of <hi>Ouid</hi> his opinion, that, <hi>Si cupiat sponte disertus erit.</hi> But whether they seeme vnto you good or ill, I trust you will take them as a token of good will, and that is the onely commoditie I looke to reape by them. I pray you only to vse them to your owne priuate pleasure, and not to impart them to other, perchaunce to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice, for that diuers discourses touch neerely diuers of my nere freindes: but the best is, they are so darkely figured forth, that only they whom they touch, can vnderstand whom they touch: yet to auoide all captious constructions, I pray you in any wise let them bee an obiect only for your owne eyes. If this mislike you in my discourses, that I make <hi>Camma,</hi> vse the example of the countesse of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the Dutches of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> and sutch who were of far later yeeres, then the auncient <hi>CAMMA</hi> is, with the like in diuers other of the stories: you must consider that my <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> is of fresher memory then any of them, and I thinke in your iudgment, of fresher hew then the fayrest of them. Likewise, if you like not of some wordes and phrases, vsed contrary to their common custome, you must thinke, that seeing wee allowe of new fashions in cutting of beardes, in long wasted doublets, in litle short hose, in great cappes, in low hattes, and almost in al things, it is as mutch reason wee should allow of new fashions in phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

and wordes. But these faultes, or whatsoeuer els, I care not to excuse vnto you, who are the only cause I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted them, by your ernest desire to haue mee set downe these trifles in writing. And as my wordes hytherto haue tended to this end, that you should take these trifles well, so now I am to exhort you that you will vse them well: that with the spider you sucke not out poyson out of them: that by some light example you bee not the sooner inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to lightnesse. For beleeue mee (I speake it freindly, therefore take it freindly) I thinke it more needfull to send you a bridell then a spur that way. And if my example may bee a bridle to restraine you from vanity, doe but imitate mee hereafter, or if my counsayle may containe you in continency, doe but follow this aduise: if you bee free, that you come not into bondes: if you bee bound, <hi>vt te redimas captum quam queas minimo:</hi> for trust me, the broad blasphemy of <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> and the sodain <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> or rather right conuersion of <hi>Alexius,</hi> haue setled me in this fayth, that I thinke him <hi>Ter<expan>

The frendship amongest men is grounded vppon no law, and dissolued vpon euery light occasion: the good will of kinsfolke is commonly colde, as mutch of custome as of deuotion: but in this stately state of Matrimonie, there is nothing fearefull, nothing fayned, all things are done faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully without doubting, truely without doublyng, willingly without constraint, ioyfully without complaint: yea there is sutch a generall consent and mutuall agréement between the man and wife, that they both wish and will, couet and craue one thing. And as a sience grafted in a strange stalke, their natures being vnited by grothe, they béecome one, and together beare one fruite: so the loue of the wife planted in the breast of her husband, their harts by continuance of loue become one, one sence and one soule serueth them both.

For this <hi>Sinorix</hi> glauncing his gazing eyes on the blazinge beuty of <hi>Camma,</hi> receiued so déep an impression, of her perfection in his hart, that immediatly he fixed his fancie vpon her comely corps. And beinge the chiefe ruler of the citie, hee perswaded him self that there was none in the city so stout but would stoup to his lure, nor none so faire but would faine imploy them selues to pleasure him: but on the other side the renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vertue of <hi>Camma</hi> came to his minde, which perswaded an impossibility to his purpose: and floting thus betwéene hope and dispaire he entred into these termes.</p>
               <p>O miserable wretch that I am, to whom shall I addresse my complaintes, is it the heauenly powers and goddes of loue that haue depriued mee of my sences, and shewed their deuine working in mée, or is it the hellish Hags and spirites of spight that haue bereeued mée of reason, &amp; executed their cruelty on mée? is it loue that leadeth me to this lust, or is it hate that haleth mee to this hurt and mischiefe, no no the gods guide vs to goodnesse, the furies of hell it is that force vs to silthynesse: neyther doth it any way deserue the name of loue, which bringeth such torment to my troubled minde, that all the diuels in the world could not do the like. But sée my rashnes why am I so blindly bolde beastly to blaspheme against that which procéedes altogether of nature, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath imparted to all men, and which I ought to follow without repininge or resistinge: for so long as I follow na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as my guide I cannot doe amisse, &amp; seing nature hath

               <p>After this amarousin counter, he caused the company to sit downe to the banquet, and so disposed the matter, that <hi>Gamma</hi> sat right ouer at the table against him, wherby hée fréely fed his eyes on that meat which conuerted rather to nourishment of sicknesse, then to wholesome humours of health. For as the finest meates that bée, eaten by one in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of sicknesse, resolue not to pure bloud to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the body, but to watrish humors to féede the feuer and disease: so though her face and lookes were fine and swéete, and brought delight to all the beholders els, yet to him they wrought onely torment and trouble of minde: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hee perceiued her beauty to bréed his bane, &amp; her lookes to procure the losse of his liberty, and that as the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrice</hi> by sight only sleath, so shée by courteous countenance onely killed and wounded his hart, yet could he not refrain his eyes from beholding her, but according to the nature of the sickly pacient, which cheifly desireth that which cheiflye is forbidden him, hée so incessantly threw his amarous glau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

If (faier lady) this simple banquet had bene so swéete and pleasant to your séemely selfe and the rest, as your sight is delightful to mee, I am perswaded you would not haue changed your chere for <hi>Nector</hi> and <hi>Ambrosia,</hi> which the Poetes faygned to bée the foode of the goddes: but seeing there was no cause of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighte in the one, and the other contayneth that in it which may content the gods them selues, I shall desier you in good part to accept the one, and courteously to accounte me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to inioy the other.

For albeit by humane lawes your husband only haue interest in you, yet by natures lawes, which beinge more auncient ought to be of more auctority, he ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy you which ioyeth most in you, which loueth you best, &amp; indureth most paine for your sake: &amp; for proufe of natures lawes, it may please you to consider the quality of the shée woulfe who alway choseth that woulfe for her make who is made most leane and foule by following her: besides that, my tytle marcheth vnder the ensigne of iustice, which is a vertue giuinge to euery one accordinge to his deserte, and that the desert of loue is onely loue againe, I know you are not to know: for all the goods in the worlde are not able to requite good will, the one belonginge to the minde, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers incident to the body, but from the equitie of my cause

Yea I might therby bee occasion to set them together by the eares, whereby it might fall out (as the euent of battaile is alwayes doubtfull) that my husband might bee hurt or slaine, and then the common report would bée (as the people are euer prone to speake the woorst) that

And sutch is the malice of men, perchaunce hée would iudge some light behauiour in mée, to be the cause that incouraged <hi>Synorix</hi> to attempt my chastity. For men haue this common opinion amongest them, that as there is no smoake but where there is some fire, so seldom is there any feruent loue, but where there hath bene some kindnesse shewed to kindle ones desire. Moreouer this toy may take him in the head, that it is a practise betwéen vs two to preuent suspicion &amp; cloake our loue, &amp; with the firme perswasion of my inuincible chastity, to lull him a sléepe in security, and then most to deceaue him, when hée least suspecteth guile: and if at any time hée heare of it by other, I may stop his mouth with this, that I my selfe tolde him of it, which if I had ment to deale falsely with him, I would not haue done: yea what know I whether hée wil like the better or the worse of mée, for bréeding sutch a bées nest in his braine: lastly I should derogate mutch from mine owne vertue, and in a manner accuse my selfe of prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to fal that way, as though I were not strong inough to withstand his assaultes without the assistance of my husband. Yes, god in whom I repose my trust, shall forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie mée against the fury of my foes, and giue mée grace with wisdome to escape his wiles, with charines to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew his charmes, and with pietie to resist his prauitie.</p>

               <p>And shall I thus be frustrate of my desire? shal I with wordes and workes, with prayers and presentes, pursue the goodwill of a daintie disdayninge dame, and receiue but labour for my loue, and gréeif for my goodwill?

Wel I sée now my time is come, my toung begins to faile, come dere children, &amp; take your last conge of your lost mother, god shield you from shame, God preserue you from perill, God send you more prosperous fortune the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your poore parents had.

               <p>Now I would wish you blazing starres which stande vpon your chastity, to take light at this lot, to take héed by this harme, you sée the husband slaine, the ruffian fled, the louer poysoned, the wife dead, the freinds comfortles, the children parentlesse. But it is naturally incident to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to enter into extremities, they are either to louinge or to lothinge, to curteous or to coy, to willinge or to wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to mercifull or to mercilesse, to forwarde or to fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to freindly or to féendly, the meane they alwayes meanely account of. Otherwise shee might with reason sooner then rigour haue repressed his rage. But howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my words run, I would not you should take them to tend altogether to her dispraise, for as I must condemne her crueltie, so can I not but commende her constancie, &amp; chastitie, and thinke her worthy to bée compared to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crece, Penelope,</hi> or what woman soeuer that euer had any preheminence of praise for her vertue. And I woulde wishe my gallant youthes, which delight to gaze in euery garish glasse, and to haue an Oare stirring in euery beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull

He had the lawe of loue on his side, shee had the lawe of men and of marriage on her part: loue led him, which the goddes themselues cannot resist, chastitie guided her, whiche the goddes themselues haue lost: he killed him whom he counted his enemy, she killed him whom she knew her fleshly freinde: shée with reason might haue preuented great mischiefe, his wings were to mutch limed with lust to fly forth of his folly.</p>

And at the first incountry of the two princes <hi>Tereus</hi> sayde.</p>
               <p>My commyng vnto you O noble prynce is not as an open enemie to inuade you, for you see I am vnarmed, neither as a secret traytour to intrap you, for you know I am your freend: but that you may not meruayle at my sodayne cummyng, you shall vnderstand it is to sée your daughter the Lady <hi>Progne,</hi> for you shall soone perceyue I pretende well vnto her. <hi>Pandian</hi> answered.</p>

               <p>If faire Lady, I should tell the truth of my comming into this country, I thinke you would take it but for a trifling toy, yea if I should in woords plainly set downe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause of this my interprised iourney, and the case which through your meanes I remaine in, I doubt you would neither beleeue the cause, neither reléeue my case: for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the straungnesse of the one would bréed great incredulity &amp; for the other the small acquaintance I haue with you &amp; lesse deserts towards you can craue smal curtesy: yet if it please you to know, neither the desire to see this country, neither the renoume of your vertue &amp; beauty brought me hither, for though the report therof be great, yet now I se I must néedes say, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fame hath rather framed your praise maliciously then reported it truly, for one good part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to bée in you, I perceiue by your countenance such confluence of good conditions, that I can not but counte the rumor which run of you, rather sparing speeche then right reporte. But the cause of my hasty comminge and heauy case is this, it pleased the goddes to presente your seemely selfe to my presence, in the same louely likenesse wherin you are at this present, what time I tooke sutch veiwe of your sweete face, that approchinge this daye to your fathers palaice, béefore I knew who you were, what you were, or where you were, as you looked if you reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now seinge it pleased the gods thus miraculously to moue mée to traueile to see you, and seeing the sight of your sweete face hath fast fettred my fancy in links of loue, these may bee humbly to desire you, neither to resist the motion of

And if I haue preferred your loue before all the Ladies of my owne land, if I make you that profer which many princes haue pressed for, if neither wearines of way, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perils of sea could prohibite mee from pursuing your good will, if I bee content to resigne my kingdome, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and all that I haue into your handes, I shall desire you not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne my curtesy, but to counteruaile my paine and to returne my goodwill with like loue and affection.

So that as the one halfe and moytie of mee is not mine, so the other part, if your goodwill bee as greate as you pretend, shalbee yours. Presently vpon this he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his sute to her parentes, who were no lesse glad of sutch a sonne in law, then hee of sutch a wife?

the destines draue, neither the Shies caused, but first his owne fonde fancie framed, and then his owne ambitious desire finished as by the sequele of this Hystorie you shall sée. For this Gentleman <hi>Germanicus</hi> frequentynge the court of <hi>Octauian</hi> the Emperour, chaunced to fixe his eyes on the face of a noble Gentlewoman named <hi>Agrippina,</hi> the daughter of <hi>M. Agrippa,</hi> and as the Mouse mumpeth so longe at the bayte, that at length she is taken in trap, so hee bit so longe at the bayte of her beutie, that at length hee was caught in <hi>Cupids</hi> snare: and on a time as shée was at Cardes in the Presence chamber, this youth stoode sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng in her face in a great studdy, which shée perceiuynge to bryng him out of his studdy, prayed him to reache her a boale of Wyne which stoode vppon a Cupboord by: and as hée approched therewith to the place of her presence, his sences were so rauished with the sight of her sweete face, that hee let the boale fall foorth of his handes: and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng backe with seemly shamefastnesse, went for more, and béeing come therwith shée thanked him for his paines saying, I pray God that fall of the Wyne hinder not my winnyng and bryng mée ill lucke, for I know many that connot away to haue Salt, or Drinke, or any sutch like thynge fall towardes them.</p>
               <p>Madame saith <hi>Germanicus</hi> I haue often heard it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in schooles that sutch as the cause of euery thing is, sutch wilbe the effect, and séeyng the cause of this chaunce was good, I doubt not but the effect wil folow accordyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and if any euill do insue therof I trust it will light on my head through whose negligence it happened. <hi>Agrip.</hi> answered.

               <p>If that bée all (saith hée) rather then it shalbée sayd any euill to haue insued of this chaunce, I will perswade my selfe that euery payne whiche you shall put mee to, shalbe

double delight and treble pleasure vnto mee. You must vse (sayth shee then) great eloquence to your selfe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you to sutch an impossibility. Oh if it please you (sayth hee) there is an oratour which of late hath taken vp his dwelling within mee, who hath eloquence to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade mee to a far greater matter then this.</p>
               <p>If (sayth shee) hee perswade you to thinges no more behouseful for your selfe then this, if you follow my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle, you shall not giue him house roome long. Madame (sayth hee) it is an assured signe of a free and freendly minde to giue good counsayle, but it is harde for one in bondage and out of his owne possession to followe it. For what knoweth your honour whether hée haue already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken intire possession of the house wherin hée is, which if it bee so, what wit is able to deuise a writ to remoue him from thence? If sir (sayth shée) hée entred by order of law and payd you truely for it, it is reason hée inioy it, marie your folly was greate to retaine sutch a tenant, but if hée intruded himselfe by force you may lawfully extrude him by strength.</p>
               <p>In déede (sayth hée) hée entred <hi>vi et armis</hi> forcibly, but after vpon certaine parlance passed betwéene vs, I was content hée should remaine in peacible possession: marie hee hath payd mee nothinge yet, but hee promiseth so frankely that if the perfourmance follow, a house with beames of beaten golde, and pillers of precious stones will not counteruaile the price of it: yea if I were placed in quiet possession therof I would thinke my self ritcher, I wil not say then the Emperour, but which is most then god him selfe who possesseth heauen and earth: and as the hope of obtayning the effecte of that promise, heaueth mee vp to heauen, so the doubt to bee deceiued therof dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth mee downe to hell.</p>
               <p>And what ioyly fellow (sayth shee) is this that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth so frankely, will hée not promise golden hils and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme durty dales? Would to god (sayth hee) your seme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

selfe were so well acquainted with him as I am, then would I make you iudge of the worthynesse of the thinge hee hath promised, for that you know the goodnes thereof none better? The lady smellinge the drift of his deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and seeinge the ende of his talke seemed to tend to loue and that touching her owne selfe, thought not good to draw on their discourse any longer, but concluded with this answere.</p>
               <p>As I am altogether ignorant what your obscure talke meaneth, so care I not to bee acquainted with any sutch companion as your Landlord is, for so methinkes by you I may more fitly call him, then terme him your tenaunt: and so departed away into her lodginge: <hi>Germanicus</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his Misteris beeing gone gat him to his chamber to entertaine his amarous conceites and béeing alone brake forth into these wordes.</p>
               <p>O friendly fortune if continually hereafter thou furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously frowne vpon mée, yet shall I all the dayes of my life count my selfe bound vnto thee for the onely pleasure which this day thou hast done mee, in giuinge mee occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of talke with her, whose aungels voice made sutch heauenly harmony to my heauy heart, that where before it was plunged in perplexity, it is now placed in felicity, and where before it was oppressed with care, it is nowe refreshed with comfort. Yea euery louely lookes of her is able to cure mee if I were in most deepe distres of moste daungerous disease, euery sweete woord proceeding from her sugred lips, is of force to fetch mee from death to life. But alas how true do I trie that saying, that euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity hath a discommodity annexed vnto it, how dooth the remembraunce of this ioy, put mee in minde of the annoy which the losse of this delight will procure mee? Yea it maketh all my sences shake to thinke, that some other shall inioy her more woorthy of her then my selfe: and yet who in this court, nay in all Christendome, nay in the whole worlde is worthy of her? No if shée neuer
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1570:26"/>
haue any vntill shée haue one worthy of her euery way, shee shall neuer haue any. And shall I then beeing but a poore gentleman seeke to insinuate my selfe in place so high? Shall I by my rude attempt purchase at least the displeasure of her friendes and parentes, and perchaunce hers also, whom to displease would be no lesse displeasant vnto mée then death? Alas and must loue needes bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with hate? Must curtesy néedes bée counteruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with crueltie? Must goodwil needes be returned with displeasure? Is it possible y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bounti should not abide where beuty doth abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; that curtesy should not accompany her comlinesse? Yes I am sure at the least she wil suffer me to loue her, though her younge yeeres &amp; high estate will not suffer her to loue mee: &amp; though shée will not accept me for husband, yet I am sure shee will not reiecte mée for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt: and though shee will not receiue my seruice, yet I doubt not but shee will courteously take the tendringe therof vnto her. And touchinge her parentes displeasure, what care I to procure the ill will of the whole world, so I may purchase her good will. Yea if I should spend the most precious bloud in my body in the pursuite of so pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les a péece, I would count it as welbestowed as if it were shed in the quarrell of god my prince or country. For shée is the goddesse whom I wil honour with deuotion, shée is the prince whom I will obey with duty, shee is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in whose cause and quarrell I will spend life, liuing, and all that I haue. Neither is there mutch cause why her friendes should storme much at the matter, for though my lands &amp; reuenewes are not great, yet am I of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bloud royall, &amp; nere kinsman to themperour, who wil not suffer me to want any thing pertayning to my estate &amp; degree. Why <hi>Alerane,</hi> a youth like my self, practised the mightie emperour <hi>Otho</hi> his daughter &amp; darling <hi>Adalesia,</hi> stole her away &amp; married her, and do I sticke to attempt the like w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one of far meaner estate, though of far more worthinesse? And though frowning fortune tossed him for a while in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

tempestious seas of aduersiti, yet at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length he arriued at the hauen of happy estate, and was reconciled to the good grace and fauour of the Emperour againe. And though at the first my ship be shaken with angry blastes, yet in time I doubt not but to bee safely landed on the shore, and haue my share of that which the showres of shroad fortune shall keepe mee from. Hee is not worthy to sucke the sweete who hath not first sauored the sower. And as the beauty of a faire woman beeing placed by a foule, blaseth more brightly, so eche ioy is made more pleasant by first tasting some sower sops of sorrow. Did not the perill which <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ventred in the sea, and the paine which hee tooke in swimming, make his arriuall to the hauen of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <hi>Hero</hi> more happy and pleasaunt? Yes no doubt of it, for besides the feelinge of the present pleasure, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberance of the perill past delighteth. Beesides that by how mutch more a man hazardeth him selfe for his misteris sake, by so mutch the more hee manifesteth the constancy of his loue, and meriteth méede at her handes the more woorthily. This saying also is no lesse tried then true that fortune euer fauoureth the valiaunt, and things the more hard the more haughty, high, and heauenly: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any thing hard to bee accomplished by him which hardily enterpriseth it.</p>
               <p>With these and sutch like sayinges incouraginge him self, hée purposed to pursue his purpose, and failed not dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attend vpon his Misteris withal dutie and diligence and sought all occasions hee could to let her vnderstande his loyall loue and great good wyll towardes her, which she perceiuing disdayned not acknowledge by her amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and curtuous countinaunce towards him, wherewith he helde himselfe as well satisfied as if he had bene made Monarche of the whole world. And though he were often determined in woordes to present his sute vnto her, yet when it came to the poynt he shoulde haue spoken, feare of offending her altogether disappointed his purpose, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1570:27"/>
made him mute in the matter he minded to vtter, but at length perceiuing that delay bred danger, for that she had many other suters, and féeling by experience, that as fire the more it is kept downe, the more it flameth vp, so loue the more he sought to suppresse him, the more fiery forces he expressed within him, he began to set feare aside and to force a supplye of courage in his faint harte, and seeing his Misteris sit in the presence alone, he entred into rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning with her in this manner.</p>
               <p>Madame for that I sée you without company I am the bolder to presume to preace in place, wherof though I be altogether vnworthy, yet am I altogether willing to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye it, and if my companie may content you as well as your sight satisfieth mee, I doubte not but you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it in good part: and so mutch the lesse I hope my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany shalbe combersome vnto you, for that you are busied about nothing wherto my presence may be preiudiciall.

For then onely (say they) we begin to liue, when we haue a house to gouerne, and may commaunde ouer our children and seruants.</p>
               <p>Tush (saith the Lady) this is but the sentence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per opinion of one peculyer people, who perchaunce by the nature of their country, or otherwise are more desie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus of husbands then other, neither is it any more reason that we should be tied to their example, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be bound to follow our virgin <hi>Vestals</hi> or other, who consume the whole course of their life w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out contaminating their corps with the company of men. Nay rather (sayth he) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiuyng their perfection from men, according to the opinion of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> But Madame I did not produce that example as necessary for all to follow, but as probable to proue and shew, what course a count they made of virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which you so highly esteeme of. But to leaue perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer opinions, and come to generall constitutions and customes, I meane both naturall, humaine and deuine lawes, and you shall see them all to make agaynst you. And first if you consider natures lawes, which in the doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynges of creatures without reason are playnly set downe you shall sée no liuing wight in the vniuersall world, but that so soone as by age they are apt therto, apply themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to that life whereby their kinde may bée conserued and number increased. Behold the high flyinge Faulcon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1570:28"/>
which soareth so high in the ayre that a man would think she would stoope to neither Lure nor lust, yet shee is no sooner an entermuer or at the fardest a white Hauke, but that of her owne accorde shee commeth to the call of the tassell gentle her make. Likewise the Doe which s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ingeth so freely aboute the wooddes as though shée made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the male, yet shee is no sooner a sores sister, but that shee séekes the society of the bucke. Yea if it would please your séemely selfe to enter into the consideration of your owne nature, or if your curtesy would accounte mee worthy to haue the examination of your secrete thoughtes, I doubt not but you would confesse your selfe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lee a firy force of that naturall inclination which is in other creatures, which being so you must graunt to deale vnnaturall in resisting that naturall motion which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bée ill or idle, bicause nature hath planted it in you: for God and nature doo nothinge vainely or vily. And in that some doe amisse in rebellinge against nature, their owne scrupulous nicenesse is the cause, when they will lay on them selues heauier burdens then they are able to beare, and refuse to beare those burthens whiche nature hath appointed them to beare: which are but light.</p>
               <p>What talke you sir (sayth shee) so mutch of nature and of creatures without reason, as though wee ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low either the instinct of the one, either the example of the other. I haue bene alwayes taught that reason is the rule to direct our dooinges by, and that wee ought to laye béefore vs the actions of creatures indued with reason to follow and imitate. For if you sticke so strictly to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of reasonles creatures, you should vse the company of women but once or twice at the moste in the yeere, as most of them doo, with their females, whereto I am sure you would bée loth to bée tied.</p>
               <p>Madame (sayth hee) a gentlewoman of this citie hath answerd this obiction alredy for me. Why then (saith she) wil you condemne their dooings in some poinctes, &amp; place
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1570:28"/>
them for paternes to bée practised by in othersome?</p>
               <p>Yea why not (sayth hée) otherwise you might general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take exception against the example of men, for that some men in some matters do amisse. The good euer is to bee vsed, and the ill refused. But to come to the dooings of men which you séeme to desire, doth not euery man so soone as his daughter is arriued to ripe yeres, trauell to bestow her in mariage, wherby she may inioy the fruits of loue, &amp; participate with the pleasures incident to that estate: wherby they plainly shew that the cause why they begot them with pleasure, and bring them vp with pain, is to haue them enter into that trade of life, wherin not only themselues may liue happily abounding in all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but also by the fertill fruite of their body, make their mortall parentes immortall: that when they with age shalbée wasted and withered away the séede of their seede may begin gréenely to grow and flowrishingly to spring, to the great comfort of both the father and daughter. For what pleasure the graundfather takes in the sportinge pastime of his proper daughters prety children, I thinke you partly vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and what delight the mother takes in the toyes of her litle sonne, you soone shall perfectly perceiue, if it please you friendly to followe the friendly counsayle which I frankely preache vnto you. For do you thinke if virginity were of sutch vertue, that parentes would not rather paine them selues to keepe their deare daughters modest maides, then straine them selues and their substance to ioyne them in <hi>Iunos</hi> sacred bond? Yes perswade your swéete selfe if your mother were so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded shée would rather locke you vp close in her closet, then suffer any to inioy the soueraigne sight of your beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or once aspire to your spéeche whereby you might bée perswaded to some other kinde of life. But shée experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by yéeres knoweth best what is best for your behouse and would you should followe her example and make no conscience to loose that which shée her self hath lost, which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1570:29"/>
except shée had lost wée had lost so rare a Iewell as your séemely selfe are, with what a losse it had bene to my self I dare not say lest you count verity vanity, and truth trifling and flattery. But to our purpose, you perceiue as I sayd your parentes pleased with the accesse of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vnto you, wherby you may conceiue their minde is you should accept sutch seruice as they profer, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with those pleasures which they prefer vnto you.</p>
               <p>Why sir (sayth shée) you altogether mistake the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of men in this matter, for when fathers te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to their daughters, it is not for any minde they haue to haue them maried, but onely for feare least they should fall to folly otherwayes, for knowing the fickle frailenesse of youth, and our procliuyty to prauity and wickednesse, they prouide vs mariages to preuent mischiefes: and sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of euils the least is to bée chosen, they count mariage a lesse euill then lightnesse of our life and béehauiour.</p>
               <p>Alas good Madame (saith he) why do you so mutch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the holy state of wedlocke, as to count it in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of euils, wheras the goddes themselues haue entred into that state, where as Princes pleasantly passe their time therin, whereas by it only mankinde is preserued, and amitie and loue amongst men conserued, of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse wherof I am not worthy to open my lippes.</p>
               <p>Sir (saith she) I speake it not of my self, but according to the opinion of the most wise and learned Philosophers that euer liued, amongest whom one <hi>Aminius</hi> so mutche misliked of Marriage, that béeyng demaunded why hee would not marrie, answered, because there were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie inconueniences incident to that estate, that the least of them is able to slea a thousande men.</p>
               <p>Why Madame (saith hee) you must consider there is nothyng in this mortall life so absolutely good and perfect but that there bée inconueniences as well, as commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties incurred therby: by that reason you may take the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1570:29"/>
greene, and blasteth away the beutie of those that blaze their face therin. But to leaue naturall &amp; humaine lawes and come to the deuine precepts proceedyng from Gods owne mouth: doth not God say it is not good for man to liue alone, and therefore made <hi>Eue</hi> for an helper and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter? Likewise in diuers places of Scripture he doth not only commend Marriage to vs, saying, Marriage and the bed vndefiled are honourable, but also commaundeth vs to it, saying: you shall forsake Father and Mother and follow your wiues.</p>
               <p>Why sir (saith shee) and doth not God say it is good for man not to touche a woman, and if thou bee vnmarried remayne so. But why alleadge you not this text, it is better to marrie then to burn, wherby is playnly shewed that Marriage is but a meane to medicine the burnynge in concupiscence and lust, and as I sayd béefore of two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils the least, and therfore preferred. But because wee bee entred into deuine misteries, I could refer you to a place of scripture, where it is reported that in Heauen Uirgins chéeifly serue God and set foorth his glorie. And <hi>Mahamet</hi> the great Turke (who was in heauen) saith he saw there Uirgins, who if they issued foorth of Heauen would lighten the whole worlde with their brightnesse, and if they chaunced to spit into the sea, they would make the whole water as sweet as Honie, but here is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of married folke.</p>
               <p>Belike (saith hée) those Uyrgins bee like your self, and then no meruayle though God be delighted with the sight of them, whiche perchaunce is the cause hee hath them in Heauen to attend vpon him, as first <hi>Heue</hi> and after <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymedes</hi> did vpon Iupiter. But generally of women the scripture sayth that by bringinge forth of children they shalbée saued and inioy a place in heauen, which must bée by mariage if honestly. But bicause I am perswaded that it is onely for argument sake that you disalow mariage, and that you pretend otherwise in words then you intend
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1570:30"/>
to doo in workes, I am content to giue you the honour of the fielde, and thus far to yéelde my consent to your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that virginity considered of it owne nature simply without circumstance is better then Matrimony, but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the one is full of perill, the other full of pleasure, the one full of iepardy, the other full of security, the one as rare as the blacke swan, the other as common as the blacke crow, of good thinges I thinke the more common the more commendable.</p>
               <p>If (sayth shée) I haue gotten any conquest hereby I am to thanke mine own cause not your curtesy who yéeld when you are able to stand no longer in defence.</p>
               <p>Nay Madame say not so (sayth hée) for in that very yelding to your opinion, I proued mariage better then virginity for that is more common: neither would I haue you turne my scilence in this matter, into lacke of science and knowledge, or reprehend mée if I spare to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force further proufe in a matter sufficiently prooued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, no more then you would rebuke a Spanniel which ceaseth to hunt when hée séeth the Hauke seazed on the Partridge. But you may meruaile madame what is the cause that maketh mée perswade you thus earnestly to mariage, which as mine owne vnworthinesse willeth mée to hide, so your incomparable curtesy incourageth me to disclose, which maketh mée thinke that it is no smal cause which can make you greately offended with him who beareth you great goodwil, and that what sute soeuer I shal prefer vnto you, you wil either graunt it or forgiue it, pardon it or pitie it. Therfore may it please you to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> since not long since I tooke large view of your vertue and beauty, my hart hath beene so inflamed with the bright beames therof, that nothing is able to quenche it, but the water which floweth from the fountayne that first infected mée, and if pity may so mutch preuaile with you as to accept mée, I dare not say for your husband, but for your slaue and seruaunt, assure your selfe there shall

no doubt of daunger driue mée from my duty towardes you, neither shall any Lady whatsoeuer haue more cause to reioyce in the choice of her seruaunt then your selfe shall, for that I shall account my life no longer pleasaunt vnto mée then it shall be imployed in your seruice.</p>

               <p>As I am to yéeld you thankes for your goodwill, so am I not to yéeld consent to your request, for that I neither minde to marry, neither thinke my self worthy to retain any sutch seruaunt: but if I were dispoled to receiue you any way, I thinke the best manner meane inough for your worthynesse.</p>
               <p>Immediatly here vpon there came company vnto them which made them brake of their talke, and <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi> béeing got into her chamber began to thinke on the sute made vnto her by <hi>Germanicus,</hi> and by this time <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi> had so cunningly carued and ingraued the Idoll of his person and béehauiour in her heart, that shée thought him worthy of a far more worthy wife then her selfe: and perswadinge her selfe hy his woordes and lookes that his loue was loyall without lust, true without triflinge, and faythfull without faygninge, shée determined to accept it if her parentes would giue their consent therto.

               <p>I béeseech you sir (sayth shee) to rest satisfied with my former answere, for other as yet I am not able to make you.</p>
               <p>Alas Madame (sayth hée) the extremity of my passion will not suffer long prolonginge of compassion, wherfore

I humbly beseech you presently to passe your sentence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of bale or blisse, of saluation or damnation, of life or death: for if the heauens haue conspired my confusion, and that you meane rigorously to reiecte my good will, I meane not long to remaine aliue to trouble you with any tedious sute, for I account it as good reason to honour you with the sacrifice of my death, as I haue thought it conuenient to bestow vpon you the seruice of my life.</p>
               <p>Alas sir (sayth shée) this iesting is nothing ioyfull vnto mée, and I pray you vse no more of it for the remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of that which you speake of in sporte, maketh mée séele the force therof in good ernest: for a thousand deaths at once can not bée so dreadful vnto mée, as once to thinke I should liue to procure the death of any sutch as you are.</p>
               <p>If sayth hée you count my wordes sporte, iest and dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, assure your selfe it is sport without pleasure, ieste without ioy, and daliance without delight, as tract of time shall shortly try for true. But if you loue not to heare of my death, why like you not to giue mée life, whiche you may do only by the consent of your good will.</p>
               <p>Why sir (sayth shee) you know my consent consisteth not in my selfe but in my parents to whom I owe both awe and honour: therfore it bée hooueth you first to séeke their consent.</p>
               <p>Why Madame (sayth hée) shall I make more account of the meaner partes then of the heade, you are the heade and cheife in this choice, and therfore let mée receiue one good worde of your good wil, and then let heauen and earth doo their woorst. It is not the coine, countenance, or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of your parentes that I pursue for to winne, sutch wealth as your good will. I could bée content to leade a poore life all the dayes of my life, so that you bée maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to your will and worthinesse.</p>
               <p>Well (saith shée) séeing I am the only marke you shoot at, assay by all the meanes you may to get my freindes good will, and if you leuell any thinge strait you shall not

               <p>
                  <hi>Germanicus</hi> vpon this procured the Emperours let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to her father in his beehalfe, who hauinge perused those letters sayd hée trusted the Emperour would giue him leaue to dispose of his owne accordinge to his owne pleasure, and that his daughter was to nere and deere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to see her cast away vpon one, who for lacke of yéeres wanted wisdome to gouerne her, and for lacke of landes, liuyng to maintaine her: and calling his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter béefore him, hée béegan to expostulate with her in this sorte.</p>
               <p>Daughter, I euer here tofore thought you would haue been a solace and comfort to my olde yéeres, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longer of my life, but now I se you will increase my hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie heares and bee the hastner of my death. Doeth the tender care, the careful charge, and chargeable cost which I haue euer vsed in bringyng you vp deserue this at your handes that you should passe a graunt of your goodwill in marriage without my consent? Is the pietie towardes your parents, and the dutie of a daughter towardes her father so vtterly forgotten, that you will prefer the loue of an vnthrift before my displeasure, &amp; to please him care not to displease your parentes, who trauayle to bestow you with one worthy your estate and ours? No neuer thinke <hi>Germanicus</hi> shall inioy you with my goodwill, nor neuer take mee for your father if you graunt him your goodwill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agrippina</hi> hearing this cruell conclusion of her father, with bashfull countenance and tremblynge tounge, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her answer in this fourme.</p>
               <p>I béeséeche you good father not to thinke mee so grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse a child as once to thinke, mutchlesse to do any thing whiche may heape your heauinesse or hasten your death, the least of whiche two, would bee more bitter vnto mee then death. For if it please you to vnderstande, I haue not graunted my good will to any, vnlesse your consent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1570:32"/>
bee gotten therto. Neither haue I, as you say, preferred the loue of an vnthrift béefore your displeasure, but as I cannot let that noble gentleman <hi>Germanicus</hi> to loue mee, so can I not, to confesse the truth, but loue him: mary in hart only, for my body as you gaue it me so shall you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of it: and as I faithfully promise you by the loue which of dutie I owe you, that I will neuer haue any to husbande without your good will, so I humbly béeséeche you for the affection which by nature you beare mée, that you will neuer force mée to any without my good will.</p>
               <p>For if for the transitorie life you haue giuen mee, you make mee pay so derely as to bée linked with one agaynst my likyng, I must néedes count it a hard pennyworthe, and well may I wish that I had neuer béene borne. I béeseche you sir consider the inconueniences alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to those marriages, where there is more respect of money then of the man, of honours then of honestie, of goods then of good will of the parties eche to other.</p>
               <p>What strife, what iarres, what debate at bed &amp; at bourd, at home and abroade, aboute this about that, neuer quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with contentation, neuer merry countenance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counterfaityng, neuer louyng deedes without dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng. And whence but from this rotten roote springeth so many dishonest women, so many ill liuyng men? Is it not the lothyng of neuer liked lips that maketh women stray from theyr husbandes to straungers? And is it not either the difference of yéeres, either y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> diuersitie of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or disagréement of natures, that maketh the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band forsake his wife and follow other women? And where are any of these differences or in equalities bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the married, but where the force of freendes not liberty of loue linketh them together? These thinges by your wisdome considered, I trust as you restraine mee from one whom I loue, so you will not constraine mée to any whom I loue not. In so dooing doubt you not but you shall finde in mée modesty méete for a maide, vertue fit
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1570:32"/>
for a virgin, duty méet for a daughter, obedience fit for a childe. Her father hauing mildly heard her modest talke, tolde her hee ment not to force her to any, but would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide her a husband whom hee doubted not should like her better euery way then <hi>Germanicus</hi> did, and therfore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her to put out of her minde the likeinge shee had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of him, and so gaue hir leaue to depart. And beeing in her chamber shee began to deuise all the meanes shee could to roote out of her heart the loue shee bare <hi>Germani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus:</hi> and assone reuoked to her memory his lacke of liuing his litle countenance and credite, assone her fathers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and her owne preferment, with many other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities arising that way. But nothing preuayled, for as the bird caught in lime, or conny in hay, or deare in toyle, the more they strine the faster they sticke, so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> more diligently shee laboured to get out of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of loue the more doubtfully was shee intricated therein. And as one climbing on high his feete fayling and he in daunger to fall, more firmly fasteneth his hold then hee did before: so loue seeinge him selfe ready to bee dislodged out of her breast, tooke sutch sure holde and fortified him selfe so strongly within her, that no force was of force to fetche him from thence. Which the good gentlewoman percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge thought best for her ease and quiet to yeeld to the sommonce of loue to bee disposed at his pleasure. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no doubte shée had reason, for as the swifte runninge streame if it bee not stopped runneth smoothly away with out noyse, but if there bée any dam or locke made to stay the course therof, it rageth and roareth and swelleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the bankes, so loue if wee obay his lore and yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his might dealeth gently with vs and raigneth ouer vs like a louinge Lorde, but if wee withstande his force and seeke to stay the passage of his power, hee rageth ouer vs like a cruell tiraunt. Which this gentle woman as I sayd perceiuinge, without any more resistance determined in her hart to loue <hi>Germanicus</hi> only and euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1570:33"/>Now <hi>Germanicus</hi> notwithstandinge the angry lookes of the father, the frowninge face of the mother, and the strange counterfayte countenance of the daughter, follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed his sute so effectually, vsed sutch apt perswasions to the maide, and in short time insinuated himselfe so farre into hir familiaritie, that her parentes lowred not so fast, but shée allured as fast, and thought shée receiued no other contentation in the whole worlde but in his company: which her parentes perceiuinge, and besides dreadinge the Emperours displeasure, thought as good by their consent to let them goe together, as by seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to kéepe them a sunder whom the goddes seemed to ioyne together. And so mutch the rather they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced therto, for that they saw their daughter so affected to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> that the hearinge of any other husbande was hatefull and hurtfull vnto her. And herevpon the mariage was concluded and consummated: and to this bargaine only the fancy of <hi>Germanicus</hi> forced him, nowe see whither his ambicious desire draue him: for beeing in proper possession of his proper wife, he was not able to maintain her according as his princely minde desired, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> his owne lyuing was litle, and her parentes would not part w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mutch, bicause shee had matched her self not any thing to their minde: where vpon in hope of preferment and aduauncing his estate, he applied him selfe diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Emperours seruice, and in shorte time with valiant exploytes atchiued in warre, and great wisdome and discretion shewed in time of peace, hee wonne sutch credite with the Emperour, that hee held him most deare vnto him, and caused him to bee proclaimed heire appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to his crowne &amp; Empire.

For as it would haue been a hel and horrour to my hart to haue séene you liue in meaner callinge then you are woorthy of, so will it bee a heauenly mirth to my minde to see you a prince in state as well as in stature beauty and vertue.</p>
               <p>Master <hi>Germanicus</hi> (sayth shee) I promise you by the loue which I beare you, for greater bonde I haue not to confirme my woords by, that it doth mee more good to sée you thus pleasantly disposed then to here y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> newes which you haue imparted vnto me, for th'one I am sure cannot hurt you, but what harme the other may procure you I feare to thinke and faint to say. Alas my <hi>Germanicus</hi> are you to know the perils which princely stat bringeth, the falshood in friendes, the treason in nobilyty, the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in comminalty, the enuy of the weake, the iniury of the strong.

is the power of prudency and wisdome, especially where there bee many that catch for it, yea and when a man shall haue no faithfull frendes in sauyng it. For <hi>Ennius</hi> saith flatly, there is no fréendly or faithfull dealinge to be looked for at any mans handes, in matters pertayninge to a kingdome: and <hi>Euripides</hi> makes it in a manner law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a kingdomes sake to transgresse the limittes of law, nature, and honesty.

But of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that by bloud haue not beene so neere, which in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of kingdomes haue dealt far worse, the examples are in straungnesse wonderfull, in number infinite, and in successe so sorowfull, that it maketh mee colde at hart to consider of it. I spake not this my <hi>Germanicus</hi> to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speake you, you may inioy the Empire quietly, and so I trust you shall, but I know not what the matter is, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes my minde giues mée some mischiefe will insue thereof. Alas (good husband) was it for my sake you sought the Empire? Doo you thinke I can not be content with th'estate which fortune shal assigne to you? Yes if it were to beg my bread from doore to doore as <hi>Adalesia</hi> did with her <hi>Alerane,</hi> I could bee contented therwith, so you were not tormented therewith? It is you (sweete hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande) that are the ritches which I séeke to possesse, you are the only honours which I looke for, you are the only

kingdome which I care for, for so longe as I may inioy you, come pouerty, come meane estate, come sicknesse, yea come death it self so I may die betwéene your armes. Therefore (good Master <hi>Germanicus</hi>) if you followe my counsayle, resigne your title to the Emperour againe to bestow on some that hath more néede of it then (thanks bée giuen to god) wee haue: for for my part I thinke my selfe indued with the greatest riches in the world, to wit your person and mine owne contented minde. And bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the euils béefore rehersed incident to a kingdome this inconuenience is commonly incurred therby, that it altereth the nature of the person which taketh that name vpon him, for honours chaung manners, and no doubt the diuersity of delightes which a prince possesseth bée but prickes to pleasure, inticementes to folly, and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to lust. Was not <hi>Saull</hi> (I pray you) in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his raigne a good prince, but after declined to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety? <hi>Salomon</hi> beegan his raigne godly, but afterwards gaue him selfe in pray to women. <hi>Caligula, Nero</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> béegan to raigne like good princes, but after the whole world was troubled with their tiranny. I could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge infinite other examples to like purpose, but these shal suffice, neither do I alledge these, for that I feare y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> chaunge of your good nature, but to feare you from the chaunge of your estate: and yet the better I knowe your nature to bee, the more cause haue I to feare the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof. For freshest colours soonest fade, &amp; ripest fruit are rifest rotten. But to leaue the louringe lottes which light on high estate, which are more then I am able to reherse, let this request take place with you, that séeinge for my sake onely you coueted the empire, at my sute on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you will forgoe it againe.</p>
               <p>Ah (swéet wife saith hée) imbracing her in his armes, what is it vnder the Sunne whiche you may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde mee to do without desiryng? But I béeseche you

suffer not the tender care you haue of mée, to depriue you of the honour due to you? For to cast the worste of it, though open enemies or trecherous traytours, or rude rebels shall set mée béesides my regall seate, and depriue mée of life, yet shall you remayne a princesse, and be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched agayne with some other more worthy your estate, and so longe I care not what béetide of my selfe.</p>
               <p>Alas (sir saith shée) I bée séeche you vse no more of those wordes, onlesse you count my great greif your great good. Can I liue when you are dead, shall I bée married again and you made away? In deed (saith hée) I néede not vse sutch extréeme doubtes in a matter nothyng daungerous for the numbers are infinite of those who haue wielded far more waightie empires then this without hazarding them selues any way, as the Emperour <hi>Octauian</hi> hath consumed the whole course of his life without perill, and <hi>Alexander</hi> béeyng but fiue and thirtie yéeres of age tooke vpon him the Monarchy of the whole world. Besides if I should now refuse the Empire offred me, it were a signe of a base and ignoble minde, and the Emperour woulde thinke I made no account of his good will. Well saith shee do as God shall put in your head, &amp; of mee make this account, that though you bee the meanest man in the citie yet will I honour you as if you were the Emperour: and though you make mée a Princesse, yet will I bée as obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to you as if I were your hyred hand mayde.

either looke for seruice of you, or mislyke the lot whiche you shall alow mée, or not restore with interest the good will which you shall beare mée. Yes perswade your selfe this, though you surmount mée in all other thynges, yet wil I not fayle, if it bée possible, to excéede you in good wil. Shortly vpon this the whirlyng whéele of Fortune tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theyr talke to teares, their woordes to waylyng, their gladnesse to sadnesse, their happinesse to heauinesse, yea their life to death. For a certayne thirst of the kingdom, began to assaulte one <hi>Tiberius</hi> a Gentleman in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours court, who beeyng of the bloud royall, perswaded her selfe if <hi>Germanicus</hi> were made away, the Emperour béeyng dead, hee should succeed in the Empire. Whiche greedie desire of the kyngdom so blinded his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, that hee passed not to peruert both humaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine lawes for the accomplishyng therof, no rules of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, no bonde of freendship, no care of kynred, no feare of lawes, no prickes of conscience, no respect of honestie, no regard of gods or men could prohibite him from his pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous purpose. For if freendship had been of force with him, why they were familier friendes. If kinred, why they were nere kinsmen. If lawes, hee knew his deede contrarie to all lawes. If conscience, hée knew it terrible. If honestie, hee knew it most wicked. If goddes or men, hée knew it abhominable in the sight of bothe the one and the other. But too true it is, desire of a kyngdome careth neither for kith nor kin, friend nor foe, God nor the diuel, as by this trayterous Tyrant may bee playnly prooued, who by poyson procured the death of this worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Germanicus,</hi> to the intent to inioye the kyngdome of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now <hi>Agrippina</hi> séeyng her sweet husband so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly dead, was surprised with sutch sodain sorrow, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> for a long time she could neither speake woord, neither let fal teare, but at length she cast her self vpon the corps of her <hi>Germanicus,</hi> kissyng his colde cheekes, and imbracing his breathlesse bodie, sighyng &amp; sobbyng foorth these woords.</p>

My life my loue, my hope my husband, my ioy my <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus</hi> is miserably murthered and made away. Ah vaine desire of wordly dignity, ah diuelish deede of bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cruelty. But in vaine it is to complaine, when my care is without cure, and none can redresse my wronge. For goddes I know there are none, otherwise I knowe the good should not bee so made away by the ill: and men there are none that can medicine my malady, and rayse my <hi>Germanicus</hi> to life againe: so that nothing resteth for mee but by death to bée rid of the moste bitter panges of death. I could prolong my life and seeke by some meanes to hasten the death of that tirant <hi>Tiberius,</hi> but alas his death can not bring <hi>Germanicus</hi> to life, no let him liue stil on earth where I doubt not but hee shall ten thousande times in his time, feele the force of death. For hee wilbée so tormented with his owne example, that (as the poets report of <hi>Suspicion</hi>) to bee plonged in all the pits of hell will not bee so painfull vnto him.

And when the Emperour <hi>Octauian</hi> caused meate to bee thrust in her throate, shee cast it vp againe saying, sorowe was the onely sustinance, and moane the meate which shee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could or would take, and so in short time died.</p>
               <p>I shall not neede here (gentlewoman) to exhort you to take the death of your husbandes when you shalbe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and when it shall happen more paciently, for that I

knowe your wisdomes to bee sutch that you will not so wilfully worke your own confusions, neither doo I think you are to know that wee must liue by the liuinge not by the dead, and that there hath bene neuer any one husband so good, but there may bee others found as good: yea and though they bee not perfectly so good, yet in respecte of chaung which most women delight in, they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counted better: as your selues if you were once mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried perchaunce would saye, or at leaste thinke. But I thinke this needefull to put you in minde, that by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Agrippina</hi> you counsayle your husbandes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselues with their callinge not to soare to highe, and stie aboue their seate, and with foolishe <hi>Phaeton</hi> and youthfull <hi>Icarus</hi> come to confusion. It is your partes also to way your husbandes wealth, and not to decke your heades and neckes with golde when hee hath none in his purse, not to swimme in silkes when hee is drowned in debt, not to abound in brauery when hee is pinched with pouerty. For you knowe it is your parte to take sutch part as hee doth, whither it bee pouerty or ritches, woe or wealth, pleasure or paine. But surely in my fancy that man is to bee begged for a foole who will prefer his wiues pleasure before his owne and her profite, her will before his owne wealth, her vanity before his owne abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And as it is great inciuilyty and churlishuesse in a man to deny his wife any thing which is reasonable, so is it great imbecillity and childishnesse to graunte her any thing which is vnreasonable, and hereof commeth the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vndooing of a great number of young gentlemen. And as it is wise and louinge carefulnesse to prouide well for ones wife, so is it fond and doatinge curiousnesse to seeke and prouide better for her then bee would do for himselfe, whereof came the confusion of this noble Gentleman <hi>Germanicus.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He aunciet Ppilosophers are of this mynde, that there is nothyng that doth more argue and shew a base mynde, then couetous desire of coyne &amp; rit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and nothyng more signe of a noble heart, then not to desire wealth if one want it, and liberally to bestow it, if hée haue it. But I am of this minde, that nothynge doth more argue a mad minde, then to desire goods which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did good, but which haue been alwayes the cause of all our calamities. What a world of men hath desire of wealth wasted in war? What huge heapes hath it drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Sea? What infinite numbers hath it caused Phisitions to kill? How many hath it mooued Lawiers to vndoe? How many hath it driuen Deuines to sende to the Diuell?

Wherto I pray you? to maintayne vs in brauery, in gluttony, in venery, in securitie, in impunitie, in pride, in

prodigalitie, yea to brynge vs to perdition and distruction as kynge <hi>Midas</hi> wished that euery thynge which hée tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched might bee gold, wherby hée was starued to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fabritius</hi> an auncient <hi>Romain</hi> waighed wealth so litle, that though hée had béen Prince and Consul of <hi>Rome</hi> three or foure times, yet at his death hée had not so mutch goods as might suffice to bring him honorably to his graue, but was faine to bée buried at the common charge of the citie. But though the immoderate desire of ritches bée to bée reprehended, yet must I néedes say that moderately to account of them is not bée misliked, for they are giuen vs by God to passe the pilgrimage of our life withall, and we may vse them and yet not abuse them, wée may make of them and yet not make our Goddes of them. And as by duely desiryng and truly vsyng them, they conuert to our commoditie, so by gréedy couetinge and naughtie consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng them, they turne to our trouble, care, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: as partly béefore hath béen shewed, and plainly here after by the hystorie folowing is prooued, which is this.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Greece</hi> amongst the people called <hi>Argiues</hi> dwelt one <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> who béeyng a man of great possessions and wealth, heard of a Widdow in the same country of like liuyng vnto him selfe, her name was <hi>Eriphile,</hi> and her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was sutch, that shée thought gaine swéet how so euer shée got it. It fortuned this Gentleman to come to her house to sée and assay her in the way of Marriage, and not withstandyng hée had more likyng to the liuyng then wil to the woman, yet hée laboured his sute as ernestly, as if hée had loued vehemently: and at conuenient time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced his sute in this sort.</p>
               <p>Gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I think it not néedful to enter into termes in commendation of mariage therby to perswade you the sooner therto, for that you know the dignity thereof, and haue already tasted the pleasures and commodities bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longinge to the same: but this chiefelye lieth mée vpon earnestly to perswade, and humbly to requeste at your
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1570:38"/>
handes, that when it shalbée your good pleasure to enter into that life againe, you will count mee worthy (though altogether vnworthy) to serue you in steede of a steward to order and dispose your thinges as your seemely selfe shall please to appointe, and to ease you of the trouble of trauailinge in your owne affaires: which I am sure for that you haue not beene accustomed thereto, must needes mutch molest you. For it is not méete your young yeres should bée tied to any trouble or trauaile, but to passe your time in pleasure according to your bringinge vp and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, and accordinge to the custome of your kinde, and sexe. And that you may not thinke my sute to procéed of any desire to your goods, your selfe I thinke partly know and by litle inquiry may perfectly vnderstande, that my landes and liuinges are sufficient to maintaine the port and countenance of a Gentleman of worship: all which I willingly yeeld into your handes to bée disposed at your pleasure, if it shall please you to yéeld your body into my armes to bée imbraced at my pleasure: so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in acceptinge my offer you shall not only increase your substance, but also haue a gentleman at your commaundement, who shall make more account of you then of all the goods in the world. His talke ended <hi>Eriphile</hi> smylinge made him this smooth answere.</p>
               <p>Sir, by how mutch more I know the inconueniences and infinite troubles mixed with mariage, by so mutch lesse do I like to enter into that estate againe. And as I was once linked with one according to my liking, so looke I not to bee placed againe with any, in whom I can take sutch pleasure: And as by holy oth I firmely bounde my fayth vnto him, so in this minde I am in, only my death shal dissolue that bond: and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sower remembrance of my sweete husbandes death, shall take away the renewinge of all pleasures of life, and altogether mortifie in mée the minde to marry any more. For his loue was so excéeding great towardes mee, that I feare to finde the like at your
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1570:38"/>
handes or any mans els. For where you professe to be my steward and seruant, I am sure if you were once sure of that you seeke for, you would thinke your selfe good i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bee my Lord and maister, and you would dispose my goods neither at my pleasure, neither to my profite, but that which is mine should bée yours and yours your owne. And where you pretend to prefer mee before al worldly goods, I take it rather for wordes of course then talke of troth, for as in the fayrest rose is soonest found a kanker, so in fairest spéech is falshood and faigning rifest. For I knowe the fashion of you men is by your subtelty to deceiue our simplicity, and by a fewe filed woordes to bring vs into a fooles paradise. Yea you haue set it down as a setled sentence amongst you, that he which knoweth not how to dissemble, knoweth not how to liue. Therfore I yéeld no other faith to your wordes then their faygned falshoode deserues, nor no other consent to your requeste, then the smal acquaintance you haue with mée, may iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly craue. But if hereafter in déedes I shall see as playne proufe of perfect goodwill, as your wordes import likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of ernest loue, perchaunce I shal bée as zelous to cast liking towardes you, as now I am ielous to cast doubtes of you. By this time dinner was serued in, wherevpon their talke ceased, and presently after dinner the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had occasion to depart. Now <hi>Eriphile</hi> beeinge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in her own house, béegan to discourse vpon this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by her selfe, and notwithstandinge shee had no great minde to the man, yet shee felt in her selfe a great lust to his landes, and thought her selfe more then happy if shee might haue them safely assured and made ouer vnto her: and in this thought, vttred wordes to this sence.</p>
               <p>Why what though I can not finde in my heart to loue and like him aboue all other. Is it requisite that euery mariage bée grounded on loue, as though we see not daily some to marry in respect of ritches, some in respecte of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, some by constraint of freindes, &amp; some vpon sundri
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1570:39"/>
other considerations: and for my parte I count it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to haue married once of meere loue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hauinge lost him whom I did loue intirely, I thinke it not lawfull, or at least not possible, euer to loue any againe hartely. For true loue euer decayeth, when the party truly béeloued dieth. And as my heart is hardened to take his death paciently, so will it not bee mollified to suffer the loue of any other to sinke therein déepely. Like as the potters clay beeing once hardened in the Ouen, will not bee made soft againe to receiue the impression of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forme. But to speake my fancy freely, I see not how wee women are bound to loue our husbandes so mutch, wee are onely commaunded to honour and obay them, which I count sufficiente, and more then for my part I meane to perfourme. Besides that loue consisteth in the heart, now it is our bodies only that are bound to our hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes as by ioyning of handes béefore the congregation is plainely shewed. But if I determine not to loue him, how can I looke for any loue at his handes? Tush that is the least matter amongest a hundred, so long as I may abound in brauery, ruffle in ritches, and participate with his goods, I care not to communicate in loue with him: I am to olde now to liue by loue. And yet wherefore is womens wit counted full of wyles, if I bee not able so to dissemble the matter that hee maye thinke I loue him deepely, though I hate him deadly.

vnto her house<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a youth more wilfull then wise, named <hi>Infortunio,</hi> who hauinge seene her once or twice beefore, was so bleared with her beauty that it dazeled his sight, and tooke away his foresight in all things: and comming to her presence hée proferred sutch lamentable sute, and ghostly resemblances vnto her, that a rigorous repulse séemed sufficient to procure him a present death. The Gentlewoman seeing the furious assaultes of this freshe water souldiour, knew how to traine him to the fielde of her falshood, and to make him march vnder the ensigne of a marciles Misteris and cruell captaine: and sometimes fed him with wordes of comfort, to put him in hope, and by and by feared him with doubtes of deniall, to driue him into dispaire. And as the North East winde first gathereth vp the cloudes, and then by puffes putteth them abroade agayne, so shee first by louely lookes allured to bringe him in, and then with frowninge face lowred to driue him away: the only end beeing to sport her selfe in his paine, yea and if shée could of his good will to make some gaine. The poore gentleman perceiuinge these haggard trickes, and that assone shée would be wel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the lure, and by and by checke at it and soare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, was so amazed ther at that hée knew not what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue vpon. And as a trée hewen round with axes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall with a blowe or twaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tottereth euery way, béeing vncertaine which way to fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so his minde distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with doubtfull deuises, wauered vnconstanly, nowe bending this way, now bowing that way, willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire his desire, but not able to set his fancy frée. And not with standinge her peruerse dealinge pitifully perplexed and terribly tormented him, yet hée perswaded himselfe that as from most sharpe thornes, to wit the Rose tree, spring most swéete flowers, so from bitter annoy would come pleasaunt ioy, and of his heauy sute happy successe. Tush (saith hée) y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Merchant often sliceth the seas, though not sure to returne with gaine. The souldiour often
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1570:40"/>
ventreth his body in the field, though not sure of booty: the husband man still tilleth the ground though not certaine to saue his seed: but yet hope of good hap carieth all these to their enterprises, and why should not the same hope worke the same effect w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mee? Yes nothing venter nothing haue, I wil pursue my purpose whatsoeuer come of it.</p>
               <p>Now the gentlewoman (as I sayd) ceased not to bayte him continually with courtly banquets, as dissembled fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, vncertaine hope, curteous congies, amiable lookes and sutch like: but hée on the contrary as one that ment truly, ceased not to feed her with faire words, with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promises, with ernest othes, with many a ritch iewel and costly gifte, which shée willingly receiued without condition, and wilyly kept with out restitution. In this meane while came the other wooer againe to renew his sute a freshe, and séeinge this younge Gentleman, as hée thought in great fauour, began greatly to feare his owne part, and thought the grasse had bene cut from vnder his féete: and as a conning <hi>Pilot</hi> séeing the seas rough and the winde contrary to his course, casteth ancker least his ship bée driuen against the rockes, or into some coast contrary to his minde: so this Gentleman fearinge least wilfull waues in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gentlewoman, should set her fast in the sands of slipper subtelty, and dash his sute against the rockes of repulse, hauld in the maine shete of her minde, and by the anckers of aduise so stayed her course, that no wynde which my wilfull youthe could blow, could cause her any thinge to bow or wauer: and by assuringe her to a large ioynter hée was chosen to rule her sterne, wher the other was kept stil vnder the hatches. Who all this while that they were concluding the contracte, was in his chaumber busily deuisinge verses in the praise of his Misteris: but hearing of the sory successe of his sute, by a handmaide of the Gentlewoman, hée was so confounded in him selfe, that his inuencion was cleane marred, and his deuise vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly dasht: yea hée was so far from writinge that hée had
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1570:40"/>
not a woord to saye or a thought to thinke. And surely in my iudgment hée reaped the right reward of his doatinge desire, for there only grafts of greife must néedes grow, where sutch raw conceite doth set, and sutch rashe consent dooth sowe. For neyther was his loue grounded vpon ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, wherwith shee was not indued, neither vpon beauty wherwith shee was not adorned. For neither can cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be cloaked vnder vertue, neither the treason of vntruth couered vnder beuty (for the disposition of the minde fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the constitucion of the body) so that it was his own selfe will and fond fancy that drewe him into sutch depth of affection, and therefore with greife was faigne to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fruites of his folly. And beeing come to him selfe hee began to rage in this sort.</p>
               <p>And is my true loue thus triflyngly accounted of? Shall hée with his trash more preuayle then I with my truth? And will shée more respect gayne then good will? O iniquitie of times, O corruption of manners, O waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of women. Bée these the fruites of thy fayre lookes? Is this the hap of the hope thou puttest mée in? Is this the delight of the daliance thou vsedst with mee? Here in truly thou mayst bée fitly resembled to the Cat, whiche playeth with the Mouse, whom straight shée meaneth to slay: or to the <hi>Panther</hi> who with his gay colours &amp; swéet smell allureth other beastes vnto him, and béeyng within his reache hée rauenously deuoureth them. But if I should set thée foorth in thy colours I thinke the sauage beastes would bee lothe to bee likened vnto thee: for crueltie thou mayest compare with <hi>Anaxarete,</hi> who suffred <hi>Iphis</hi> to hange himself for her sake: for inconstancie with <hi>Cressed,</hi> who forsooke her trustie <hi>Troylus:</hi> for pride with <hi>Angelica</hi> who contemned all men: for treason with <hi>Helen,</hi> who ran away with <hi>Paris</hi> from her husbande <hi>Menelaue.</hi> But what rashnesse is this in mee to rage and rayle agaynst her, whereas it is loue, and the destines that haue decréed my distruction. For Marriages are guided by destiny, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1570:41"/>
God hath indued women with this propertie, to bee wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their wils: Neither doth loue learne of force the knots to knit, shée serues but those which feele sweet fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies fit: for as streames can not bée made to run against their course, so vnwilling loue with teares nor truth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bée won. So that this only choice is left for mée ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die desperately, or to liue lothsomely: and as the birde inclosed in cage, the cage doare béeing set open, and the Hauke her ennemy sitting without, watching for her betwéene death and prison piteously oppressed standeth in doubt whether it bée better stil to remaine in prison, or to goe forth to bee a pray for the hauke, so stande I in doubt whether it bée better by loosing life to get liberty, or by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge to become thrall and bond, and liue in continuall torment and vexation of minde. For loue hath taken so déepe roote in mee, that neither reason can rule, neither wisdome wield my witched will. But as the bytinge of a mad dogge rageth and rankleth vntil it haue brought the body bitten to bane, so the poyson of loue is so spread into euery part of mee that it will vndoubtedly bringe mee to death and distruction. O cruell captaine <hi>cupid</hi> is this the pay thou giuest thy souldiours? O vaine <hi>Venus</hi> is this the victory thou vouchsafest thy champions? Wouldest thou haue bene content thy darlinge <hi>Adon</hi> should rigorously haue reiected thee, when thou wert furiously inflamed with his loue? But the parish priest forgetteth that euer hee was clarke, and those that bée in happines themselues way not the heauinesse of other. Yea perchaunce thou fauour the falshood of this woman the rather, for that thou thy self playedst the false harlot with thy husband <hi>Vulcan</hi> the smith, and madest him a forked toole more then before hée had in his shop: but remember yet how hée tooke thee and the adultrour <hi>Mars</hi> tardie in your trechery and leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry together starke naked in an iron nette, and then called all the goddes to take view of your victous conuersation, to thy vtter shame and confusion.

that this your pupill may so longe delight in deceit, that shee may bee taken in the net which shee layeth to intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle other. But what meane I to blaspheme against the gods who doe but punnish mee iustly, for louing so lightly and ouely mine owne careles faut, is the cause of this curelesse fate. Wherefore O death to thee I make ernest request, that thou wilt speedily send <hi>Atropos</hi> vnto mee, to cut in sunder the twyst of my troublesome life: and seing my loue doth loth mee, good death doe thou desire mee. I know thou sentst out processe for mee euen in my swath cloutes, and now I beeseeche thee serue it on me, when I am most willinge and ready to appeare beefore thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. While this foreldrue gentleman continued in these carefull contemplations, the mariage was consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated betweene the widdow and <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> who liued quietly together about a yeere or two, shee shewinge a presentiall obedience towardes him, and hee bearinge an ordinary affection towardes her: but in short time it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed god to giue occasion to try the trechery of the one, &amp; to worke the distruction of the other. For it fell so out that <hi>Adrastus</hi> king of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

Now the kinge takinge muster of his men missed <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> and knowing the cause of his absence, was in great rage, sayinge hee thought hee had had no sutch cowardes in his kingdome, and promised great rewardes to them that could bring tidings of him: <hi>Eriphile</hi> hauinge intelligence of this riche reward promised, was meruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously set on sier in the desire therof: &amp; notwithstandinge she was plentifully indued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ritches, yet was she in desire

And what so euer bee your common saying, that you must as well loue to liue, as liue to loue, yet surely in my fancie I thinke it farre better for a married couple to liue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without liuinge, then without loue: for what litle liuing will suffice nature, who knoweth not, but what lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed liues be where loue doth lack, looke but into the liues of the parties, but now reported vnto you.

               <p>IT is a doubt often debated but not yet decided, whether loue discendeth from the heauens, deriueth of our owne nature, procéedeth of the similitude of manners, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of acquaintance and familiarity, taketh originall of our education and bringinge vp together, whether it ariseth of beauty or of vertue, whether it entreth in at the eyes, or first bée rooted in the hart, whether the cause come from the party that loueth or the party loued, or whether it bée in our power to loue or to leaue, I leaue to other to resolue vpon, for for my part (I yeeld god thankes for it) I haue as yet been so litle troubled with loue, that I know not what it is, nor from whence it commeth, and when I muse theron I am as bad troubled as Symonides was to thinke and say what god was: but if an opinion grounded vpon reason without any proper experience on mine owne part may take place, I thinke loue cheifly to bee grounded vpon the similitude of manners shewed and signified by familiarity and abode together. For it is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seene that those parties who at the first incountry and vew haue rather dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1570:45"/>
and nature together, haue fallen into the fire of most feruent affection. For true loue and faythful freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is to will and to nill one thinge, to haue one obiect of appetite, and to haue like effect of affection. I know there are infinite instances to bee giuen to this assertion, for that some haue beene surprised with loue only vpon a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing looke, some vpon a curteous word, some vpon a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle sight, some vpon a vaine vision, some vpon a doubtful dreame, some vpon an vncertaine report, and some some other way. But as one swallow makes not sommer, so one particularity concludeth no generality. And as an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> is sayd generally to bée blacke though his téeth bée white, for that for the most partes of him hee is black, so I thinke loue may bee sayd generally to procéede of the similitude of manners, for that for the most part it doth so. And besides infinite other examples which I can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage for proofe hereof, the historie which you shal present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heare shall also confirme it.</p>
               <p>In the renowmed citie of <hi>Rome</hi> made his abode one <hi>Icilius,</hi> who though hée were a gentleman of a worshipful house, yet by reason that his parentes were yet lyuinge, his patrimony was not great, neither his liuinge more then might suffice to maintaine the porte of the place and countenance hée caried in the citie, by reason wherof hee remained vnmaried, as béeing not able to maintayne a wife accordinge to the estate of his callinge. It was his chaunce amongest other youthfull company to passe the time for the space of a sennight in feasting and makinge merry at the house of one <hi>L. Virginius,</hi> a worshipful gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the same citie, who had to daughter a damsell named <hi>Virginia,</hi> who as shée was of ripe yeres, so was shée of ripe iudgement and discretion in euery point bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longinge to a vertuous virgin &amp; modest maide. Her shape though it were not precise, yet was it perfecte: her face though it were not blasinge, yet was it beautifull: her corps though it were not curious, yet was it comely: and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1570:46"/>
as nature plentifully planted perfection in her, so God super aboundantly bestowed his benefits vpon her, sutch grauity in gesture, sutch modesty in manners, sutch cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy in conuersation, sutch troth in talke, sutch wit in reasoning, that <hi>Minerua</hi> her selfe could not haue mended her: that it was doutfull whether men were more rapte into admiration of her wisdome, or rauished in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of her beauty, the one contayninge contentment for the body, the other solace and delight for the minde. Now <hi>Icilius</hi> being in the company and society of this saint vsed litle other behauiour towardes her aboue his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon regard to all the Gentlewomen of the troupe, but spent his time in dauncinge, dysinge, cardinge, and other sutch pastimes. And notwithstanding this while he often felt a certaine restraint of liberty in his affections, an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of minde and as it were a ciuell assault and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord within him selfe, yet by reason of his younge yeres and small practise in the pangues of loue, hee could not coniecture the cause of his sodaine passions: but this made him most to muse, that when hee was in his most dumps, if shee chaunced to present her selfe to his presence, his heart was presently lightned of that which lay so heauy in his stomake, and as when the sun shineth the cloudes vanish away, so when her beauty blazed in place, the cloudes of care were cleare consumed. Likewise beeinge often desirous to talke with her, &amp; inioy the present plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of her pleasant speeche, his sences were so rauished with the sight of her, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he could not vtter one word vnto her. Sitting also at the table with her &amp; casting a gazinge glaunce round about him, his sight was neuer satisfied vntill hee had lent her a looke, and séemed only to resolue his fancy vpon her face. But notwithstandinge all this hee did not thorowly perceiue the cause of his sodain trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of minde, and thought it as it was a toy lightly taken so would it bée lightly left againe, and therfore departed from her fathers house without preferring any sute vnto
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1570:46"/>
her, or adding execution to the aduantage of the time and place. But beeinge gone home, and gotten solitarily to his chamber, good god what mountaines of smooke did scaldinge sighes send foorth of his mouth, what drops of bloud did galdinge greife make his heart to bléed, what flouddes of teares did flow from his eyes, what carefull complaints did hée send vnto the skies? saying O heauens why heape you my heauinesse? O planets why plant you my paine? O destines why decrée yée my distruction? O Gods why depriue you mée of liberty, nowe my younge yéeres chalenge to liue most fréely. O fortune why doest thou mixe my swéete meate with sutch sower sauce y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is more bitter then gall, and nolesse pleasaunt then death vnto mée? Must the litle delight which I tooke in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Virginia</hi> (wherof I fully vnderstood not her to bée the cause neither) bée counteruayled with sutch direfull dispight? and for the pleasure which her presence procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mée, must her absence purchase me sutch displeasure? then to true doe I finde that euery dram of delight hath a pound of spight, and euery inch of ioy, an ell of annoy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto it: then well may I curse the chaunce, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause and the company which caused mée to come to that place, which hath caught mée in sutch bondage. And may I terme it bondage to liue in the seruice and contemplation of my <hi>Virginia?</hi> Is it slauery to bée thrall to vertue? It is her bountie not her beutie that bindeth mée, it is her curtesy, not her comlinesse that I care for, it is her perfection not her person that I passe of, it is her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions not her colour that I acount of: for beuty bideth not, comelinesse continueth not, personage perisheth, coulour fadeth, but bounty, curtesie, perfection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions remaine for euer. So that if I liue in bondage, it is to vertue, if I bée a slaue I am vertues slaue. But doth vertue vse to torment men thus, béelike that is the cause there are so few honest and vertuous? No I ought not to count my trouble a torment, but the fine gold must
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1570:47"/>
bee purified in the flaming fire, &amp; white siluer is wrought in blacke pitch: glory must bee gotten thorow depth of daunger, and pleasure must bée purchased with the price of paine. And though absence now be some torment to try mee, and though dolour now drowne mee in the seas of sorrow, yet doubt I not but shortly to swim in the fluds of feliciti, and take land there where my heart hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pitcht his abode. But O presumptuous foole, whether doth folly force mec? doo I hope to win her whom my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthynesse willeth me not so mutch as to wish for? Yea which way soeuer I goe to worke, I am sure to haue a colde sute of it: for if I profer her my seruice dishonestly, why her vertue abhorreth it: if I make loue in way of mariage, her estate and ritches refuseth it. O god and shall goods bee more accounted of then goodwill? lucre more then loue? Is the counsayle of <hi>Themistocles</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether reiected, who willeth men rather to marry their daughters to a man that wanteth mony, then to mony y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wanteth a man to vse it? Is the world so blinded in coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse to prefer liuinge before learning, wealth before wit? Then farewell true freindship if it bée not grounded vpon loue: then farewell true loue if mariage bée not the end of it: then farewell true mariage if mony make it: then resteth for mee onely to beewayle my euill hap, to lament my luckelesse loue, and neuer to attempt that I am like neuer to attaine vnto.</p>
               <p>By this time the earth was couered with a darke man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and by reason that the Sun was departed out of our <hi>Horizon,</hi> the light of the starres which the Sun lendeth them, béegan to appeare in the firmamente, where vpon this poore passionate louer weried with woe, disposed him selfe to rest: but hee whose bane loue hath brued, neither by night nor by day, neither in company nor solitary, neither sléeping nor waking, can take any rest or quiet. For hee was no sooner in a slumber but the goddesse of his deuotions presently presented her selfe béefore him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1570:47"/>
Myne owne, why doest thou thus torment thy selfe for my sake, who suffer no litle greife to see thy great sorrow, wherfore be bolde to aske any thing at my hands honestly, and bee sure I will graunt it willingly: for I perswade my selfe the heauens haue reserued mee for thée. <hi>Icilius</hi> hearinge (as hée hoped) this heauenly voice, and séeing (as hée thought) that saint by his bed side, with open armes reached to imbrace her, but béeinge awaked with open eyes hée saw hee was deceiued: which sodaine fall from heauen to hell tooke away his breath from him for a while, but béeing come to him selfe hée began to cry out in this carefull manner.</p>
               <p>O God, is it not sufficient to vexe mée with vanities in the day time, vnlesse thou torment mée with visions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the night? haue I not woe inough awake, but that béesides I must haue sorrow in sleepe? What gréeuous offence haue I committed, that deserueth sutch gréeuous punishment? if this bée the rewarde of them that loue, woe, woe bée to them that hate: thou hast commaunded vs all to loue one another, and if thou thus punishe the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fillers of thy law, what shall béecome of the transgressors therof? but if thou bee disposed to punish mée, and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with my deedes, neuer suffer mée hereafter to do any thynge but cast mée into sutch a sleepe wherin I was er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, and therein let mée continue continually. O happy was <hi>Endymion,</hi> who longe time inioyed the like sleepe. O ten times happie are the dead, if death bée any thynge like this sleepe. But O hundred times vnhappie am I, to whom wakyng is waylefull, wheras to all thynges els it is ioyfull. But was this but a vision which deluded mee? was it but a dreame whiche I doated on? And if it were but a dreame, doth it portend nothyng? and may there be effect in dreames? Yea god wot commonly the contrary: or (as <hi>Cato</hi> saith) wée sée sleeping that which wée wish for wakyng. So that neither in dreaming nor doing, neither in sleepyng nor séeyng, neither in thinkyng nor sayinge,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1570:48"/>
finde I any cause of comfort or see any signe of solace. This youthe passed his time so longe in these and sutch like passions, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> carefull cariage of his eyes bewrayed his carefull minde, and his pale countenance his painfull case. Which a special fréend of his perceiuyng, tooke sutch compassion and pitie on his painfull state, that hée sought all meanes possible to sift out the cause of his sorrow, to the intent to séeke some medicine for his maladie. And hauyng oportunitie of time and place, hée brake with him in this sorte.</p>
               <p>Good freende, if I should shew you what great sorrow I sustayne by your heauinesse, you would perchaunce iudge my words to proceede rather of flattery and trifling then of truth: but no more but trie how willyng I wilbe to ease your payne, and by that iudge how greatly it grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth mee. But how great so euer my gréeif bee, my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is more then great to sée you transfourmed from the estate of a pleasant Gentleman into sutch solitarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardes, that you séeme rather a <hi>Tymon</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> then a courtier of <hi>Italy:</hi> and so mutche the more cause I haue of meruayle, by how mutch lesse I sée any apparent cause which should worke any sutch alteration in you. For if want of worldly wealth coulde worke your woe, why you want nothyng: if you would eate golde (as they say) you might haue it. If losse of freendes molest you, why you haue an infinite number whiche loue you intirely. If you bee disposed to trauayle to see straunge countries, your parents wilbee well pleased with your departure. If you bee wearie of your single life, your freendes will foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with prouide for your Marriage. If any repulse receyued of any dayntie dame doo daunt you, why the Goddes them selues haue suffred the like: as <hi>Daphne</hi> a seely damsel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the God <hi>Phoebus: Syrinx</hi> a simple mayde reiected the God <hi>Pan,</hi> with infinite other. If you haue fixed your fancie in place you thinke impossible to possesse, why you haue reason to rule your affection, you haue wit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe

                  <hi>Icilius</hi> hearing this friendly discourse could not but say in his heart, O friend vnfained, O loue most loyall, O curtesy incomparable and imbracinge fast his freend in his armes sayd, if al the miseries in the world did muster in multitudes about mee, yet this thing only is of force to fence mee from their furies, to thinke I inioy so firme a friend as your selfe are, and if I may liue but to requite some part of your good wil, it is the second felicity I loke for in this life. But touching the cause of my perplexity I must craue pardon if I make courtsy to disclose it, for that many euils cary this nature, rather to bee concealed with griefe, then reuealed in hope of releife. And as a greene wound by taking the aire spredeth farther abroad and is the hardlier healed, so I thinke my tormente and greife beeinge once discouered, would not bee so easely cured. If (sayth his frend) the originall of your euil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1570:49"/>
of loue as in my fancy it doth, then vndoubtedly the more it is vncouered the sooner is it cured, for as coales of fire couered cloase with ashes keepe their heate longe time, but lying open soone waxe colde and blacke, so the firy flames of loue raked vp in silence, burne furiously within a man, but béeinge by discourse disclosed they soone conuert from flame to fume and smoake. Wherefore (good freinde) sticke not to imparte vnto mée this matter which doth import you so nere, promising you by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable bond of freindship to trauaile so ernestly in your affaires, that what wanteth in power, you shall finde in the paines which I will take in your cause. Alas swéet freind (saith <hi>Icilius</hi>) rather then you should thinke I haue any diffidence or distrust in you, or thinke you vnwoorthy of credite in any cause whatsoeuer, I will make you pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy to the cause of my paine what pange or perill so euer I incur therby. Wherefore you shal vnderstand that since the time I was at the house of <hi>L. Virginius,</hi> as you part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, the conditions of his daughter did so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent mée, her nature agréed so well with mine, her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were so framed to my fancy, that I am constrained to resigne my liberty captiue vnto her, and to make her person the prison of my hart. And the lesse hope I haue of obtayning her, the more doo I loue: and the more déepely I doo desire her, the more deadly doo I dispaire of her: which is the cause of all my care and summe of all my so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: yea this is it which hath made mee an enemie to my selfe, a straunger to my freindes, to abandon all good company, to sit in solitarinesse, and this is it which, if it bée not in time prouided for, will preuente by death all other mischeifs. God forbid good freind (sayth his freind) that so light a cause should so déepely distres you: what, doo you thinke either so superstitiously of her, either so abiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of your selfe, that you deeme this matter so impossible to bee brought to passe? Why her person is not of sutch perfection, but that yours may match it: her freindes are
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1570:49"/>
not of sutch state, but that yours may stand by them: her portion is not so greate, but your parentes are able to make yours equall vnto it. No, doubt not but your loue shall sort to lucky ende, and haue sutch successe you seeke for: and I am hartely glad, that seeinge it was your chaunce to loose your liberty, it is lodged in sutch a place, which is rather to bée counted a Paradise of pleasure, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a prison of paine, of whose worthynes I would somwhat say, but that perchaunce you will thinke mee partiall to the party, and besides that I should rather kindle newe coales in you, then quench olde flames. But bicause I perswade my selfe I may doe somewhat with the partie which putteth you to this paine, doubt not to commit this charge to mee, and I warrant you I will discharge it to your contentation. Ah deare freind (sayth <hi>Icilius</hi>) if I thought you as well able to giue order to my sorrow and redresse my woe, as I see you willing to comfort my care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and keepe mee from dispaire, I should thinke my self the happiest wight in the world, and I would account of you as the preseruer of my life, but I can not tell what the matter is, méethinkes the more feruent is my fire, the more faint is my feare. Phy (sayth his freind) you shew your selfe to very a coward, fortune you knowe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth not the faint hearted, neither are they woorthy to win the pray you presse for, and therefore for shame take a good heart vnto you, and doe your indeuour, and let mee alone with the rest: there is no hauke soareth so highe but shee will stoupe to some praye, neither any so rammishe and wilde but in time shee may bee reclaimed and made to the lure. And if you follow my aduise, I think good you solicite her by letters vntill sutch time you haue conuenient time to goe thither your selfe.

               <p>Ah <hi>(Maister Icilius)</hi> my tounge is not able to tell the hurt which my hart sustayneth by the couetous cruelty of my parentes, who in a gréedy desire of goods, go about to stay mee from that wherevpon my life doth stay and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende, and were it not that your great curtesie and loue towardes mee did somwhat moderate and mitigate my martirdome, I should neuer bee able to beare the vnsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable burthen therof. But now I vnderstande by you I shall lose your companie, which was my only comforte and consolation, what resteth for mee, but notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge I was neuer married, yet to continue and leade a wofull widowes lothsome life, and to spende my golden yéeres in galdynge greeife. I could rehearse vnto you, and you your selfe can better tell, the infinite and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perils which alwayes wayte on warre, but that I doubt therby I should rather increase your gréeif, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your determination, but this request at least, yea and perchaunce the last, let mée make vnto you, that in warre you be warie, in battaile rather to backward then to bolde in field rather to flying then to forwarde, and if you take no care of your selfe, yet make some spare of mee. For perswade your selfe this, out of euery wound which your
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1570:51"/>
body shall receiue, will issue as well my bloud as yours.</p>
               <p>And for constancie in your absence assure your selfe, <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> will alway bée the vowed vassall of <hi>Icilius.</hi> And as the Laurell or Bay tree ceaseth not to bée green, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng the parchyng Sommer, and pinchyng Winter, so will I neuer cease to bee fresh in freendship, and green in godwill towardes you, nothwithstandyng the sharpe stormes of absence, the distance of place, and difference of time. But here teares stayed the talk of the one, and time tooke away any longer abode of the other, whervpon they were constrained after a few carefull kisses, to giue eche other a faintyng farewell. Neither is it easie to poynte foorth the payne wherwith this partinge pinched bothe these poore louers, but surely in my fancie of al greifes it is most gripyng when freindes are forced to parte eche from other, when one hart is placed in two places, when one member is torne as it were from another, when ownes selfe is separated from him selfe, or at least his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde selfe. But their partyng was not so paynfull, but that shortly after their meetyng was as mornefull. For not longe after the departure of <hi>Icilius:</hi> as <hi>Virginia</hi> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked abroade somwhat to recreate and solace her sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full selfe, it was her fortune vnfortunately to bée seene by one <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> one of the <hi>Decemuirs,</hi> who were the cheife rulers of the citie, who by the furies of Hell was so set on fire in libidinous lust towardes that virgin, that he sought all the meanes possible to winne her to his wicked will: but seeyng her to firmely fortified in vertue, to bee by consent vanquished by villany, hée determined by force to force her to his filthinesse. And as nothinge is so impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible which frantike furie will not enterprise, nothyng so shamefull whiche vnbrideled desire will not vndertake, nothing so false which fleshly filthinesse will not forge, so to brynge his purpose to passe hee coyned this deuise, hee caused one <hi>Marcus Cloudius</hi> a client of his, to lay clayme to the mayde as his bonde slaue: Who partly for awe of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1570:52"/>
the tyrant, partly béeyng apt of himselfe to vndertake any euill, tooke the matter vpon him, and the next time hee tooke her out of her fathers house, hee layde handes vpon her, commaunding her to folow him home, to the end <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> might haue had his pleasure of her. But by the pitiful exclamation of the mayde and her nurse, a greate multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people began to muster about them, who hearyng whose daughter shee was, and that shee was béetrothed to <hi>Icilius,</hi> thought it vnseemly that in the absence of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and freind (who were both in the warres) she should bee violently caried into bondage, the title béeyng not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed by the lawes, and therevpon with held <hi>M. Cloudius</hi> from hauynge hir away. Who séeynge his might ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matcht by the multitude, tolde them hee ment not to deale by force, but his minde was for the playne proufe of his tytle and interest in her, to haue her beefore the cheif ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate of the citie, and only iudge in ciuil controuersies, who was <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> the only author of this euill.</p>
               <p>Béeyng come béefore him, hee tolde a solemne tale for the confirmation of his right in the mayde, saying shee was the daughter of a bond woman of his, that in her infancy shee was stolen from her mother, conueyed to <hi>Virginius,</hi> and from that time brought vp at his house and taken for his naturall childe, and for proufe hereof hée brought in two or three knightes of the post to depose. The freindes of the maide not able to refell this forged tale, desired of the <hi>Iudas</hi> iudge that the matter might bée adiourned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the comming of her father <hi>Virginius. Apius</hi> answered that hee thought it good the matter should hange in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence vntill the returne of her supposed father, but it was no reason but that hee who pretended, yea and had proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to haue sutch right to her, should haue her in his cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody, vntill the matter were more examined: and vpon his honour hée promised shee should bee foorth comminge to appeare at the time of her fathers approche. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hearinge this iniurious iudgment of <hi>Appius,</hi> rather
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1570:52"/>
murmured at it, then durst make resistance against it, by reason wherof <hi>Marcus Cloudius</hi> béegan to draw the maid to bee defloured, as the tiger in <hi>Hyrcane</hi> wooddes haleth the lambe to bée deuoured. But god y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righter of al wrongs and protector of all pure virgins, preuented the perill which hong ouer her head, &amp; sent home from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres to succour her, her vncle <hi>Numitorius,</hi> and her spouse <hi>Icilius:</hi> who hearinge the haynousnesse of the matter, presently presed to the place where <hi>Appius</hi> sate in iudgement, but hee commaunded his officers to kéepe <hi>Icilius</hi> backe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Icilius</hi> inueighed against him in this sort.</p>
               <p>Albeit (O <hi>Appius</hi>) by force you keepe mee from keepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge mine owne out of your handes, yet shall you not stay my toung from detecting the villany which you indeuour to doe. For the truth is, this virgin is betrothed to mée, and my minde is to marrie her a chast maide, therfore as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure your selfe if it lie in mee to let, shee shal not remaine one minute of an houre out of her fathers house. Is it not sufficiente for you to depriue the people of the cheife pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of their liberty, but that our wiues and children also must liue in slauery to your tirranny? Exercise your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty on our bodies, at least let chastity bee in safety.</p>
               <p>Ought princes to giue light of life to their people, and wil you make your selfe a mirrour of mischeife to your poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? But if you minde to take her away from vs by force and from her, her virginity, neuer thinke to doe it while I haue any breath left in my body, for in this iust cause and quarrell of my wife, life shall sooner leaue mee then loyalty. <hi>Appius</hi> thinkinge the power of <hi>Icilius</hi> would preuaile aboue his, for that the multitude meruaylously inclined to his side, sayd hée would haue another time to represse the rebellious rage of <hi>Icilius,</hi> and touchinge the maide for her fathers sake hee was content to defer the pronouncinge of sentence against her, vntill the nexte court day that her father might bee present, in the meane while hée would intreate <hi>Marcus Cloudius</hi> to forbeare his
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1570:53"/>
right: but if her father came not by the next court day, hee would defer the execution of iustice for no mans ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Presently vpon this hee dispatched letters to the captaine generall of the army, that hee should not in any wise dismisse <hi>Virginius</hi> or suffer him to come home: but <hi>Icilius</hi> had sent for him with such spéede that he had leaue to depart beefore those letters came to the captayne, so it pleased god to preuent the pollicy and wicked purpose of <hi>Appius.</hi> Now <hi>Virginius</hi> béeinge come to <hi>Rome,</hi> went with his daughter to the iudgement place, and did there lamentably implore the helpe of the people, sayinge: while I with the rest of the souldiours haue hazarded our liues in the defence of you and your children, I am in daunger to haue mine owne daughter dispoyled: &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by my helpe our city is preserued from enemies, I my selfe am brought to sutch misery, as if it were taken by our enemies and vtterly razed to the ground. For what greater villany can bée done to the vanquished, then to sée béefore their eyes their wiues and children desloured and defiled? But neighbours and freindes if you suffer mée to sustaine this iniury, assure your selues your staffe stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth next to the dore, and looke no longer to bée husbands ouer your wiues, and parentes ouer your children, then it shall please these tirantes to giue you leaue. Any euill at the first entring in of it may easely bée auoyded, but let one or two presidentes passe patiently without resisting, and it will run into a custome, and from thence to a law, and you will neuer bée able after to rid your handes of it. And if your owne safety driue you not to succour mée, yet let my old yeeres, my hoary heires, the honest port which I haue euer maintained, and the chast life of my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moue you to put to your handes to helpe redresse my wronge. By this time <hi>Appius</hi> was come to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment place with a great troupe of armed men, and séeing <hi>Virginius</hi> there contrary to his expectation, and percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning no colour of law could cloud his dooings, hée set down
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1570:53"/>
his owne will for a law, and sayd hée would defraud <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Cloudius</hi> no longer of his right, and séeinge the maide was conuicted by proufe and witnes to bée his bond maid, he gaue sentence that he should presently haue her away, not suffering her father to alleage any thing for her frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>Virginius</hi> seeing this extreeme dealing of <hi>Appius</hi> threatningly shooke his hands at him, saying, I haue bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed my daughter to <hi>Icilius</hi> not to thee (O <hi>Appius</hi>) &amp; I haue brought her vp to bee an honest maried woman, not thy harlot. What doest thou thinke vnder the pretence of bondage, to make her bound to thy beastlinesse? <hi>Appius</hi> not regarding his rayling caused his officers to make the multitude giue place to <hi>Marcus Cloudius</hi> that hee might quietly cary away his bond mayd, by reason wherof <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> was left voide of helpe and rescue, which her father perceiuing and séeing him self not able to deliuer her out of her enemies handes, to defer the time hopinge still for helpe, hée vsed this pollicy: hée desired <hi>Appius</hi> hee might haue his daughter aside, and betwéene her nurce and her examine the matter, that if it were found hée were but her fained father, hée might the more willingly depart with her. Which béeing by <hi>Appius</hi> graunted, they thrée went aside together, where <hi>Virginia</hi> fell downe vpon her knees and made this ruthles request vnto her father.</p>
               <p>I perceiue (deare father) it is not without great cause that the philosophers were of this opinion, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test felicity is neuer to bée borne, and the second soone to die, now séeing by your meanes I am depriued of the first I beseech you by your meanes let mee inioy the second: and to counteruayle the lucklesse and lothsome life which you haue giuen mée, vouchsafe to bestow on mee an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable death. And as by your fatherly care I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a continent virgin hetherto, so by your furthering aide I praye you let mee dye an honest mayde presently: least my life hereafter, contaminate y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> commendation of my life heretofore: and seeing I can bee no longer suffred
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1570:54"/>
to liue honestly, good father let mee die honourably? For an honourable death is alwayes to bee preferred beefore an infamous life, of euils the least is to bee chosen, and death of body is to bee counted a lesse euill, then distructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of body and soule. I thinke I may by more right craue your helpe herein, for that partly by your meanes I am fallen into this extremity, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> you would not agree to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> consummation of the mariage betweene <hi>Icilius</hi> and mee, and howe you can deliuer mee, but by deliuering mee to death I see not, for that your power is to weake to wreak the wrong which is offred mee, and your force is to féeble to fence mee from the fury of my foes. Therfore seeing hee will needes haue my body (sweet father) let him haue it dead, that I may not feele the filthinesse which hee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth to force mee too. Her father melting into teares at her pitifull sute, carefully kissing her, commended her couragious minde, rather confirming her in her constant couragiousnesse, then disswadinge her from her purpose. By this time the tirantes traine beegan to flocke aboute them to haue her away, which <hi>Virginius</hi> seeing snatched a butchers knife from the shambels and thrust therewith his daughter to the heart, saying: O daughter, by this only meane wherby I may doe I make thee free. <hi>Icilius</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge his spouse thus spoyled, spent no time in triflinge teares, but by the helpe of his father in lawe <hi>Virginius,</hi> prosecuted the matter so ernestly against <hi>Appius</hi> that hee was throwen into prison, where for shame of his deede and dread of deserued punnishment, hee did him selfe des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately to death.</p>
               <p>You see here Gentlewomen, a most lamentable death of a most vertuous virgin, wherein you may note a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minde in her to desyre it, a stout courage in her father to doe it, and most outragious tyranny in <hi>Appius</hi> to driue them to it: wherby you may learne that vertue and chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is to bee preferred beefore worlde or wealth, beefore freind or father, before loue or liuing, before life or death.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1570:54"/>
Therfore, if I were either in wit able or otherwise wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to giue you counsayle, I would aduise you to auoyde the traines of sutch tyrauntes, to kéepe you out of the sight of sutch seedsuckers, and to fly from sutch <hi>Senes fornecato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res:</hi> sutch raueninge wolues in shéepes cloathinge are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest to deuoure sutch swéete shéepe, sutch olde dogs euer bite forest, sutch grauity for the most parte contayneth most incontinency. For if their lust were not more then outragious, either their great discretion would represse it, either their many yéeres would mortify it, either their owne wiues would satisfie it. But vse of euill maketh vs thinke it no abuse, sinnes oft assayed are thought to bée no sinne, and these grayheaded gamesters haue the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite of this mischeife so déepely rooted in them, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence will frie their fleshe, till breath doe leaue their bodyes.</p>
               <p>And as I would you should auoide these olde youthes in the way of wickednesse, so if my wish might wield your willes, you should neither medle with them in the way of mariage. For perfect loue can neuer bée without equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, there can bée no good agréement of affections, where there is sutch difference of yéeres. Can fire &amp; water, can flowers &amp; frost, can warmth and winter, can mirth &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy agrée together? No surely Gentlewomen but if you wil haue it so, I wil beléeue this matter mooueth you nothing: Yet what say you to another point, &amp; that a most perilous point, when to impotencie shalbe added Ielousy? This is a pill of harde digestion, this is a pill which if it bée a litle chewed, it will bée so bitter that you will neuer bee able to abide it. For when sutch an one shall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure your déedes by his owne desire, and your life present by his owne life past, when hée shall thinke you to bee naught, bicause hee him selfe hath bene naught: good god how cloasely then will hee mew you vp? how carefully will hee looke to you? How lothsomely will hee cloy you with his company? Then will you wishe you vnmaried,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1570:55"/>
then will you wishe you had maried with a younge man: they wil loue and not doate, they will bée zelous and not Ielous. And if your parentes in some curious or coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous respecte goe about otherwise to dispose of you, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly request them you may chuse where you like, and link where you loue, that you may bee married to a man ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then mony, to quiet rather then coine. Dutifully tell them that sutch presinesse of parentes brought <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe</hi> to a wofull end, <hi>Romeo</hi> and <hi>Iulietta</hi> to vntimely death, and draue <hi>Virginius</hi> miserably to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his owne daughter <hi>Virginia.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>IT is a saying no lesse common then commonly proued true, that Marriages are guided by destinie, &amp; amongst all the contractes which concerne the life of man, I think they only bee not in our owne power or pleasure: which may plainly appeare by this, that when the choice of sutch marriages doth chaunce vnto vs as wée our selues can wish, when they may by their parents &amp; freindes counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

               <p>There raygned in the lande of <hi>Lybia</hi> one <hi>Atys,</hi> who had to his neighbour more neere then was necessary one <hi>Lycabas</hi> kynge of Assur, which princes rather couetynge their neighbours dominions, then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentyng themselues with their owne, incroched eche one vpon others right, and continued continuall warre one against the other. But at length <hi>Atys,</hi> whether hee were weried and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with warre, or whether hee had occasion to bend his force some other way, or whether hée were disposed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into league and amitie with his neighbours I know not, but hée sent his one sonne <hi>Admetus</hi> to <hi>Lycabas</hi> to parlée of a peace. Now Lycabas either thinkyng hée had him at some aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, either not minding to put vp iniu ries béefore receiued, would accept no conditions of peace, but by <hi>Admetus</hi> sent his father flat defiance. So that the warre continued between them in as great rage as it had done the former time of their raygne. But yet hate cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not sutch hoate skirmishes between the parentes, but that loue forced as fierce assaultes between the children. For it was so that <hi>Lycabas</hi> had a daughter named <hi>Alcest,</hi> who what time <hi>Admetus</hi> was in her fathers court to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of peace, chaunced out at her chaumber window to haue a sight of him, and hee at the same time happened to incounter a vewe of her.

great flouddes, and as of litle seedes grow greate trees, so of this litle looke and sight grew sutch great loue and delight that death it selfe could not dissolue it. For as women bee of delicate and fine mettall, and therefore soone subiect to loue, so <hi>Alcest</hi> after this first sight was so ouergone in goodwill towardes <hi>Admetus,</hi> that shee fixed her only felicitie in framyng in her fancie the fourme of his face, and printyng in her heart the perfection of his person. And as nothyng breedeth bane to the body sooner then trouble of minde, so shee perseuered so longe in sutch pensiue passyons, and carefull cogitations, that her body was brought so lo for lacke of the vse of sleepe and meate, that shee was fayne to keepe her bed: and by reason that shee couertly concealed her greife, it burned so furiously within her, that it had almost cleane consumed her away. Her father seeinge her in this heauy case, assembled all the learned phisitions hee could learne of in the country, who hauinge seene her were all altogether ignorant of her disease, and were at their wits ende what medicine to apply to her malady. Some thought it a consumption, some a burning feuer, some a melancholy humor, some one thing, some another. And her father examyning her how it held her, and what disease shee thought it to bee, shee answered that it was a sicknesse which it pleased god to sende her, and that it was not in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> helpe of Phisicke to heale her, but her health was onely to bee had at gods handes. Nowe <hi>Admetus on</hi> the other side hauinge the profer of many princes made him in the way of mariage, made very carelesse account thereof, and seemed in his minde to bee very angry with those offers: and as the sight of meat is very lothsome to him whose stomacke is ill or hath already eaten his fill, so that litle sight which hee had of <hi>Alcest</hi> had fed his fancy so full, that to see, or so mutch as think, of any other woman was most greeuous vnto him. And notwithstandinge the gripinge paine of loue caused some graftes of greife to begin to growe in

his heart: yet by reason that hée had the conducting of the army royall vnder his father, hée was so busily occupied that he had no great leasure to lodge any louing thoughts within his breast. But sée howe the destinies dealt to driue this bargaine thorow. There aroase a quarrell béetwéene the two armies touchinge certaine pointes wherin the law of armes was thought to bée broken, to decide which controuersy <hi>Admetus</hi> was sent post to <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabas:</hi> who sitting by his daughters bed side, had woorde brought him that <hi>Admetus</hi> was come to the court to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part matters of importance vnto him. Nowe at this instant there chaunced one of the Phisitions to hold <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest</hi> by the arme and to féele her pulses, and where before they beate very féebly as if shée had béene ready to yéelde to the sommance of death, shée no sooner heard that mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage brought vp to her father, but that her pulses began to beat with great force and liuelinesse: which the phisition perceiuinge perswaded him selfe hée had found the cause of her calamity: but for more assured proufe hée whiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the king in the eare desiring him that <hi>Admetus</hi> might bée sent for thither and there to make relation of his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage vnto him: which the kinge caused to bée done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. <hi>Admetus</hi> was no sooner admitted into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but her pulses beegan to beate againe with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full swiftnesse, and so continued all the while hée was in the chaumber. Who séeinge his loue in sutch daunger of her life, though hée vnderstood not the cause therof, yet hée cast sutch a carefull countenance towardes her, that shee easely perceiued hée did participate in payne with her: which made her cast sutch glaunces of goodwill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him, that hée easely vnderstood it was for his sake shée sustained sutch sorow and sicknesse. But the feare of her father, who was his mortall foe, and the vrgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of his affaires, forced him to depart without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting vnto her the manifolde good will hée bare her.

the damsell, yet for that shée knew her loue to bée incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with like affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (wherof before shée stoode in doubt) shee beegan to driue away the darke cloudes of dispaire and to suffer the bright light of hope to shine vpon her. <hi>Admetus</hi> béeing gone, the Phisition tooke the king a syde and tolde him his daughters disease was not deriued of any distemperature of the body but only of the disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the minde: and to tell you the truth plainely (saith hee) it is only the feruent affection shée beareth to that younge prince <hi>Admetus</hi> your enemy that forceth this fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse and faintnes in her. And told the kinge by what meanes hée tried the truth therof. The kinge at these wordes was meruailously disquieted perswading himself that it was so in déede, and that <hi>Admetus</hi> on the other side bare affection to his daughter, for that all the time of his talke with him, hée continually turned his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her bed, and wold often times giue him answeres nothinge pertinent to the questions which hée proposed vnto him, as hauing his cogitations conuersaunt in other matters. Upon this the king went to his daughter, &amp; as the phisition first ministreth to his patient bitter pilles and purgations to expell grose and ill humours, and then applieth lenitiues and restoratiues to bréede and bringe againe good bloud, so hée first vsed sharpe threatnings vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her to expell the force and fury of her loue, and then v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed gentle perswasions to restore her to her former helth and quiet of minde. But neither the sowernesse of the one, neither the swéetnesse of the other could preuayle, for salues seldome helpe an ouerlong suffred sore, it is to late to shut the stable dore when the stéede is stolen, it booteth not to stop the breach when the towne is ouerflo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: it is to late to dislodge loue out of ones breast, when it hath infected béefore euery parte of the body. For as sowninge mortifieth euery member, as pestilence infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth euery part, as poyson pierseth euery vaine, so loue if it bée not in time looked too, will bringe both body and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1570:57"/>
minde to vtter confusion. For this virgin was so van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished by loue, that shée neither forced her fathers faire wordes, neither feared his fierce threatninges, but tolde him plainly shée would not deny the loue she bare <hi>Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> neither could cast out of her minde the liking shée had conceiued of him: and therfore humbly craued pardon if (sayth shee) it bée an offence to loue him honestly, which deserueth it worthily. But her father in a fury flunge from her sayinge, shée should neuer inioy him with ioye, and that shee should neuer finde any more fatherly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance at his handes, then the greatest enemy hee had. The younge princesse perceiuinge her fathers goodwill thus alienated from her, reposed her onely comforte and confidence in <hi>Admetus,</hi> hoping that hée would stande her in stéede of both a freind, phere, and father. And with as conuenient spéede as shee could, wrought a letter to him to this ende.</p>

Therfore you shall vnderstand the cause of my writing is this. What time your good hap (I hope) was to bee at my fathers court, I did perceiue (if desire to haue it so did not deceiue mée) that your affection was great towardes mee, and that you seemed not a litle to bee pinched with my payne, to ease you of which greife I thought it my duty to certify

What dutie can bée a due recompence to this goodwill? If I by any meanes can quite this curtesy, I neuer doubt to bee deemed vngratefull while I liue.

               <p>Few wordes (most worthy prince) are inough to win credite to a matter already beleeued: for onely vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of your constant and faithfull hart towardes mée,

I haue thus vnaduisedly aduentured mine honour as you see, destringe you not sinisterly to thinke of this my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, beeing boldned therto by the greate loue which I bare towardes you, and by the loyalty which I looke for of you towards mee. Ah sayth <hi>Admetus,</hi> if I should make any ill interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your vertuous loue and sincere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towardes mée, I were the veriest villain on earth, for I take god to witnesse I take your forward will for sutch freindly good wil, that I doubt my desertes will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee able so to answere therto as I desire. But here hee aptly ended his talke vpon her mouth, and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into sutch priuy conference, their lips beeing ioyned most closely together, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I can not report the meaninge of it vnto you, but if it please one of you to leane hitherward a litle I will shew you the manner of it. Now hauinge continued some time therin, they at the length entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the temple, wher the mariage accordinge to the sacred rites was solemnly celebrated: which done they entred into a poore cotage, in steede of a princely pallace, ioyning to the temple, where longe they durst not tary for feare of apprehension by postes which pursued them. Therfore puttinge on their pilgrims apparell againe, they wente hand in hand and harte in harte, waylfully and wilfully, wandring out of their owne natiue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, to auoide their parentes punnishment and displeasure. O lamentable lots of loue which draue two princes from theyr pleasant pallaices, from their flourishinge freindes, from their traine of seruauntes, from their sumptuous fare, from their gorgeous garmentes, from variety of delightes, from secure quietnesse, yea from heauenly happinesse, to wilde wildernesse, to deserte dennes, to carefull caues, to hard chéere, with hawes and hippes, to pilgrims peltes, to perill of spoyling, to daunger of deuouring, to misery of minde, to affliction of body, yea to hellish heauines. O pitiles parentes to prefer their owne hate beefore theyr childrens loue, their owne displeasures before their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens

pleasure, to forget y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> themselues were once younge and subiect to loue, to measure the firy slames of youth, by the dead coales of age, to gouerne their children by their owne lust which now is, not which was in times past, to seeke to alter their naturall affection from their children vpon so light a cause, shewinge themselues rebels to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to indeuour to vndoe the destines and disappointe the appointment of the goddes, shewing themselues trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to the goddes. But the one of them, the father of <hi>Admetus</hi> reaped the iust reward of his rigour. For <hi>Atys</hi> after the departure of his sonne tooke the matter very heauily, abandoned all pleasures, auoyded all company, and spent most part of his time in discoursinge with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in this sorrowfull sort.</p>
               <p>If nature by the deuine prouidence of god did not moue vs to the maintenance of mankinde, surely the charge of children is sutch a heauy burthen, that it would fear men from entring into the holy state of matrimony. For to omit the inconueniences of their infancy, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, when they drawe once to mans estate, what time they should bee a stay to our staggeringe state, good God what troubles doe they torment vs with? What cares doe they consume as with? What annoyes doo they afflict our olde yeeres with all? They say wee are renewed and reuiued as it were in our ofspringe, but wee may say wee die dayly in thinkinge of the desperate deedes of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And as the spider feeleth if her web bee prickt but with the point of a pin, so if our childred bee touched but with the least trouble that is, wee feele the force of it to perce vs to the hart. But how well this tender care is by them considered, alas it maketh my hart bleed to think if wee looke for obedience of them, and that they shoulde follow our counsayle in the conuaighe of their affaires, why they thinke wee doate, and that their owne wits are far better then ours: if wée warne them to bee wary and thrifty, they thinke it proceedeth rather of couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1570:61"/>
then of kindenes: if wee prouide them no mariages, it is bicause wee will departe with no liuinge to them: if wée perswade them to mariage, it is bicause wée would haue them forsake all good felowship, &amp; liue like clownes in the countrey by the Plowe tayle: If wée perswade them to learnynge it is that they might liue by it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our charge: if wée perswade them to one wife ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then another, it is bicause the one is ritcher then the other: if wée looke seuerely on them, wée loue them not: if wée vse them familiarly, wée feede them with flattery bicause wée will giue them litle: and so of all our louing dooinges they make these leud deuises: yea when wée haue brought them vp with greate care and coste, when wée haue trauailed all our time by sea and by land, early and late, in paine and in peril, to heape vp treasure for them, when wée haue by continuall toyle shortned our owne liues to lengthen and inlarge their liuinges and possessions, yet if wée suffer them not to royst and to riot, to spill and to spoyle, to swashe and to lashe, to lend and to spende, yea and to followe the fury of their owne frantike fancies in all things, this forsooth is our recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, they wish an end of our liues to haue our liuings. Alas a lamentable case, why hath not nature caused loue to ascend as well as discend? Why hath shee indued the Storke with this property to féede his damme, when shée is olde, and men with sutch malice to wish their parents death when they are aged? But I speake perchaunce of mine owne proper greife, god forbid it should bée a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon case, for my sonne (Ah why doo I call him sonne) hath not only wisht my death but wrought it. Hée knew hée was my onely delight, hée knew I coulde not liue hée béeing out of my sight: hée knew his desperate disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would driue mee to a desperate death. And could hée so mutch doate of a light damsell, to force so litle of his louing father? Alas a wife is to bée preferred before fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and freind. But had hee none to sixe his fancy on
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1570:61"/>
but the daughter of my most furious foe? Alas loue hath no respecte of persons. Yet was not my goodwill and consent to bee craued therin? Alas hee saw no possibility to obtaine it. But now alas I would graunt my goodwil, but now alas it is to late: his feare of my fury is to great euer to bee found, his fault is to great euer to looke mee in the face more, and my sorrowe is to great euer to bee saluted. And therevpon got him to bed and in fiue dayes space his naturall moysture with secret sorrowe was so soken away, that hee could no longer continue his careful life, but yeelded willingly to desired death. So it pleased God to prouide for the poore pilgrimes, who hauing past many a fearful forrest and daungerous desert, were now come to the sea shoare mindinge to take ship and trauell into vnknowen coastes, where they might not by any meanes bee knowne, and béeing on ship borde they heard the mayster of the ship make report that <hi>Atys</hi> king of the <hi>Lybians</hi> was dead. Wherevpon <hi>Admetus</hi> desired to bée set on shoare againe, and dissemblinge the cause thereof, pretended some other matter and got to the next towne wherwith the mony and iewels hée had about him, hee furnished him selfe and his lady with the best apparell could bee prouided in the towne, and with sutch a trayne of men as hee coulde there take vp: whiche done hee made the greatest expedition hee coulde vnto his owne country where hee was royally receiued as prince, and shortly after ioyfully crowned Kinge. And beeing qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, setled in the regall seate, hee presently dispatched Ambassadours to <hi>Lycabas</hi> his fathers foe, and his father in law, whose ambassade contained these two pointes, the one to intreat a peace for his people, the other to craue a pardon for his wife, who willingly graunted both the one and the other. Wherby hee now liued in great quiet and tranquillity. A meruaylous mutabylity of fortune which in the space of a moneth could bring him from hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ioy to heauy annoy, and then from annoy againe to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1570:62"/>
greater ioy then his former ioy. For as the sunne hauing bene long time ouerwhelmed with darke cloudes, when it hath bannished them from aboute it, seemes to shyne more brightly then at any time beefore, so the state and condition of this prince hauinge bene couered with the cloudes of care, now it was cleared of them, seemed more pleasaunt and happy then at any time before. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely as sharpe sauce giues a good taste to sweete meate, so trouble and aduersity, makes quiet and prosperity for more pleasaunt. For hee knoweth not the pleasure of plenty, who hath not felt the paine of penury, hee takes no delight in meate, who is neuer hongry: hee careth not for ease who was neuer troubled with any disease.</p>
               <p>But notwithstandinge the happy life of this prince, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it hee abounded in as great ritches as hee required, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it hee had as many kingedomes as hee coueted, albeit hée had sutch a wife as hee wished for, yea and inioyed all things which either god could giue him, fortune further him to, or nature bestow vpon him: yet to shew that there is no sunne shineth so bright but that cloudes may ouer cast it, no ground so good but that it bringeth forth weeds as well as flowers, no kinge so surely garded, but that the gamesome goddes fortune will at least checke him, if not mate him, no state so plentifull in pleasure, but that it is mixed with paine, hee had some weedes of wo which began to grow vp amongst his flowers of felicity, &amp; some chippes of sory chaunce did light in the heape of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynesse. Yea fortune presented her selfe once agayne vpon the stage and ment to haue one flinge more at him. For this prince possessinge sutch a pleasaunte life, tooke great delight in good house keepinge, and gaue sutch good entertainment to straungers that his fame was far spred into forrain countries: yea the rumor thereof reached to the skies, in so mutch that <hi>Apollo</hi> (as the poets report) hauing occasion to discend from heauen to the earth, went to see the entertainement of <hi>Admetus:</hi> who was so roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1570:62"/>
receiued by him, that the god thought good with some great kindnesse to requite his great curtesie. And as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> and <hi>Laucis,</hi> for their harty house keepinge, were preserued by the goddes from drowning when al the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and people besides were ouerflowen, so the god <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> ment to preserue his life, when all his countrey and people then lyuing should lie full loe in their graues. And of the destinies of death obtained thus much for him, that if when the time and terme of his naturall life drewe to an end, yf any coulde bée found who would willingly die &amp; loose their owne life for him, hee should begin the course of his life againe, and continue on earth another age.</p>
               <p>Now when the time of his naturall life drew to an ende, there was diligent inquiry made who would bée content to abridge their owne dayes, to prolong their princes life. And first the question was put to his freindes (who were néerest to them selues) then to his kinsfolke (whose loue was asmutch of custome as of kindenesse) then to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes (whose affection was as mutch for feare as for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour) then to his seruauntes (who thought their life as swéete as their mayster did his) then to his children (who thought it reason that as their father did first enter into this life so hee should first depart out of this life) so that there coulde none bée founde so franke of their life to set this prince frée from the force of death. Now <hi>Alcest</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the death of her deare husband draw néere, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge her owne life without his life and loue would bée but lothsome vnto her, of her owne accorde offred her selfe to bée sacrificed for her husbandes sake, and to hasten her owne death to prolonge his life. O loyall louing wife, O wight good inough for god him selfe. And yet had shée a husband good inough for her selfe, for hee loued her so intirely that though by loosing her hée might haue gained life long time, yet would hee not by any meanes consent to her death, sayinge, without her life his life would bée more gréeuous vnto him then a thousand deathes.

shée perswaded with him against herself all that shée could saying, I would not (O peerles prince) you should take the matter so kindly at my hands, as though for your sake only I offred vp my life, for it is in déede the commodity of your country and mine owne, béeinge vnder your domy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which driueth mee hereto, knowinge my selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to gouerne them you beeing gone. And considering the dayly warre, the spoylefull wastes, the bloudy blastes, the troublesome strife which your realme is subiect too, I thought you had not loued mee so litle as to leaue mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde you to beare on my weake backe sutch a heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, as I thinke <hi>Atlas</hi> him selfe could scarce sustaine.</p>
               <p>Againe, considering that death is but a fleeting from one life into another, and that from a most miserable lifë to a most happy life, yea from bale to blisse, from care to quiet, from Purgatory to Paradise, I thought you had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied mee so mutch, as to thinke mee vnwoorthy of it. Doo you not know that <hi>Cleouis</hi> and <hi>Byton</hi> had death bestowed on them as the best gifte which God could deuise to giue them, and doe you thinke it can doe mee harme, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeing I may therby doe you good? Alas sweet wife (sayth <hi>Admetus</hi>) this your piety is vnprofitable which is subiect to so many perils. But if death bee so good (good wife) let mée inioy it, who am inioyned to it, and to whom onely it will be good, for death is onely good to mée whom it is giuen, not to you who are not appointed to it. For it is not lawfull for any to leaue this life without speciall permission of the goddes. And as in our court it is lawful for none to haue accesse vnto vs vnlesse by vs hee bee sent for, so neither is it lawfull for any to appeare before the heauenly throne, vnlesse by the goddes hee be sommoned. Neither wil death bee so easy to you as to mee, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is apt to yeelde vnto it. For you see fruite whiche is not ripe, will scarce with strength bee torne from the tree, wheras that which is ripe falleth easely of it owne accord. Therefore (good wife) giue mee leaue to die to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1570:63"/>
whom it wilbee onely good and easy to die. Why sweet husband (sayth shee) the god <hi>Appollo</hi> allowed any that would to die for you, otherwise to what purpose was that which hee obtayned of the destinies for you? And for the vneasines of death, nothing can bee vneasy or hard vnto a willing heart. But bicause your pleasure is so, I am content to continue my carefull life, and with sorrowe to suruiue you. And so left her husbande and went priuily to the Aulter and offred vp her selfe to death to prolonge her husbands life. Which when the king knew, hee would presently haue spoyled him selfe, but his handes had not the power to doe it, for that by the decrée of the destinies hee must now of force liue another age on earth. Which when hée saw, hée filled the court with sutch pitifull way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, sutch bitter weeping, sutch hellishe houlinge, that it pearced the heauens and mooued the gods to take remorse on his misery. And <hi>Proserpine</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> goddes of hell especiallye pitying y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> parting of this louing couple (for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> she her selfe knew the paine of partinge from freinds, beeing by <hi>Dys</hi> stolen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her mother <hi>Ceres</hi>) put life into his wife againe, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> speed sent her vnto him. Who beeing certified here of in his fleepe, early in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> morning waited for her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming seing her come a far of hee had much a do to kepe his soule in his body from flying to meet her.

               <p>This séemeth straunge vnto you (Gentlewoman) that a woman should die and then liue againe, but the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of it is this, that you should die to your selues and liue to your husbandes, that you should counte their life your life, their death your distruction: that you should not care to disease your selues to please them: that you should in all thinges frame your selues to their fancies: that if you see them disposed to mirth, you should indeuour to bee pleasaunt: if they bee solemne, you should bée sad: if they hard, you hauinge: if they delight in haukes, that you
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1570:64"/>
should loue Spanniels: if they hunting, you houndes: if they good company, you good housekéeping: if they bee has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that you should bee pacient: if they bée ielous, that you should lay aside all light lookes: if they frowne, that you feare: if they smile, that you laugh: if they kisse, that you cléepe, or at least giue them two for one: and so that in all thinges you should conforme your selues to their conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion: so shall there bée one will in two minds, one hart in two bodies, and two bodies in one flesh. Meethinkes I heare my wish, wishe mée sutch a wife as I haue spoken of, verily (good wish) you wish your wealth great wealth, and God make mee woorthy of you wish and your wishe and if I might haue my wish I am perswaded you should haue your wish.

               </argument>
               <p>MAny are of opinion that the vertues of loue are very many, &amp; that it is of force to reduce vs from sauage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to ciuilnesse, from folly to wit, from couetousnesse to liberalitie, from clownishnesse to courtlinesse, yea from al vice to all vertue. But if the effectes therof bée rightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, I sée not but that wée may more iustly say, that the inconueniences of loue bée infinite, and that it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs from modesty to impudencie, from learnynge to lewdnesse, from stayed firmnes to staggering fickelnesse, from liberalitie to prodigalitie, from warinesse to wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, from good béehauiour to dissolute liuinge, from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to rage, yea from all goodnesse to all vanitie.

But Gentlewomen, bicause most of you bee maydes (I meane at least taken so) I will manifest vnto you the mischeif of loue by the example of a mayde, in that estate (though I hope not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way) like vnto your selues, that admonished there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1570:65"/>
you may auoyde the like inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience in your selues.</p>
               <p>Therfore you shall vnderstande that ouer the towne <hi>Alcathoé</hi> raigned one <hi>Nysus,</hi> who had to daughter a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell named <hi>Scilla,</hi> a proper swéet wenche, in goodlinesse a goddesse, in shape <hi>Venus</hi> her selfe, in shew a saynt, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of person péerelesse: but in déedes a dayntie daine, in manners a mercilesse mayde, and in workes a wilfull wenche, as by her life you shall perceyue. For there was attendant vpon her father in his court a proper youth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Iphis,</hi> who, as the freshest colours soonest fade the hue, and as the finest mettals soonest breake, so the more noble bloud hee came of, and the finer wit hee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued withall, the sooner was hee made thrall and subiecte to loue: And the more couragious minde hee had, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> more haughtie conquest did hee indeuour to atchiue. For bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng in the dayly sight of <hi>Scilla,</hi> hee béegan firmely to fixe his fonde fancie vpon her fine face. And by reason of his younge yéeres béeyng ignorant that vnder moste gréene grasse lie most great snakes, and vnder intisinge baytes intanglyng hookes, hée bit so gréedely at the bayte of her beutie, that hee swallowed downe the hooke of hatefull hurt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and hurtful heauinesse to his heart. But like a man hee sought meanes to subdue his sorrow and to vanquish this virgin, and first like a bashfull younge man hee soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited his sute by pitiful lookes, thinkyng therby to let her vnderstande his desire. But shee on the other side percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng his intent, cast coy countenances vpon him to driue him to dispayre: so that where béefore his owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

whereby he should incur the Kings displeasure, and <hi>per co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequens</hi> his owne vndoyng. But he tolde this tale to one that had no eares to heare, for the deepenesse of his loue caused deafnesse in him to heare any thinge whiche might help to heale his harebraind head, for forwarde he would with his folly whatsoeuer came of it. The olde Gentleman seeing his vnaduisednes, tolde hym he would so far as he durst féele the fancye of the younge Princesse, and therby he should perceiue how likely he were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile in his purpose. And hauinge conuenient time he fel to sifting her thoughts in this sort.</p>
               <p>Fayre Lady, we haue letters come to the Court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning this newes, that two or thrée younge Princes haue directed their course into this Country to see and assay you in the way of marriage: wherein I doubt not but you will deale to the Kinges maiesties contentation, and to our Countryes commodytie: and to consider that the stay of the whole kingdome standeth vpon your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he whiche marrieth you must after the kings decease succéede as lawfull heire vnto the crowne. Now if you match your selfe with a stranger, it is greatly to be feared that we shall be greatly molested with the fury of forraine force, for that the Kings garde and court for the most part shalbe of his owne Country: and so strangers shal be preferred to offices, and we set besides our liuing, wheras if it shall please you to take to husbande some of your owne country you shalbe as it were King &amp; Quéene your selfe, and he as it were your seruante and subiect. And so shal you raigne in great soueraignitie and we liue in great tranquillytie. His talke beeing ended the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse made hym this prowde answer.</p>
               <p>My Lord, touching my marriage it toucheth me more néerely then you, and my father the Kinges counsell I meane chéefely to follow therin: neither will I so respect your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie to neglect mine owne honour, neither wil I haue more consideration of the stay of my Countrie,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1570:66"/>
then of the state of my callinge, neither in that poynt by your leaue will I prefer the common wealth before mine owne priuate will: for that it is onely I must marrie, which if I doe to my liking, I am lyke to liue pleasaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if otherwise I am sure to liue sowerly all the dayes of my life. And for marryinge any of mine country, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise you for my part I know neuer a Prince in all this country my father excepted. Meaninge she would matche with none vnder the degrée of a Prince. Immediately after this the noble man called his nephew vnto him tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him he thought it as easy a matter to climbe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with ladders, as for so meane a man as he to aspyre to the height of her haughtie minde. The younge Gentleman thinking that his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And knowing that proper Gentlewomen delight in prety Iewels, and that the Goddes them selues are pleased with gifts, he gat the most precious Pearles &amp; dearest Diamonds in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and caused them to be presented vnto the Princesse from hym. But disdainfull rigour so ruled her, that she would not so mutch as looke vpon them, saying she had no néede of his giftes, that he might better bestowe them on those who were not his betters, and that she thought it shame a Princes person should be purchased with perles. The Gentleman though greatly dismaide to sée both his goodwill neclected, and his giftes reiected, yet lyke a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt Souldiour he gaue a freshe onset vppon her with friendlye louing Letters whiche hee wrote in this wise.</p>

               <p>Ah fond foolish girle, and canst thou finde in thine hart to beare freindly affection to thy fathers feendly foe? Can I loue him kindly, who seekes to spoyle my country cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly. Coulde I valiauntly withstande the assaultes of a flourishinge young man, and shall I cowardly yeeld to a fadinge olde man without any assault? O loue without law, O rage without reason, O will without wit, O fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy fraught full of fury and frensy. Good God where are now beecome those lofty lookes I was wonte to vse to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers? Where are the coy countenances, the haughty wordes, the solemne salutacions, the dainty dealinges, the curious congies, and sutch like? Alas now I am made to stoupe without stale, to come without call or lure, yea to the empty fist. But alas who is priuiledged from the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1570:67"/>
force of loue, no there are none so stout but loue maketh them stoupe, none so wise but loue maketh them fooles, none so shamefast but loue maketh them bolde. And though I should first bewray my affection and make loue to kinge <hi>Minos,</hi> the offence is rather to bee pitied then punished. Yea the more frankly I offer him my goodwil, the more freindly no doubt but hee will accept it: and the lesse hée hath deserued it, the more will hée indeuour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to bee thankful for the same. Neither can hee but take it as an vndoubted signe of deepe goodwill if I giue the first onset in this skirmishe: neither can it any way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to my shame, the end béeinge honest and my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge in the way of mariage. And if it bee lawfull to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of creatures without reason, doth not the Cow loe to the Bull, doth not the Mare neigh to the Horse, doth not the Yeaw blea to the Ramme, doth not the Faulcon call to the tossell gentle, the gerfaulcon to the Gerkin, the sparehauke to the Musket? And so of all other creatures the females are more forward that way then the males. Besides that by how mutch weaker wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are then men, by so mutch the more they are to bee borne with all, if they bee lesse able to beare the heauy burthen of loue then men. Againe by how mutch more the loue of women is more feruent then of men, the more fiery flames of force must fry within vs, whiche without great griefe cannot be concealed or couered. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of springeth this errour that women may not first make loue but only of a precise and curious custome, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a preiudicall and carefull custome I may tearme it to vs women: for wherof commeth it that so many of vs are so euill matcht in mariage, but only hereof, that wée are tyed to the hard chose of those that offer their loue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: where as if it were lawfull for vs to make loue where we lyked best, we woulde neuer marry but to our minde and contentation. Lastly I am not the first that haue played the lyke parte, and that whiche is done by
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1570:68"/>
alowable example is lawfully done. For <hi>Venus</hi> her selfe yéelded her selfe to her darlinge <hi>Adonis</hi> withoute any sute made on his part: <hi>Phaedra</hi> made sute to <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus: Oenone</hi> pleaded her right with <hi>Paris: Dido</hi> dyd <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> to vnderstande how déepely she desired him: <hi>Bryses</hi> besought the goodwill of <hi>Achilles: Adalesia</hi> by her gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse made loue to <hi>Alerane:</hi> the Dutchesse of <hi>Sauoy</hi> went on pilgrimage to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Knight <hi>Mendoza:</hi> infinit lyke exampls I could alleage, and why is it not lawfull for me to do the lyke, and make loue to King <hi>Minos,</hi> who perchance would first haue sued to mée, if he had first séene mée? yes let the world iudge what they will, I wyll doe what I shal iudge best for my selfe, and with as conuenient spéede as I may I will either by letters or déedes do <hi>Minos</hi> to vnderstand what minde I beare him. And as she was busely beating her braines here about, one of her most trusty and louing women came<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnto her, humbly requestinge her to make her priuy to the cause of her perplexitie. Alas good miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris (saith she) yf you want any thing, let your friends vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, and it shal be prouided. If my poore seruice may any way serue your turne, assure your selfe neither respect of honour, lyuing or lyfe, shall let mee from doing any thing, which may deliuer you out of distresse: if you haue imprisoned your libertie any where, and giued your selfe in the fetters of fansy, I know a Gentlewoman, my familier freind, who can stand you in as much steed for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> obtaininge of your purpose as any gentlewoman in this Courte.</p>
               <p>The princes desirous of aid in her distres, prayed her woman to procure the comminge of that Gentlewoman with all possible spéede. Whervpon the wayting woman caused one of the princesses gentlemen to goe to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest woman, and in her name to desire her to come to the princesse. You shall vnderstande this gentlewomans name, who was sent for, was <hi>Pandarina,</hi> in her youth a seruinge woman, and one which knewe more fashions

But nowe married to an honest Gentleman, shée entred into a newe religion seeming to renounce her olde fayth, &amp; setling her selfe in sutch hipocrysy, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> she rather counterfaited cunningly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liued co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. But to paint her out more plainly she was more coy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cumly, more fine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel fauored, more loftly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> louely, more proud then proper, more precise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pure, more superstitious then religious, more of spighte then of the spirit, and yet nothing but honesty would downe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her, more Ielous then zelous, either iudging her husband by her selfe, or iudginge her selfe vnworthy the seuerall vse of so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious a commen as her husband was. Well sutch as shee was this younge gentleman of the younge princesse was sent for her, &amp; at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first comming according to the fashion hee kist her, and hauing done his message, with frowning face shee told him shee could not goe to the princesse, and though shee could yet would shee not goe with him. The Gentleman somwhat abashed hereat, returned to the gentlewoman that sent him, and told her what answere this honest woman made. Who mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing mutch therat went presently her selfe vnto her, desiring that gentleman to accompany her. Béeinge come to her lodging, after a few salutacions, <hi>Pandarina</hi> prayed the gentlewoman either to send vnto her a more modest messenger then the gentleman shee sent, or els to teache him to kisse more continently. The gentlewoman blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge for bashfulnes, told her she had not the skill to teache men to kisse, shee thought that cunning concerned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon harlots, or at least married women rather then her, but, sayth shee, I will tell him of it, that of him selfe hee may amend his fault, and callinge the gentleman aside vnto her, shée asked him how hée had misused him selfe towards Misteris <hi>Pandarina</hi> in kissinge her. No way (sayth hee) that I knowe for, but if I kissed her boldly, I trust shee wil attribute it to young mens bashfulnesse, and if I kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her kindly, I trust she wyll impute it to good will. Yes
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1570:69"/>
mary (sayth the gentlewoman) it was more hindely then shee cared for or liked of. Uerily (sayth hee) if it were ouer kinde, it is more then I know, or more then I ment for to speake my fancy freely, I know neuer a gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this lande, that I like of worse: and if shee bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferde I bee to far in loue with her, I will bee bound in what bond shee will, to hate her no man more. But gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, if you adhibite any credite to my counsayle, flie her familiarity, eschew her company, sutch sayntes in shewe are Satans in déede, sutch fayned holinesse is double diue lishnesse, sutch counterfayte continencye I count litle better then baudry. For sure this is a most sure marke to knowe dissemblers by, that they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes far excéede the meane, for feare of béeing found in their fayning. As those that fayne to weepe, houle out right: those that fayne to bee freindly, shew them selues plaine <hi>Parasites:</hi> as those that fayne to bee valiant, brag most gloriously: and as shee counterfaytinge continency, sheweth her selfe altogether curious and hipocritiall.</p>
               <p>But notwithstandinge I haue had no knowledge of her life and conuersation, yet dare I lay my life on it, that either shee hath bene naught, is naught, or wilbe naught whensoeuer shee can get any foule adultrour fit for so fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy an adultresse. The Gentlewoman hearing him so er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, prayed him to put vp the matter patiently, sayinge shee thought it was but a shift to excuse her not comminge to the princesse: and so went to <hi>Pandarina</hi> telling her the Gentleman was sory hée had offended her, and so away they went together to the princesse. I haue wandred, Gentlewomen, somwhat béesides the path of my promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed purpose, but yet not cleane out of the way of mine owne will and intent. For though this digressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pertaine litle to the history I haue in hande, yet it may serue to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish you that you take not executions of curiosyty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst kisses which are giuen you of curtesy: and if there chaunce to bée any fault in them, either modesty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1570:69"/>
it, or presently to returne the kisses againe to him, which gaue them. But in excusing my former digression, I shall enter into another digression, therefore to the matter and purpose proposed. <hi>Pandarina</hi> beeinge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the presence of the Princesse, hauinge done dutifull reuerence humblye craued to knowe her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Nay rather answered the princesse, it is my payne Gentlewoman which I meane to make you priuy to: and blushing either for giltinesse or for bashfulnesse, shée vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> secrets of her thoughts to <hi>Pandarina</hi> in this sorte.</p>
               <p>Gentlewoman, but that I know to whom I speake, I shoulde perchaunce bée in doubt what to speake in this matter, which is somewhat vnmeete for my maydenly estate. But considering you are a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and one who no doubt in your time haue felt the force of loue, I perswade my selfe I may boldly impart vnto you the panges of my passion, as to one who (I hope) will rather seeke a salue for my sore, then thinke sinisterly of my dooinges. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you shall vnderstand that the sight of Kinge <hi>Minos,</hi> who layeth siege to our city, hath made sutch a breach in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my heart, that I lie altogether open to his assaultes, and am fayne to yeeld my selfe his prisoner and captiue. And though it may seeme straunge vnto you that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces béeinge not bent against mée, should haue sutch force ouer mée, yet it is often séene that a dart leueled at one, lightes on another. And though you may meruayle to sée mée yéelde beefore any onset bee giuen, yet no doubt that cittie merittes more mercy which yéeldeth without assault, then that which standeth to the doubtfull euent of battayle, and after mutch effusion of bloud, yeldeth when it is able to stand no longer in defence. For here the losse in the siege, taketh away the gaine in the conquest, the paine in pursuing, taketh away the plesure in possessing, and the hardnesse in winning drowneth the happinesse in wearing. And surely if maides would follow my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle, I would not wish them to set sutch solemne lookes,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1570:70"/>
to vse sutch nice denials and dainty delayes to those, whom they thinke worthy of them, and whom they mean only shall inioy them. For they gaine nothing hereby but deferre their owne releife, and increase their louers greife. Béesides that when they are so hardly wonne, it is a signe they yéeld rather by importunity of the wooer, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by any inclination of goodwill on their owne part. But what neede I vse this defence, where no body chargeth mée with any offence? This rather lieth mée vpon, ernest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to craue your aide &amp; assistance in this my distresse, and that you will either by counsayle cure my disease, either by paine or pollicy put mee in possession of my desire.</p>
               <p>I am thus bolde to commit this matter vnto you, presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of your good wit, and goodwill towardes mée. And if you shew sutch faythfull freindlynesse herein, as I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily looke for, assure your selfe I will in sutch freindly manner requite it as you shall very well like of. Miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris <hi>Pandarina</hi> hauing attentiuely attended her talke, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully replied in this sorte.</p>
               <p>Most excellent Princesse, I am humbly to thanke you that it pleaseth you to repose sutch credite in mée as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloase your secretes to mée, and I shall thinke my selfe most happy, if my duty may any way doe you good, or my seruice satisfie your expectation. And touching your loue it is sutch that you néede not bée ashamed to shew it, yea in my iudgemente it is rather to bée commended euery way, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned any way. For first in that your fancy is fixed on a prince, you shew your princely minde in ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your like: then in that you seke to ioyne your selfe to him in mariage, you shew your godly disposition, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to quenche the desires of your harte by that godly meane which god hath made and appointed. Thirdly in louinge your fathers soe, you followe gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who willeth you to requite good for euill. Yea and by this meanes you may bée a meane to make peace and amity betweene two enemies, and saue your cittie front

siege and sacke. Lastly in that you yeeld so quickly to the alarms of loue, you shew your fine nature and wit which are soonest subiect to the impression of loue. And for your opinion touching the dealing of dainty damsels, you are no doubt (Madame) in the right. For those which are so coyishe &amp; wilde, or so haggarde like, that searce in seuen yeeres sute they will bée reclaimed, they plainely shewe themselues either to bée of base mettal, as not to bée capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of loue, either of grose wittes as not to vnderstande when loue is made vnto them, either of slender iudgment as not to accept good offers, either of incontinent conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation as beeing loth to bee tied to one diet, either of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constaunt conditions, as iudging men as light of loue as themselues are lend of life, or els some way imperfecte that they are not meet for the holy state of matrimony.</p>
               <p>Now wheras you craue my counsel and helpe to the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of your good purpose to passe, good Madame would I were as well able as willinge to doe you good: but so far as my simple wits can see in the matter, I thinke this way the best to worke your will: you knowe your father hath on his head a golden haire whereon dependeth the stay of his state and puissance of his power, no more but when your father is a sleepe, pull of the the heire and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent kinge <hi>Minos</hi> therwith and no doubt but hee will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace you as the autor of his victory, and receiue you for his lawful and louing wife, so shal you redresse your own distres, and preserue the life of your father and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who perchaunce by the continuance of this warre, may come to confusion. The princesse likinge reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well of this practise of <hi>Pandarina,</hi> gaue her thankes for her good counsayle, and departed into her chamber by her selfe to thinke more of the matter, where shee entred with her selfe into these contrarieties.</p>
               <p>I sée there is no disease so desperate, but if it be taken in time phisick may help it: no matter so harde but poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie can preuaile in it, nor no policye so good but expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1570:71"/>
will put into our heads: as may be séene by the sound aduice and perfect polycie of <hi>Pandarina.</hi> I warrant I am not the first clyent that this counsellour hath had, I am not the first <hi>Pupill</hi> that she hath practised for, this is not the first sluttish sute that she hath bene Solicyter in, this is not the first honest match that she hath made. But stay, let me not commend her cunning and counsell to mutch, before I consider better of the goodnesse thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I must forsooth pull of my fathers golden haire and present <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> therwith: a light matter it séemeth to pul of a haire, but alas, that haire containeth my fathers helpe, his hope, his hap, his strength, his power, his conquest, and his kingdome. Shall I then so mutch transgresse the lawes of nature to bring him to a miserable plight, who was the cause that I came into this ioyfull lighte? Who from my infancy carefully cherished, and fatherlye foste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mee vp, whom by humaine and deuine lawes I am bound to obey honor and loue?

Is it lykely hee will receiue a runnagate from her cittie, a beetrayer of her Father? Can hee think to finde mee faithfull towards him, that am faithlesse to mine owne father?

The night following (sutch hast her hot loue required) she shewd her selfe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steris of her word though not of her selfe, and performed that which shee sayde she would. For her father beeing a sleepe, shée got softly to him and cut of his precious haire which had in it sutch vertue. Which done, shée went to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1570:72"/>
King <hi>Minos</hi> and presented him therewith, who in most reprochefull wordes reprehended her déede, and in most disdainfull sort reiected her loue. But she not meaning to leaue her loue while shee had lyfe, leapt into the sea to swim after him as hee sayled away. And so quenched her desire in the bottome of the sea.</p>
               <p>You see here, Gentlewomen, she y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> would not looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her <hi>Iphis,</hi> coulde not be looked vpon by her <hi>Minos.</hi> Shee that would make no account of her inferriour, could not be accounted of by her superiour. For it is a plaine case, (and therfore looke to it) that they which deale rigorously with other, shall bée rudely dealt withal themselues. But I am by this story chiefely to admonish you that you pull not of your fathers haire that is, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> you pul not their harts out of their bodies, by vnaduisedly castinge your selues away in matching in marriage with those who are not meet for you. That is to pull of your fathers haire, when you shall cast of the bridle of obedience, rashly run at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, rudely neglect his precepts, and presumptuously place your selues in marriage contrarie to his pleasure: that is to pull of your Fathers haire. But (Soueraigne) now your father is gone, I will giue you more sound ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: I will admonishe you all not to pull of your owne haire, that is not to binde your selues to the froward faust of your politique parents, but to make your choice in mar riage according to your owne mindes: for ouer widowes you sée Fathers haue no prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of power touching their marriages: and you are not to know that mariage is a contract consisting of the frée consent of both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that onely is required in the consummation of marriages: and the <hi>Rodians</hi> haue this law, that onely the mothers haue rule ouer the Daughters. But mum, <hi>lupus in fabula.</hi> I must (I say) admonish you y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> as your parents gaue you your bodies, so they may dispose of them. That you requight all their loue, care and cost, at least with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. I must tel you that if you honour not them your

               <p>SUrely Gentlewomen, either according to <hi>Ouid</hi> his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion <hi>Forma numen habet,</hi> Beutie hath some diuinity or Godhead in it, or els contrary to the common opinion, loue is some heauenly influence and no earthly accident. For of euery earthly and mortall motion there may some probable reason or naturall cause bee giuen: as euery ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature desireth that whiche is good and agréeable to it nature, bicause euery thinge is déere to it selfe, and desireth the conseruation of it selfe in it kinde. As the earth draweth downward, beecause it is heauy, the fyre flyeth vpward beecause it is light, the water contrarie to it nature oftentimes ascendeth to the top of high hyls to avoyde vacantnesse. The aire for the same cause often times discendeth into the pores of the earth: as cholerike complexions are soonest intensed to anger, beecause they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1570:73"/>
abound with heate, as women are not so subiect to anger as men beecause they are more colde of nature. And so of all humaine actions &amp; natural effectes, there may be some probable reason and naturall cause yéelded. But of loue it is so farre without the compasse of reason and bounds of nature, that there can no reason, no cause, no coniectur bee geuen of it. Neither what it is, working sutch diuers effects, neither whence it is, procéedinge of so diuers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, neither whether it will béeing neuer satisfied. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no earthly thing but some supernal power sure it is, as your selues (I thinke) will say by that time you haue harde the History of <hi>Curiatius</hi> who was sodenly strocken therewith as if it had béene with some thunder or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from heauen. For you shall vnderstande this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman dwelling in a towne named <hi>Albania,</hi> situate néere vnto the Cittie of <hi>Rome,</hi> hee made dayly repaire vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> both in respect of profit, as to deale with marchants in matters of waight, and in respect of pleasure, as to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the felowship of lusty younge Gentlemen whiche flourished in that Cittie. Now it was his chaunce as hee strayed about the stréetes, to sée a proper Gentlewoman named <hi>Horatia,</hi> sittinge at her Fathers dore to take the aire, and to recreate her selfe with the sighte of those that passed by: and notwithstandinge he had neuer séene her before, yet through the deuine power of loue, he was so blasted with her beautie, that he presently procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her the soueraigne of his thoughtes, and gouerness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of all his doinges. And hauinge passed by her twise or thrise with lookes shewing his loue, and salutations sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifiyng his sute, he could not be so satisfied but banishing bashfulnes, he couragiously incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred her in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner.</p>
               <p>Gentlewoman, God saue you, and send you that which you wish, and to wish that which I would.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1570:73"/>
swéet face, whiche is the cause that hath made mée thus boldly to intrude my selfe into your company. But set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your goodnesse against my rudenesse, I doubte not but you will attribute it rather to abundaunce of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, then to want of good behauiour, and rather take it for good meaning then yll manner. But if it please you not thus frindly to interpret it, yet at least I beséech you not to impute it to my boldnesse, but to your owne beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for as the Larketaker in his day net hath a glasse whereon while the birdes sit and gaze they are taken in the net, so your face hath sutch a glisteringe glasse of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse in it, that while I gazed thereon I was caught in the snares of <hi>Cupid.</hi> Or as the Spider in her webbe doth fast winde the litle Flie, so your beauty doth so fast binde mee in the beames thereof, that I am faine presently to yéelde my selfe a pray to your good pleasure: humbly bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching you to account of mee, not accordinge to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts which as yet are none, but accordinge to the loyall seruice which I faithfully vow hereafter to do vnto you.

               <p>Gentleman, this libertie of spéeche in you sheweth the lightnesse of your loue, for as I haue harde those that loue most speak least, as hearing their cogitations conuersant in the contemplation of the Saints whom they serue, but your smooth tale and fine filed words shew that your prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise is rather fainedly to pretende loue then faithfully to loue. And for my part I would not you should think me either so simple as to beléeue your coloured words, either so ouergone in lykinge of my selfe, but that I take the commendation which you giue mee, rather for triflinge mockinge then true meaninge, and I promise you I had rather you woulde vse some other to exercise your elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence

on then my selfe, for that I neither like of your vnlykely loue, neither meane to be framed to your folly.

               <p>O good Misteris, goe not about to torment hym so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly whiche loueth you so intirely, depriue mee not of that sight which doth onely work my delight, absent not your selfe from him whom nothinge vnder the Sunne pleaseth but your presence. And whereas you chalenge my lybertie of spéeche, may it like you to vnderstand that though this sodaine loue hath made me loose in a maner the remembraunce of my selfe, and caused mee to bee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and negligent in all other affaires though of neuer so great importance, yet the beeholdinge of your séemely selfe doth so reuiue my sences and quicken my spirits that it maketh all my partes to doe their part in praying for pittie and praysing your person: wherein if I should bee speechelesse, I might iustly be thought to spare the trueth and spighte your perfection, And that my loue is modest without mocking, true without triflynge, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement without vanytie, I take the heauens to witnes: and beesids let this be practised for proofe, that if it please you to imploy mée, you shall finde mée as spéedy to end my lyfe to doe you good, as ready to spende my time to doe you seruice. Mary (saith she) perchaunce so, for I thinke I shall finde you neither spéedy in the one, neither ready in the other. But thei that haue once passed the bounds of shamefastnesse, may euer after lawfully bee impudent, and you that haue beegunne to scoffe and gybe, thinke by authorytie you may continue in it: sutch a one I count you to bee and so I account of you. And so left my youth
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1570:74"/>
without dores. Who séeinge him selfe so coursly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of, fell to raginge to him selfe in this manner.</p>
               <p>Ah the brauery of these fine girles, the more they are courted the more they are coy, the more humbly they are sued vnto, the more loftyly they looke. And if a man practise them in the way of marriage, good God what shew of shamefastnesse will they make, what visors of vyrginitie will they put on, what colours of continencie wil they set foorth, what charinesse wil they make of their chastitie? they neuer forsooth meane to marrie, sayinge that single life is the only swéet life, that marriage is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented rather for necessitie then for any goodnesse that is in it, that their yéeres yet require no hast of marriage, &amp; that if God would giue them grace, &amp; their freinds would not force them to the contrarie, they would neuer know what man meaneth while they liue. Whereas in very deede they desire nothyng more then marriage, neither couet any thing more then the company of men. Agayne if a man making loue in way of marriage do but so mutch as touche one of these tender péeces, they crie phy away, away, but let one that is married, or one that meaneth not marriage dally with them, why they are as lose of their lippes and as frée of their flesh as may bee: For let a man béehaue himselfe towardes them accordyng to the common course of curtesie, hée shall obtayne any thyng of them, for they know hée is soone lost if hée bée not soone lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but let one direct his doynges by the lyne of loue, and bée drawne into great depth of affection towardes them, why they will raygne like princes ouer him: yea they will make him glad of one glaunce of goodwill giuen by the eye: for they know a litle thyng pleaseth a foole, and they thinke him to fast hampred in folly to giue them the slip on the sodayne. And bicause they count the number of suters a great testimony to their bentie &amp; proufe of theyr perfection, they vse twentie shiftes to haue if it bée possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble twentie suters, some they féede with lookes, some with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1570:75"/>
loue, some with promises some with practises, some with vowes some with vewes, some with triflinge some with truth, some with woordes, some with workes, some with kisses some with curtesy some with witte some with wyles, some with fayth some with fraude, some one way some another, so that by their willes they will haue as many suters as themselues haue sleightes to entertaine them. And yet these girles on Gods name are to younge to haue a husband, they are loth to leaue suckinge their dame. But ah blasphemous beast that I am to cast sutch diuelish doubtes of her honesty, whose very countenance containeth continency in it, whose vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage seemes to bee without vice, and lookes without lust. Is it likely shée will yéeld her body to bée abused by any, who wil not suffer her selfe to bée vsed by any? And she y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> will not enter into modest matrimony, is it likely shee will fall into filthy fornication? No I thinke her to bée as frée from folly, as I thinke my selfe far from wisdome who seeme to doubt of her honest dealing bicause shée wil not yéelde consent to my hastie meaning. What know I whether shee be consecrated alreadie to some other saint, which if it bée so, with what reason can I looke to reape any thynge at her handes but a repulse? For as gorged Hauks will stoupe to no lure, so a woman vowed already to another man, the sickenesse of other suters will not cure: or it may bée thus, that as the Fauconer when hee first draweth his Hauke out of the mew, giueth her washt and vnpleasant meates to make her after like better of better meates, so perchaunce her pollicie bée first to féede mée with bitter brothes, that hereafter dayntie fare may more delight mée: and now to tosse and torment me with the rigorous stormes of repulse, that hereafter the caulme of her consent may the better content mee. For springe time would neuer seeme so pleasaunt vnto vs, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the sharpe winter which went before: peace would not so mutch please vs, but by reason that warre beefore
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1570:75"/>
spoyled and wasted our country. So that if shée bée coy of consent to make mée inioy the greater ioy, may I thynke my selfe misused? Againe would I haue her so light of loue to yéelde to the firste onset? No shée deserueth to bee pursued with endlesse paine, yea and I will trauayle in continuall toyle but her good will I will attaine. Now as the good Spaniell hauing sprung the partridge ceaseth not to raunge the fieldes and beate the bushes vntill hee haue retriued it againe to serue the Hauk which flew at it, so hee hauing once séene this saint sought all occasions to come to the sight of her againe, and if it were possible surely to seaze vpon her. Now it pleased fortune to bee thus frindly to further his purpose with this oportunitie.</p>
               <p>Ther was in the cittie a very solemne wedding sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously celebrated, where hée by inquiry learned that his Misteris was, wherevpon hée assembled his company<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons together, and prepared themselues the same night to goe thither in a maske: and béeing come to the house, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had marched vp and downe the great chamber, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> first masker hauing taken the bride, hée being the second addressed him selfe to his Misteris with great deuotion, and when the sownd of the instrumentes ceased, hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into reasoning with her in this sorte.</p>
               <p>Good Misteris, you haue allowed to your lot in stéed of a masker a mourner, and for one to delight you with ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt discourse you shall haue one to weary you with ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And if I could in woordes set forth but halfe the heauinesse which since the first sight of you hath sunke into my breast, I hope your hart would not bée so hard frozen but that the shininge sun of pity would thaw it againe. For if plaintes may proue my paine, I haue

still continued in carefull cries: if sighes may shewe my sorrow, the smoake of them hath reached to the skies: if teares may trie my truth, the water hath flowen as a sloud from my eyes. And as these thinges haue passed heretofore to my paine, so if hereafter the sheddinge of my bloud may shew my constancy or woorke your conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation any way, assure your selfe I will bee so prodigall therof, that your selfe shall haue iust cause to say I liued only to serue you, and died to doe you good. By this time the instrumentes sowned another measure, at the ende wherof shee began to reply in this sorte.</p>
               <p>Sir, I am sory you haue taken so great paine for so litle thanke, for if the end of your maske bee to make mée marche vnder <hi>Venus</hi> banner, yea or <hi>Iunoes</hi> either, your successe wilbe sutch that you shall haue cause to count this your labour lost, and that you haue cast away so mutch cost. And for my part I promise you I had rather haue bene matcht with a mery masker then a leude louer, for the one might delight mee, whereas the other doth ut spight mee. And if (as you say) you maske without mirth so assure your selfe on the other side I daunce without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: neither can it but greatly greiue mee to bee trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with so vnreasonable a sutor, whom no reasonable answere will satisfie. This rigorous replie of his Miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris conuerted him from a masker to a Mummer, for hee was strooke so dead herewith that the vse of his tounge vtterly fayled him. But at length béeing come to himself againe, hee entred into this vehemency with her.</p>
               <p>O Gentlewoman, suffer not the bright sunne of your beauty to bee eclipsed with cruelty: contaminate not your cumlinesse with coynesse: remember beauty and cumlinesse continue not, wheras curtesy and clemency remaine for euer. Consider that vertue is the true beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which carrieth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendacion with it at al times, which maketh men loue those whom they haue neuer seene, and which supplieth all other wantes whatsoeuer.

Whiche bounty I beseeche you imbrace both to preserue my life and your owne good name. Alas what renowme shall you reape by killinge cruelly him that loued you intirely? What glory shall you get by driuing into dispaire him y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> was drawen into desire towardes you? No, pitty is the onely patheway to prayse, and mercy is the meane to make you immortall. At the ende of the next measure shée replied in this sorte.</p>
               <p>Why Gentleman, doe you thinke it cruelty not to condiscend to the requestes of euery one that maketh loue? Doe you count it vice not to yéeld to the assaultes of euery lasciuious young man? Doe you make so mean a count of mariage that you thinke it meet for a maide so rashly to enter into it, without sufficient knowledge of your selfe, ignorante of your life and conuersation, not knowing your state, parentes, or freindes: againe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of my freindes, without their good will and furtherance, and which is most of all, without mine owne loue and likinge? No, I will haue more tryall of him whom I meane to marry then I haue had of you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I wil féele in my self more feruent affection towards him, then as yet I doe beare you. You must consider it is not for a day or a yéere that man and wife must conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue together, but euen for the whole terme of their life: and that they may not for any respecte chaunge, beeinge once chayned together: but muste remaine content the one with the other in solace and in sorrowe, in sicknesse and in safenes, in plenty and in penury. Way againe that the happy life of the wife only consisteth in the loyall loue of her husband, and that shee reposeth her selfe only
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1570:77"/>
in the pleasure shee hath in him. She for the most part sitteth still at home, shee hauketh not, shee hunteth not, shee diseth not, shee in a manner receiueth no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation but in his company. Hee is the only play which pleaseth her, hee is the only game which gladdeth her, hee is the field shee delighteth to walke in, hee is the forrest shee forceth to hunt in. So that in my iudgement in takinge a husbande, no héede can bee to wary, no choyce to chary. And therefore you must make a count that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is a matter neither so rashly to bee required as you doe, neither so easely to bee graunted as you would haue mee to doe. And if you adhibite any credite to my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle, I would wish you to sowe the seede of your sute in a more fertill soyle, for in mee no graftes of grauntes, or flowers of affirming will by any meanes growe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly double denialles and ragged repulses. His replie here to with diuers other discourses whiche passed bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen them, I wil omit, lest I should weary you with the weary toyle whiche hée made of it. And besides I would not you should take example by her to hang of so straung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when you are sued to so humbly: and not to faine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likinge so deepely, when in deed you loue intirely.

Therfore I thinke the best way to mitigate my martirdome, is to absente my selfe from both hearing and seeing.

And herevpon the day of the solemnizing of the mariage was

appointed, but many thinges (as the sayinge is) happen betweene the cup and the lip, many thinges chaunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the bourd and the bed: man purposeth and God disposeth, and it is the fashion of fortune commonly thus to frame, that when hope and hap, when health and wealth are highest, then woe and wracke, disease and death are nighest. For in this manner it happened this mariage to bée marred. There arose a quarrell béetwéen the towne <hi>Albania</hi> and the cittie of <hi>Rome,</hi> which not with wordes but onely with weapons must bée decided: great hurly burly there was in either towne, nothing but war, war, war, the Cannons roard, the barbed horse neighed, the glitteringe armour shined, the boystrous billes and pearcing pikes pressed forward, the dartes were dressed, the bowes were bent, the women wept, the children cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Trumpets sowned Tan tara, tara the Drummes stroake vp the mournfull marchinge forward, and the souldiours on both sides marched in battayle aray vnto the field. Amongst whom <hi>Curia.</hi> as one of the most coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious captaines and boldest blouds of the <hi>Albanes,</hi> was the formost. But to leaue the battayle and come to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicte which <hi>Horatia</hi> had with her selfe when shée hearde that her beloued was in armes against her cittie. Shée fell forsooth to reasoninge with her selfe in this sorte.</p>
               <p>O most doubtfull distres that euer poore damsell was driuen to. For whom shall I offer vppe sacrifice, for whom shall I make my vowes? For whom shall I pray for victory, to whom shall I wishe the ouerthrowe? on the one side fighteth my freinde, on the other side my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: on the one side the cittie wherin I am is in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to bee sacked, on the other side the towne whither I must goe is in perill to bee spoyled, on the one side I am like to loose my loue, on the other side mine owne life. So that I know not to whether part, I ought to incline in hart. No can? Why a woman ought to forsake father and mother and followe her husbande. But ought any
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1570:79"/>
thinge to bée more swéete vnto mée, then the cittie to bée counted mine, wée beeing both one flesh? But life is sweet to euery one: full sower God knoweth to mee without his loue and life. So that if my will might worke ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, I would rather wish that of the two, <hi>Rome</hi> might run to ruine. But alas, dareth hee lay siege to the cittie wherin I am? Is hée not affraide to ouerthrow the house that harboureth mée? Doubteth he not least some peece should perce my tender breast? Yes no doubt of it, hee deepely doubteth it: but alas, they that are bound must obey, hee must follow of force his general captayne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee will incur the suspition of cowardlinesse, or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or both. Like as <hi>Vlysses</hi> was greatly defamed bicause hee faigned himself to be mad, for that he would not go to the siege of <hi>Troy.</hi> No god sheild my <hi>Curiatius</hi> from shame, god sende him either friendly to enter into the citie, all quarrels beeing ended and truce taken, either valiantly to venture into the cittie, and with triumphant armes to imbrace mee. By this time both the armies were met, and to auoyd the effusion of bloud, the general Captaines entred into this agreement. There were in either army three brothers of great courage and countenaunce, the <hi>Romaines</hi> were named <hi>Horatii,</hi> brothers to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before spoken of, the <hi>Albanes</hi> were called <hi>Curiatii,</hi> wherof one was y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned.

our bodies: the goodes whiche doe vs good, often times woorke our decay and ruine: children which are our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, are also our care: marriage which is a meane to make vs immortall, and by our renewing ofspring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our name from death, is accompanied with cares in number so endlesse and in cumber so curelesse, that if the preseruation of mankinde, and the propagation of our selues in our kinde, did not prouoke vs therto, wée should hardly be allured to enter into it. And amongest all the miseries that march vnder the ensigne of marriage, in my fancy there is none that more torments vs, then that hatefull helhounde Ielousy, as the history which you shall heare shall shew.</p>
               <p>You shal vnderstand in the Dukes Courte of <hi>Venice,</hi> spent his time one <hi>Cephalus,</hi> a Gentleman of great cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and good qualities, who at the first time hee insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe into the societie of the Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, made no speciall or curious court to any one, but generally vsed a dutifull regarde towards them all, and shewed hymselfe in sport so pleasaunt, in talke so wittie, in maners so modest, and in all his conuersation so cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, that though he were not specially loued of any, yet was hée generally lyked of all, and though hée himselfe were not specially vowed to any, yet was hee speciallye vewed of one, whose name was <hi>Procris.</hi> a proper Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, discended of noble parentage. And though at the first her fancy towardes him were not great, yet shee sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to receiue more contentation in his company, then in any other Gentleman of the troupe. But as materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fyre in shorte time groweth from glowinge coales to flashing flames, so the fyre of loue in her, in shorte time grew from flytting fancy to firme affection, and she bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to settle so surely in goodwil towardes him, that shee resolued with her selfe, hée was the onely man she would be matched to, if shee were euer married. And béeinge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in her lodginge, shee entred with her selfe into this
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1570:81"/>
reasoning.</p>
               <p>How vnequally is it prouided that those which worst may, are driuen to holde the Candle? That we which are in body tender, in wit weake, by reason of our youth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull, and in all thinges without experience, should bee constrained to beare the loadsome burthen of loue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ryper yéeres who haue wisdome to wyeld it, and reason to represse it, are seldome or neuer oppressed with it? Good God what fiery flames of fancy doe frye within mée? what desyre, what lust? what hope, what trust? what care, what dispaire? what feare, what fury? that for mée which haue alwaies lyued frée and in pleasure, to be tormented therewith, séemeth litle better then the bitter pangues of death. For as the colte the first time he is ridden snuffeth at the snaffle, and thinketh the bit most bitter vnto him: so the yoke of loue séemeth heauy vnto me, beecause my neck neuer felte the force thereof béefore, and now am I first taught to drawe my daies in dolour and griefe. And so mutch the lesse I lyke this lot, by how mutch the lesse I looked for it, and so mutch the more sower it is, by howe mutch the more soddaine it is. For as the Bird that hops from bough to bough, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth many a pleasant note, not knowinge how néere her destruction draweth on, is caught in snare before shée bée ware: so while I spent my time in pleasure, assoone play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, assoone parling, now dawncing, now dallying, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time laughing, but always loytering and walking in the wide fields of fréedome, and large leas of lybertie, I was sodenly inclosed in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> strait bonds of bondage. But I se &amp; I sigh, and sorow to see, that there is no clothe so fine but moathes will eate it, no yron so harde but rust will fret it, no wood so sounde but wormes will putrifie it, no met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall so course but fire will purifie it, nor no Maide so free but loue wil bring her into thraldome and bondage. But seeing the Goddes haue so appointed it, why should I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them? séeing the destinies haue decreed it, why shuld
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1570:82"/>
I withstand them? seeing my Fortune hath framed it, why should I frowne at it? seeing my fancy is fast fixed, why should I alter it? seeing my bargaine is good, why should I repent it? seing I lose nothing by it, why should I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain of it? seing my choice is right worthy, why should I mislyke it? seeing <hi>Cephalus</hi> is my Saint, why should I not honour him? seeing hee is my ioy, why shoulde I not inioy him? seeing I am his, why should not he be mine? yes <hi>Cephalus</hi> is mine, and <hi>Cephalus</hi> shall be mine, or els I protest by the Heauens, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> neuer ani man shal be mine.</p>
               <p>Euer after this shee obserued all oportunities to giue him intelligence, as modestly as shee might, of her goodwill towards him. And as it happened a company of Gentlewomen to sit talkinge together, they entred into commendation of the histories whiche beefore had bene tolde them, some commending this Gentlemans stories, some that, according as their fancy forced them, but <hi>Pro.</hi> seemed to preferre the histories of <hi>Cephalus,</hi> both for that (saith she) his discourses differ from the rest, and beesids, that mee thinkes the man amendeth the matter mutch. <hi>Cephalus</hi> though out of sight yet not out of hearing, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this sorte. And surely (Gentlewoman) the man thinketh himselfe much mended by your commendacion, and assure your selfe you shall as readily commaunde him, as you curteously commend him.</p>
               <p>The Gentlewoman blushing hereat, saide she thought hee had not bene so néere, but touchinge your answere (saith she) I haue not so good cause to commaunde you, as commend you: for as I thinke you well worthy of the one, so I thinke my selfe farre vnworthy of the other: but bee bolde of this, if at any time I commaunde you, it shall bee to your commodytie. I can not (sayth hée) but count your commaundment a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modytie, only in that you shall thinke mée worthy to doe you seruice: neither will I wish any longer to liue, then I may be able, or at least willing, to doe you due and dutifull seruice. If sir (saith
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1570:82"/>
she softly vnto hym) it were in my power to put you to sutch seruice as I thought you worthy of, you should not continue in the condition of a seruant longe, but your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state should bee altered, and you should commaunde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while, and I would obey. It shal bée (good misteris saith he) in your powre to dispose of mée at your pleasure, for I wholy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit my selfe to your curtesy, thinking my estate more frée to serue vnder you, then to raigne ouer any other whatsoeuer: and I should count my selfe most happy, if I might either by seruice, duty, or loue, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile your continuall goodnesse towards mee. Upon this the companie brake of, and therewith their talke. But <hi>Cephalus</hi> seing her goodwil so great towards him, began as fast to frame his fancy towardes her, so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> loue remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mutuall beetweene them. Which her father perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and not lyking very well of the match, for that hee thought his daughter not olde inough for a husbande, nor <hi>Cephalus</hi> ritch inough for sutch a wife, to breake the bond of this amitie went this way to worke.

Which iourny, as it was nothing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ioyful to <hi>Cephalus,</hi> so was it so painfull to <hi>Procris,</hi> that it had almost procured her death. For beeinge so ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wacht by herwaspish parents, that shee coulde neither see him nor speake with him beefore his departure, shee got to her chaumber window, and there heauily behelde the Ship wherin hee was sorowfully sayling away. Yea shee bent her eyes with such force to beehold it, that shee saw the ship farther by a mile then any els could possibly ken it. But when it was cleane out of her sight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she sayd: Now farewell my swéete cephalus, farewell my ioy, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well my life, ah if I might haue but geuen thée a carefull kisse and a faintinge farewell beefore thy departure, I should haue bene the better able to abide thy aboad from mée, and per chaunce thou woul dest the better haue myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

mée in thy absence, but nowe I knowe thy wyll, wyl wauer with the windes, thy faith wil fleete, with the flouds, and thy poore <hi>Procris,</hi> shall bee put cleane out of thy rememberance. Ah why accuse I thée of inconstancy? No I knowe the seas will first be drie, beefore thy fayth from mee shall flye. But alas, what shal constancy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nayle, if thy lyfe doe faile? mée thinkes I sée the hoysinge waues lyke a huge army to assaile y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sides of thy Ship: me thinkes I sée the proulyng pirats which pursue thée: mée thinks I heare the roaring Cannons in mine eare, which are shot to sinke thee: mée thinkes I see the ragged rocks whiche stande ready to reaue thy Ship in sunder: mee thinkes I see the wilde beastes which rauenously runne with open mouthes to deuoure thee: mee thinkes I see the théeues whiche rudely rushe out of the woods to robbe thee: mée thinkes I heare the trothlesse <hi>Turke</hi> enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conspiracy to kill thee: mee thinks I feele the furyous force of their wicked weapons, pitiously to spoyle thee. These sights and thoughtes, depriued her both of seeing, and thinkinge, for shee fell herewith downe dead to the grounde: and when her wayting woman could not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes reuiue her, shee cryed out for her mother to come help: who beeing come, and hauinge assayed all the meanes shée could for her daughters recouery, and seeinge no signe of lyfe in her, shee fell to outragious outcries, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: O vniust Gods, why are you the authours of sutch vnnatural and vntimely death? O furious féende, not god of loue, why dost thou thus diuelishly deale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? O ten times cursed bee the time, that euer <hi>Cephalus</hi> set foote in this Court. At the name of <hi>cephalus</hi> the maide beegan to open her eies, which before had dazeled, which her mother perceiuing, saide, beeholde daughter thy <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus</hi> is safely returned and come to see thee. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with shee start from the bed whereon they had laied her, and staring wildly about the chamber, when shee coulde not sée him, shee sunk downe againe. Now her parents
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1570:83"/>
perceiuing what possession loue had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her, thought it labour lost, to indeuour to alter her determination, but made her faithful promise shee should haue their further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and consent to haue her <hi>cephalus</hi> to husbande at his returne, wherewith shee was at length made stronge to indure the annoy of his absence. It were tedious to tell the prayers, the processions, the pilgrimages, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, the vowes shee made for his safe returne, let this suffice to declare her rare good will towardes hym, that hearing of his happie comming towards the courte, shee feared least his sodayne sight would bring her sutche excessiue delight, that her sences shoulde not bee able to support it, and therfore got her into the highest place of the house, and beheld him comming a far of, and so by litle and litle, was partaker of his presence, and yet at the méetinge, shee was more frée of her teares then of her tounge, for her greetinge was only wéeping, word shee could say none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cephalus</hi> inflamed with this her vnfaigned loue, made all the freindes hee could to hasten the mariage beetweene them. But the olde saying is, hast maketh waste, and bargains made in spéede, are commonly repented at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. For married they were, to both their inexplicable ioy, which shortly after turned to both their vnspeakable annoy. For the increase is small of seede to timely so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, the whelpes are euer blinde that dogs in haste doe get, the fruites full sone doe rot, which gathered are to sone, the mault is neuer swete onlesse the fier bee softe, and hee that leapeth before hee looke, may hap to leape into the brooke. My meaning is this, that <hi>Cephalus</hi> his share must needes bée sorow, who would so rashly and vnaduisedly, enter into so intricate an estate as wedlocks is.</p>
               <p>The Philosophers will vs to eate a bushell of salte with a man béefore wée enter into strict familiarity with him, but I thinke a whole quarter litle inoughe to eate
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1570:84"/>
with her with whom wee enter into sutch a bond that only death must dissolue. Which rule if <hi>Cephalus</hi> had obserued, hée had preserued him selfe from most irkesome inconueniences. But hee at all aduentures ventred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one of whom he had no trial, but of a litle triflynge loue. I like but litle of those mariages which are made in respecte of ritches, lesse of those in respect of honours, but least of al, of those in respecte of hasty, foolish, and fond af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For, soone hot soone colde, nothing violent is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, the cause taken away, the effecte vanisheth, and when beuty once fadeth (whereof this light loue for the most part ariseth) goodwill straight fayleth. Wel, this hot loue she bare him, was the only cause of his hasty and heauy bargaine, for womanlines she had none (her yeres were to young) vertue shee had litle (it was not vsed in the court) modesty shee had not mutch (it belongeth not to louers) good gouernment and stayed wit shee wanted (it is incident to few woomen) to bee shorte, his choyce was grounded rather vpon her goodlinesse then godlinesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather vppon her beauty then vertue, rather vppon her affection then discretion. But sutch as hee sowed, hee reapte, sutch as hee sought hee founde, sutch as hee bought, hee had, to wit, a witles wenche to his wife. Therefore I would wishe my freindes, euer to sow that, which is sound, to seeke that which is sure, to buie that which is pure. I meane I would haue them in the choice of sutch choyce ware, cheifly to respect good conditions and vertue: that is the only seed which wil yéeld good increase, that is the onely thinge worthy to bee sought, that is the only thinge which can not bée too derely bought. And who soeuer he bee that, in any other respecte whatsoeuer, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the holy state of matrimony, let him looke for no better a pennyworth then <hi>Cephalus</hi> had, which was a lothsome life, and desolate death. For within a yeere or two after they had bene maried, his fancy was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fully fed, and his disordinate desire of her began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1570:84"/>
so that hee beegan plainly to see and rightly to iudge of her nature and disposition, which at first the parciality of his loue, or rather outrage of his lust, would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to perceiue. And seeing her retchles regardes and light lookes, which shee nowe vsed towardes al men, rememberinge therewithall howe lightly hee him selfe won her, hee began greatly to doubt of her honest dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge towardes him, and hauing occasion of far iourny and longe absence from her, hée wrought this practise to try her truth. Hee told her his aboade from her must of necessity bee fourty wéekes: but at the halfe yeeres end by that time his haire was wildly growen, hee apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him self altogether contrary to his wonted guise, and by reason of his haire so disguised him selfe that hee was not knowen of any, which done, his necessary affayres dispatched, he returned into his owne country, and came to his owne house in manner of a straunger which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled the country, where hee founde his wife in more sober sorte then hée looked for, and receiued sutch cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous entertainment as was conuenient for a guest. Hauing soiourned there a day or two, at conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time hée attempted her chastity in this sorte.</p>

I demaunded of him whether hee were married, saying, all those thinges bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearsed, were not sufficient to the attaininge of a happy life, without a beutiful, saire, and louing wife. With that hée fetcht a deepe sigh, sayinge, I haue (Sir) I would you knew, a wife, whose beuty rese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bleth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the sunne, whose face doth disgrace all the ladies of <hi>Venice,</hi> yea <hi>Venus</hi> herselfe, whose loue was so excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge great towardes mee, that béefore I was married vnto her, hauinge occasion to goe in Ambassage to the <hi>Turke,</hi> shee almost died at my departure, and neuer was rightly reuiued till my returne. Good God, sayd I, how canne you bée so longe absent from so louinge a wife? How can any meate doe you good, which shee giueth you not? How can you sleepe out of her armes? It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (sayth hee) for euery man to doe as hee would, I must doe as my businesse bindeth mée to doe. Besides that, euery man is not of like minde in like matters. Lastly, it is one thing to haue bene happy, it is another thing to bée happy. For your businesse (sayd I) it séemeth not to bée great, by the good company, whiche I thanke you,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1570:85"/>
you haue kept mée this foure daies. For your minde, I know no man that would willingly bée out of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of sutch a wife. For your present happinesse, in déed it may bee your wife is dead, or that her loue is transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from you to some other. No (sayth hée) shée liueth, and I thinke loueth mee, but what good doth golde to him that careth not for it? And can you (sayd I) not care for sutch a golden girle? Then may I say you haue a wife more faire then fortunate, and shée a husbande more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate then faythfull. Alas (sayth hee) with teares in his eyes, it is my great care that I doe so litle care, but no more hereof I beseech you. But my bloud beeing infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the commendation which hée gaue to your beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and pityinge your case to haue so careles a husbande ouer you, I lay very importunately vpon him to impart the whole matter vnto mee, &amp; with mutch adoe I wrung these wordes from him. Sir (sayth hee) I shall desire you to impute my doings not to my fault, but to the fates, and to thinke that whatsoeuer is done ill, it is done against my wil. It is so, that I remained married with my wife the terme of two whole yeeres, what time I did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make of her, but I made a goddesse of her, and rather doltishly doated on her, then duely loued her: now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were the punishment of the gods for my fonde I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry committed vnto her, or wehther they thought her to good for mée, or whether the destinies had otherwise decréed it, or whether loue be lost when fancy is once ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fed, or whether my nature bée to like nothing long, I know not, but at the two yeeres ende I beegan sodainly in my harte to hate her as deadly, as beefore I loued her déepely: yea her very sight was so lothsome vnto mée, that I could not by any meanes indure it. And bicause her freindes are of great countenance, and I had no crime to charge her withal, I durst not séeke diuorcement, but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily parted from her, pretendinge vrgent affaires which constrained mée therto. Hereafter I meane to béestow
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1570:86"/>
my self in the warres vnder the Emperour, not minding to returne while shée liueth. And for my maintenance there, I haue taken order secretly with my freinds, to conueigh vnto mee yeerely the reuenewes of my lande. Thus crauing your secrecy herein, I haue reuealed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you my carefull case. The straungnesse of this tale made mee stand a while in a maze, at length I greatly began to blame his disloyalty, to conceiue without cause so great disliking, where there was so great cause of good likinge. But Gentlewoman, to confesse the truth vnto you, my loue by this time was so great towardes you, that I neuer perswaded him to returne vnto you, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my selfe to take that paine, and knowinge him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lost then found, being no better vnto you. Shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this hee departed from mee towarde the Emperours courte, and I tooke my iourney hither as you sée. And this is the tale I had to tell you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Procris</hi> hauinge heard this forged tale, with diuers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations and sundry imaginations with her selfe, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time fearing it was true, for that hee rightly hyt diuers pointes which had passed betweene her husband and her, sometime thinkinge it false, for that shee had firme confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in her husbandes fayth and loyalty towardes her, assoone castinge one likelyhoode one way, assoone another another way, at length fully resoluing with her self that his wordes were vtterly vntrue, shee replied vnto them in this sorte.</p>
               <p>Good God, I see there is no wool so course but it will take some colour, no matter so vnlykely which with wordes may not be made probable, nor nothinge so false which dissembling men will not fayne and forge. Shall it sinke into my head that <hi>Cephalus</hi> will forsake mée, who did forsake all my freindes to take him? Is it likely hee will leaue country, kinsfolke, freindes, landes, liuinge, and (which is most of all) a most louinge wife, no cause constrayning him therto? But what vse I reasons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1570:86"/>
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which one without eyes may sée is but some coyned deuise to cosen mee? No sir knight, you must vse some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther practise to effect your purpose, this is to broad to bée beleeued, this colour is so course that euery man may sée it, and it is so blacke that it will take no other colour to cloud it, the thread of your hay is so big that the Connies see it before they come at it, your hooke is so longe that the bayt can not hide it, and your deuise is to far fetcht to bring your purpose neere to an ende. Gentlewoman (sayth <hi>Cephalus</hi>) I see it is some mens fortune not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued when they speake truly, and others to bee well thought of when they deale falsely: which you haue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in your husbande and mee, who doubte of my wordes which are true, and not of his deedes which are false. And this I thought at the first, which made mee doubte to discloase this matter vnto you: for I knowe it commonly to bee so, that trauaylors wordes are not much trusted, neither great matters soone beleeued. But when the time of your husbandes returne is expired, and hee not come, then will you say that Sir <hi>Sulahpec</hi> (for so turning his name hee termed him selfe) tolde you true. For my part not withstanding, the great good will I bare you, would not suffer mee to conceale this matter from you that you might prouide for your selfe, yet I am very well content you should giue no credite to my woordes, for I would not you should beléeue any thing which might gréeue you any way, and I would wish you to thinke wel, till you see otherwise: for euery euill bringeth greife i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with it when it commeth, though the feare before procure none. Therfore I craue no credite for my words, my desire is that you will beleeue that which you see, which is, that for your sake I haue trauayled with great perill and paine out of mine owne country hither, to your house, that vppon the reporte of your beauty I was so surprised therwith, that I thought euery houre a yeere till I had seene you, that hauing seene you, I haue resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

with my self to liue and die in your seruice and sight. Now if in consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereof it shal please you to graunt mee sutch grace, as my goodwil deserueth, you shall finde mée so thankfull and gratefull for the same, that no fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fortune shall force mée to forget the present benefite which you shall bestow vpon mee, and if it chaunce that your husband returne, you shalbée sure alway to inioy mée as your faythful freind, and if hée neuer come again, you shall haue mee if you please for your louinge spouse for euer. Yea mary (sayth <hi>Procris</hi>) from hence came those teares, hereof procéeded your former fetche, this is it which hath seperated my husbande from mée, which hath sent him to the warres, which will cause him neuer to returne, a fine fetch forsooth, and cunningly contriued. Did that report which blazed my beuty (which god know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is none) blemish my name (which I would you knew is good) in sutch sorte, that you conceiued hope to win mée to your wicked will? Were you so vaine to assure your selfe so surely of my vanity, that only therevpon you would vndertake so great a iourney? No, you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaunt with no <hi>Cressid,</hi> you haue no <hi>Helen</hi> in hande, wée women will now learne to béeware of sutch guyleful guestes. No, if you were as cunning as Ioue, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> you could conuert your self into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> likenesse of mine owne husband, (as Ioue came to <hi>Alcmena</hi> in the likenes of her husbande <hi>Amphitrion</hi>) I doubt how I should receiue you til, the pre fixed time of my husbandes comminge were come: mutch lesse shall your forged tales or importunities constrayne mée to receiue you into that credite, and admit you into that place which is and shalbe only proper to my husband. And this answere I pray you let suffice you, otherwise you may leaue my house when you list. <hi>Cephalus</hi> liked this geare reasonably wel, and perswaded him selfe, that though hee had a wanton wife, yet hée had no wicked wife. But knowing it the fashion of women at first to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, &amp; that what angry face soeuer they set on the matter
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1570:87"/>
yet it doth them good to bee courted with offers of curtesy, hee ment to proue her once againe, and went more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to worke, to wit, from craft to coyne, from guyles to giftes, from prayers to presentes. For hauing receiued great store of golde and Iewels for certaine lande, which hee solde there whyther hee trauayled, (the only cause in deede of his trauayle) hee presented it all vnto her, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, hee had sold al hée had in his own country, minding to make his continuall aboade with her, and if shee ment so rigorously to reiect his goodwill, hee willed her to take that in token therof, and for him self, hee would procure him self some desperat death or other, to auoid that death which her beuty and cruelty a thousand times a day draue him to.</p>
               <p>The Gentlewoman héering those desperate words, and séeing that ritch sight, moued somewhat with pittie, but more with pencion, beegan to yeeld to his desyre, &amp; with <hi>Danae</hi> to holde vp her lappe to receiue the golden showre. O god golde, what canst thou not do? but O diuel woman, that will doe more for golde then goodwill? O Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, what shame is it to sell vily that which God hath geuen fréely, and to make a gaine of that whiche is more gratefull to women then men, as <hi>Tyresias</hi> gaue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hereof came that odious name of whore, which in Latin is <hi>Meretrix,</hi> a merendo, of deseruing or getting: a thing so vnnatural, that very beasts abhorre it, so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, as if one should be hyred to do ones selfe good, so vnhonest that the common stewes thereof tooke first their beginning. But to returne to our story, <hi>Cephalus</hi> séeing the lewdnesse of his wife, bewrayed himselfe vnto her who hee was, wherevppon shee was surprised with sutch shame, and hée with sutch sorow, that they could not long time speake ech to other: at length she fell downe vpon her knées, humbly crauinge his pardon. <hi>Cephalus</hi> knowing women to bée to weake to withstand the might of mony, and thinkinge that her very nature violently
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1570:88"/>
drew her to him, whom being her husband, though to her vnknowne, shee loued intirely, hee thought best for his owne quiet, and to auoid infamy, to put vp this presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this euill in his wife paciently, and to pardon her offence, and so they lyued quietly together a while. But within short time she, partly for want of gouernment, &amp; partly thinking her husband would reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g which she would haue done to him, fel into such a furious gelosy ouer him, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it wroght her owne destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; his desolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For this monstrous mischiefe was so merueilously crept into her harte, that shee beegan to haue a very carefull and curious eye to the conuersation of her husbande, and with her selfe sinesterly to examine all his wordes and works towardes her. For if he vsed her very familiarly, shee supposed that he flattered her, and did it but to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour his falshod towardes her: if hee looked solemnely on her, she feared the alteration of his affections, and the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enation of his goodwill from her, and that hee rowed in some other streame: if hee vsed any company, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented any mans house, shee thought by and by that there dwelt the saint whom hee serued: if he liued soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taryly, &amp; auoyded company, she iudged forthwith that hée was in loue some where: if hée bid any of his neighbours to his house, why they were his goddesses: if hee inuited none, shee thought hee durst not least she should spie some priuie tricks beetwéene them: if hee came home mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee had sped of his purpose: if sadly, hee had receiued some repulse: if hee talked pleasauntlye, his misteris had set him on his merry pinnes: if hee sayde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge, shee remembred it was one of the properties of loue to bee silent: if hee laughed, it was to thinke of his loue: if hee sighed, it was beecause hee was not with her: if hee kist her, it was to procure appetite against hee came to his misteris: if hee kist her not, hee cared not for her: if hee atchiued any valient enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise at armes, it was done for his misteris sake: yf
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1570:88"/>
not, hee was beecome a carpet Knight: if hee fell out with any, it was some open enemie to his priuye friend: if hee were friendes with all men, hee durst dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please none, least they should detect his doinges to her: if hee went curiously in his apparel, it was to please his misteries: if negligently, hee liued in absence: if hee ware his haire longe, hee mourned beecause hee coulde not bee admitted: if shorte, he was receiued into fauour: if he bought her any apparrell or any other prety trifling trickes, it was to please her, and a bable for the foole to play with: if hee bought her nothinge, hee had inough to do to maintaine other in brauery: if he entertained any seruant, hee was of his misteris preferment: if hee put away any, hee had some way offended her: if hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended any man, hee was out of question his baude: if hee praysed any woman, shee was no doubte his whore: and so of all other his thoughtes, wordes, and déedes, she made this suspicious suppose, and ielous interpretation: and as the Spider out of most sweet flowers sucketh poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, so shee out of his most louing and friendly déedes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, picked occasions of quarrell, and conceyued causes of hate. And so long shee continued in these care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full coniectures, that not onely her body was brought low, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that her appetite to meate failed her, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so she was so disquieted in minde, that she was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner beesides her selfe, whereupon in great pensiuenesse of hart, shee fell to preaching to her selfe in this sorte.</p>
               <p>Ah fonde foole, wilt thou thus wilfully woorke thine owne wrack and ruine? if thy husbande commit treason against thée, wilt thou commit murther vpon thy selfe? if he consume himselfe away with whores, wilt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume thy selfe away with cares? wilt thou increase his mischief w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thine owne misery? if he be so wickedly bent, it is not my care can cure him, for that whiche is bred in the bone will not out of the flesh. If hee bee disposed to deale falsly with mée, it is not my wary watching which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1570:89"/>
wyll ward him from it, for loue deceiued <hi>Argus</hi> with his two hundred eies. If hee should bee forbidden to leaue it, hee will vse it the more, for our nature is to runne vpon that which is forbidden vs, vices the more prohibited, the more prouoked, and a wilde coult the harder he is rained, the hotter he is. If I should take him tardy in it, it would but encrease his incontinent impudency, for beeing once knowne to haue transgressed the lawefull limits of loue and honesty, hee would euer after bee carelesse of his good name, which hee knew hee could neuer recouer againe. And why should I séeke to take him in it? should I séeke to know y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which I ought not to séeke, no not so mutch as to thinke on? was euer wight so bewitched to run headlong vpon her owne ruine? So long as I know it not, it hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth mee not, but if I once certainly knew it, God kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth how sodainly it would abridge my dayes. And yet why should I take it so gréeuously, am I the first that haue bene so serued? Hath not <hi>Iuno</hi> her selfe sustained the like iniury? But I reason with my self, as if my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band were manifestly conuicted of this crime, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce, good Gentleman, bée as innocent in thought, as I wrongfully thinke him to bée nocent in déede: for to consider aduisedly of the matter, there is not so mutch as any likelyhood to lead mee to any sutch leud opinion of him, hee vseth mee honestly, hee mantayneth mée hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, hée loueth mee better then my leude dealinge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him hath deserued. No it is mine owne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynesse that maketh mee thinke I am not worthy the proper possession of so proper a Gentleman: it is myne owne lustful desire that maketh mee afrayde to loose any thing: it is myne owne weakenesse y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> maketh mée so sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of wronge: it is mine owne incontinency which maketh mée iudge him by my selfe. Well, the price of my preiudiciall doings towardes him is almost paide, and if paine be a punishment, then haue I indured a most pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full punishment, but let this déere bought wit doe mee
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1570:89"/>
some good, let mee now at length learne to bee wise, and not to thinke of euils before they come, not to feare them béefore I haue cause, not to doubte of them in whom is no doublynge, nor to mistruste them in whom is no treason, and faithfully to loue him that vnfainedly loueth mée. After this shee indeuoured to do sutch fonde toyes foorth of her head, for a while shée liued louingly and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly with her husband, but sodaynly by reason of one looke which hée cast vpon one of his neighbours, shée fell into her olde vayne of vanitie agayne. And as second fallynge into sicknesse is euer most daungerous, so now her folly was growen to sutch furie, and her disease so incurable, that shée could not conceale it any longer, but flatly tolde her husbande to his teeth, that she thought hee did misuse her. <hi>Cephalus</hi> knowyng his owne innocencie, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng her imbecillitie, gently prayed her not to conceiue any sutch euill opinion of him, saying: If neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of God, neither respect of men, neither reuerence of the reuerent state of marriage could feare mée from sutch filthinesse, yet assure your selfe the loyal loue I beare you, would let mee from sutch lasciuiousnesse. For béeleeue me, your person pleaseth mee so well, that I thinke my selfe sweetly satisfied therewith. Yea if <hi>Venus</hi> her selfe should chaunce vnto my choice, I am perswaded I should not prefer her béefore you. For as her beutie would inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly draw me to her, so my dutie wold necessarily driue mee to you. Therfore (good wife) trouble not your selfe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sutch toyes, which will but bréede your owne vnrest and my disquiet, your torment &amp; my trouble, yea and in time perchance both our vntimely deathes. Let <hi>Deinyra</hi> bée a president for you, who suspecting her husband <hi>Hercules</hi> of spouse breache, sent him a shert died with the bloud of the <hi>Centaure Messus,</hi> who tolde her that shert had vertue to reuiue loue almost mortified, but <hi>Hercules</hi> had no sooner put it on, but it stocke fast to his flesh, &amp; fried him to death, as if it had been a furie of hell. Which when shée knew,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1570:90"/>
with her owne hands shée wrought her owne destruction. See y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vnworthy end which that monster ielousy brought this worthy couple too, &amp; foresee (sweet wife) that it bring not vs to the like bane. These wordes could worke no effect with her, but rather increased her suspition, perswading her selfe, that as in faire painted pots poyson ofte is put, and in goodly sumptuous sepulchers rotten boanes are ryfe: so fairest wordes are euer fullest of fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Yea, the more curteous hée shewed him selfe, the more culpable shee thought him to bée. Which <hi>Cephalus</hi> seeing, bicause hee would take away all causes of suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, abandoned all good company, and spent his time so lytarily, hunting in the wooddes, and séekinge the spoyle of spoylinge sauage beastes. But this helhounde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy, did so haunt and hunt her that shee could in no place bée in rest, but made her plod from her Palaice to the wooddes, to watche whether hee there hunted a chaste chase or not. And one day as shee dogged him, where hée was layde downe to rest amongest the gréene leaues, shee hearde him vtter these woordes: Come gentle <hi>Ayre</hi> and refresh my weried spirites, with sutche like woordes of daliance, whiche hee beeing hot, spake to the gale of Wynde whiche pleasauntly blew vppon him: but shee thought hee had spoken to some woman with him, wherevpon she furiously fel to the ground, tearing her haire and scratchinge her face, and though her greife would not giue her leaue to speake, yet to her selfe shee thought this: And can the traytor thus trecherously deale with mee? Had the sorow which I sustayned only for his absence beefore I was married to him, or any way owed him any thing, almost cost mee my life, and now shall his presence procure my death? Did I poure out pensiue prayers for his safe returne from the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and doth his returne returne my good wil with sutch dispight? Oh would to god the <hi>Turkes</hi> had torne him in péeces, that hee had neuer come home to martir mee in this manner. But

Wolues neuer pray vpon wolues, his fraud was nothing inferiour to their falshood, and therefore it had beene in vaine for them to haue haulted before a creeple: but me, beeing but a simple sheepe, see how sone this subtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Foxe could deceiue. Is this the fruite of my feruente loue? is this the felicitie I expected in marriage? had I knowen this, I would neuer haue knowen what the subtill sexe of man had ment: I would rather, as they say, haue led apes in hell after my death, then haue felt all the torments of hell in my life. But had I wyst, is euer had at the worst, they that cast not of cares beefore they come, can not cast them of when they doe come. It is to late to cast An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor when the ship is shaken to péeces against the rockes, it booteth not to send for a phisition when the sicke party is already departed. Well, I will yet goe see the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed cause of my carefull calamity, that I may mitigate some part of my martirdome, by scratching her inconty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent eyes out of her whoorish head: and thervpon roused her selfe out of the shrub wherin shée was shrouded. <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus</hi> hearing somwhat rush in the bush, thought it had bene som wilde beast, and toke his darte, and strooke the tame foole to the hart. But comming to the place, and seeing what hee had done, hée fell downe in a sowne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, but with her striuing vnder him with the panges of death, hee was redused to life, and sayd, Alas my <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris</hi> by my selfe is slayne. Which she (not yet dead) hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe, sayde, Alas your <hi>Aire</hi> hath brought mee to this ende. With that hee vnderstood how the matter went, and sayd, Alas (sweete wife) I vsed these wordes to the winde. Why then (sayth she) not you, but that winde gaue mee this wound. And so ioyninge her lippes to his, shee yéelded vp her breath into his mouth, and dyed. And he with care consumed, taried not long behinde her, to béewayle either his owne deed, or her death.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlewomen, let the casuall end of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bée a caueat to kepe you from sutch wary watching

               <p>OF all the ordinary accidentes incident to the lyfe of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is none of more mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to our prosperytie, or misery, then marriage: which estate if wee aduisedly enter into, it maketh vs in happinesse equall to Angels: but if wee rashly run into it, it prolongeth vs in the paines of the furies of hel. And amongst all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which are to bee foreséene in this bargaine, there is none more daungerous, then inequalitie of estates bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the parties: for, what agréement of affections can there bee, when the one shall bee of a meane minde, the other hautie, the one lowly, the other loftie? how can there be one harte in two bodies, when the one wisheth one thinge, the other willeth another? When the one is disposed one way, the other inclined another way, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the secret instinct of their proper and peculier natures? For the nature of nothinge may bee altered: that whiche nature hath geuen, connot bee taken away: and that whiche is bred in the boane, will not out of the flesh.

               <p>In the Country of <hi>Creete,</hi> raigned one <hi>Minos,</hi> a Kinge and Monarch of great might, to whom the blinde goddes Fortune assigned a wife of far more meanesse, then was meete for the maiestie of his mightinesse. For there chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to bee in his Court attendaunt vpon a noble woman, a proper péece, named <hi>Pasiphae.</hi> Who by birth was but the daughter of a Knight, but by beauty séemed to bee a heauenly wight. On her chéekes, the Lilly and the Rose did striue for interchange of hew, her haire cumly curld, glistered lyke golde: her pierceinge eies, twinckled like starres: her alabaster teeth stoode as a ranke of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pearles: her ruddy lippes, were soft and sweete: her handes fine and white, yea all her partes so perfectly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, that nature sought to winne great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in caruing so cunningly so curious a carkas. But as a rusty Rapier is no trusty Rampier to defende a man, though the Scabbord bee of fine veluet: so a woman with foule conditions is coursly to bee accounted of, though her face bee faire, and body bewtifull. But destinies so draue, that this King by chaunce cast a glaunce vpon this gorgious goddes, and at the first view was so vanquished by vanitie, that hee thought his life no longer pleasaunt vnto hym, then hee was in her sight: And fayled not day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly familierly to frequent the misteris company, for the maides cause. And hauing attempted her chastitie by shewing her his great goodwyll, by beestowinge on her great giftes, by large promises of preferment, and many
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1570:92"/>
other meanes, and neuerthelesse fayling of his purpose, in pensiue perplexitie fell to parley with himselfe, to this purpose.</p>
               <p>I euer heretofore thought a Princes life to bee voyde of strife, and that they had alwaies passed their time in pleasure without paine: but now I sée wee are subiect to sorow, so soone as the meanest subiect we haue. Lykewise beefore this I was of opinion, that number of frindes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundinge in wealth, abidinge in health, and sutch lyke things which pertaine to the body, were sufficient to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to a happy life in this lyfe: but now I see, it is the minde whiche maketh mirth, and stirreth strife, yea the contented minde is the onely ritches, the onely quietnes, the onely happinesse. Good God, how vnsauery seeme those sweete meats vnto mee, wherein I was woont to delight? how vnpleasa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sports, wherin I was woont to take pleasure? how cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bersome is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, which was woont to content mee? no game glads mee, no daunsing delights mee, no iusting ioyes mée, no playes please me, no triumphes, no shewes, no hauking, no hunting, no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnder the Sunne doth solace mee. And would I know the cause? why, I haue not a contented minde: the perfect parts of <hi>Pasiphae</hi> do so diuersly distract my minde that only her sight is swéete, onely her company is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, onely her presence is pleasaunt vnto mee. And would I know the cause? why, in her y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fates haue fixed my felicitie, in her the heauens haue heaped my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with her must I liue, and without her must I die. Why, I haue pursued her goodwil with praiers and with presentes, with loue and with liberalitie, with gifts and with goodwill, and yet am neuer the néere. And would I know the cause why? I sought not her goodwill in the way of marriage. Only marriage is the meane, only wedlock must locke, and lincke vs together. And shal I so much debase the height of my estate, as to match in mariage w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so meane a mate? as though many princes
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1570:93"/>
haue not as meanely matcht themselues: as though the Gods the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues haue not maried with earthly creatures. And for my <hi>Pasiphae,</hi> though shee bee inferriour to me in parentage, yet in personage, shee is good inough for God himselfe. And for her dowry or wealth, what neede I way it, who haue the most part of the world vnder my domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? no, there shall no regard of honour, or respecte of ritches, detaine mee from that which doth only containe the contentment of my minde.

               <p>Now so soone as hee had oportunitie offered him, hee made <hi>Pasiphae</hi> partaker of his purpose in these termes.</p>
               <p>Séeing the onely touchstone to trie true and loyall loue from lothsome lust, is marriage, I meane, if you bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to consent therto, to seale the sincere affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I beare you, with the sacred ceremonyes and holly rites of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony: and as I haue preferred your loue beefore all worldli respects, so I trust you wil return my loue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such loyalty, that I shall haue cause to count my selfe as well matcht, as if I had married with the greatest princesse in the world. <hi>Pasiphae</hi> hearing these wordes, was so rauished with ioy, that shée could not on the sodaine make the kinge an answere, but hauing chaunged colour twice or thrise, from red to white, and from white to red, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a minde mooued with hope, assayled with feare, and passioned with pleasure, at length shée sayd vnto him. As (most worthy prince) I euer thought my selfe far vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any sutch honour, so if it please your highnes plainly to heare the truth, I euer thought my selfe far to worthy, to yéeld to your desire in the way of wickednesse: which was the cause I made so course account of your curtesy heretofore. But seeinge it hath pleased you to

Neither would I you should thinke, that it is the name of a queene, or estate of a prince, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> winneth mee thus willingly to your will, for I know that name to bee vaine, and that estate full of paine: but it is your exceedinge loue towardes mee (O noble prince) that linketh my lykinge with yours, it is your incomparable curtesy which forceth mee to yeelde the forte of my fayth and virginity into your handes.</p>
               <p>For as the sunne the higher it doth ascende in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the more heate it doth extend to the earth, so ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and curtesy, in the more high and princely person it is placed, the more force it hath to win the wils, &amp; binde the heartes of people to imbrace it. And as my loue is grounded vpon your vertue, so I trust so to behaue my selfe, that hereafter you shall haue as great lyking to my conditions and vertue, as now you haue loue to my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and beuty: that when yéeres shal take away the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> one, you may take delight &amp; solace in the other. The king was so déepely delighted with this dutifull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, that hee had not a woorde to reply, but satisfiyng him selfe for the time with a few swéete kisses, presently gaue commaundement to his officers, to make prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the sumptuous celebrating of his mariage, which shortly after was consummated with sutch royalty, as is requisite in a matter of sutch maiesty. So this married couple, consumed two or three yeres in the highest degrée of happinesse. But the sunne béeing at the highest, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: and the Sea beeinge at full tide, ebbeth: caulme continueth not longe without a storme, neither is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse had longe without heauinesse, as by this couple may bée séene. For when the kinges fancy had bene once
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1570:94"/>
fully fed, the vehemency of his desire beegan to vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and hee began to loue his new married wife rather with reason then with rage: by reason whereof with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency of iudgement, hee could now note her naughty nature, which at first partialyty of loue, would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to perceiue. For what Gentleman soeuer shee saw in the court, indued with a vertuous disposition and noble minde, shee would with the kinge hinder his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment by all meanes possible, still aduaunsing the vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest, to tipe of dignity. If any Gentlewoman were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for her honesty and chastity, by some sluttish slights or other, shée sought to slaunder them. So that those in whom the kinge did only delight, shée indeuoured with all dilygence to molest and spight. Which the king per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuinge, and consideringe how from low estate, hee had brought her to heighth of honour, thought hée might more boldly refourme her faultes, and began (with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity sufficient, and in déede, more then was méete bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene man and wife,) to admonish her of her malitious disposition, towardes those which were of vertuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: and made no curiosity though without curtesy, to tell her, that shee béeinge ignoble her selfe, could not like of those which were noble. But to mutch familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had bred so mutch contempt in her, that shee beegan impaciently to pout, to loure, to snuffe, to chase, to thinke her self mutch iniuried by those wordes, and sayd plainly shee would like of whom shee lyst, shewinge her rude bringing vp, her want of wit and gouernment, her cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe nature, her curst conditions, and howe vnfitte shée was for the place shée was in. Well, the kinge was fayn to make a vertue of necessity, and to take paciently, that which hée could not take away easily. For shée still perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in her peruersenesse, and hated those chiefely, whom her husband loued especially. And amongest all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there was one proper yong gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> named <hi>Vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus,</hi> attendant vpon the kinge, and in great fauour
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1570:94"/>
and credit with him, whom when shée could by no means bring into displeasure or dislikinge, shee went about to intrap by this traine of treason: shee began to cast glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of good will towardes him, and by alluringe lookes to thrall him in the thread of her beuty. The young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beeing made of fine mettall, and therfore very apt to receiue the impression of loue, in short time was so fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to her fancy, that hee yeelded fayth to her fraud, and requited her fayned lookes with vnfayned loue. And as a pleasaunte praye soone intiseth a simple theife: so hee thought her beuty sutch a booty, that in his opinion, no younge man in the world but would hazarde hanginge to haue it. And herevpon fell to debatinge the matter with him selfe in this sorte.</p>
               <p>It is a common opinion amongest men, that hée which is once chayned in the linkes of loue, is foorthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned of his liberty and freedome, but if true lyberty bee to liue as one list, I cannot but thinke my self to liue in most large and licentious liberty, for that I lust not, or desire to lead any other life then that which I doe: which is, in the secret seruice and continuall contemplation of my princely <hi>Pasiphae.</hi> Yea I thinke euery sorrow sweet, and euery paine pleasure, which any passion proceeding of her beuty procureth mee: and I thinke my selfe more then happy, that the heauens thinke mee meete to suffer any martirdome for her sweet sake. And if I might ende my dayes in dooing her seruice, I should thinke it the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beginning of ioy, the way to life, and the readie and perfect path wherby to passe to the pleasures of Paradise. Oh that fortune would minister some occasion wherby I might manifeste vnto her the manifolde goodwill I beare her: and if without preiudice to her person it might bee done, would to god she were drowned in some sutch depth of daunger, that nothinge but the hazardinge of my life could preserue her from perill: then should shee see the seruice which I haue sworne to doe her, then should shee
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1570:95"/>
see the duty which I haue vowed to owe her, then should shee plainly perceiue, that neither the pleasures of the world, neither the solace of freindes, neither the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life, neither the sowernesse of death should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw mee from sheadynge the déerest drop of bloud in mee to doe her good. And then woulde shee say (if any curtesy bee contained in her) that my loue is most loyal, and my friendship most faythfull, then would shee paye (if any gratefulnesse bee grafted in her) my daunger and perill with the price of her person. But alas, how can she pay me with that which is not in her own power? There is another only who hath interest therin, she hath already payd her person as a price of a prince &amp; his whole kingdome: so that I plough the barrein rockes, and set my share into the shoare of the Sea: I till with toyle sutch a kinde of soyle, whereof another by right must crop the corne. But admit she were disposed to incroche somwhat vpon her husbandes right, yet is it likely shee will looke so low, as let so meane a man as my selfe growe into so great acquaintaunce with her? No, fortune denieth mée any sutch fauour, my good will as yet hath deserued no sutch gwerdon, my desire is far aboue my desertes, my ambition aboue my condition. Why, my birth is better then hers, why should shee then neglecte mee? But her calling is better then mine, why should shee then respect mee? My desire procéedes of loue, why should shee not then accept it? But alas, it is contrary to law, why should shée not then reiecte it? I am of noble bloud, why should shee refuse mee? But shee hath a noble prince to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, why should shee misuse him? Yea if I my self were not a villaine, altogether deuoyd of vertue, I would not suffer it so mutch as enter into my thought to abuse him, who hath alwayes vsed mee honourably, who hath sought my prefermente by all meanes possyble, who from my childhood hath brought mée vp like a louing lord &amp; Maister. Shall I requite his liberalytie towards mee with sutch
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1570:95"/>
disloyaltie? shall I deceiue the opinion whiche hee doeth conceiue of mee, with sutche destable villany? shall I returne the trust which he reposeth in me, with sutch tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? shal I defile my faith towards him, by séeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file his bridly bed? But (alas) loue is aboue lord or laws, aboue Prince or priuiledge, aboue friend or faith. Where loue leadeth no maister is made account of, no Kinge ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for, no friend forced of, no duty respected, no honestie regarded, but all thinges done accordinge to the passion which preuaileth ouer vs. And séeinge it is not in our power to preuent that passion, for it is either deriued of our owne nature, or discended from the heauens, there is no reason I shoulde requier any proper or peculiar fortune to my selfe, and séeke to be dispensed withal from that which is common to all: and so mutche the rather I am induced to yeelde to the instinct of loue, and to pursue my purpose, for that I perceiue by the wanton lookes of the Quéene, that she is determined to entertaine some secret friend, béesides the King her husband, and if I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not my selfe, her very countinance towardes me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports some lykelyhood of loue shee beares mée: therefore I think it wisdome to strike while the iron is hot, and if it bée posible to ease my hart of the greif, which her beuty hath bred mee. And if shee be disposed to arme her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with horned harnesse, as good I be the instrument therof, as some other of meaner calling and countenance. After this, hee sought all meanes possible to insinuate himselfe into her familiaritie, &amp; courted her continually with dutiful seruice and secret signes of sincere affection: hee so bribed her maides with benefits, &amp; corrupted them with coyne, that they made him a God vnto their miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris: she could not looke out at her chamber window, but that she saw him walke solitarily vnderneath, casting vp countenances which séemed to containe humble praiers for pitie and compassion, and throwing vp sutch sighes as might plainly signifie the sorrow of his thoughtes. If she
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1570:96"/>
chaunced to walk abroade, hee woulde méete her lyke a ghost in such ghastly maner, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such a pale countenance, and pined carkas, that it woulde haue moued the stoany rocks to ruth. But the Quéene séeing him so fast fettered in folly, had that she desired, and now she left her louinge lookes towardes him, and the more painfully shee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him tormented, the more disdainfully shee lokt vpon hym, and would not by any signes which hee did shew of his affection, séeme to know it, to the intent hee should by writing make manifest his meaninge vnto her. The yong Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, séeing the hope which at the first he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of her goodwill, altogether without hap, and in a manner dispairing of his purpose, hee coulde take no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger dayes with his desire, but that hee must know a final resolution one way or other: And beeing driuen to care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse desperatnesse, hee feared not to commit his life to a tell tale péece of paper, and beewrayed his miserie to his misteris in this manner.</p>

warde ouer her at home, yea this furious féende of hel did so torment him, that hee could take no rest day nor night, but his fancy still ran either vppon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gentleman that would haue done him that iniurie, either vppon some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that shoulde be lyke to serue him in like sorte: so that the pleasure which her proper person procured him, was drowned with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> doubt, lest she would not remaine proper vnto him, and that she would bee as common in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as she was proper in personage. Alas, (saith hee) now my ioy is at an end, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> clouds of care haue quight couered my sun and light, of solace &amp; delight: yea the greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure I take in practising w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my <hi>Pasiphae,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> greater feare I haue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> others déepely desyre to participate with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. And the more free she is in sutch fréendship towards me, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> more franck I doubt she will be towards other. Ah, would to God I had neuer bene married, rather then to bee thus martired, or els would I had matcht with some sutch, whose princely nature woulde haue participated only with Princes, and whose royall bloude and birthe might haue feared the baser sorte to presume to practise her to their purposes: but my chaunce was to chuse one, who if (as the sayinge is) like, like best of their likes, is like to like better of any other then of my selfe, for that in nature and conditions there is sutche difference bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene vs. But repentaunce now commeth to late, this only resteth to bee foreséene, that vnto the greate greife which mine owne conceite procureth me, her abuse adde not infamy and dishonour. And if the heauens haue assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mee sutch heauy fate, as due to my doatinge desyre, yet this at least let mée take heede, that with the losse of her owne honour, shee procure not the losse of my lyfe. And herevpon appointed certaine of his assured friends, to haue the custody and kéeping of the queene: who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge her selfe thus disloyally without cause abridged of her liberty, béegan to curse the time that euer shée came to bee quéene, wishing shee had continued in meaner cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1570:97"/>
with fruition of liberty, rather then to sit in chayre of dignity, with suspicion of dishonesty. What pleasure, sayth shee, doth my princely estate procure mee, whiche must liue as a prisoner? Who wil honour mee for queen, which am suspected for a queane and harlot? How shall I dare to shew my face in the Courte, when the kinge doubteth of my dealinge towardes him? My lookes haue not bene so light, my curtesie hath not bene so common, my glaunces haue not bene so garish, wherby hee shoulde enter into this sinister suspicion of mee. But loue (they say) is light of beeleefe, and ielousy is grounded vpon loue. Auant fond foolish loue, God send my husbande rather to hate me, then to beare mée any such loue, which bereueth him of rest, and mee of renowme, which breaketh the bond of faythfull freindship and intire amity betwéen vs, which causeth him to doubt mee, and mee to dread him, which maketh both our liues so lothsome, that I wishe death to dispatch ether the one of vs or the other. But this froward fate, I must ascribe only to mine owne fault, and fraud towardes <hi>Verecundus,</hi> who hath now iust cause to triumph that I my selfe am fallen into the pit I digged for him. Wel, I must retire to patience perforce, and hange in hope of some good hap to redresse my woe and misery.</p>
               <p>But you shall vnderstand (Gentlewomen) this was not all her punnishment, nay this was but a trifle in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte of that which after followed, a matter in haynous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse so horrible, in desire so detestable, and in lust so lothsome, that it is no lesse strange to bée tolde, then hard to bée beléeued: so that I thinke my wordes will rather carry wonder then credite with you. For, whether it were gods plague for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> husbands ielousy, or for her iolity, pride, and subtelty, I know not, but thus it pleased him to suffer the diuell to deale with her. Beeing by her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes commaundement in his absence kept from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, her cheife solace was to walke in a pleasaunt groue
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1570:98"/>
ioyned to her palaice, where vsed to feed a heard of beasts, amongest which was a goodly white bull. I dare not say shee fell in loue with the bull, least I should driue you rather to laughinge at my story then listninge to it, but surely so it was. Yea shee was not only in loue with the beast, and went euery morninge and with her owne hands brake downe boughes for him to brouse vpon, but, which was more, shee was ielous ouer him: for what cow in all the herd shee saw hee liked best, shee caused to bée had from the heard and killed, as she pretended for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but in deed for fatisfiyng her ielous minde. And as the beast was opening, shee would take the inwardes in her hand, saying, now goe thy way and please my loue if thou canst. And taking delight a while in this daliance, at length her lust grew to sutch outrage, that shee felt in her selfe an impossibility to continue her cursed life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the carnall company of the bull. And notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge shee assayed the assistaunce of reason, the pollicy of perswations, the helpe of herbes, and the meane of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, to mortyfy her beastly desire to the beast, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge would preuayle, yea beeinge often in minde to make her selfe away, her hart would not suffer her hands to doe it: not that death feared her, but that desyre forced her first to fulfil her filthy lust. But Gentlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because you shal not enter into colorick conceites against me, for publishing in this presence, a hystorie whiche seemeth so mutch to sounde to the shame of your sexe, I meane not to iustifie the truth of it, but rather will proue it false by the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of one <hi>Seruius,</hi> who writeth, that <hi>Pasiphae</hi> indéede played false with one <hi>Taurus</hi> (which signifieth a Bul) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to her husband in the house of <hi>Dedalus,</hi> and after being delyuered, had two sonnes, the one lyke <hi>Minos,</hi> the other lyke <hi>Taurus,</hi> and therevpon the Poets faigned the fable aforesaide: but whether béeing a woman shee vsed the carnall company of a beast, or whether lyke a lewde wife shee gaue her husbande the badge of a beast, her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

was sutch, that I cannot (though gladly I woulde) excuse it. Yet must I néedes say that in my fancy her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande deserued some blame: for no doubt his suspicion without cause, caused her in sutche sorte to transgresse marriage lawes.

And surely the experience is to common, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion and slaunder maketh many to bee that which they neuer ment to bee.

               <p>TO make the reckoning without the host, is the way soone to bee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ouershot in the shot: to resolue certenly vpon incertenty, is the way neuer to be in any certenty: to looke for constancy, of those y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lyke of inconstancy, or to determine of those things which are not in our powers to perfourme, is nothing els but to bee deceiued of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and to be driuen to alter our determination: as the History whiche you shall heare, shal yéelde example of both the one and the other.</p>
               <p>In the country of <hi>Piemount</hi> had his beeinge one <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malion,</hi> a gentleman discended of noble birth, indued with perfection of person, &amp; perfectly pourtraied forth with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of learning, so that it was dooubtful whether he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1570:99"/>
were more indebted to fortune for his birth, to nature for his beauty, or to his parentes for his learninge. But as beautie, birth, ritches, and the rest must néedes geue place to learninge, so no doubt but his parentes deserued the preheminence of prayse. For the other are but dim starres, where learninge giueth light. And as when the sunne shineth, the light of the stars is not séene: so where learning appeareth, all other giftes are nothing to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of. Besides that, beeside his learning, he was indued with a great dexteritie in all thinges, in so mutch as nothing came amisse vnto him, whiche was méete for a Gentleman: in feates of armes no man more couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in exercises of the body none more actiue, in game or play none more politike, amongst the auncient who more graue? amongst the youthfull, who more merrie? so that there was no time, no person, no place, wherto hee aptly applyed not him self. By reson wherof, he was acceptable to all good companies, &amp; wel was he that might entertaine him in his hous. But most of al he freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>hous of one Luciano a noble Gentleman of the same countri, &amp; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuaunce of time grew so farre in familiaritie with his wife, that he reposed his onely pleasure in her presence. Yea shee had made sutch a stealth of his harts, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Father nor Mother, Sister nor Brother, nor all the friends he had in the country beside, could keepe him one wéeke together out of her compani. Yea this faithful loue hée bare her, séemed in a manner to extinguish all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall loue towards his allies, and kinsfolke: Who beeinge (as they were wont) desirous of his company at hauking, hunting, and sutche like pastimes, coulde not by any era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or importunity obtayne it: but being ignorant of the cause, they thought it had proceded of this, that his minde vpon some occasion had been alienated from them, which caused them on the contrarie, somewhat to withdrawe their goodwils from him. But hee forced litle thereof, he cared not whom hee displeased, so he might worke her
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1570:100"/>
contentation: shee was the starre by whose aspect he did direct his doynges, she was the hauen wherein he sought to harborough, shée was the heauen whyther he coueted to come, shee was the saint to whom hée did lend sutch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, that hee could finde in his heart to bend no liking to any other whatsoeuer. In so mutch, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hauing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of many ritch maryages, hee alway refused them, as hauing his hart so replenished w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the loue of her, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there was no roomth for the loue of any other to remayn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him. Now shee, on the other side, whose name was <hi>Penthea,</hi> béeinge a curteous courtly wenche, gaue him sutch freindly entertaynment, and vsed him so well in all respectes, that, her husband excepted, shee séemed to holde him most dere vnto her of any wight in the whole world. Shée neuer made feast, but hée must bee her guest: shee neuer rode iourney, but he must be her companion: shee neuer daunced, but hee must direct her: shee neuer dised, but hee must bee her partner: shee, in a manner, dyd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, wherin hee did not something. Her Husbande all this while beeinge fully assured of her vertue, and very well perswaded of the honesty of the Gentleman, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected no euill beetweene them, but lyked very well of their loue and familiarity together, neither in deede had hee any cause to the contrary. For <hi>Pigmalion</hi> knew her to bee indued with sutch constant vertue, that he thought it impossible to allure her to any folly: and besides that, his loue was so exceedinge great towardes her, that hee would not by any meanes bee the cause to make her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thinge, which might make her lesse worthy of loue then shee was. And if at any time (as the fleshe is frayle) the vehemency of his affection forced him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade her to folly, he did it so faintly, that it might plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee perceiued hee was not willing to ouercome. For hee deepely doubted, that if by the force of her loue towardes him, or of his perswasions towardes her, shee should haue yeelded the forte of her fayth and chastity in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1570:100"/>
to his handes, his loue towards her (with the sun beinge at the highest) would haue declined and decreased, which would haue bene the greatest greife to him in the world. No, hee liued with sutch delight in the contemplation of her chastity and vertue, that hee was voyde not only of <hi>Libidinous</hi> lust towardes her, but also towardes all other women whatsoeuer. Yea, hee receiued more pleasure of her by imagination, then of any other woman by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> acte of generation. So that betweene these friends was no cause of suspicion, no cause of iarre, no cause of ielousie: but they liued together the space of three or foure yeares in most heauenly hauen of most happie lyfe. The floud of their felicity flowed from the fountaine of most faithful friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, the building of their bidinge together was raised on the rock of vertu, so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it was to be thought, no seas of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie, or floudes of fickelnesse coulde haue vndermined it. But what perpetuitie is to bee looked for in mortall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences? What constancy is to bée hoped for in kytes of <hi>Cressids</hi> kinde? may one gather Grapes of thornes, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Thistels, or constancy of women? Nay if a man sift the whole sexe thorowly, hée shall finde their wordes to bee but winde, their fayth forgery, and their déedes dissemblinge. You must not (Gentlewomen) take these words to come from mée, who dare not so mutch as thinke so mutch, mutch lesse say so mutch, for that truth getteth hatred, I meane sutch as tell not the truth, as hée in no wise should not doe, which should blowe foorth any sutch blast of the most faythfull and constant feminine kinde. But you must take these spéeches to procéede from <hi>Pigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> who, to speake vprightly, had some cause to discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend some in particuler, though not to condemne all in generall, as you shall foorthwith heare. For it fell so out that an Ambassadour came out of a straunge country in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Piemount,</hi> and was appointed to lye at the house of <hi>Luciano</hi> the time of his aboade in the country. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the company which came with him, there was
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1570:101"/>
vne young Gentleman, in whom though there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy of commendation any way, yet whether it procéeded of the daintinesse of women, who (as <hi>Pigmalion</hi> thought) wilbée soone wery of one diet, or of their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering (who are constant in nothing) or of their imperfect nature (which tendeth alway to the worst) I knowe not, but this lady began to conceaue a very good opinion of him, and in short tyme in affection far to prefer hym bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her old faithful freind. Which <hi>Pigmalion</hi> perceiuing, being in their presence, drunke vp his sorowe in scilence, but hauing withdrawen hym self out of theyr companye, into his solitarie chamber, he entred with hym self into this raging rayling.</p>
               <p>O faigned fawning, O counterfayt curtesy, O déepe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling, O hony mixt with gall, O heauen turned to hell. Now doe I perceiue thy frendshyp heretofore was nothing but flattery, thy loue, leude thy curtesy of course, nowe am I assured thou madest of me a vertue of necessy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, to serue thy turne for lacke of other company. Dyd I prefer thee before father and freend, and canst thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre before me a straunger, whom thou neuer sawest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of no countenance, credite, or constansy, but waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with the wynd? Dyd I beare thee faythfull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire affection, and canst thou beare greater goodwill to hym, who careth not for thee? who beareth stedfast affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to none, in whom is nothing but flitting fantasy, and meere vanity? &amp; canst thou thus prefer leudnesse before learning, tryfling before truth, clownishnes before court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse, vanitie before vertue? then farewel reason, thou restest not in womans head: then farewel wyt, thou wieldest not womens doinges: then farewel fayth, thou art no womans pheare: then farewel women, you are no mates for me. And hereuppon verily determined with hym self vtterly to abandon her company for euer: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending his owne rashnesse, he ment to haue a further troyall of her triflinge towardes him, and also to looke
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1570:101"/>
more narrowly into the dooinges and behauiour of that other Gentleman, that if hée could see any thinge in him wherby hée worthily deserued to bée preferred before him selfe, hee might more patiently indure it. Whervpon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling his greife so well as hée could, hee made repaire againe vnto her house, and there noting her loue by her lookes, her fancy by her face, and her conceites by her countenance, hee easily perceiued to whom shée bent her best deuotion, and who was her holiest Idol. Likewise, diligently considering the conuersation of the gentleman, hee perswaded himselfe that in indifferent iudgment, where affection did not make blinde, the best guiftes ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of body or minde which were in him, were not to be compared to the worst which were in him self: the one being not perfect any way, the other imperfect noway. So that seeing neither his owne worthynes, neither the others vnworthynes, could settle her affection as it should be, he vtterly apealed from her vnworthy &amp; vnequal iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and geuing her the <hi>bezolas manos,</hi> hee altogether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straunged hymself from her societie. See the meruaylous power of his loue, who notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he neuer inioyed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vse of her body, and certaynly knewe that the other had not won that poynt of her neither, yet he tooke it so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously, that she should seeme to beare greater goodwyll towardes the other then hym, that he fully resolued with him selfe, to esche we the company of all other women for her sake, and neuer to suffer the loue of any to sinke again so déepely into his harte. And surely (Gentlewomen) this <hi>Pigmalion</hi> may bee a presedent and proofe to confute the errour of those, who thinke there can bee no hot and feruent loue betwéene a man &amp; a woman, vnlesse it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede of some pleasant practise betwéen them. And if they sée any freindly familiarity betweene a younge Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Gentlewoman, they forthwith conceiue an euil opinion of their honest affection. Which errour, as it is most grose, so may it bée defaced by sundry reasons. For
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1570:102"/>
how it is possible that of an il cause, can come a good effect? That firme freindship can flow from fading fancy? That the heauenly consent of mindes, should proceed of the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall coniunction of bodies? Which, if it were so, those men (if I may call them men) which dayly deale with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon women, should bee very faythfully and freindly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned towardes them: but it is so far of, that in my fancy after the fact, they rather loth them, then loue them. Both for that a lothsome repentaunce followeth it, and also (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith) men therby are made lesse perfect. So that I thinke the coniunction of bodies, rather a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of minde then otherwise. And true freindship béetweene man and man, or man &amp; woman, is grounded only on that which is good and honest. Yea, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that the wanton louer himselfe, is as well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the good countenaunce, louing lookes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte agréement of his misteris minde with his, as with the vse of her body. Which, although hée oftentimes er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desire, yet I thinke it bée as mutch to know therby her vnfayned goodwill towardes him, to confirme it with a naturall bonde, and to procure her contentment, as for that hée reposeth the fulnesse of his felicitie therein. So, if then a lewd louer altogether vowed to vanitie, can loue without lust, how mutch more easily may a faithful freind bée feruent in affection, and yet colde in desire? And as <hi>Pigmalion</hi> may bée a playne president, that a man may loue loyally, and yet not desire laciuiously: so may <hi>Florinda</hi> bée a fruitfull example to the feminine sorte, to doe the like, who bearyng sutch feruent affection to her freinde <hi>Amadour,</hi> that shee helde him more dere then her owne life, that shée receiued more contentacion in the companie of him, then of husband, father, mother, freinde or whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer: yet shee was so far of from filthy affection towards him, that shee auoyded, so neare as shee could, all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which might draw him into any disordinate desire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes her. In so mutch, that hauyng occasion of priuie
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1570:102"/>
conference with him in a priuie place, beefore shee came, shee fouly defaced her face, and bruised it with a stoane, that hee might not bée inflamed with the feature thereof, and diuers other wayes at diuers other times, valiantly withstoode all alarms of lust. Therfore they are no doubt deceiued, which thinke that loue cannot bée without lust, neither feruent affection without fleshly fancie. And I would not wish any to iudge so iniuriously of the familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of freindes, sutch light iudgements, proue but a light iudge: sutch suspicious opinions, for the most part procéede from suspected persons: and they are commonly sutche themselues as they thinke other to bee: for <hi>mala mens, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus animus:</hi> an euil disposition bréedeth an euill suspition. But to returne to <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> who, for al his feruent loue, beyng frustrate of the fruites therof, and not incountred with the like, got from the house of his fickle freinde, and beeing alone in his owne lodginge, hée entred with him selfe into this discourse. Notwithstandynge my loue hath been alway guided rather by reason then rage, and my fancie neuer at any time turned to furie, by reason wherof I haue not been greatly pinched with the panges therof, yet when I consider the common course of louers, and of loue, surely of all punishments inflicted on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde, there is none that doth more afflict vs, then the Iewde lots therof, and the firie dartes of <hi>Cupid.</hi> For all other euils by nature we flie from, by reason we redresse, by pollicie wee preuent, by pleasure wee mitigate, by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience wée moderate, by labour wee lighten, by payne we appease, by counsayle wee cure, by time wée take away, or by some meanes or other set our selues free from. But this hatefull loue by nature wee follow, it beréeneth vs of reason, pollicie hath no place in it, pleasure doubleth our dolour, patience purchaseth no ease, labour is lost, payne preuayleth not, counsayle conduceth not, time tieth and intangleth vs, no, nothyng is able to leade vs out of this intricate Labyrinth: And though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleasures pertayuing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1570:103"/>
to loue, séeme great: yet who so euer purposeth to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase them, let him assure him selfe to buy them at an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable rate. Euery pecke of pleasure shall cost him a quarter of care, for euery pinte of hony hee shall taste a gallon of gall. Yea though the entry which leadeth to the lodginge of loue séeme easy, &amp; the porche paradise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, yet shall hee finde the hall a hell, and the whole house a hateful priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and place of bondage. For as Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vnder a shew of calme wether, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit them selues to the sea, are oftentimes with tempestes so tossed, that rushinge against the rockes, their ships are shaken to péeces, and they deuoured in the depth of the sea: so hee that vnder the curteous countenance of a wauering wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man yéeldeth himself to loue, is commonly so wrapped in the waues of wiles, that hée is altogether drowned in the depth of deceit, and hardly escapeth with the losse of his liberty and lyuinge. Wee sée the flie playeth so long with the flame, that hee is scourched therwith, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience is no lesse common then lamentable, that men dally so longe with dainty dames, that at length they are scorched in the flames of fancy, and the winges of their frée will quight burned away. And then, good God it is strange to consider their case, how carelesly they deale in all thinges, how leudly they spend their time, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally they consume their gooddes, how negligently they regard their freindes, how lothsomely they like good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle, how resolute they are in their owne fonde deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, how dissolute in their béehauiour, howe soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taryly they sit in scilence, how secretly they conceale their greife, how sorowfully they spend their daies, how fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically their mindes are troubled, how feebly their bodies are weakned, what broken sleepes, what doubtful dreame, what vaine visions they haue. And touching their beelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, how curiously they commend them, howe partially they prayse them, how doltishly they doate on them, how wilfully they are blinded in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how supersticiously they

thinke of them, how idolatroucly they worship them, how zelously they loue them, how ielously they looke to them, how warely they wach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how willingly they serue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how painfully they imploy themselues to pleasure them, how readily they run vnder their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, how obediently they bowe at their beck &amp; cum at their cal, how deadly thei hate their enemies, how deeply thei loue their freindes, how charily they seeke their goodwill, how chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishly they feare their ill will, how gladly they take a good looke, how sadly they receiue a sower countenance, how foolishly they fulfil their desires, how fondly thei frame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to their fancies, how with lookes they shew their loue, &amp; with signes signifie their goodwil, how it greeueth them to haue any other looked vpon or spoken to, how in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> presence of their ladies they frie as hotly as Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> how in their absence they frize as coldly as the Hill <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casus,</hi> how present they prefer sutes, how absent they send salutations, how present they flourish, how absent they fade: to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, how present they liue, how absent thei dy. But on the other side, to waigh the dealings of their dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings towards them, it makes my hart sore to think, that any man shoulde bee so mad, as not vtterly to abhorre them. For, first while they sée a man frée from folly and without the compasse of their cozenage, they fetch many a windlas to driue him into the nets of naughtinesse, &amp; to intrap him in their trechery: and if they perceiue him so strongly armed with wisdome, that their bolstred beuty cannot bleare his eyes, then foorth with they goe about to compasse him with their counterfeit courtesye, then, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, they frame sutch friendly countenaunces towards him, and pretend to beare him so great goodwill, that hee cannot (vnlesse hee will shewe himselfe altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull and discourteous) but frame his fancy towards them againe. Now, so soone as they sée him reasonably well reclaimed to the lure of their alluring looks, they by and by stop the lure vpon him, and cause him to houer in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1570:104"/>
hope and teach him to flie a high pitche, for a pray of litle profit or pleasure. For then they cast very coy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances towards him, yea they will not so mutch as with a glaunce giue any signe of goodwil: but when they haue made him lie so long in the aire, that he is redy either to take a stande, or soare away, they flinge forth a traine of treason, and cast some slattringe hope, and faigned faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for him to feed on, lest his kindnes by their coldnesse should quaile, and so he retire his desyre. But if they see him to be so sharpe set, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he will stoupe at euery stale, or know him to be an eyesse which wil neuer away, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make him flye and neuer serue him, they bangle him out and bob him as they list, then they keepe themselues out of his sight to make him more sharp, then in his presence they lend louing lookes to other, then they make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so strange, that hee is driuen to beegin agayne, and to renew his sute afresh. And the ende of all this is, to sport themselues in his paine, to glory in his griefe, and to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in his tormentes. Sutch mallice they beare him that beareth them great goodwill. Yea hee whiche loueth them best is sure to be handled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worst, for they know he is armed with loue to indure the force of their fraude, &amp; like an Asse to beare any burthen whiche they shal lay on his back. Yea they will not stick to yeelde their bodies to some course <hi>quidem</hi> in a corner, rather then they will bestow on him one courteous countinance, sutch is their ill nature to cleue to the worst, and proudly to disdaine him that humbly desireth them, and openly to reiect all men though neuer so noble, and secretly to refuse no man though neuer so base. And as the Humble bée flieth all the day in the pleasaunt aire, and thinketh mutch to light euen vppon the swéete flowers, but at night taketh no skorne to lodge in a Cowes foule sharde: so these dainty dames, in company think skorne to yeelde loue to any, but in corners they care not to practise with some lothsome skullion, or horse boy. But if they think this louer, whom
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1570:104"/>
they haue so daintily dealte withall, haue oyle to coale their furious flames, and bee euery way fit for theyr fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, he shall perchaunce, after this tedyous toyle, and long sute in the court of curtesy and conscience, be aduised and admitted for a more speedy dispatch of his lyuing, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his action in the common place: I meane, he shalbe receued into their good grace and fauour, and be now and then feasted with the best banquets in their bodyes. But by that tyme the reckonnyng be payed, he shall finde his chere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so chargable, that all thinges consydered, he might haue fared better far better cheape, at the most cutthrote Inne in a country. Then must the Chaines, the Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, the Iewels, the Kings, the Diamonds, the Pearls, bee prouided: then must hee buie for euery part a peece, for euery finger a fangle, for euery toe a toy: then must their maides bee monied, their bauds bribed, their scouts considered, their seruaunts satisfied, and euer as they lye open to him so his purse must lie open to them and theirs. And hereof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the spoyle of a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of noble &amp; lustie younge Gentlemen: yea and the nobler bloude and the franker hart they are of, the sooner &amp; sorer is their decay &amp; confusion. For lyke as the fire hauing stones cast into it doth onely alter their colour and make them black, but cannot consume them, but hauing wood thrown into it, it wasteth it cleane away: so these cousoning Curtizanes, if some hard mettald louer light vnto their lot, they onely alter his estate, and bringe him from very wealthy to somewhat néedy, but if a frée and franke childe chaunce vppon them, they wholy consume him body and goodes. A thing surely on our parte rather to bee punnished then pittied, who being by God endued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greater wits, should suffer our selues so villanously to bee vanquished by the weaknesse of women. But verely as Spiders conuert to poison whatsoeuer they touche, so women infect with fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whom so euer they deale withall. And I think them made of God only for a plague and wo vnto men, as their

name importeth. And as <hi>Eue</hi> caused <hi>Adam</hi> to bee depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of Paradise, so I think her sexe is ordained to depriue <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> posterity of prosperiti. Yea in mariage it self where only they are counted necessarie, I sée not but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they are accompanied with more care then commoditie, more cost then comforte, more paine then gaine, more greife their good. Sutch falsenesse if they be faire, sutch silthinesse if they bee foule, sutch wiles if they bee wittie, sutch fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse if they be fooles, sutch proudnesse if they bee noble, sutch rudenesse if they be base, so nice if they bee vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, sutch vice if they be vicious, sutch lustinesse if they bee young, sutch lothsomnesse if they bee olde, sutch light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes if they be merrie, sutch sullennes if they be sad, sutch often desyre of sport if they be healthy, sutch seld in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse if they bee sikly, sutch vnholsomnesse if they be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, sutch quesinesse if they bee with childe, sutch longe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sutch daintinesse, sutch waiwardnesse: at all times in fare sutch finenes, in apparrel sutch costlines, in hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde stuffe sutch curiousnesse: at most times so immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, sutch poutinge, sutch lowringe, sutch chidinge, sutch chafing, that to conclude with scripture, I thinke best for man not to touche a woman.</p>
               <p>Gentlewomen, you must vnderstande, this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was in a great heate, and therefore you must beare with his bolde blasphemy against your noble sexe: for my part, I am angry with my selfe to haue vttred it, &amp; I shall like my lisping lippes the worse for that they haue bene the instrumentes of sutch euill, neither shall I think them sauory againe, vntill it shall please some of you to season them with the swéetenesse of yours. But yet hée himselfe was so fully confirmed in this fayth and beleife, touching the fraylty and fraud of women, that I thinke no torment, no not the fury of fire could haue forced him to recant his opinion. For euer after, hée sled al occasions of womens company, perswading himselfe, that as hée which toucheth pitch shalbée defiled therwith, so hee that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1570:105"/>
vseth womens company shalbée béeguiled therwith. And as the mouse hauing escaped out of the trap, will hardly bée allured againe with the intising bayt, or as the Hauke hauing béen once canuassed in the nets, wil make it daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to strike againe at the stale: so hée hauing beene caught in the snares of crafty counterfaytinge, and now hauing vnwound him selfe thereout, and won the fieldes offreedome, auoyded all occasions which might bringe him eftsoones into bondage. But man purposeth, and God disposeth, men determine, but the destinies doo: for what shalbe, shalbe: no pollicy may preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> power of the heauens, no dooinges of men can vndoethe destinies. For hee was so far of from beeing able to keepe him self from bééinge in loue with women, that hee fell in loue with a senceles thing, a stoane, an Image, (a iust punnishment for his rash rayling against the florishinge feminine sexe. For continuing (as I said before) his solitarily life, sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">r</hi> society of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most part of his time in caruing &amp; grauing Images, &amp; amongest all other his workes, he made out of Marble y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> likenesse of a proper wench (as by like) notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> new religion he was entred into, hauing most fancy to a feminine forme, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fashioned and finished it in the finest maner, he fel to looking on it: and as loue first entreth in at the eyes, and from thence discendeth to the hart, so hee looked so longe theron, that at length hee fel in loue with it, yea he was so wonderfully bewitched with it, that hee fell to imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, kissinge, and dallyinge with it. A monstrous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle no doubt, and rather to be wondred at then credited: And yet I haue heard of some that haue beene so possest with melancholy passions, that they haue thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to bee made of glasse, and if they had gone in any streete, they would not come neere any wall or house, for feare of breaking them selues: and so it may bee that this <hi>Pigmalion</hi> thought him selfe some stoane, and knowinge that like agree best with their like, hee thought he could
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1570:106"/>
make no better a match, then to match him self to a stone. Or it may bee hee was one of those, whom after the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall floud (as <hi>Ouid</hi> reporteth) <hi>Ducalion</hi> &amp; his wife <hi>Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raha</hi> made by casting stoanes at their backes: and then no meruaile though hee beare meruaylous affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to stones, beeing made of stoanes. Or whether his religion were to loue images, I know not: neither is it any more to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled at in him, then in an infinite nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> liue at this day, which loue images right well, &amp; verely perswade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Or whether it proceeded of this, that euery one is lightly in loue with that which is his owne, I knowe not: but this I read reported of him, that when neither by the feelinge of his sences, neither by the force of reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither by the assistance of time, neither by any other meane hee could rid his tender heart of this stoany loue, hee tooke his image and layd it in his bed, as if it had bene his birde, which done, hee went to the temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> &amp; there sendinge vp sighes for sacrifices, and vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his passions in steed of prayers, rufully repentinge his former rebellion against the maiesty of the Goddesse <hi>Venus,</hi> for that hee had blasphemed wickedly against wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and neglected the lawes and lore of loue, and sought to lodge himselfe in liberty, hee humbly requested her now to rue his ruthles case, and hee would remaine her thrall all the dayes of his life after. And that if it seemed good to her godhead to giue him a wife, that shee might bee (hee durst not say his image) but like vnto his image. <hi>Venus</hi> very wel knowing what he ment by this request, remembring also the wrong which <hi>Penthea</hi> beefore had profred him, for that hee loued her loyally the space of three or foure yeres with out any rewarde, except it were double disse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling for his singuler affection, &amp; therfore had some reason to rage against women as he did, she thought her self bound in conscience to cure his calamity, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge how Idolatrously hee was addicted to his Image, shée

put life into it, and made it a perfect woman. The like miracles wée haue had many wrought within these fewe yeres, when images haue béene made to bow their heads, to holde out their handes, to wéepe, to speake, &amp;c. But to <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> who hauing done his deuotions, returned to his lodging, and there according to custome fell to kissing his Image, which séemed vnto him to blush thereat, and taking better taste of her lips, they began to waxe very soft and sweete, and entringe into deeper dal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which hée séeinge, magnified the might and power of <hi>Venus,</hi> ioyfully tooke this maide vnto his wife. And so they liued together long time in great ioy and felicitie.</p>
               <p>You haue heard (Gentlewomen) what broad blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ficklenes of <hi>Penthea</hi> caused vnworthily to be blown forth against you all: wherefore to auoide the like, I am to admonish you that you prefer not new fangle freindes beèfore olde faythfull freindes: that you neither lightly leaue the one, neither lightly loue the other, for it is great lightnesse to doe either the one or the other. And beesides the incurring of the blot of inconstancy and wauering, it is very perilous for you to commit your selues &amp; your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to those, of whose trustines you haue made no trial. For all is not golde which glistereth, counterfayte coine sheweth more goodly then the good: and it is most easy to deceiue vnder the name of a freind. The common saying is, the chaunge is seldome made for the better, and your owne sayinge is, that of your seruauntes you had rather kéepe those whom you know, though with some faultes, then take those whom you knowe not, perchaunce with moe faultes. How mutch more then ought faythfull freindes to bee kept and accounted of, whom you know to bee perfectly good? They are not surely for any chance to beè chaunged, they are not for any respect to bee reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they are the only Iewels to bee ioyed in, the onely
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1570:107"/>
perles to bee preserued, the only pillers to bee trusted to. Wee like a picture made in marble, better then in waxe, bicause it will last longer: wee like the ritch Diamonde chiefly bicause it lasteth longe, and will not lightly lose it bright hew: so likewise, you ought to like those freindes best which last longest, &amp; haue liued longest with you. For you must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, true freinds are not like new garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which will be the worse for wearing: they are rather like the stoane of <hi>Scilicia,</hi> which the more it is beaten the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is: or like spices, which the more they are pounded, the swéeter they are, or like many wines, whiche the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they are the better they are. But to leaue true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and come to trifling friendship, consisting in pleasant priuie practises, I would wish those women which deale that way (although they beé no sheepe of my flocke, yet for their sexe sake, I wish them wel) I mould, I say, aduise them to vse wary héed in ridding away those freinds they are weary of. It is a daungerous peece of worke, and importeth as mutch as their good name commeth to, for if they shall, without discretion and great cause, disclaime a mans freindship, it is the next way (onlesse his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himselfe bée very great) to make him proclayme what freindship hee hath had of them in times past. This was it whiche made <hi>Fausline</hi> so famous as shee was: thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And surely I know not well what counsayle to giue in this case, it is a matter of harde digestion to a man to see her become straunge to him, who was wonte to bee most familier with him, to haue her his enemy, who was wont to be his freind. Therfore I would aduise them to sticke to their old freindes still, but if they cannot frame their fickle nature to sutch firmenes, the best way is, by litle and litle to estraunge them selues from their freindes, to pretend some ernest or honest cause, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that neuer any other shall possesse that place with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to promise that in hart they wilbe theirs during life.</p>

For first béeing desirous to passe the pilgrimage of this short life in pleasure, hee auoyded (so néere as heé could) al worldly vanities, reposing his chiefe pleasure in serching out the sacred skill of learned books, so that stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was his only pleasure in prosperitie, his onely solaco in aduersitie, his only exercise beeing freshe, his only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing beeing wery, his only sport, his only play. And notwithstanding hee had good skill in hauking, huntinge, diceing, carding, with sutch lyke, and somtime for recroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sake vsed them, yet hee counted all those pastimes a paine, in the respect of the pleasure whiche study procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hym. His Father séeinge him setled in this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary life, séemed to mislyke thereof, and disswaded hym from it, in this sorte.</p>

               <p>Sir, if it please you, I am of this opinion, that a good thinge, can not bée to mutch vsed, and that the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon it is, the more commendable it is, neither is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to séeke learning to mutch, whereof there was neuer any man yet but had to litle: and I thinke it shame to cease from séeking, when the thinge sought, is the onely thing worthy to bée thought. For what toyle can séeme te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to finde the way to wit, and path to prudency, the line of life and vaine of vertue? And for the commodity of my country. I doubt not, but you know, that the studious standithe common wealth in as great steed, as the indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious otherwise. Yea who first brought men within the compasse of a common wealth but only the learned? Who brought them from sauagenes to ciuilnes, was it not the learned? Who reduced them from rage to reason, was it not the learned? Who brought them into the society of a cittie, who prescribed them lawes, who taught them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who inuented mariage it selfe, which you are so ernest to haue mee enter into, was it not the learned? Yes no doubt, learning is the life of the common wealth, the maker and mayntainer of it. I must confes that those
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1570:109"/>
which vse trades of trauaile in the common wealth, doe mutch good to the common wealth, but I must say, the learned doe more good. I must confesse that souldiours often defend the common wealth: but I must say that ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning must lead them, otherwise they will sooner offend it, then defend it. I must confesse that souldiours often win wealth to their country: but I must say that <hi>Senatours</hi> must keepe it, and the cunning to kéepe, is no lesse commen dable then the courage to get, and courage god knoweth is litle worth abroade, vnlesse there bée good counsayle at home. For what worthy exploytes did any captaine euer atchiue abroad, but by the aduise of counsaylors at home? As the valiant victory which <hi>Themistocles</hi> had ouer <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> was atchiued by the counsayle of the <hi>Senate</hi> which <hi>Solon</hi> had constituted. The ouerthrow of <hi>Carthage</hi> was wrought by the aduise of <hi>Cato</hi> a counsailour. The distruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Troy</hi> was wrought not by lusty prowesse, but by learned pollicie. The takinge of <hi>Babilon</hi> by <hi>Darius,</hi> was not done by the strength of his army, but by the skilfull subtelty of his seruant <hi>Zopyrus.</hi> And so almost in all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table victories, pollicy preuayleth aboue power.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1570:110"/>
to study and learninge. For they very well knewe hée could not bée a perfect captaine, which was not perfectly séene in al sciences and learning. In <hi>Grammer,</hi> to attayn to the lattin tounge, and by it to the knowledge of other tounges, wherby hee may not bée deafe and dum amongst those with whome hee shall haue to deale in warre. In <hi>Rethoricke,</hi> cherefully to perswade his souldiours to such enterprises as hee would haue them attempt.

In <hi>Arithmetick</hi> to number his souldiours, to deuide them into bands, as best may serue for the battell. In <hi>Geometrie,</hi> to measure the ground, to iudge of the distance of places, wherby hee may cast his trenches, raise his bulwarks, &amp; place his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and munition to most aduantage. In <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> to know the course of the starres, the place of the <hi>Poles,</hi> the sight of the <hi>Zones,</hi> and sutch like, wherby hee may bée able to direct his army by night (either on sea or land) into what coastes hée shall haue occasion. In <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,</hi> to recreat himselfe béeing weary, to sing Psalmes prayses to God for the victory.

to auoyd infamy, with infinite other commodities, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with philosophy doth furnish vs. <hi>Cosmography,</hi> to know the situation of citties and countries, to take the oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of mountaines, woods, and waters. <hi>Surgery,</hi> to beale his wounds.

So that counsayle, learning and knowledge ought to bée the cheife weapons and complete harnesse of a captaine, yea knowledge is the armour of proofe which neither Cannon, Hargabus, nor Pistol can péerce.

If then learninge bée so necessary to warre (whereto many thinke it rather a hinderance, as the french nobility for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth at this day scarce dareth deale with it, for feare of marring their martiall feates) howe needfull must wee thinke it to other partes of the common wealth? Can the Prince set forth Gods glory, and sée to the realmes safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? can the nobility prouide for the preseruation of their prince and countries co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity? can diuines truly preach the gospel? can iudges duely minister iustice, can lawiers defend the innocent, can Phisitions heale the sicke, yea in

warre can the surgions cure the wounded without lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? Can Merchaunts safely passe the daungerous seas without skilfull Pilotes? Can they mutually trafique and bring in necessaries into the realme without skilfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters? To bee short, there is nothinge done to the countries commodity, wherto there is not had the help of skill and learning. So that learning and wit is the only wealth of ech country, the only conquerour in warre, the only preseruer of peace. Litigiousnes without learninge can doe no good, <hi>Mars</hi> without <hi>Minerua</hi> can make no good mart. Therfore (sir) well you may restraine mée from studye, but you shall neuer diswade mée from it. And wheras you perswade mee to enter into the state of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, I can not but thinke that the great desire you haue to do me good, doth so dim your vnderstanding, that you perfectly know not what will doe me good, otherwise you would not goe about to bringe mee (as they say) out of Gods blessing into a warme sunne. For if you knew the commodities of this life, whiche I now leade, &amp; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the discommodities of that life you would haue mée to leade, I knowe you woulde neuer counsayle mee to cleaue to the one and leaue the other. In this sutch quiet, in that sutch care, in this sutch puritie, in that sutch prauitie, in this sutch vertue, in that sutch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nytie, in this sutch contentation, in that sutch vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in this sutch caulmes, in that sutch stormes, in this sutch safetie, in that sutch ieopardie, in this sutch felicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in that sutch miserie, that I mutch muse that you your selfe murmur not at the miseries in marriage, and séeke to bée setled in the swéete solace of single life againe.</p>
               <p>The people called <hi>Massagetes</hi> liuinge in mountaines without houses, enacted this law amongst them, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie inhabitant should haue two tunnes, or fats, in the one should lie the husband, sonnes, and men seruants, in the other the wiues, daughters, and maide seruants, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eate together but on holy daies, and may not lawfully

They answered him, The gods had geuen them but short time to liue on the earth, which they ment to spend quietly, which beeinge together with their wiues, they saide they could neuer doe. And <hi>Licur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> himself, whom you alleage in commendation of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, was almost of the <hi>Massagetes</hi> minde, for hee willed men not to lie continually with their wiues, but to vse their company seldome and by stealth, whereby you may sée that marriage is a daungerous thinge, and daintely to be dealt with all, and that hée had néede to bee armed with more yéeres then I am, that shall venter vppon it.

               <p>May it please you then to knowe, that <hi>Alexius</hi> séeinge howe desirous his Father was to haue him marrie, thought it the part of an obedient child, to apply himself to the plesure of his parents, and to enter into that trade of lyfe wherein his father beefore him had troden: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon hée somwhat intermitted his earnest study, and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to peruse those bookes, which treated but of litle lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; in stéed of schooles, frequented those places where

at the first being a fresh man for the principles of his sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hee was taught with lookes, not with letters, and with the eyes, not with the mouth: well in short space it fortuned one of his good instructors, by lendinge him a looke to learne hym sutch a lesson (as best wits are soonest caught by <hi>Cupid</hi>) that hée could not bee quiet till hée had gotten out alone by himself perfectly to con it: where he sayde it without booke in this sort.</p>
               <p>I perceiue now that saying is true, that the greatest clarks are not the wisest men, and that in respect of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, learning is litle to bée accounted of. For I sée the foolishnesse of my Father (if it were possible there shoulde be any in him) to bée far better then all my wisdome and learning.

Then he proceeded further in his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and came to numbers, hee was driuen to number and tell out his coyne, and to buie rings, tablets, chaines, and sutch like, to sende to his misteris, as tokens of true loue, to linke liking, and to binde fast the bargaine. After this, hee attained to the knowledge of the articles, for now articles must bee drawen of their agréement, her ioynter must bee appoynted, all the conueiances concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this contract are concluded. This lesson neither dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked hym, for that his father was able euery way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it.

This lesson hée soone had learned, and yet thought with himself that hée neuer had sufficiently lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, which made him in short time make repetition of it a thousand times. And for recreation after his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, his exercise alwayes was either to triumph of his owne happinesse, either to trisle and talke with his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris, either in verse curiously to commende her, or els in prose liuely to paint foorth the praise of women, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

               <p>As it somewhat easeth the afflicted to vtter their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy, so no doubt, it greatly increaseth our happinesse to expresse our ioy.

O Father, thou only knowest how to blesse thy children? then what more happines could happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto me then to haue a wife, whose countenance coueteth only to content mée, whose lookes are framed only to my lykinge, whose wordes are only wrested to my wyll, whose deedes are only directed to my delight, whose beautie then the sun beames is more bright, whose bounty, wit and vertue is more rare then to be comprehended in a mortal wight, who in shape <hi>Venus,</hi> in wit passeth <hi>Pallas</hi> her selfe, who is the only starre which giueth right light, who is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worship of the worlde, the only honour of her age, the only <hi>Phaenix</hi> of the earth, whose gouernment is sutch, that she can guide her selfe wisely in all companies, in all causes, whose discretion is sutch, that shee can applie her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe fitly to all times, to all places, to all persons, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth mée so loyally, that I cannot but like it, who honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth mee so dutifully, that I cannot looke for more, who at all times entertaineth mée so curteously, that I cannot
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1570:113"/>
but bee content with it, who dayly filleth my eares with sutch sugred words, that they can not but delight mée, who at borde feedeth mée so daintily that a prince would bée pleased with it, who at bed feasteth mee so delicately that <hi>Cupid</hi> him selfe would bée glad of it? O Misteris, thou only knowest how to make thy husband happy. But what meruayle is it to sée a good trée bring forth good fruit? what wonder is it to sée one woman good, when there are none ill? And how is it possible there should bée any ill, when y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter wherof they are made, &amp; causes wherof they come are right good? For first they are made of the purified met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of man, wheras man was made of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> grosse earth: And as in stils out of herbs is gotten pure water: so out of man was gotten y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pure mettall of women, as may bée plainly perceiued by the finenesse of their fourme, by the softnesse of their flesh, by the clerenesse of their colour &amp; sutch like. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the constitution of their bodies, they are most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly colde, by reason wherof they are most patient, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, milde, and mercifull, most constant without light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, most continent without leudnesse, neither offende, either in excesse of meate, either in fleshly heate, so often as men of firy and hot complexions doe. Besides that, the purity of their bodies may bée perceiued by this, that no corruption comminge by the grosenesse of meat or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, can continue long within them, but that they haue continually euacuation of all yll humours: sutch force hath that which is fine, to expel that which is filthy. And as their bodies are most perfecte, so also their soules are most pure. For wheras men receiue from <hi>Adam</hi> origy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne, women are altogether voide of that infection, which may be partly coniectured by the excellency of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their complexions, &amp; cleerenes of their skins: so that no man almost would think y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there could lurke any loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnes to be misliked of, vnder so cumly a couert as their faire faces are, but only they y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> haue proued the contrarie. But notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding this perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet (as things most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are euer most enuied) their
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1570:114"/>
want not those which want so mutch gouernmente, that they will not sticke ernestly to inueigh against the noble feminine sexe, and amongest the rest (as who is so bold as blind bayard.) <hi>Mantuan</hi> like a mad man, most rudely and rashly raueth and rayleth against them. But his wordes are so voyde of wit, and his railing so without reason, that if hee were aliue, I thinke him rather with tormentes to bee confounded, then with argumentes to bee confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Before him <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as an Asse sotted with ouer mutch studdy maketh a great speake, sayinge: women are monsters in nature, and he alleageth a profound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to proue it, for that nature, forsooth, alwayes inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to bringe forth that which is most perfect, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would bring forth only men if shee might. Apythy argumente, hee reasoneth as though it were graunted him, that men were more perfecte then women, which with all his philosophy, hee shall neuer bee able to proue. And if hee make this reason, that the male is euer more perfect then the female, nature her selfe will quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him, who in most of her creatures hath made the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male far more perfect then the male. And not to vse many instances, what need wee goe any farther then consider the kinde of Hawkes, where wee shall see the Goshauke far better then the Tossell, the Gerfaulcon then the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, the Lanar then the Lanaret, the Spar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hauke then the Musket, and so of all the rest. But <hi>Aristotle</hi> can make a better reason, for that women by mutuall coniunctions receiue their perfection from men, a reason truely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all reason. What woman was euer more perfecte then the virgin Mary, who neuer knew man? Then the <hi>Romaine</hi> vestall virgins? Then our vowed virgins, who continued the whole course of their life without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men? But <hi>Ceny</hi> forsooth beeinge a mayd desired to bee made a man. But will you know the cause? Not for that shee coueted to bee of the kinde of man, but that shee might bee free from the filthinesse whiche men did force her to (for before she had bene rauished by <hi>Neptune</hi>)
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1570:114"/>
like as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> litle chicke being caught by the kyte, would wish with all his heart hée were a Kite, and yet the kind of Kites is not to be thought better then of the chicken. But to leaue <hi>Aristotle</hi> his railyng reasons, and to reason indifferently of the matter, what one perfection any way are men indued withall, that women want? Do men (I say) either in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wit, either in politike gouernment, either in valiant courage, either in skill and learnyng, either in vertue and liuyng, any thyng excell them? And first for wit, <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe proueth them to bee more apt in wit, for that they are more soft in fleshe, and we our selues haue a common sayinge amongst vs, that women are neuer without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, which is a sure signe of a most sharpe and readie wit. And if I were driuen to alledge exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of witty women, I coulde recite whole countries, to wit, <hi>Flaunders, Holland, Zeland,</hi> and most of the lowe countries, where the women wittily deale in al thinges, discreetly order their housholds, courteously entertayne straungers, and wisely wield most waightie affayres, wheras the men deale only with drinke, and like drunken doltes lie vnder the bourde. In <hi>Fraunce</hi> also, the Gentlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> generally are more wittie in words, and eloquent in talke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the men. The like no doubt may bee truly reported of diuers other nations. Then for politik gouernment, is it likely that they, who can gouerne them selues and their affections discréetely, their families and housholdes orderly, are to séeke in the polytike gouerment of publike matters? For (no doubt) it is far more easy to see wittily into other mens affaires then into our owne: and <hi>Solon</hi> sayth, that they only are fit to gouerne other, who can well guide them selues, neither is the difference so great betweene a priuate family and publike society, but that they which can gouerne the one, may wyeld the other. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, seeinge in matters of loue (which blinde the wisest men that are) women can deale so politikely, that though they themselues beare great affection to a man, yet they will so handle the matter that they shall humbly make sute vnto them, and ernestly desire them to it, which thei of them
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1570:115"/>
selues most ernestly desire, seeinge in priuy stealthes they can practise so politikely y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> their husbands, though neuer so wary, shal neuer be ware of it, but rather the more they are deceiued, doate y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> more of them. Is it to be thought they are to learne of men, or any way inferiour to them, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaigh of ordinary accidents, and matters of common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? But women are not admitted to the administration of the common wealth: but what forsooth is the cause? For sooth the malicious spite of men: and I may saye it to my self, it standeth vs vpon so to do, for if they should be allowed to execute publike offices, whereby their discreet and good gouernment might be generally known, it were greatly to bée feared that wee should be set to the clout and kitchin an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while, and they placed in those offices, whiche wee now, not so worthy of them, wrongfully vsurpe. And yet to the intent all sutch bright lights should not bee put vnder a bush<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll, it hath pleased god to set some of them on the hils of high estate, to giue light of life and good gouernment to the whole world: as namely the wife of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> named <hi>Laui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> after his death gouerned the most turbulent state of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> with sutch policy and wisdome, that though the title of her husband to the kingdom were very tickle, beeinge a <hi>Troian</hi> &amp; straunger, though her neighbours on euery side were giuen to spoylyng, incroching, oppressyng, and vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge, yet shee kept her people in peace, and her kingdome quiet, vntill her sonne <hi>Ascanius</hi> came to ripe yeeres, &amp; then safely set him in the regall seate and royall dignity of his father. As <hi>Debora</hi> for her wit and policy was appointed iudge ouer the Israelits, by whose counsayle and courage that couragious captayne &amp; capital enemy to the Israelits, named <hi>Sysara</hi> was subdued. But what should I rehearse examples of the politique gouernment of women, whereas lawes (the only ground of all good gouernment) were first inuented and made by <hi>Ceres,</hi> a woman?</p>
               <p>Therfore to the third point, which is valiaunt courage: wherin we our selues confesse them to be nothing inferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our vnto vs, in that wee say women are alwayes destrous
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1570:115"/>
of soueraintie, which euidently argueth a noble and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty minde. Béesides that, howe mutch weaker their bodies are then mens, so mutch the more strength and vertue is contained in their mindes. For it is the iustice of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, to supply the debilitie of the body, with the might of the minde. Againe, how mutch shorter lyued are they then men, according to <hi>Aristotle</hi> his opinion, so mutch the more vertue of body and minde they are endued withall. Like as by dayly experience, wée sée that those children which are destined to death in the prime time of their lyfe, are farre more wittie, discréete, &amp; perfect euery way, then those who haue longe time graunted them to liue on earth. Lastly, if particularyties might proue a generality, what man was euer more couragious then <hi>Semiramis,</hi> who in the habite &amp; apparell of a man gouerned y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Assirians,</hi> most couragiously? then <hi>Tomiris,</hi> who slue the mighty Kinge <hi>Cyrus</hi> most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently? then the wiues of the citie of <hi>Scio,</hi> who repulsed their enimies most reprochefully? with infinite other, who in stoutnes of stomack, and couragiousnes of minde, haue ben equall to any man, that euer had any praise for his prowes and vertue. The fourth poynt is learninge, which to bee proper as it were to women may bee proued by this, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the <hi>Muses</hi> the authors of all lerning were wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It may be said that the people called the <hi>Latines</hi> lent vs mutch learninge, but it must bée saide that a woman named <hi>Nicostrata</hi> first taught them their letters. It may be said that <hi>Athens</hi> hath bene the author of many arts, but it must be sayd y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Aspasia</hi> instructed <hi>Pericles</hi> the Duke thereof in learning. <hi>Solomon</hi> was most wise and learned, yet <hi>Saba</hi> was able to dispute with him. <hi>Zenobia</hi> had learned sonnes, but shee her selfe taught them. So that it is euident that women are rather the author of learninge, then any way inferiour to men in learning. The last poynt is vertuous life. Alas it gréeueth mée to thinke how far we come behinde in this comparison. How straunge is it to heare a woman to bée a swearer, a stealer, a murtherer, a traytor, a rebel, an extorcioner, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

it, we wallow in those wickednesses. How hard againe is it to finde a man of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation, of modest manners, of milde minde, of gentle disposition, of curteous inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of pitifull hart? To their praise I speake it, women abound in those vertues. So that to speake indifferently, béetwéene the life of men and women, is as mutch difference as bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene light and darknesse, beetween vertue and vice, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and the diuell. Therfore, séeing women excell men in perfection of body &amp; soule, in wit and gouernment, in courage, in learning, in life &amp; conuersation, what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile is it if my misteris make mee happie? what wonder is it if she winne mee to her wil? what méede do I deserue, if I serue her all the daies of my life? For duty no doubte is due vnto her, and I thinke my seruice not sufficient to shew the goodwil which I am bounde to beare her.</p>
               <p>You haue harde (Gentlewomen) what praise <hi>Alexius</hi> for his misteris sake hath bestowed vppon you all, whiche I doubt wil driue you into so good an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your selues, that you will thinke so meane a man as my selfe not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your company: but I would wish you to take héede, for in so doyng you might shew your selues to want that wit and curtesie whiche <hi>Alexius</hi> hath attributed vnto you, and if you prooue him false in one poynte, it is as likely he hath lyed in all the rest. But to speake my fancie fréely of the praise which hee hath geuen you, though some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler examples bée so manifestly true, that all the world doth acknowledge them, yet his general reasons are altogether sophisticall and full of fallacies, set forth without any liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colour, only with fayning &amp; painting: and the fine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you know needeth no painting, that is néedfull only for ragged walles. I meane not that hée ment women were ragged walles, and therfore painted them out in sutch sort, but surely the sequele of his dooings was sutch, that it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeared hee thought not so well of women in déede as hée set foorth in wordes. For hauing (as I sayd béefore) often saide his lesson of the coniunction of cases &amp; genders together vpon the booke, and either séeing it impossible to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1570:116"/>
attaine it without the booke, either béeinge wery with the often repetition of it, either seing there was no end in it, or els béeing desirous to learne farther and take foorth a new lesson, he left this lesson with dispaire, and procéeded to the declensons, hee beganne now to decline, which lesson hee sayde to himselfe in this sort.</p>
               <p>Good God I sée there is satietie of all thinges, &amp; Hony it selfe, if one haue to mutch of it, séemeth nothing swéete vnto him. How vnpleasant now séemeth the pleasure of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with my misteris, which but euen now I thought hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly happinesse? How are my firy flames vanished to dead coales? How is my lust turned to lothsomenesse? but what shoulde be the cause of this sodaine alteration? The beauty of my misteris blazeth as brightly as euer it did, her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards me is as feruent as euer it was, and my flesh as apt to follow folly as euer it was. The cause is this, I perceiue by this pleasure of the body my minde to be mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. I sée that by this vanitie vice hath vanquished vertue in mee, I se hereby my wit dulled, my vnderstanding blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, my memorie weakned, my sences sotted, and all my parts able to play but one part, which is pleasantly to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise with my misteris. I sée hereby all exercise of vertue, al respect of religion, all care of godlinesse vtterly extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in mée. I sée pleasure the very pathway to perdition, I sée women the way to wrack and ruine.
