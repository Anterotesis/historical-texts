            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

my weakneſſe left any
place for expectation
that my poore Labours
ſhould have found ſuch
benigne accepta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with
men of higher place and
judgement, as by the report of Honourable
perſonages, and mine owne late experience
of your noble favours, ſome of them I
now perceive have found with your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb facs="tcp:7905:3"/>
theſe preſent papers had come to crave
your patronage in a better dreſſe than now
they doe. Beſides the conſciouſneſſe of my
inabilities to pleaſe the acurate judgements
of this age, want of opportunities for theſe
many yeares to give my ſelfe that content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which I was once bold to promiſe
unto my ſelfe, had almoſt deterred me from
publiſhing any part of my former labours,
which were not popular, and for the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
of which ranke this preſent Treatiſe is
not. The ſubject or matter of it is Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall,
and was conceived in that famous
Nurſerie of all good literature, which for
theſe many yeares hath flouriſhed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more may it flouriſh under your Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
patronage. If either theſe, or other of
my Labours of the like argument, which
tooke their firſt being from the benignity of
that ſoile, may finde acceptance with your
Lordſhip, I ſhall need no other Apologie
for publiſhing them beſide my unfaigned
deſire to leave the Chriſtian world a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of that high eſteeme which I have
ever made of your Honourable favours to
<pb facs="tcp:7905:3"/>
that renowned Vniverſity, and of my
thankfulneſſe for my particular intereſt in
your generall goodneſſe. If this manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my weakneſſe may occaſion other
Academickes to ſhew their ſtrength in this
and like Arguments, it ſhall be a great part
of my joy and comfort to ſee better fruits of
your Lordſhips favour brought forth by
others, than I can preſent unto you. But
if theſe may finde that acceptance which I
moſt deſire, your Lordſhip will haply bee
deemed by ſome, to patronize not my
weakneſſe onely, but mine errors. It is not
ſo unuſuall, nor ſo much for mee to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
for an <hi>Arminian,</hi> as it will be for your
Lordſhip to be thought to patronize <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme.</hi>
To give your Lordſhip that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
therefore in this point, which I am
not bound to give unto others; If the man
which moſt miſlikes the <hi>Arminian</hi> or <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
doctrine in the points moſt controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
through reformed Churches, will but
agree with me in theſe two, <hi>That the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Creator hath a true freedome in doing
good; and Adams off-ſpring a true freedome of</hi>

                     <hi>doing evill;</hi> I ſhall not diſſent from him in
any other points controverted, unleſſe it be
in this one, that there needs to be no other
controverſie at all betweene the <hi>Arminians</hi>
and their oppoſites in point of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
and Predeſtination. In all other
particulars, ſave onely ſo farre as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
to theſe two, I have not yet the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or underſtanding to conceive, what
contradiction there is or can bee, betweene
men not willing to contend about words.
But if any in oppoſition to <hi>Arminius,</hi> will
maintaine that all things were ſo decreed by
God before the Creation of the world; that
nothing ſince the Creation could have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
out otherwiſe than it hath done, or
that nothing can bee amended what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe,
I muſt crave pardon of every good
Chriſtian to oppugne his opinion, not as
an errour onely in Divinity, but as an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
which involveth enmity to the
ſweet diſpoſition of the All-ſeeing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
Providence; as a forerunner of ruine
to moſt flouriſhing States and Kingdomes
where it growes common, or comes to full

height. For ſupplanting or preventing the
growth of ſuch opinions, I make bold to

this progreſſe, whereof I ſpeake, take beginning

The nature of things finite and limited, no

hath noted three ſorts of errors in ſetting forth the
divine nature: of which, two go upon falſe grounds,
the other is altogether groundleſſe. Some (ſaith he)
there be that ſeeke to meaſure things ſpirituall by
the beſt knowledge which they have gotten (by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7905:10"/>
ſence or art) of things bodily. Others doe fit the
Deity with the nature and properties of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſoule, and from this falſe ground frame many
deceiptfull and crooked rules, whileſt they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to draw the picture or image of the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Eſſence. A third ſort there be, which by too
much ſtraining to tranſcend every mutable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
patch up ſuch conceipts, as cannot poſſibly
hang together, either upon created or increated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and theſe rove further from the truth then
doe the former. As (to uſe his inſtance) He which
thinkes God to be bright or yellow, is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
yet his errour wants not a <hi>cloke,</hi> in as much
as theſe colours have ſome being (from God) in
bodies. His errour againe is as great, that thinkes
God ſometimes forgets, and ſometimes cals things
forgotten to minde; yet this viciſſitude of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and oblivion, hath place in the humane ſoule,
which in many things is like the Creator. But hee
which makes the Divine nature ſo powerfull, as to
produce or beget it ſelfe, quite miſſeth not the
marke onely, but the Butt, and ſhoots (as it were)
out of the field: for nothing poſſible can poſſibly
give it ſelfe being or exiſtence.</p>

of things ſcarce poſſible, to laſt ſo long till
we have moulded <hi>conceipts</hi> of the Eſſence and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
incomprehenſible, more lively and ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable,
then can be taken either from the humane
ſoule alone, or from bodies naturall. To main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7905:11"/>
it as a Philoſophical truth, that <hi>God is the ſoule
of this univerſe,</hi> is an impious errour<note n="*" place="margin">In the 5. Book, Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 3.</note> before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
as a grand ſeminary of Idolatry. Yet by
imagining the humane ſoule to be as really exiſtent
in every place, whereto the cogitations of it can
reach, as it is in our bodies, or rather to exerciſe
the ſame motive power over the greateſt bodily
ſubſtance in this world, that it doth over our fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
able to weild the Heavens or Elements with
as great facility and ſpeed, as we doe our thoughts
or breath: We may, by this fiction, gaine a more
true modell or ſhadow of Gods infinite efficacy,
then any one created ſubſtance can furniſh us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
But whileſt we thus, by imagination, transfuſe
our conceipts of the beſt life and motion, which
we know, into this great Sphere, which we ſee, or
(which ſute better to the immutable and infinite
eſſence) into bodies abſtract or mathematicall: we
muſt make ſuch a compound as <hi>Tacitus</hi> would have
made of two noble Romanes: <hi>Demptis utriuſque
vitiis ſolae virtutes miſceantur: The imperfections of
both being ſifted from them, their perfections onely
muſt be ingredients in this compound.</hi> Yet may we
not thinke, that the divine nature, which we ſeeke
to expreſſe by them, conſiſts of perfections infinite,
ſo united or compounded. We muſt yet uſe a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extraction of our conceits, ere wee apply
them to his incomprehenſible nature.</p>

to our eyes: ſo whatſoever we conceive to
have dependance upon another, wee neceſſarily
conceive it to have proper limits of being, or at leaſt
a diſtinct beginning of being from the other,
though as it were ingrafted in it. But whether we
conceive effects and cauſes diſtinctly as they are in
nature, or in groſſe, ſo long as wee acknowledge
them (this or that way conceived) to be finite and

                     <p>3 Why men in theſe dayes are not Gyants,
why Gyants, in former, were but men, are two
Problems which the meere naturaliſt could eaſily
aſſoyle by this reaſon, for ſubſtance one and the
ſame. The vigour of cauſes productive or conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
of vegetables, of man eſpecially, from which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7905:12"/>
he receiveth nutrition and augmentation, is leſſe
now then it hath beene at leaſt before the Flood;
though but finite and limited, when it was greateſt.
Why vegetables of greateſt vigour, ingroſſe not
the properties of others leſſe vigorous, but reſt
contented with a greater numericall meaſure of
their owne ſpecificall vertues; is, by the former
reaſon as plaine. For in that they have not their
being from themſelves, they can take no more then
is given; nor can the natures whence they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated,
convey them a better title of <hi>being,</hi> then
themſelves have. This as the ſeale communicates
his faſhion to the waxe, ſo doth the limited force
or vertue of cauſes, alwayes imprint bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
upon their effects. If further it be demanded,
why the Elements having the opportunity of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
vicinity, to wreake their naturall enmities or
hoſtilities, doe not each treſpaſſe more grievouſly
upon other; as why the reſtleſſe or raging water
ſwallowes not up the dull earth, which cannot flye
from any wrong or violence offered; or why the
Heavens, having ſo great a prerogative by height of
place, largeneſſe of compaſſe, and indefatigable
motion, do not diſpoſſeſſe the higher Elements of
their ſeat? The naturaliſt would plead the warrant
of Natures Charter, which had ſet them their
diſtinct bounds and limits by an everlaſting undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable
law. Yet is nature in his language alwaies
an internall or eſſentiall part of ſome bodies, within
which it is neceſſarily confined. As the <hi>nature</hi> of
the Heavens hath not ſo much as liberty of egreſſe
into neighbour Elements, nor the proper <hi>formes</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:7905:13"/>
of theſe, (upon what exigence or aſſaults ſoever
made againſt them in their territories,) ſo much as
right of removall or <hi>flitting</hi> into lower Elements.
Or, in caſe it be pretended that theſe particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
have a <hi>nature</hi> more <hi>generall</hi> for their <hi>preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;</hi>
yet this, whether one above the reſt, or an
aggregation onely of all the reſt, is ſtill confined to
this viſible world, and both ſo <hi>hidebound</hi> with the
utmoſt ſphere, that they cannot grow greater or
enlarge their ſtrength. So that nature taken in what
ſenſe the Naturaliſt liſts, cannot be ſaid ſo properly
to ſet bounds or limits to bodies naturall, as to bee
bounded or limited in them. Or to ſpeake more
properly, Nature her ſelfe did not make, but is that
very domeſtique law, by which they are bounded,
and therefore, in no caſe, can diſpenſe with it. And
in that ſhe is a law, (for the moſt part, but not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
indiſpenſable) ſhee neceſſarily ſuppoſeth a
<hi>Lawgiver;</hi> who, if he have no Law ſet him by any
ſuperiour (as we muſt of neceſſity come in <hi>fine</hi> to
ſome one in this kinde ſupreame) <hi>hee</hi> can have no
ſuch limits or bounds, as he hath ſet to nature, and
things naturall. <hi>He</hi> neither is any part of this viſible
frame, which we ſee, nor can he be incloſed within
the utmoſt ſphere. And thus by following the iſſue
of the former fountaine, we are arived in the latter,
which fully diſcovered, opens it ſelfe into a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
Ocean. <hi>Whatſoever hath no cauſe of being can
have no limits or bounds of being.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4 And Being, may bee <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>illimited</hi> two

But that things made out of the matter, or
made at all, could be immortall by nature, he rightly
affirmed. For to be immortall in his language, is to
be without beginning, without dependance. And
what ſo is, hath an eternall neceſſity of exiſtence.
Abſolute neceſſity of exiſtence, or <hi>impoſsibility</hi> of
non-exiſtence, or of not being alwayes what it is,
and as it is, implies an abſolute neceſſity of <hi>being</hi> or
of <hi>exiſtence</hi> infinite; which cannot reſide ſave only
in the totality or abſolute fulneſſe of all <hi>being</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
The greateſt fulneſſe of finite exiſtence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable,
cannot reach beyond al poſſibility of non-exiſtence,
nor can poſſibility of non-exiſtence, and
perpetuall actuall exiſtence, be indiſſolubly wedded
in any finite nature, ſave only by his infinite power,
who eſſentially is, or whoſe <hi>eſſence</hi> is to exiſt, or to

ſuppoſall, or acknowledgement of ſuch an
<hi>infinite</hi> or <hi>eſſentially exiſtent power,</hi> cannot more
ſtrongly or more perſpicuouſly be inferred, than by
the reduction of known effects unto their cauſes, &amp;
of theſe cauſative entities (whoſe number and ranks
are finite) into one prime eſſence, whence al of them
are derived; it ſelf being underivable fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any cauſe,
or eſſence conceivable. In that <hi>this prime eſſence</hi> hath
no cauſe of being, it can have no beginning of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And yet is <hi>beginning</hi> of <hi>being,</hi> the firſt &amp; prime

<hi>bounds</hi> or <hi>limits</hi> of <hi>being,</hi> cannot follow.</p>
                     <p>5 If that which Philoſophers ſuppoſe to be the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7905:14"/>
root of incorruption in the heavens, can brooke no
limits of duration, but muſt bee imagined without
end or beginning; why ſhould it content it ſelfe
with limits of extenſion? ſeeing duration is but a
kinde of extenſion, ſeeing motion, magnitude, and
time, by their rules in other caſes, hold exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
Things cauſed (as induction manifeſteth)
are alwayes limited and moulded in their proper
cauſes. Nor are there two cauſes (much leſſe two
cauſalities,) one of their being, another of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
or reſtraint to this or that ſet kinde of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
For whatſoever gives being to any thing,
gives it the <hi>beginning</hi> of being. As <hi>Sophroniſcus</hi>
was the true cauſe why <hi>Socrates</hi> was in that age
wherein he lived, not before or after; why he was
a man not a beaſt, an Athenian, not a Barbarian.
<hi>Quicquid dat formam, dat omnia conſequentia for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam:
whatſoever gives forme of being to any thing,
gives all the appurtenances to the forme:</hi> is a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Maxime which ſuppoſeth another Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
<hi>Quicquid dat eſſe, dat proprietates eſſe:</hi> That
which gives being unto any thing, gives likewiſe
the properties of ſuch being as it hath. Now limits
of being, are eſſentiall properties of that eſſence or
being, wherin they are found. And diſtinct bounds
or limits are included in the diſtinct <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>being,</hi>
which every thing hath from its cauſe. Actuall
eſſence or exiſtence it ſelfe, is diſtributed to every
thing that hath cauſe of being, as it were ſealed up
in its proper <hi>forme</hi> or <hi>kind</hi> of being. It is as poſſible
to put a new faſhion upon <hi>nothing,</hi> as for any thing
that is, to take limits or ſet <hi>forme</hi> of being from <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:7905:15"/>
That which hath nothing to give it <hi>being,</hi>
can have nothing to give it limits or bounds of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And as no entity can take its <hi>being,</hi> or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>being</hi> from it ſelfe; ſo neither can it take
bounds or limits from it ſelfe, but muſt have them
from ſome other. The prime eſſence or firſt cauſe
of all things that are, as it hath no precedent cauſe
of <hi>exiſtence,</hi> nor can it be cauſe of <hi>exiſtence</hi> to it ſelf;
ſo neither can it have any cauſe of limits without it
ſelfe, nor can it be any cauſe of limits to it ſelfe. It
remaines then, that it muſt bee an <hi>eſſence</hi> illimited,
and thus to be without bounds or limits, is the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall</hi>
effect or conſequence of <hi>being</hi> it <hi>ſelfe,</hi> or of
<hi>that</hi> which <hi>truly is,</hi> without any cauſe precedent to

                     </p>
                     <p>6 So eſſentially is the <hi>conceipt</hi> of <hi>being without
bounds or limits,</hi> included in our <hi>conceipt</hi> of being
without cauſe precedent, that if we ſhould, by way
of ſuppoſition, give any imaginary entity leave to
take beginning or poſſeſſion of being from it ſelfe,
without the warrant of any cauſe precedent to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
or meaſure it out ſome diſtinct portion or

granted, wee could not (by any imagination

of being for ever after whatſoever it liſted to be,
or from being all things, rather than any one thing.</p>
                     <p>Of the Heathens, many did hold an uncreated
<hi>Chaos</hi> praeexiſtent to the <hi>frame</hi> of this Vniverſe:
and Philoſophers, to this day, maintaine an ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
matter, which actually is not any body, but
indifferent to be made every body. Let us but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7905:15"/>
Firſt the one, or other of them to be as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneall</hi>
in it ſelfe, as the ayre or water: Secondly,
to be able to <hi>actuate,</hi> or <hi>Proteus-like</hi> to transforme
it ſelfe into a better ſtate than now it hath, without
the helpe of any agent or efficient; and then, as it
could have no cauſe, ſo can there bee no reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to reſtraine it from taking all bodily perfection
<hi>poſsible</hi> to it ſelfe. And if it bee true, which ſome
teach, that this prime <hi>matter</hi> hath neither proper
quantity nor quality, what ſhould hinder it to take
both without meaſure, ſuppoſing it might bee its
one <hi>carver</hi> of thoſe endowments? Or imagine
there were ſuch a vacuity, where the world now is,
as we Chriſtians beleeve there was before it was
made, and onely one of <hi>Democritus</hi> caſuall <hi>Atoms,</hi>
or ſome meere <hi>poſsibility</hi> or <hi>appetite</hi> of the <hi>matter,</hi>
left free, <hi>venire in vacuum,</hi> to give it ſelfe full and
perfect <hi>act</hi> without curbe or reſtraint of any ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
power or ſharer to cry <hi>halfe mine</hi> with it, or
make claime to the nature of any actuall entity loſt;
<hi>it</hi> being ſuppoſed to be able to take any one nature
upon it, what ſhould either hinder or further it, to
aſſume the nature of earth, rather than of water, or
of theſe two, rather than of any other Element, or
of any ſimple bodies, rather than of mixt or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
ſubſtances, or of bodily ſubſtances, rather
than ſpirituall, or of all theſe, rather than of their
metaphyſicall <hi>eminences,</hi> and <hi>perfections?</hi> Or whilſt
we imagine <hi>it,</hi> without cauſe of exiſtence or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
no reaſon imaginable could confine <hi>it</hi> to any
ſet place of reſidence or extenſion: no cauſe could
bee alledged why it ſhould take poſſeſſion of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7905:16"/>
                        <hi>center,</hi> rather than of the circumference of this V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe,
as now it ſtands, or of both theſe rather
than of the whole ſphere, or of the whole ſphere
rather than of all extenſive ſpace imaginable. Only
the very ſuppoſition of taking beginning though
without cauſe, doth put a limit to its duration;
becauſe this kinde of beginning, being but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
depends upon our imagination, as upon its
true cauſe. And yet even thus conſidered, me thinks
it ſhould extend its exiſtence both waies, and draw
a circular duration to the inſtant where it beginnes.
Or (not imagining the beginning) let us imagine it
only to have true preſent being without any cauſe
precedent to puſh it forward, or ſuperiour guide to
appoint it a ſet courſe; and it is not within the
compaſſe of imagination, why the duration of it
ſhould not reach as farre the one way as the other.
as farre beyond all imagination of time paſt, as of
time to come, why it ſhould not comprehend all
duration imaginable by way of preſent poſſeſſion,
or ſupereminent permanency, without admiſſion
of any deflux, diviſion, or ſucceſſion, for continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>7 If it bee objected, that any thing may follow
from ſuppoſition or imagination of impoſſibilities,
the reply is eaſie. The objection is either falſe, or

finde a meane betwixt them, by <hi>abnegation,</hi> that is,
any thing which is neither ſomething nor nothing,

                     <p>2 Of the greateſt Angell which he hath created,
or of the moſt noble intelligent Spirit which the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7905:18"/>
Philoſophers imagined, were he preſent, or did we
know the place of his reſidence, we might without
wrong ſay, <hi>This</hi> Angell, or <hi>yonder Intelligence;</hi> or
ſpeake of either, as of a numerable part, though a
principall one of this Vniverſe. For though his
<hi>nature</hi> be much more perfect then ours is, and <hi>hee</hi>
according to the perfection of his nature, much
more excellent then his fellow Angels are: his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
nevertheleſſe have their bounds and limits,
not uncapable of theſe demonſtrative ſignes, <hi>This,
Here,</hi> or <hi>Yonder, &amp;c.</hi> He neither containes the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall
perfection of our nature, nor the <hi>numericall</hi>
of his Fellowes, within the meaſure of his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In his kind then <hi>he</hi> is moſt perfect, yet is he not
that <hi>perfection</hi> which he hath in him, but the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
of it; And if he have perfection onely in him,
without being himſelfe perfection, <hi>Quid habet quod
non accepit? All</hi> he hath muſt bee <hi>participated or
borrowed</hi> from perfection it ſelfe. And of his bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
perfections, <hi>one</hi> neither properly is <hi>another,</hi>
nor are all or any of them, what he is. His power is
not the ſame that his wiſedome is; his wiſedome is
not his goodneſs, nor his goodneſſe his life. Sathan
and his Angels have life, though they have loſt their
goodneſſe; and their power to practiſe, is leſſe than
their wit to plot miſchiefe and villany. The beſt,
the wiſeſt, or mightieſt of thoſe immortall Spirits,
which kept their ſtations, is not able, either by his
meere power to give being to things that are not,
or life to liveleſſe creatures; his wiſedome cannot
inſpire wiſedome into creatures indued with life;
his goodneſſe is no fountaine whence grace may

be derived into the heart of man. But when we ſay
<hi>God is one,</hi> or <hi>God onely is,</hi> in this indiviſible unity,
we include all multiplicity. Nor can wee ſay more
of him in fewer words than <hi>Seneca</hi> hath done; <hi>Eſt

the abſolute totality of all and every part of being or

man; we are bound to ſay, and thinke, that no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                        <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently

not conceiving any creation but out of the

<hi>Being</hi> to immateriall ſubſtances. An error

beene put in mind, that theſe their <hi>demi-gods</hi> by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
conſequence of this opinion, muſt have
beene acknowledged infinite in Being. Whereas
the true notion of ſuch infinitie, by the apparent
grounds of true Philoſophy, is onely proper, onely
poſſible unto One; becauſe it entirely includeth <hi>all</hi>
that can be; and, All, abſolutely excludes all plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.
From this principle rightly ſounded, did
<hi>Plato</hi> deny things ſenſible truly to be, or (as <hi>Seneca</hi>
paraphraſes upon his Text) they make a <hi>ſhew</hi> only,
or put on a countenance of being for a time, being

and much apter to occaſion admiration. The
ſpeech it ſelfe will naturally beare this conſtruction,
Multitude of things viſible, is but the multiplyed
ſhadow of inviſible independent unitie: things
ſenſible, or by imagination numerable, are but ſo

moſt truly One, becauſe He onely is, and unto his
being nought can be added, nought detracted from
it, by the increaſe or diminution of other beings.
Or in <hi>Parmenides</hi> meaning, He ſo <hi>is,</hi> that if al things
numerable ſhould loſe that being which they have,
or be annihilated, all might be found againe in <hi>him,</hi>

infatuated (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) by divine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
became vaine in their imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; he might
have perceived his owne definition of ſuch infinity
as he imagined in the diviſibility of Magnitude or
ſucceſſion of time, to have beene (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeakes
of Time it ſelfe) but a moveable image of that true
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7905:21"/>
and ſolid <hi>infinity,</hi> whoſe definition, being well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
by others, was cenſoriouſly rejected by him;
or ſuch a floating ſhadow of it ſwimming in his
braine, as the Sun or Starres imprint in a ſwift run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſtreame. A perfect definition ſhould bee ſo
fitted to the entire nature of the thing defined, or
to the thing it ſelfe abſolutely conſidered, as the
barke is to the tree, or other viſible ſurfaces to the
bodies which they environ: To expreſſe ſome
particular properties or branches, much leſſe ſome
references or conſiderations of it, is not enough.
The queſtion then being abſolutely propoſed
<hi>Quid eſt infinitum?</hi> What is infinity? or what is it
to be infinite? The definitive and ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
muſt bee ſuch, as ſhall expreſſe not the nature
of infinity in ſucceſſion onely or in diviſion, not in
this or that reſpect only, or according to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
abſtraction or conſideration; but the nature
of infinity ſimply and abſolutely conſidered. That
only is abſolutely and properly <hi>infinite,</hi> which is
<hi>infinite</hi> not according to one conceipt or kinde of
<hi>infinity,</hi> but that which is <hi>infinite</hi> in <hi>Being.</hi> This
was that <hi>infinity</hi> which the Ancients well defined,
when they ſaid, <hi>Infinitum eſt extra quod nihil eſt:</hi>
Infinity is that without which nothing is, or can be.
For as infinity in longitude, includes all length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable,
and infinity in ſolid magnitudes, all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions
imaginable; ſo muſt <hi>infinite being</hi> include
all Being poſſible; and it is impoſſible for any thing
to be <hi>without</hi> or beſides that, wherein all <hi>being</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
is contained. Thus did theſe ancient Heathens
<hi>feele after and ſeeke,</hi> and in a manner find, <hi>that Lord</hi>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:7905:22"/>
under the notion of <hi>unum</hi> and <hi>infinitum, in whom,</hi>
as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>(Act. 17. 28.) we live, and move, and
have our being.</hi> His words will beare or rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe
that improvement, which is neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the <hi>Ancients</hi> definition of abſolute infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<hi>It is impoſsible that any thing living ſhould have
life, that any thing moveable ſhould move, that life
or motion ſhould have the leaſt degree of being, ſave
only in Him, who onely is.</hi> For as the ſame Apoſtle
there ſaith, verſ. 25. <hi>He giveth to all, life and breath,
and all things.</hi> The very firſt beginnings, the firſt
and laſt degrees of ſuch being as they have. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
then came farre ſhort of the truth in ſaying,
<hi>Infinitum eſt extra quod ſemper aliquid eſt,</hi> That is
infinite, which never hath ſo much, but it is alwaies
getting more. The truth is, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did not, could
not deny the definition aſſigned by the Ancients,
to be a true and perfect definition of abſolute infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or of infinity in being. Wherein then, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what grounds did he diſſent from them? Either
in that he did not acknowledge any ſuch abſolute
infinity or infinite being, as the Ancients beleeved;
or elſe did ſuppoſe, that they held this viſible world
or ſome bodily magnitude to be ſo actually and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
infinite, as the former definition doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
Concerning this latter ſort of infinity, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the ancient Philoſophers did, we Chriſtians
doe not diſſent from <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> for we deny any
bodily magnitude actually infinite. But that there
is an abſolute infinity, or an Eſſence actually and
abſolutely infinite, may be neceſſarily inferred from
thoſe branches of that <hi>infinity</hi> which conſiſts not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7905:22"/>
in <hi>act,</hi> but in <hi>poſsibility,</hi> or ſucceſſion, which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
rightly acknowledged, and well defined. For,
whence ſhould al the parts of this viſible world poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
get any new portion of time, any ſucceſſion
or addition to their preſent being or duration,
which now they have not; ſave onely from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and inexhauſtible ſtore, who, before all times,
had ſo much of being in every kind, as he could not
poſſibly either get any more, or loſe a dramme of
what he had; albeit through every moment of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
diviſible, he furniſhed all things, that are (as
hee could doe more) with as much perfection, as
they are capable of, that is, all of them with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
or being in it ſelfe finite, but in ſome of them
without limit of duration. But are all things in <hi>him?</hi>
or ſuch only as include perfection? or ſhall wee ſay
perfections are in him, rather than in the things
themſelves? And if ſo, whether ſhall we ſay hee is
one perfection, or all perfections?</p>

We muſt either allow the Gods to
have bodies, or deny them ſenſe;
becauſe ſenſe is never found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a body. What was it then in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7905:23"/>
his Philoſophy, which framed the organs of bodily
ſenſe? a body already organized and indued with
ſenſe? or a <hi>ſpirit (virtus formatrix)</hi> which rather
is in the body, than is a body it ſelfe? And if this

ſhould in reaſon have afforded it both ſenſe and
reaſon in greater meaſure than hee had himſelfe;
who, out of the ſame matter, could not make ſo
much as one haire white or blacke; much leſſe the
moſt exquiſit inſtruments of ſenſe. But if this <hi>ſpirit,</hi>
by which, in Philoſophers opinions, our bodies are

                        <hi>Epicurus</hi> could
doe, by all his art or philoſophicall skill: wee muſt

                        <hi>Epicurus</hi> took delight in. Our argument is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

teacheth man knowledge, ſhall not he know? Pſal. 94.
8, 9, 10.</hi> Yet as wee ſay that <hi>He</hi> onely <hi>is,</hi> and all
things numerable are but meere ſhadowes of <hi>His
being;</hi> ſo wee muſt hold, that <hi>hearing, ſight,</hi> and
<hi>reaſon</hi> are in him, according to their idaeall patterns
or perfections, not according to thoſe imperfect
pictures, which communicated to men and beaſts,
diſtinguiſh them from vegetables or liveleſſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
whoſe perfections likewiſe are in him. But
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7905:23"/>
ſome things perhaps there be, which have no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of perfection, as the prime <hi>matter,</hi> or ſome
like dead or dull maſſe. For how ſhall that, which
is but a body, be in him that hath no body? That
Maxime, <hi>Idem eſt non eſſe, &amp; non apparere,</hi> is not ſo
true in matters of civill proofe or allegation, as the
other ſtemme of the ſame root, <hi>Idem eſt non eſſe &amp;
non operari,</hi> is in nature. To be without efficacie
or operation, or to ſerve unto no uſe, is all one, as
not to be at all. Or, rather, ſo to be, hath the ſame
proportion to ſimple <hi>non-being,</hi> as <hi>nihil agere,</hi> to
<hi>otioſum eſſe.</hi> To <hi>be</hi> without uſe or operation is more
remote from true <hi>being,</hi> and worſe in nature, than
ſimply not to be. If any ſuch things there be, how
ſhould we ſay they are in God, in whom is nothing
but perfection? Yet of things without proper uſe
or operation, there might be ſome peculiar end beſt
knowne to their Maker; if it were but to commend
the perfection which other creatures borrow from
him, and to ſtirre up our thankfulneſſe, that we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are ſuch dull maſſes our ſelves, nor are troubled
with harbouring or ſupporting them. But even
theſe, if any ſuch there were, could not be exiſtent
or <hi>extra cauſas,</hi> unleſſe they truely were in Him.
What is it then for all things that are, or their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to be in Him?</p>
                     <p>2 For all things to be in Him, is no more then
that He alone can produce them without ſeed or
matter precedent. All things, not extant onely, but
<hi>poſsible,</hi> are in his wiſedome, as the Edifice is in
the Artificers head: all things againe are in his
power, as ſtrength or force to move our limbes, is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7905:24"/>
in our ſinewes or motive faculty. The perfections
of all things are truly ſaid to be in Him, in as much
as whatſoever is, or can bee done by their efficacy
or vertue, Hee alone can doe without them. Hee
could feed all the beaſts of the field without graſſe,
heale every diſeaſe, without herbe, mettall, or other
matter of medicine, by his ſole word, not uttered
by breathing, or any other kinde of motion; not
diſtinct from his life or eſſence. Hee is life it ſelfe;
yet is not his life ſupported by any corporeall
maſſe, or praeexiſtent nature, nor clothed with ſuch
ſenſe as ours is: for ſenſe, in as much as it cannot
be without a corporeall organ, is an imperfect kind
of knowledge. Paine hee cannot feele as we doe,
becauſe that tendeth to deſtruction, which is the
period of imperfection: yet what ſoever paine any
ſenſible or materiall object can inflict upon us, He
alone can inflict the ſame in an higher degree. The
meaſure of paine, likewiſe, which we feele by ſenſe,
He knows much better without ſenſe or feeling of
it. But when wee ſay all things are in <hi>Him,</hi> after a
more excellent manner, than they are or can bee in
themſelves: Wee muſt not conceipt a multitude
or diverſity of excellencies in his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> anſwering
to the ſeverall natures of things created: We muſt
not imagine one excellencie ſutable to <hi>elementary

ſaith <hi>God is all perfections,</hi> excepts none, yet hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
onely perfections numerable and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And to ſay <hi>He</hi> were onely <hi>one perfection,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
onely <hi>perfection</hi> limited, and therefore <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
borrowed, not independent. Or admitting

and one <hi>perfection,</hi> which may fitly be expreſſed by
all <hi>perfection:</hi> yet he that ſhould thus ſay [God is the
<hi>univerſall</hi> unity or <hi>totality</hi> of perfection] had need
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7905:25"/>
to diſtinguiſh acurately of <hi>univerſality</hi> and totality,

                        </hi> more exquiſitely
than the Platonickes doe; that he may acquit his
meaning, from ſuſpition of ſuch <hi>totality,</hi> or <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality,</hi>
as ariſeth not onely by aggregation of parts,
but whoſe extent is no more than equall to all its
parts. For every other <hi>univerſall</hi> or <hi>whole,</hi> is fully
equalized by all the parts taken together; whereas
the Divine Nature infinitely exceeds all particular
natures or perfections poſſible, though in number
they could be infinite. It is then (if any man liſt ſo
to ſpeake) ſuch a <hi>totality</hi> or <hi>univerſality,</hi> as cannot
bee augmented, much leſſe made up by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of any other perfection, though proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>in infinitum;</hi> neither diminiſhable or exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible
by multiplicity or diviſion of particulars de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from it. But whether wee conſider this <hi>His</hi>
infinite Eſſence in it ſelfe, or, as it eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
all things poſſible; the incomprehenſibility
of it is in both reſpects more fully intimated (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
it cannot be) by indefinite formes of ſpeech;
than by addition of any definite termes, whether
of <hi>ſingularity, univerſality,</hi> or <hi>totality.</hi> Hee ſpeakes
more fully and more ſafely, that ſaith, <hi>God is being
it ſelfe, or perfection it ſelfe;</hi> than he that ſaith, he is
the onely <hi>being,</hi> or all <hi>being,</hi> the onely <hi>perfection,</hi>
or all <hi>perfection,</hi> the totality of <hi>being</hi> and of <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

ſubſtances without imagination of ſome
corporeall forme, and yet the underſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
denyes them to bee like their pictures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to it by the phantaſie, or to have any ſuch
corporeall forme as it doth paint them in: ſo in
this caſe, notwithſtanding the plurality of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
conceipts, or multiplicity of <hi>perfections</hi>
imagined by us, in our contemplations of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;
we muſt ſtedfaſtly beleeve, and acknowledge,
that He <hi>infinitely is,</hi> what all theſe ſeverall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
intimate: not by compoſition, or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>perfections</hi> ſeverally infinite, but by indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unity of independent and illimited <hi>Being.</hi> And
as it is a maxime moſt infallible in naturall philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie
<hi>[Vis unita fortior]</hi> Force, otherwiſe the ſame,
is alwaies greater united, than being ſcattered or
diffuſed: ſo is the metaphyſicall extract of it, more
eminently true in Divinity. The indiviſible unity of
illimited <hi>being</hi> or <hi>perfection,</hi> is, in every reſpect
imaginable, more excellent and ſoveraigne than all
infinite <hi>perfections,</hi> by imagination poſſibly could
be, ſo they were, though never ſo ſtrictly, but uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
From this fundamentall truth of Gods abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
infinity by indiviſible unity, wee may inferre,
He is <hi>powerfull</hi> above all conceit of infinite power,
rooted in the ſame Eſſence with infinite wiſedome,
and partaker of all her fruits, but not identically the
ſame with her. <hi>Wiſe He is,</hi> beyond all conceit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7905:27"/>
wiſedome, though ſworne confederate with
infinite power, or linked with it, or with other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
in any other bond, but not in abſolute iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie.
<hi>Good</hi> likewiſe <hi>He is</hi> above all poſſible conceit
of infinite goodneſſe, though indiſſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bly match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with all other perfections that can bee concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
unleſſe they be conceived (as we muſt beleeve
in Him they are) different onely in name or mans
conceit, but indiviſibly agreeing with it in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
unity and identity of nature and Eſſence. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the immenſity of his Majeſty, and infinity of
duration, common to his Eſſence and all his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
infinitely exceed all conceit of <hi>infinite</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
or extenſion, whoſe parts cannot be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and indiviſibly the ſame, one with another, or
with the whole.</p>
                     <p>This is the bottomleſſe and boundleſſe Ocean
of admiration, wherein contemplative wits may
bathe themſelves with great delight, but whereinto
they cannot dive, without great danger; That the
totality of every conceiveable excellency and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
ſhould be contained, after a manner farre
more excellent in unity indiviſible, then if their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which they hold thus in common, were laid
out in ſeverall, without any bounds preſcribed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
infinities proper to each kinde.</p>
                     <p>6 But ſeeing our imaginations have a more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
apprehenſion of greatneſſe, expreſt under the
notion of totality or diviſible <hi>infinity,</hi> then under
the conceipt of indiviſible <hi>unity;</hi> and ſeeing every
whole, ſeemes much greater, when it is reſolved
into parts, (as a mile by land, whoſe ſeverall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7905:27"/>
or leſſe portions, are diſtinctly repreſented to
our eyes, ſeemes much longer than two miles by
water, whoſe levell ſurface affords no diſtinct repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of parts, or diverſity of aſpect) it will bee
very behoovefull to unfold ſome principall
branches of <hi>being</hi> or <hi>perfection,</hi> whoſe <hi>infinitie</hi> or
totality is eminently contained in the unity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Being. For being thus ſorted by imagination
into their ſeverall ranks, like ſo many numbers in a
table ready for addition, the underſtanding may
with admiration gueſſe at the product, like an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetician,
which had gone ſo far in Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

though we could thus proceed by addition or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication

to allow the underſtanding to uſe the improove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

obvious to our thoughts, that our
imaginations will hardly ſuffer it
to be ſevered from thoſe ſubjects,
which our underſtandings by light of reaſon may,
and by the eye of faith, muſt confeſſe to bee finite,
to wit, time and place. The cauſe of this difficultie
in abſtraction, was ſignified<note n="*" place="margin">In the 5. Booke. Section 2.</note> before to be this. No
event there is obſerved by ſenſe, but is husked in the
circumſtance of <hi>place</hi> and <hi>time,</hi> whence it is, that
theſe two accompany many Phantaſmes, after they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7905:28"/>
bee winnowed from all the reſt, into the cloſet of
the underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. The conceit of mathematicall or
metaphyſicall ſpace, is ſo naturally annexed to our
imagination of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> phyſicall; that albeit
reaſon, aſwell as Scripture demonſtrate the world
to be, for Phyſicall magnitude, finite; yet our phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies
cannot be curbed from running into imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
locall diſtance, beyond the utmoſt ſurface of this
goodly viſible worke of God, yea beyond the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of heavens. The Philoſopher, which thought
all place or locall diſtance to bee contained within
the utmoſt ſphere, it beeing contained in nothing
elſe (for <hi>extra coelum nihil eſt,</hi> was his ſaying) might
in congruity have granted, a like termination, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcription
of ſucceſſion or time; unto which
notwithſtanding our imaginations will not eaſily
ſubſcribe. For though our underſtanding oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
their errour, which deny the beginning of
Time; yet our ſenſes ſtill nurſe an imaginary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
duration much longer before the creation
of this viſible world, than the continuation of it
hath beene. And (which is much to bee admired)
ſome Schoole-braines have beene ſo puzled in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
this unſoundable gulfe, as to ſuſpect that God,
which is now in every place of the world created
by <hi>Him,</hi> was as truly in theſe imaginary <hi>diſtances</hi> of
place and time, before the creation was attempted.
Thus have they made <hi>place</hi> commenſurable to his
<hi>immenſitie,</hi> and ſucceſſion, or time coequall to his
<hi>eternitie.</hi> But what could they anſwere us, if we
ſhould demand, whether this duration, or locall
diſtance, wherein they imagine God to have beene
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7905:29"/>
before the Creation, were created by <hi>Him,</hi> or not?
whether they were truly ſomething, or meerly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
If they held them to be meerly <hi>nothing,</hi> they
ſhould have told us, that they had a reall imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an infinite ſpace, which really was not: and
therefore could not bee truely tearmed imaginary
ſpace before the world was created. For it is one
thing to imagine an <hi>infinite</hi> ſpace, and another to
avouch there was an <hi>infinite</hi> imaginarie ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could have any imagination of it. Hee
that made the world and all that is in it, is not much
beholding to thoſe men, for building him an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Caſtle, not in the Ayre (which had no being
before the Creation) but in <hi>that</hi> which neither the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
was, nor ſince hath had any being, ſave onely in the
vaniſhing imaginations of men which have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For if this imaginary ſpace were any more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a meere imagination, it was ſurely created by God.
Had then this imaginary ſpace another ſpace or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance-locall,

<hi>duration,</hi> another <hi>duration,</hi> wherin to be produced?

commenſurable to eternity or immenſity? If
God from eternity had been in any other <hi>infinity</hi>

2 But what ſhall we anſwer unto theſe or the
like captious demands of the Atheiſt: If the world,
if time, if place, which now are, had not been from
everlaſting? where was your God when theſe were
not, ſome where, or no where? If no where, <hi>Hee</hi>
and <hi>Nothing</hi> might be fellow reſidents. In reſpect
of eternity or immenſity, no creature, no poſitive
eſſence, no numerable part of this Vniverſe is ſo like
unto <hi>Him,</hi> as this negation of all things, which we
deſcribe by the name of <hi>Nothing.</hi> It hath no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or end of dayes. Nothing or the negation of
all things, as it is the object of our poſitive conceit,
is more like unto <hi>Him</hi> than any <hi>one thing,</hi> in that
no diſtinct or proper place of reſidence can bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to nothing, or to the negation of all things:
Yet moſt <hi>unlike</hi> him, in that it is truly and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
no where, not in it ſelfe. <hi>Non entis, non eſt
actio, non eſt qualitas, non conditio,</hi> That which is
not can have no capacity to accept any condition of
<hi>being,</hi> it can have no right or title to bee termed it
ſelfe. We may truly ſay ſome objective conceipts
are nothing: but we cannot rightly conceive, that
<hi>nothing</hi> ſhould have any degree or kinde of <hi>being;</hi>
and want of <hi>being</hi> is the worſt kinde of barrenneſſe
that can be imagined. We cannot imagine it ſhould
bring forth any degree or ranke of being. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be mother to that which poſſibly may bee; it
cannot be nurſe to that which is. But of God wee
cannot abſolutely ſay, He was no where, before the
world was made; we muſt uſe this limitation <hi>[Hee
was no where ſave in Himſelfe:]</hi> But ſuch and ſo in
Himſelfe, that He was more than all things, longer
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7905:30"/>
than <hi>time,</hi> greater than <hi>place,</hi> more <hi>infinite</hi> than <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi>
it ſelfe, uncapable of circumſcription or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurability,
able to limit <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> (or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
we conceive to be by ſucceſſion or addition
infinite,) by his eſſentiall preſence, or coexiſtence
more than <hi>penetrative;</hi> being ſo in both, in all things
that are, as nothing poſſibly could have beginning,
or continuance of being, unleſſe He were in them,
as the center of their ſupportance; yet ſo as they
cannot environ or encompaſſe him. The abſolute
infinity of his <hi>being</hi> includes an abſolute impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his <hi>being</hi> onely in things, that are, or may be,
though by his power thoſe may be in number, by
ſucceſſion, infinite.</p>
                     <p>3 Had the evaporations of proud phantaſticke
melancholy, eclipſed the luſtre of his glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
in that late prodigious Queſtioniſts braine,
which would bring us out of the ſunne-ſhine of the
Goſpell into old Aegyptian darkneſſe: For as ſome
well conjecture, this error of incloſing God in the
heavens, and excluding his eſſentiall preſence from
this inferiour world, was firſt brought forth in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
but ſo ill <hi>taken,</hi> as it could not be propagated
to many nations; entertained by few Philoſophers
of better ſort, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or the Author of the Booke
<hi>de mundo ad Alexandrum,</hi> excepted; from whoſe
opinion <hi>Verſtius</hi> did herein diſſent, that hee held
God to be everywhere by his power, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
providence: His error notwithſtanding, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
groſſe and unſufferable, in that hee makes
his infinite <hi>power, wiſedome,</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> in whoſe
ſweet harmony Divine Providence eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7905:30"/>
but as Agents or Ambaſſadors to his infinite
Majeſty: as if his infinite Majeſty onely were full
<hi>compere</hi> to his Eſſence, unfitting to bee imployed
abroad, or to keep reſidence any where, ſave in the
Court of Heaven. Or if his power and wiſedome
be joynt aſſeſſors with his Eſſence in the heavens,
and yet reach withall unto the earth, unto every
thing within this <hi>Canopy,</hi> which is ſpred betwixt us
and his glorious preſence: His <hi>power,</hi> his <hi>wiſedome,</hi>
&amp;c. may in ſome ſort be held more infinite than his
Eſſence, as being in many places where it is not.
But for God to be everywhere here on earth, or in
the region under the earth, by his wiſedome, by his
power, or by his goodneſſe, is perhaps in his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
no more, than that the effects of theſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
are every where, that all things as well in earth
as in heaven, are eſſentially ſubject to that eternall
Law, which he hath appointed them; that every
creature doth as conſtantly fulfill his will, and obey
his power, in his abſence, as if it were penetrated
by his preſence; that the eye of his knowledge
pierceth every corner of the world, and ſeeth the
ſecrets of mens hearts, as clearly, as if it were reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in their centers. And in part, unto this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
ſome great Schoolemen diſtinguiſh the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Gods being in all things, by his <hi>eſſence,</hi> by his
<hi>power,</hi> by his <hi>preſence.</hi> Let us take it as poſſible to
ſuppoſition or imagination, (what by the habit of
Chriſtian faith, we are fully perſwaded to bee in it
ſelfe impoſſible) what by light of reaſon might be
demonſtrated to imply a manifeſt contradiction to
any well-ſetled underſtanding, <hi>viz. [That infinite
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7905:31"/>
Eſſence or Being it ſelfe ſhould not be every-where eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially
preſent, or that infinite power ſhould not bee
able to reach every poſsible effect:]</hi> yet ſhould al things
that are, be preſent to him, whoſe name, whoſe beſt
deſcription is <hi>[I am.]</hi> Nothing could be done or
ſaid without his preſence, that is, without his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
notice. And in this ſenſe perhaps it hath beene
rightly avouched by ſome good Authors, whoſe
meaning hath beene much miſtaken, or wilfully
perverted by others, <hi>That all things as well future
as paſt, are alike preſent to Him, who was every where</hi>
(before there was any diſtinction of times;) becauſe
nothing can bee ſaid or done, without his perfect
knowledge or juſt notice. Nothing can be begun,
continued, or finiſhed, without his expreſſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
or intuitive permiſſion. He hath a vigilant eye
over all things that are, or poſſibly can be. Or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it againe as not impoſſible to imagination, that
divine knowledge were not ſo truly infinite as wee
beleeve it is; yet admitting his power to bee truly
<hi>infinite,</hi> nothing could be done, ſaid, or intended,
without its concourſe, operation, or <hi>aſsiſtance.</hi> So
that he might be everywhere by his infinite power,
albeit his knowledge were not <hi>infinite;</hi> or every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
by his infinite knowledge, albeit his power
were but finite. But by the infallible conſequence
of theſe indemonſtrable principles, it will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follow, That his Eſſence, being as was ſhewed
before, truly <hi>infinite,</hi> nor world, nor time, nor place,
nor power, nor wiſedome, nor any thing poſſible
can be where it is not, it muſt needs be, where any
thing is, or poſſibly may be. He is in every center
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7905:31"/>
of bodily or materiall ſubſtances, in every point
imaginable of this viſible Vniverſe, as an eſſentiall
root, whence all and every part of what is beſides
him ſpring, without waſte or diffuſion of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
without nutriment or ſuſtentation from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other root or element. The conſervation of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
or <hi>illocall</hi> ſubſtances, is from the benefit of
his eſſentiall preſence. Materialls are daily made
and renewed by the tranſient efficacy of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power.</p>
                     <p>4 Doe we make theſe collections only, or doth
not the Scripture teach this Philoſophy alſo? <hi>Am
I a God at hand, ſaith the Lord, and not a God farre
off? Ier. 23. 23.</hi> Nothing is, nothing can be without
the reach of his power, his omnipotency cannot
be confined within the places that are: for his hand
hath made them all, not as Priſons to incloſe his
Eſſence, not as manicles to hinder the exerciſe of
his mightie arme. <hi>Can any hide himſelfe in ſecret
places, that I ſhall not ſee him?</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Ibid.
verſ. 24.</hi> This is a formall demand of our aſſent
unto the <hi>infinitie</hi> of his knowledge. Theſe are two
ſpeciall, but not the onely wayes of his being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, which the Scripture teacheth: for there
followes a third, which after the manner of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
is the root or foundation of al the reſt;
<hi>that</hi> indeed, from which the two former branches
are moſt neceſſarily inferred, <hi>Doe not I fill heaven
and earth? ſaith the Lord.</hi> Doth He fill heaven and
earth by his power, or by his knowledge onely?
Nay, but moſt properly and in the firſt place by his
eſſentiall preſence. For his <hi>Eſſence</hi> is infinitely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7905:32"/>
infinitely wiſe.</p>
                     <p>His filling the earth as well as heaven, by his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall
preſence, cannot be denyed but from one of
theſe two reaſons following.</p>
                     <p>Either, That his <hi>Eſſence</hi> is altogether uncapable
of intimate coexiſtence, with ſuch groſſe and baſe
creatures, as the parts of this inferiour world:</p>
                     <p>Or elſe, Becauſe it is his will, to abſtract or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his eſſentiall preſence from them.</p>
                     <p>To affirme the former part, to wit, That his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is uncapable of intimate coexiſtence with any
nature created by Him, is to deny his <hi>omnipotency;</hi>
as all, by neceſſary conſequence, doe, which grant
not the immenſity of his Eſſence. For what can
withſtand or withdraw his Eſſence from piercing
the earth, as well as heaven? Not the hardneſſe of
it, not the loathſomneſſe of the vile bodies contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in it. If either of theſe qualitites, or ought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
could deny the admiſſion of his eſſentiall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
he were not omnipotent, becauſe not able to
place his Eſſence in that locall ſpace, in which, were
it filled with more ſubtill or more glorious bodies,
it might as well reſide, as in the heavens. Suppoſe
he ſhould (as no doubt hee is able) annihilate the
earth, and create a new heaven in the ſpace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it now is, or demoliſh his preſent heavenly ſeat,
or turne it into a baſer maſſe then this earth is;
were it not poſſible for him to bee in this new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by his eſſentiall preſence, or ſhould he be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in it, nor in the new earth? If hee could not
be here, he were in this reſpect more impotent than
the Angels, who can change their manſions when
they miſlike them.</p>

5 Shall wee then take the latter part of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
diviſion, and ſay, It is his will and pleaſure to
withdraw his Eſſence from this lower roome of
his own Edifice, whiles it remaines ſo ill garniſhed,
as now it is? If hee have made heaven his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by choice, not by neceſſity of his immenſity,
with which all places, as we contend, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
be filled; hee might relinquiſh it by the like
free choice of ſome other manſion, which he could
make for himſelfe as pleaſant and beautifull: yea,
Hee might by the like freedome of will, come and
dwell with us here on earth. So that in concluſion,
he which admitteth Gods wil to be free, but denies
the abſolute immenſity of his Eſſence, makes him
capable of locall motion or migration from place to
place. And ſuch motion neceſſarily includeth mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability,
which is altogether incompatible with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity.
Reaſon grounded on Scripture, will warrant
us to conclude from the former principle, that hee
which hath no cauſe of being, can have no limits of
being, no bounds beyond which it cannot be. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
or <hi>being</hi> illimited cannot poſſibly bee diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by ſeveralties of internall perfections,
though united: much leſſe can it be diſtinguiſhed
or limited by any place, whether reall or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
In that he is the authorleſſe Author of all <hi>being,</hi>
it is altogether as impoſſible for Him not to bee in
every thing that is, as it is for any thing to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Him. The indiviſible unity of his infinite <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi>
is the center and ſupporter of all things, the
conſervation of place, and that which holdeth
things diviſible from reſolving into nothing.</p>

above this; Hee ſhould by vertue of His infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

more truly than the ſymbolizing qualities of their

ſymbolizing or preſerving qualities, flowes as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from his eſſentiall preſence, as the paſſive
aptitude of bodies preſerved by them, doth. The
more the places are through which bodies naturall
ſwiftly move, the leſſe properly they are in them.
In analogy to this condition of naturall bodies, the
more capable man is of all knowledge, the more

are truly ſaid to be with the places which containe

ſo well befit it, as theſe that intimate more to our

this kinde I have found none, from which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

God is a ſphere, whoſe Center is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
whoſe circumference is no where. Not the
leaſt particle of this univerſall Globe or ſphere, but
is ſupported by the indiviſible unity of his Eſſence,
as by an internall Center. And yet neither the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
circumference of this viſible world, nor any
circumference conceiveable, can ſo circumſcribe or
comprehend his eſſentiall preſence, that it might
bee ſaid, thus farre it reacheth and no further. For
albeit hee would crowne the convexity of theſe
Heavens with others, ſo much higher and more
ſpacious, than theſe Heavens, as theſe are than the
Earth, and continue this courſe unto the worlds
end: yet all ſhould bee comprehended in his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
it could not be comprehended in any. Their
circumference ſhould ſtill be ſomewhere, whereas
his Eſſence, though ſtill inlarging (by this ſuppoſed
daily exerciſe of his power) the bounds of its actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
coexiſtence with theſe new creatures, is in it
ſelfe altogether boundleſſe. Omnipotency it ſelfe,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7905:35"/>
cannot pitch a circumference to it, becauſe nothing
can be, but it muſt be in it, which onely <hi>truly</hi> is, and
cannot bee contained in any thing imaginable. In
that all things are contained in him, he is rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
by a ſphere, which is of al figures the moſt
capacious. In that all things cannot comprehend
him, He is rightly reſembled by a ſphere whoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
is no where.</p>
                     <p>8 Two points notwithſtanding in the former
reſemblance ſeeme difficult to mens conceipts; but
more difficult it is fully to expreſſe what may
rightly be conceived concerning them. The former
difficulty is, how a Center ſhould be conceived to
be every where: The ſecond, how the indiviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Gods preſence in every place, ſhould bee
compared unto a Center. To the former it may be
ſayd, That as the divine Eſſence by reaſon of its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<hi>infinity,</hi> hath an abſolute neceſſity of coex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
with ſpace or magnitude infinite: ſo were
it poſſible there ſhould bee (as ſome Divines hold
it poſſible there may be) a magnitude or materiall
ſphere actually infinite; this magnitude could have
no ſet point for its Center, but of every point de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignable
in it, wee might avouch this is the Center
as well as that. Every point ſhould have the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
properties of a ſphericall Center; there could
be no inequality betweene the diſtances of ſeverall
points from the circumference of that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
and hath no bounds of magnitude. To the
ſecond difficulty it may bee ſaid, The manner of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
preſence or coexiſtence to every place or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of bodies viſible, is rightly compared unto a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7905:35"/>
Center, in that it hath no diverſity of parts, but is
indiviſibly preſent to all and every part of things
diviſible. His <hi>preſence</hi> againe is herein like to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
actually <hi>infinite,</hi> in that it can have no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference.
But whether the divine Eſſence may
have as perfect actuall coexiſtence to every point
or Center, as it hath to every leaſt portion of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes
diviſible, cannot ſo cleerely bee inferred
from the indiviſibility of divine immenſity, becauſe
the indiviſibility of Centers or points, and of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
ſubſtances are Heterogeneall, and Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealls
are oft-times <hi>aſſymmetrall,</hi> that is, not exactly
commenſurable. Hence the moſt ſubtill Schoole-men
or metaphyſicall Divines, as well ancient as
moderne, reſolve it as a point irreſoluble by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
wit, whether a mathematicall point or Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
can be the compleat and <hi>definitive</hi> place of an
Angell, albeit they hold the Angelicall natures to
bee as truely indiviſible, as points or Centers are.
But it is one thing for an immateriall or ſpirituall
Eſſence to have true coexiſtence with every Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
another to be confined to a Center, or to have
a definitive place or coexiſtence in it. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
may bee thought of Angells; of the Divine
Eſſence we may ſay, that he is as properly in every
Center as in every place, ſeting wee acknowledge
<hi>Him</hi> to bee alike incomprehenſibly and indiviſibly
in both. The manner of his indiviſibility we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by his coexiſtence to a Center. His incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſibleneſſe,
by his coexiſtence to all ſpaces or
places imaginable, without coextenſion to any,
without comprehenſion in all. We may in no caſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7905:36"/>
imagine, that there is more of God, or that God is
more fully in a great ſpace than in a little; in the
whole world, than in a man or little world. For this
once granted, an Aſſes head ſhould participate the
eſſentiall preſence of the Deity in greater meaſure
than a mans heart doth. But in what reſpects God
is ſaid to bee more ſpecially preſent in one place
than in another, or to be preſent with ſome, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from others: hereafter.</p>
                     <p>9 The abſolute perfection of this Attribute, in
whoſe right apprehenſion or conceipt many other
divine perfections, according to our manner of
conceiving them, are as it were couched or lodged,
may beſt bee gathered by oppoſition to the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of bodies or materiall magnitudes. A body
though of Homogeneall nature, ſuppoſe a Pole or
ſtone fixed in the earth, invironed <hi>above</hi> with water
and the ayre, can have no coexiſtence with theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
bodies, otherwiſe than according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of its owne parts: that part of it which hath
coexiſtence with the ayre, can have no coexiſtence
with the earth or water. Farre otherwiſe it is in
God, whoſe abſolute infinity in that it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of parts, but conſiſts in perfect unity, cannot
bee coexiſtent to any place after any other manner
than <hi>He</hi> is coexiſtent to all, that is, by indiviſible
unity or identity, Whereſoever <hi>He</hi> is (and <hi>Hee</hi> is
every where,) <hi>He</hi> is <hi>unity</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>infinity</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity</hi>
it ſelfe, <hi>perfection</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>power</hi> it ſelfe. All
theſe branches of quantity, in which we ſeek to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſſe
ſo many ſorts of <hi>infinities,</hi> thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
or reſemble <hi>His</hi> incomprehenſible nature,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7905:36"/>
do flow from participation of his infinite preſence.
Vnleſſe <hi>He</hi> were <hi>infinitie</hi> or <hi>immenſity</hi> it ſelfe, there
could be no magnitude, no meaſure quantitative,
by whoſe multiplication wee could in any ſort ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or gueſſe what <hi>immenſitie</hi> or <hi>infinitie</hi> meant.
That imaginary <hi>infinitie</hi> which wee conceive by
ſucceſſion or compoſition of parts (for their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
extenſions finite, though in number infinite)
is but a tranſient raye or beame of that actuall and
ſtable infiniteneſſe, which <hi>Hee</hi> poſſeſſeth in perfect
unitie, without any imaginary diverſity of parts
united. Had his <hi>immenſity</hi> any diverſity of parts,
there ſhould be more power in many parts, than in
one, or few: unto the full exerciſe of his whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
or force, there ſhould bee a concurrence of all
parts required: &amp; this concurrence of parts in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>infinite,</hi> would perhaps be impoſſible. <hi>Infinitum
tranſire non poteſt.</hi> At the leaſt, were divine power ſo
lodged in divine immenſitie, as ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth or power is
in our bodily faculties, it could not bee ſo omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
as we beleeve it is. Our ſtrength or force is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
increaſed by unition or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traction of ſeverall
parts; His power can receive no increaſe ſeeing his
immenſity excludes al diviſion, &amp; doth not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

                        <hi>10 The Prophets and other holy men in their

their thoughts ſeldome aſcend. And according to

                        </note> As there was from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
a poſſibility for us to bee before wee were; ſo
our actuall being or exiſtence, whileſt it laſteth, is
compoſed of a <hi>capacity</hi> to be what we are, and of
the <hi>actuation</hi> or filling of this capacity. Life (ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
eſpecially) is but the motion or progreſſe of
this capacity towards that which fills it, or as it
were a continuall ſucking in of preſent exiſtence, or
continuation of actuall being, from ſomewhat prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent.
Vnleſſe the vegetables, by which our life
is continued, had exiſtence before they become
our nutriment, they could not poſſibly nouriſh us,
or continue us in that eſtate of being which we
have. Nor could theſe Vegetables themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt,
unleſſe they did draw their exiſtence or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of their being, from that which did every
way exiſt before them; and unto which they doe
by motion or continuation of their being approch.
So that future times, and all things contained in
time it ſelfe, preſuppoſe a fountaine of life, as truly
praeexiſtent to their future terminations or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as it was to their beginnings. That deſcription
of time <hi>[tempus edax rerum,] as if it were the devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of all things which are ſubject to alteration,</hi> did
relliſh more of poeticall wit, than of any metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall
truth. For if time did devoure al things which
are brought forth in time, what is it that could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
nouriſh them, or continue their <hi>being</hi> from
their beginning to their end? whileſt the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for them laſts, they cannot poſſibly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7905:39"/>
or periſh. Nothing there is that doth or can
deſire its owne deſtruction, nor long after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
or fruition of that, which doth devoure or
deſtroy it. All things naturally deſire the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of ſuch being, as they have; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
things temporall cannot have, but from
the continuation or fruition of time. Time then it is
not, but their owne motions or endeavors to injoy
or entertaine time approching, which doth waſte or
conſume things temporall. We naturally ſeeke to
catch time, and it is the nature of time, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
caught, not to be held by us. This nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of time, is ſo like unto the ſwift progreſſe of
motion, that ſome acknowledge no difference at
all betweene them. Whereas in true Philoſophy,
the length of time paſſing by us, is onely notified
by motion. Motion in true obſervation goes one
way, and drives time another, as the ſtreame which
runnes Eaſtward, turnes the Wheele Weſtward.
Our actuall being or exiſtence ſlides from us with
time, and our capacity of being, continuing ſtill the
ſame, runnes on ſtill, being alwayes internally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

this repleniſhment cannot otherwiſe bee gotten,
than by gaining a new coexiſtence with time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,

the nature of things generable) haſtens unto
that being which is to come, nor can it reſt, ſeeing
it drawes or ſuckes in that being which it hath by
doing now this and now that, being moved as it
were in a circle with deſire of Eſſence or of Being
what it is. Nor are we men, or any creatures (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

much of our proper being from the fountaine of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</hi>

liſt. We have our portions of life or ſelfe-fruition
diſtributed piece-meale and ſparingly unto us, leſt
too much put into our hands at once, might make
us prodigall of the whole ſtock. As may yonglings
by their parents too much bounty towards them,

all at once. Whereas fruition of delights and
pleaſures ſhould be meaſured by the capacity of our
eſtate or condition; as wiſe men fit their expences
according to the tenour of their revennues.</p>
                     <p>2 Albeit the conſtant motion of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and
<hi>Moone</hi> be appointed by the Creator as a common
ſtandard for the meaſuring of all times: yet every
thing temporall, or endowed with duration mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7905:40"/>
by the motion of the heavens, hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
time, which in all of them is no other than a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of eternity. And hee ſhould define the

or <hi>repleniſhments,</hi> which are derived from the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
fountaine of life &amp; being, to fill the capacities,
or ſatiate the internall deſires of things temporall.
And albeit the motion of the heavens bee conſtant
and uniforme; yet the duration of things temporall
or ſublunary (though meaſured by their conſtant
motion) is capable of internall contraction and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation.
Some things have a kind of a double du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and runne a courſe of time as it were inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Life, albeit in it ſelfe moſt ſweet, yet in us is
often charged with ſo<note n="*" place="margin">See Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticus 41. 2.</note> great a meaſure of ſowre
occurrences, that were it at all or moſt times, as
ſome whiles it is, the fruition of it could not quite
the paines we are put to in preſerving it. And the
worſe our eſtate is, the longer it ſeemeth to bee
ſuch, becauſe vitall exiſtence or duration, through
diſtraction of mind, or vehement motion, ſeemeth
divided into more parts, then without ſuch impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
it could take notice of. In griefe or paine wee
ſtrive to thruſt time preſent apace from us, that
ſome other may come better attended. In delight
or pleaſure wee ſeeke to arreſt it, and wiſh to have
our joyfull moments fixed, or to have them ſtill to
returne and goe, ſo that wee might prolong our
daies by living the ſame times over and over again,
as men often walke longer in pleaſant gardens, then
in vaſt fields, by often reſuming the ſame ſhort
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7905:40"/>
walkes. Were it poſſible for us to ſtay thoſe grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
parcels of time, till new ones come with like
ſupply; the current of pleaſure, thus damnd vp,
would ſwell; and our fruition of ſuch imperfect
exiſtence as we have, would be much more perfect
and entire. But ſeeing the pleaſure of borrowed
life, is to the identity of being, but as water to the
pipe, through which it runnes; all the remedy wee
have againſt welcome times departing from us, is
to regain the like, and make up the unity of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of ſelfe-fruition by equivalency. The gluts
or guſhes of pleaſure, may at one time bee much
greater than at another, yet ſtill tranſient, never
conſiſtent. The fruition of them cannot poſſibly
be entire: begotten and dying in every moment;
they are, and they are not in a manner, both at
once; ſo that we loſe them as we gaine them.</p>
                     <p>3 The Angelicall natures, albeit they account
not the continuation of their duration, nor number
the portions of their participation of eternity, by
the motion of the heavens, as being not fed with
expectance of that time or ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunites
wee watchfully attend: yet their deſires
(more fervent by much then we have any) to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
what they are, witneſs they have not all that in
preſent poſſeſſion, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is allotted to their compleat
duration. <hi>Nothing,</hi> being the foundation as well of
angelical excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies, as of our mediocrities, makes
them uncapable of that entire ſelfe-fruition, which
is eſſentiall to him which made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>nothing,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made of none. He, as he is of himſelfe without
beginning, ſo is he entirely in himſelfe, and can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7905:41"/>
nothing by ſucceſſion. He deſires not his own
duration, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> none can give him, nor needs he to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it, becauſe it is alway entirely &amp; indiviſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
without poſſility of addition. For how ſhould
<hi>Eſſence</hi> it ſelfe, or infinity of <hi>being,</hi> get ought to
morrow, which to day it hath not; or loſe ought to
day which yeſterday it had. The firſt branch of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we can conceive as incident to him,
that is thus truly <hi>infinite,</hi> is, not all times to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
within himſelfe all fulneſſe of joy, however
poſſible. He is life it ſelfe, &amp; therfore life truly infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.
And infinite life, being infinitely ſweet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
joy truly infinite; altogether uncapable of
any addition or diminution. As in a body infinite
(could any ſuch be) there could be no middle or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams;
ſo neither can infinite life admit any parts,
as being indiviſible into duration ſubſequent &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.
Natures, capable of theſe differences, have
alwayes the one accompliſhed by the other. Time
comming (as we ſaid before) repaires the loſſes of
time going, and perfects or ſupports things natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
by ſucceſſive continuance of preſent being. But
perfection it ſelfe can no more bee perfected, than
<hi>whiteneſſe</hi> can be dyed <hi>white.</hi> Life, or Eſſence <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi>
excludes vacuity, or capacity of reſumed acts
to fill up the meaſure of actuall exiſtence, or fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>being.</hi> In that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

can want nothing; and to him that can want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
all muſt be preſent. We muſt then conceive
of the Divine Eſſence, as infinite, not onely in life,
but in the degrees or acts of life: which in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
cannot be many, but onely take the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7905:41"/>
of plurality, from things decreed. As Hee is
ſaid Everlaſting with reference to the perpetuity of
ſucceſſion, which ſtill ſuppoſeth his interminate
exiſtence, as preſent to the whole and every part of
it. Conſider <hi>him</hi> in himſelfe, and He is every way
indiviſibly infinite, and interminable; not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Hee had no beginning, nor ſhall have ending:
For ſo might time or motion be held interminable,
could the Heavens have beene created from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting;
whoſe revolutions nevertheleſſe or ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
parts of motion, ſhould have beene truly nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable,
and therefore terminable; whence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
had beene contained within their circuit,
ſhould ſtill have gotten ſomewhat which before it
had not, either addition of duration, or (which is
all one) continuance of their firſt exiſtence, or
ſome new Acts of life, of ſenſe, or reaſon. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Eſſence infinite, none of theſe can accrue. If
they could, as yet he ſhould not be, nor ever could
Hee bee actually eternall, but everlaſtingly onely
by ſucceſſion. For Eternity, as <hi>Boetius</hi> hath well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
it, <hi>is the entire or totall poſſeſsion of intermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
life, all at once or together.</hi> Howbeit theſe termes
of totall fruition or poſſeſſion, may ſeeme to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
ſome parts, though not in the life poſſeſſed,
yet in the poſſeſſion of it; which (I take it) was farre
from this good Authors meaning. What meant he
then to uſe ſuch tearmes? onely to exclude ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which hath a totality of Being, but not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or all at once. As the next houre, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall have ſucceſſive duration in it, ſhall bee
wholly and fully exiſtent; but ſo as one part ſhall
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7905:42"/>
goe before, another come after. So is not that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which is interminable. But in what ſenſe <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi>
is attributed to <hi>eſſence</hi> or <hi>duration infinite,</hi>
will better appeare in the iſſue of theſe explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

ſome Philoſophers compriſe generation, or the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

There is no greater difference betwixt theſe two,

power,</hi> which needeth nothing beſides that

hath <hi>All,</hi> that is or can bee, in that it truly <hi>Is:</hi> for

determinate, or in ſucceſſion infinite, but now
hath whatſoever is expedient to bee had: this is
that, which our notion of Eternity hunteth after.
That which thus is, hath not its Eſſence or Being

to all quantity or menſuration. Farre
otherwiſe have things generable their <hi>being,</hi> as it

                        </gap>ians, queſtioning
<hi>whether Socrates</hi> in the inſtant of his diſſolution or
corruption, be a man, or corps, or both. To be both
implyes a contradiction; theſe two negative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
being ſimply convertible, No corps can
be a man, no man can bee a corps. And yet there
is as much reaſon, that he ſhould in this inſtant bee
both as either. For true reſolution we are to ſay, He
was a man, and ſhall be a corps, or he ceaſeth to bee
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7905:43"/>
the one, and begins to be the other. But the Being
or exiſtence of both being menſurable by time,
muſt needs bee diviſible, and for this reaſon, not
comprehenſible by an <hi>inſtant</hi> which is indiviſible.
But <hi>Plotins</hi> concluſion is, whileſt wee ſeeke to fit
that which truly is, with any portion of meaſure or
degree of quantity, the life of it being thus divided
by us, loſeth its indiviſible nature; We muſt then
leave it (as it is) <hi>indiviſible,</hi> as well in life or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as in Eſſence, and yet infinite in both.</p>
                     <p>Of time, no part truly is, but the preſent, which
is never the ſame: and as one queſtioned (in that
age wherein the Art of Navigation was imperfect)
whether Navigators were to be reckoned amongſt
the dead or the living: So it is more doubtfull
then determinable, whether time participate more
of being, or of not being; yet as is time, ſuch is the
nature of things brought forth in time. But <hi>Eternity</hi>
(being the duration of <hi>Him</hi> who onely <hi>Is,</hi> being
made of none, but Maker of all things, and the
diſpenſer of Time it ſelfe into its portions) as<note n="*" place="margin">Ad 7. Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. lib. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nead. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi>
deſcribes it, is as a fixed inſtant or perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Center, which needs no ſucceſſion for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;
<hi>all ſufficient</hi> to ſupport it ſelfe, and all things
elſe. The ſame Writer not unfitly compares <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
to a Center in a Circle; and time to the points
or extremities of the lines in the Circumference,
alwayes ſo moving about the Center, that were it
an <hi>eye,</hi> it might view them all at once. Yet muſt we
not hold <hi>Eternity</hi> to be indiviſible, after the ſame
manner that points or Centers are. Theſe are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
becauſe they want the perfection of that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7905:44"/>
quantity, whoſe parts they couple. <hi>Eternity</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible
by poſitive <hi>infinite,</hi> as containing all the
parts or perfections poſſible of ſucceſſion in a
more eminent manner, then they can be contained
in time it ſelfe, which (as <hi>Plato</hi> wittily obſerves) is
a moveable image of <hi>Eternity.</hi> This difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the indiviſibility of an inſtant or moment,
and Eternity, may perhaps make the ſolution of
that ſeeming contradiction leſſe difficult then it is
to ſome great Schoolemens apprehenſions: <hi>[Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus
in aeternitate agrotat, Et, Petrus in aeternitate no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
aegrotat.] Peter is ſick in eternity, Peter is not ſicke in
eternity.</hi> This affirmation &amp; deniall, in one and the
ſame indiviſible inſtant or limited portion of time,
would inferrean indiviſible contradiction, which
in eternity they doe not. And yet is Eternity more
indiviſible than an inſtant, but indiviſible after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner.</p>
                     <p>6 But I know not how it comes to paſſe, that
the true ſhadow of perfection it ſelfe, is oft-times
more apparant in things moſt imperfect. Natures
more perfect (by a borrowed perfection) hold the
meane betweene them; Out of both we may ſpell
more than we can put together, for right expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the nature of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelfe. The prime mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though of things created moſt imperfect, is of
creatures ſublunary, moſt like unto the Creator, in
being ingenerable and incorruptible; in that it is the
<hi>Alpha</hi> whence all things generable ſpring, and the
<hi>Omega</hi> into which they are reſolved: Yet is the
prime matter moſt contrary to its Maker, in that
wherein it doth reſemble Him. It is in a ſort or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7905:44"/>
manner, all things generable, but perfectly nothing,
as wanting the true unity of Entity, or determinate
Being. The Creator or Eſſence it ſelfe, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
perfection of all things, without
participation of their imperfections. The Earth
againe is like the Eternall Founder in permanency
and immobility, but this it hath from its naturall
dulneſſe; whereas the perfection of this ſhadow is
in Him from the infinite vigour of his vitality. The
ſwift motions of the Heavens, or motion as ſwift as
we may imagine, is as a middle terme of proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between the Earths immobility, and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,
or more then infinite mobility of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which we tearme the infinite vigour of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.
<hi>Inſtants</hi> in this are moſt like <hi>Eternity,</hi> in that
an infinite number of them added together, yeelds
no increaſe of quantity: Nor doth Eternity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
addition from ſucceſſion infinite, which moſt
unlike it in being diviſible, doth yet better expreſſe
the poſitive infinity of it, than <hi>inſtants</hi> can doe. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
againe, is like a fixed Center, becauſe indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
immutable; yet withall moſt like a circle. And
<hi>Triſmegiſts</hi> deſcription of the Deity, <hi>commutatis
commutandis,</hi> as well exemplifies the Eternity, as
the immenſity of his nature. Eternity is a circular
duration, whoſe <hi>inſtants</hi> are, <hi>alwayes,</hi> whoſe <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi>
or <hi>extremities</hi> never <hi>were,</hi> never <hi>ſhall be:</hi> It is
coexiſtent to every parcell of time, but not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptible
by any: ſucceſſion infinite cannot be coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to it. For albeit the motion of the Heavens,
or other notifications of duration diviſible, ſhould
continue the ſame, without interruption or End:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7905:45"/>
yet every period and draught of time, we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
ſhall ſtill fall within Eternity, now totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent;
and which hath beene, is, and ever will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
every minute or ſcrupe of time, that hath beene,
is, or ſhall be, alike everlaſtingly coexiſtent, not by
acquiſition of any new ſucceſſive parts, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible
and interminable unity.</p>
                     <p>7 We cannot perhaps properly ſay, that God
ſhall be after all times or durations to come; for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
muſt flow from <hi>His Everlaſting Being</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end. And what can be after that which hath no
end? And here we ſuppoſe, that albeit time or dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſucceſſive had their actuall beginning with the
creatures: yet there ſhal be, or may be, if not a time,
yet ſome duration ſucceſſively infinite. And that
onely is after this manner, infinite, unto which
ſomewhat of the ſame kinde may ſtill bee added.
Thus, as in the continued and diviſible quantities,
<hi>[non datur minimum.]</hi> There is no fraction ſo little,
but may be leſſe; and as in numbers <hi>[non datur max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imum]</hi>
There is no number ſo great, but it may be
made greater by addition: ſo in ſucceſſive durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>[non datur ultimum.]</hi> It may be truly ſaid to laſt
for ever, becauſe it can have no laſt portion. But
howſoever we cannot properly, or without expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
our ſpeech to captious exceptions, ſay, that
<hi>eternity</hi> ſhal be after all time or duration ſucceſſive;
(ſeeing this may ſeeme to import, that duration or
ſucceſſion ſhall finally ceaſe:) yet that <hi>eternity</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>duration,</hi> actually, interminably and indiviſibly,
not ſucceſſively, <hi>infinite)</hi> now is, and ever was, as
infinitely praeexiſtent or precedent to all ages, or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7905:45"/>
ſucceſſions comming towards us, one way; as it is
and was to the worlds nativity, or the firſt out-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of time, the other way. This is a point which
we muſt beleeve, if we rightly beleeve God to bee
Eternall, or know what Eternity is. A point, which
would to God they had ſeriouſly and in heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
which have had Gods eternall decree and
the awards of it, moſt frequently in their mouthes
and pens. And he is no Chriſtian that would deny
whatſoever is by God decreed, was ſo decreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all worlds: So is he no Chriſtian Philoſopher,
much leſſe a true Chriſtian <hi>Divine,</hi> that ſhall refer
or retract the tenor of this ſpeech <hi>[Before all worlds]</hi>
to that only which is paſt, before the world began.
Whatſoever can be more properly ſaid or concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be paſt, then to be yet to come, or to bee in
every moment of time deſignable, can have no
property of Eternity. For that onely is Eternall,
which alwayes is, and ſo alwaies is, that it hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence
or praeexiſtence infinite to all ſucceſſions,
which way ſoever wee looke upon them, or take
their beginning, whether backwards or forwards.
It was a great overſight (or rather want of inſight
into the nature of this great Sphere or viſible
world) in <hi>Lactantius,</hi> (otherwiſe a learned Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an)
not onely to deny there were any Antipodes,
but to cenſure the Philoſophers (which had gone
before him) of groſſe ignorance or infatuation, for
avouching this truth, now manifeſted to meaner
Scholars, or more illiterate Chriſtians, than any
which <hi>Lactantius</hi> taught. A greater ignorance it
would be in us which acknowledge this truth, to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7905:46"/>
ſay theſe Antipodes were under the earth, and the
inhabitants of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> onely above it;
or that the Heavens were as farre under our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes,
as they are above us. For whoſoever walkes
on the earth, whether in this Region or that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the halfe or full Antipodes, is above the
earth. And every part of the Heavens unto which
the lookes of men are erected, as well the <hi>Nadir</hi> as
the <hi>Zenith,</hi> as well the <hi>South pole</hi> as the <hi>North-pole</hi>
is above the earth. And as the Heavens are every
way above the Earth, ſo is <hi>Eternity</hi> every way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all worlds, before all times. As we beleeve this
viſible world and all things in it, had a beginning;
ſo we expect it ſhall have an end: Now the eye of
Eternall Providence lookes through the world,
through all the ſeverall ages, ſucceſſions, or durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the world; as well from the laſt end to their
firſt beginning, as from their firſt beginning to their
laſt end. There is no period of time to us imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which is not ſo invironed by Eternity, as the
Earth or Center is with the Heavens; ſave onely
that the Heavens are finite, and Eternity infinite.
So that the Heavens though far every way, are no
way infinitely above the Earth; whereas Eternity
or Gods <hi>eternall</hi> decree, are every way infinitely
before all worlds, before all times. In this ſenſe,
were it poſſible, the world might have beene crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or motions continued from everlaſting; the
<hi>Eternall,</hi> notwithſtanding, ſhould have been ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
before them. For that period of motion
which muſt terminate the next million of yeares,
ſhall have coexiſtence with Eternity now exiſtent;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7905:46"/>
whoſe <hi>infinity</hi> doth not grow with ſucceſſion, nor
extend it ſelfe with motion; but ſtands immovable
with times preſent, being eternally before times
future, as wel in reſpect of any ſet draught or point,
whence we imagine time future to come towards
us, as in reſpect of the firſt revolution of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
whence time tooke beginning. Or, to ſpeake
as we thinke, it is impoſſible to conceive any dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be without beginning and ending; without
conceiving it circular, and altogether void of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.
Notwithſtanding, if any liſt to imagine
time both wayes everlaſting; the continuity of it
may be beſt conceived by the uninterrupted fluxe

ſports altogether to paſſe without any uſe or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
if not for compoſing ſome greateſt contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
amongſt learned men, yet for facilitating
contemplation in one of the greateſt difficulties,
that Philoſophy, whether ſacred or humane, affords
to the conceit of the moſt curious. The difficulty
is, how eternity being permanent and indiviſible,
ſhould have coexiſtence with ſucceſſion or motion.
We have ſeene a Top turne ſo ſwiftly upon the
ſame center, in a manner, that it ſeemed rather to
ſleepe or reſt, than to move. And whileſt it thus
ſwiftly moved, any bright marke or conſpicuous
ſpot, how little ſoever, ſeemed to be turned into an
entire and permanent circle. Seeing motion thus
ſwift, may be procured by a weake arme, it will be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7905:47"/>
no hard ſuppoſal to conceit that a <hi>mover</hi> of ſtrength
and vigour infinite, ſhould be able to move a body
in a moment. Admit then the higheſt viſible ſphere
ſhould be moved about in a moment; all the ſeveral
parts of ſucceſſive motion, which now it hath,
would be contracted into perfect unity: which
whether it ſhould be called a ceſſation from moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or a vigorous reſt, or a <hi>ſupermotion,</hi> actually
containing in it parts of motion ſucceſſively infinit,
were not ſo eaſie to determine. If thus it were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
about in an inſtant, the nature of it ſuppoſed to
be incorruptible, and the <hi>mover</hi> immortall, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill in the ſame ſtrength and minde; he would
not move it more ſlowly this day or yeare, than he
did the former. This ſuppoſition admitted, there
ſhould bee not onely parts ſucceſſively infinite of
one revolution, but revolutions ſucceſſiuely infinit
in one and the ſame inſtant. Or to ſpeake more
properly; As theſe revolutions ſhould not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be termed motion, but rather the product of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
infinitely ſwift, united or made up into a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
permanency: ſo ſhould not the duration of
one or of all theſe revolutions bee accounted as an
inſtant or portion of time, but a kinde of eternity
or duration indiviſibly permanent. The motion of
the eight ſphere ſuppoſed to be ſuch as hath beene
ſaid, that is motion infinitely ſwift, or not diviſible
by ſucceſſion; the Sunne moving ſucceſſively as
now it doth, ſhould have locall coexiſtence to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſtarre in the eight Sphere, to every point of the
Eclipticke circle wherein it moves, at one and the
ſelfe ſame inſtant, or in every leaſt parcell of time.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7905:47"/>
Every Star in the eighth ſphere, every point ſhould
be converted into a permanent circle; and ſo in one
circle there ſhould be circles for number infinite, as
many circles as there bee points or diviſibilities in
the Ecliptique circle. Thus in Him that is eternall,
are <hi>Beings</hi> infinite, and in <hi>Eternity</hi> are actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
durations in ſucceſſion infinite. The former
ſuppoſition admitted, we could not ſay that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Orbes, moving as now they doe, did move
after the eighth Sphere, but that the times of their
motion were eminently contained in it. For the
eighth Sphere being moved in an inſtant, ſhould
loſe the diviſibility of time, and the nature of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with all the properties that accompany them,
not by defect, (as if it no way compriſed them,)
but by ſwallowing up time or diviſion ſucceſſively
or potentially infinite, into an actuall permanency.
By this ſuppoſition of paſſive motion made infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſwift, by the ſtrength of the mover, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into a kinde of actuall indiviſible permanency,
we may conceive of the firſt Movers Eternity, as
Mathematicians conceive the true nature of a
Sphere, by imagining it to be produced by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>ſemicircle</hi> upon the Axis. For let the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi>
be but thus imagined to bee an intellectuall
ſphere, capable of momentary motion or revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
throughout this world; and the indiviſible co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence
of his infinity, to every part of time and

by ſuch ſwiftneſſe of motion, but indiviſible
onely of it ſelfe, and by the infinite vigour of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

and forme. But of things ſo preſented, operation
or power in their kinde is the native and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

but is fitted for acting ſome part or other uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

or power, which (according to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of things created) is manifold and diverſe, doth
give but ſuch a ſhadow of that infinite power,
which is eminently contained in the union of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Eſſence, as time and place did of his immenſity
and eternity. The force and vertue of ſome things
may perhaps more properly be termed ſtrength or
power paſſive, then operation. Howbeit even in
the earth and earthly bodies, by nature moſt dull,
there is a power or ſtrength to ſuſtaine waights
laid upon them; a power to reſiſt contrary impulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which perhaps eſſentially includes an active
force or operation; a power of ſwaying to the
center, which is no more paſſive than active, but a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7905:49"/>
meane betwixt both. Even in the dulleſt body that
is, there is a ſecret force or ſlow activity to aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
other things to themſelves, or to preſerve ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizing
natures. In bodies leſſe groſſe and more
unapt to reſiſt violence offered, as in the windes,
vapours, or exhalations, or in the ſpirits or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
which guide our bodies, we may perceive an
active force or power motive fully anſwerable to
the greateſt paſſive ſtrength or reſiſtance. Other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
or mixt bodies, are indued with an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power of producing the like, or deſtroying
contraries. Celeſtiall bodies, the Sunne eſpecially,
have a productive force to bring forth plants out of
their roots, to nouriſh and continue life in al things.
It is perhaps impoſſible, for any thing, that hath
not being of it ſelfe, to receive infinity of being in
any kind from another, though infinite. Impoſſible
for the fire, becauſe the ſubſtance of it is finite, to be
infinitely hot; but were it ſuch, it would be infinite
in operation.</p>
                     <p>2 As the Author or firſt ſetter forth of all things
operative, who alone truly <hi>is,</hi> ſurpaſſeth all conceit
of any diſtinct or numerable branch of <hi>being:</hi> ſo is
his power more eminently infinite in every kinde,
than all the united powers of ſeverall natures, each
ſuppoſed infinitely operative in its owne kinde, and
for number likewiſe infinite, can bee conceived to
be. Now what was generally obſerved before, that
things by nature moſt imperfect, doe oftentimes
beſt ſhadow divine perfections, hath place againe
in this particular. Gods infinite power is clearlieſt
manifeſted in creatures which ſeem leaſt powerful.

Who hath laid the meaſures thereof, if thou
knoweſt? Or who hath ſtretched the line upon it?
Whereupon are the foundations thereof faſtened? or
who laid the corner ſtone thereof?</hi> The excellent
majeſty of this ſpeech, ſufficiently teſtifies it was
uttered by God himſelfe, though taken from his
mouth, by the pen of man. But ſetting aſide the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſticke
phraſe or reſemblance, farre ſurmounting
all reſemblance all obſervance of poeticall <hi>decorum;</hi>
What cleerer fountaine of deeper admiration, can
the eye of mans underſtanding looke into, then
this, that not onely every corner ſtone in the world
with its full burthen, but all the mighty buildings
or erections, which are ſeene upon the whole ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the earth; yea the whole earth it ſelfe, with
all the mountaines and rockes upon it, with all the
metalls or maſſie ſubſtance that are within it,
ſhould be borne up by that which is leſſe than any
corner ſtone, by that which indeed is no body or
ſubſtance, not ſo much as a meere angle or corner.
Yet ſo it hath pleaſed <hi>Him,</hi> by whoſe wiſedome
the foundations of the earth were layd; to make
that little point or indiviſible Center; which is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
removed from our ſight, the moſt conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
place and ſeate of that indiviſible power
which is infinite. Let Mathematicians imagine
what rules or reaſons of equipendence they liſt,
their laſt reſolution of all ſupportance into the
Center, muſt ſuppoſe the ſame truth which
the Aegyptian Magicians confeſſed, <hi>[Hic digitus
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7905:50"/>
Dei eſt] The finger of God is here.</hi> Impoſſible it were
for <hi>that,</hi> which in it ſelfe is matter of nothing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnably
to ſupport all things ſupportable; unleſſe
it were ſupported by the finger of God. And yet
if we conceive of <hi>Him,</hi> as <hi>Iſaias</hi> deſcribes <hi>Him,</hi>
all the ſtrength and power that is manifeſted in the
ſupportance of the whole earth, and all therein, is
not the ſtrength of his little finger. Yea though
wee ſhould imagine, that as the waight of ſolids
amounts according to their maſſe or quantity: ſo
the ſuſtentative force, which is chambered up in
the Center, ſhould be multiplyed according to the
ſeverall portions or diviſibilities of magnitude
ſucceſſively immenſurable: yet this imagination
of force ſo multiplyed, it being diviſible, could not
equalize that true and reall conceipt of force di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
which ariſeth from conſideration, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibly
ſeated, throughout immenſity. To uphold
earths innumerable much weightier and maſſier
than this is, which borne by him, beareth all things;
would be no burthen to his power ſuſtentative: (ſo
from the effects, his power, though in it ſelfe one,
muſt receive from us plurality of denominations.)
And yet fully commenſurable to this power ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,
is his active ſtrength or power motive. He
that ſpans the Heavens with his fiſt, could toſſe this
Vniverſe with greater eaſe, than a Gyant doth a
Tennis Ball, throughout the boundleſſe Courts of
immenſity. Rocks of Adamant would ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
with the leaſt fillep of his finger, than bubbles
of water with the breath of Canons.</p>
                     <p>3 Our admiration of this his active power,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7905:50"/>
which we conceive as incomprehenſible, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
uncapable of increaſe, may bee raiſed by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating
the imaginary degrees of active powers
increaſe in creatures diviſible, as well in quantity,
as operation. Though Powder converted into
ſmoake, be the common mother of all force, which
iſſueth from the terrible mouth of the Gunne: yet
the Canon ſends forth his bullet (though more apt
to reſiſt externall motion) with greater violence
than the <hi>Sachar:</hi> and every <hi>Ordinance</hi> exceeds o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in force of battery, according to the quantity
of the charge or length of barrell. But were it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for the ſame quantity of ſteele or iron, to bee
as ſpeedily converted into ſuch a fiery vapour, as
gunpowder is; the blow would be ten times more
irreſiſtible then any, that Gunpowder out of the
ſame cloſe concavity, can make. The reaſon is
plaine; the more ſolid or maſſie the ſubſtance to be
diſſolved, is, the greater quantity would it yeeld of
fire, or other rarer ſubſtance, into which it were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.
And the greater the quantity, the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
is the contraction of it into the ſame narrow
roome: and the more violent the contraction is,
the more vehement is the eruption, and the ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
ſwifter. Thus from vapours rarified or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
in greater quantity, than the concavities of
the earth, wherein they are impriſoned without
vent, is naturally capable of; doe Earthquakes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo terrible: Theſe and the like experiments
bring forth this generall rule, <hi>The active ſtrength of
bodies multiplieth, according to the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
or cloſe unition of parts concurring to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7905:51"/>
or eruption:</hi> So doth the active force or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of motion, alwayes increaſe, according to the
degrees of celerity which it accumulates. Now
though the moſt active and powerfull eſſence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be encompaſſed with walls of braſs, nor cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
up in vaults of ſteele, albeit much wider than
the heavens; yet doth it every where more ſtrictly
gird it ſelfe with ſtrength then the leaſt or weakeſt
body can be girt. For what bonds can we preſcribe
ſo ſtrict, ſo cloſe or firme, as is the bond of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
unity, which cannot poſſibly burſt or admit
eruption, wherein notwithſtanding infinite power
doth as intirely and totally encampe it ſelfe, as in
immenſity. How incomparably then doth His
active ſtrength exceed all conceipt or compariſon?
The vehemency of his motive power, whoſe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Eſſence ſwallowes up the infinite degrees of
ſucceſſion in a fixed inſtant, and of motion in vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
reſt; cannot bee expreſt by motion ſo ſwift
and ſtrong, as would beare levell from the Sunne
ſetting in the Weſt, to the Moon riſing in the Eaſt.
To caſt the fixed Starres downe to the Center, or
hoyſe the Earth up to the Heavens, within the
twinkling of an eye, or to ſend both in a moment
beyond the extremities of this viſible world, into
the wombe of vacuity whence they iſſued, would
not ſtraine his power motive. For, all this we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to be leſſe then to bring nothing unto ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or ſomething to ſuch perfection, as ſome
of his creatures enjoy. Howbeit even ſuch as take
the fulleſt meaſure of perfection from his immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
muſt derive their pedigree by the mothers
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7905:51"/>
ſide, from meere nothing or vacuity. <hi>Homo,</hi> ſaith
S. <hi>Auſtine, terrae filius, nihili nepos;</hi> Man is the ſon
of the earth, and the grandchilde of nothing. And
when he ſhall come unto the height of his glory, he
cannot forget, he muſt remember, that the worme
was his ſiſter, and the creeping thing the ſonne of
his mother. To produce as many worlds out of
nothing, as the Sunne each yeare doth Herbes or
Plants out of the moiſtned Earth, would breed no
cumbrance to his power or force productive. To
maintaine, repaire, or continue all theſe in the ſame
ſtate, whileſt he makes as many moe, would neither
exhauſt nor hinder his conſervative vertue. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
or variety greater than wee can imagine of
workes moſt wonderfull, all managed at one and
the ſame time, could worke no diſtraction in his
thoughts, no defatigation in his <hi>Eſſence.</hi> From
the unity of theſe and the like branches of power,

if meerely naturall or deſtitute of correſpondent

more to the purpoſe, then a triple portion of
ſtrength, with halfe ſo much wit. <hi>Archimedes</hi> did
not come ſo farre ſhort of <hi>Polyphemus</hi> in ſtrength
or bulk of body, as the wonderfull works wrought
by his Mathematicall skill, did exceed any that
the Gyant could attempt.</p>
                     <p>2 Every choice is better or worſe accordingly
as it more or leſſe participates of true wiſedome:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7905:52"/>
And moſt unwiſe ſhould that choice juſtly be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
which would not give wiſedome prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
to power. Knowledge then, might wiſe men
chooſe their owne endowments, would be deſired
in greater meaſure then ſtrength. <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> ſaith
the <hi>Wiſeman, is the beginning of the wayes of God.</hi>
And ſhall not that branch of <hi>being,</hi> by which all
things were made, by which every created eſſence
hath its bounds and limits, be poſſeſt by Him, (who
gave them <hi>being</hi> and ſet them bounds,) without all
bounds or limits! above all meaſure? Yes, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
branch of <hi>being</hi> wee could rightly deſire or
make choice of before others: the inexhauſtible
fountaine of <hi>being</hi> hath not choſen, but is naturally
poſſeſt of, as the better. And therefore if we may
ſo ſpeake, though both be abſolutely infinite; his
wiſedome is greater then his power, to which it
ſerves as guide or guardian. And as the excellency
of the Artificers skill often recompences the defect
of ſtuffe or matter: ſo the infinity of wiſedome or
knowledge ſeemes, in a manner, to evacuate the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of power or force diſtinct from it. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
I will not in this place, or in our native dialect,
enter that nice diſpute, which ſome Schoolemen
have done; <hi>Whether Gods Eſſence and Knowledge be
formally his Power.</hi> But whileſt we conceive <hi>Power</hi>
and <hi>Wiſedome</hi> as two attributes formally diſtinct,
(at leaſt, to ordinary conceipts,) we may conceive
<hi>Wiſedome</hi> to be the father, and <hi>Power</hi> the mother of
all his workes of <hi>wonder.</hi> As for <hi>Philo</hi> and other
<hi>Platonicks</hi> that make Knowledge the mother of all
Gods workes, it is probable they dreamed of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7905:53"/>
                        <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or perhaps under theſe termes, they
cover ſome tranſformed <hi>Notion</hi> of the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in Trinity, who is the <hi>Wiſedome</hi> of the Father,
by whom alſo he created all things: who as he is
the onely begotten Sonne from eternity, ſo is hee
likewiſe a joint <hi>Parent</hi> of all things created in time
by the Father; as <hi>Eve</hi> was in ſome ſort <hi>Adams</hi>
daughter, and yet a true mother of all that call him
father. But here we ſpeake not of that wiſedome
of God, which is perſonall; but of the wiſedome
of the Godhead, as it is eſſentially and indiviſibly
infinite in the whole Trinity.</p>
                     <p>3 Wiſedome, as all agree, is the excellency of
knowledge, from which it differs not, ſave only in
the dignity or uſefulneſſe of matters knowne, or in
the more perfect maner of knowing them. Though
no man be wiſe without much knowledge, yet a
man may know many things, and not be very wiſe.
But if we ſpeake of Knowledge divine, not as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
in our conceipt to this or that particular,
but ſimply, as it comprehends all things, the name
of Wiſedome in every reſpect beſt befits it: for
though many things knowne by him, whileſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with others more notable, ſeeme baſe and
contemptible; yet not the meaneſt, but may be an
object of divine contemplation to a Chriſtian, that
conſiders not the meere matter or forme, or phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
properties, but the Creators power, or skill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
in it. How much more may the vileſt
creatures, whileſt he lookes upon his owne worke
in it, and the uſe whereto he appointed it, be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reputed excellent? He knowes as much of every
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7905:53"/>
Creature, as can be knowne of it, and much more
than man poſſibly can know: and thus he knoweth
not onely all things that are, but all that poſſibly
may bee. This argues wiſedome truly infinite;
whoſe right conceit muſt be framed by thoſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
conceipts which we have of the modell of it.</p>
                     <p>4 Of <hi>wiſedome</hi> then or uſefull knowledge, the
parts or offices are two: The one ſtedfaſtly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a right end: The other, to make and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quute
a right choice of meanes for effecting it. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
wiſedome is oft-times blinde in both, and
uſually lame in the latter. Neither can we clearly
diſcerne true good from apparent; nor doe our
conſultions alwayes carry eaven, to the miſtaken
markes whereat we ayme; but be the end propoſed
good or bad, ſo it be much affected, the leſſe choice
of meanes is leſt, the more eagerly wee apply our
ſelves unto their uſe, and ſtrive as it were, to ſtraine
out ſucceſſe by cloſe embracing them. And for this
reaſon, ignorance or want of reaſon to forecaſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of meanes for bringing about our much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ends, is the mother of ſelfe-will and impatience.
For what is ſelfe-will, if a man ſhould define it, but
a ſtiffe adherence to ſome one or few particular
meanes, neither onely nor chiefly neceſſary to the
maine point? And wits conſcious of their owne
weakneſs, for conquering what they eagerly deſire,
preſently call in power, wrath, or violence, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
or mercenary ſeconds to aſſiſt them. Whereas
hee that out of fertility of invention, can furniſh
himſelfe beforehand with ſtore of likely meanes for
accompliſhing his purpoſe, cannot much eſteeme
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7905:54"/>
the loſſe or miſcariage of ſome one or two. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
as mans wit in this caſe is but finite, ſo his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
cannot be compleat. Even the wiſeſt will be
moved to wrath or violence, or other foule play, if
the game whereat he ſhoots be faire and good, and
moſt of his ſtrings already broken. Nor can he be
abſolutely ſecure of good ſucceſſe, ſo long as the
iſſue is ſubject to contingency, and may fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Horizon of his foreſight and contrivance.
But wiſedome infinite doth compleatly arme the
Omnipotent Majeſty (if I may ſo ſpeake) with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
patience and long-ſuffering, towards ſuch as
every minute of their lives violently thwart and
croſſe ſome or other particular meanes, which he
had ordained for his glory and their good. <hi>Hee is
light,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and in him is no darkneſſe.</hi>
He diſtinguiſheth the fruits of <hi>light</hi> from fruits of
<hi>darkneſſe,</hi> before they are, even before he gave them
poſſibility of <hi>being.</hi> As impoſſible it is for his will
to decline from that which he diſcernes to be truly
good, as for his infinite Eſſence to ſhrinke in <hi>being.</hi>
Many things may (as every thing that is evill doth)
fall out againſt his will, but nothing without his
knowledge, or beſides his expectation. That which
in its owne nature (as being made ſuch by his unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
decree) is abſolutely contingent, is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
in reſpect of his providence or eternall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
In that he fully comprehends the number
of all meanes poſſible, and can mixe the ſeverall
poſſibilities of their miſcariage, in what degree or
proportion he liſt: he may, and oft-times doth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably
forecaſt the full accompliſhment of his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7905:54"/>
propoſed ends, by multiplicity of meanes, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
not inevitable, but contingent. So that, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
is onely neceſſary to the laſt, yet not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſary unto it. All the neceſſity it hath is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
gotten by caſuall miſcariage of the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
beſtowed upon the former: as if he ordained
the apprehenſion of a Traytor, or of a Malefactor,
by an hundred meanes, all by the immutable decree
alike poſſible, and equally probable; if ninety and
nine doe miſſe, the hundreth and laſt, by the rules
of Eternall Wiſedome, muſt of neceſſity take. But
in that it was poſſible for the former to have <hi>taken,</hi>
ſucceſſe falls to this laſt, not by abſolute neceſſity,
but as it were by lott; for it might have beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the former, by ſuppoſall onely of whoſe
miſcariage it is now neceſſary. And yet ſucceſſe it
ſelfe, or the accompliſhment of the end propoſed
by infinite wiſedome, was abſolutely neceſſary and
immutable.</p>
                     <p>5 There is a fallacy, though the ſimpleſt one
that ever was ſet to catch any wiſe man, wherein
many excellent wits of theſe latter ages, with ſome
of the former, have beene pitifully intangled. The
ſnare, wherein it were not poſſible for any beſides
themſelves to catch them, they thus frame or ſet,
<hi>Whatſoever God hath decreed, muſt of neceſsity come
to paſſe: But God hath decreed every thing that is:
Therefore every thing that is, comes to paſſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
All things are neceſſary at leaſt in reſpect of Gods
decree.</hi> The extract or corrallary whereof, in briefe,
is this: <hi>It is impoſsible for ought, that is not, to bee:
for ought that hath beene, not to have beene, for ought
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7905:55"/>
that is, not to be; impoſsible for ought to be hereafter,
that ſhall not be.</hi> But if it be (as here I ſuppoſe) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſonant to infinite wiſedome; altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to infinite goodneſſe; and no way impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for infinite power, to decree contingency as
well as neceſſity; or that ſome effects ſhould bee as
truly contingent, as others are neceſſary; a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
quite contradictory to that late inferred, wil be
the onely lawfull iſſue of the former Maxime, or
major propoſition matched with a minor of our
chooſing. Let the major propoſition ſtand as it did
before, <hi>[Whatſoever God hath decreed muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity
come to paſſe]</hi> with this additionall, <hi>Nothing
can come to paſſe otherwiſe than God hath decreed it
ſhall or may come to paſſe.</hi> The minor propoſition,
which (if our choice may ſtand) ſhall be conſort to
the major, is this, <hi>But God hath decreed contingency
as well as neceſsity,</hi> or, <hi>that ſome effects ſhould bee as
truly contingent, as others are neceſſary; Therefore of
neceſsity there muſt bee contingency, or effects contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</hi>
The immediate conſequence whereof is
this, <hi>There is an abſolute neceſsity, that ſome things
which have not beene, might have beene; That ſome
things which have beene, might not have beene. That
ſome things which are not, might be; That ſome things
which are, might not be: That ſome things which
ſhall not be hereafter, might bee; That ſome things
which ſhall be hereafter, might not be.</hi> But as ill weeds
grow apace, ſo the late mentioned errour once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
was quickly delivered of a ſecond, which
derived the infallible certainty of Gods foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things future, from an infallible neceſſity (as
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7905:55"/>
they conceived it) laid upon them (before they had
being) by his immutable decree. But every wiſe
decree preſuppoſeth wiſedome, and wiſedome eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially
includeth knowledge: ſhall we then grant
that Gods Knowledge is antecedent, and his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
conſequent to his decrees? or ſhall we
ſay he did inevitably decree the obliquity of Iewiſh
blaſphemy againſt his Sonne, becauſe he did moſt
certainly foreknow it, or, that hee did therefore
certainly foreknow it, becauſe hee had irreſiſtibly
decreed it? Moſt certaine it is, that he did as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
foreſee or foreknow all the obliquities of
their malice &amp; blaſphemy againſt Chriſt, as he did
their very acts or doings: if thoſe could be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from their acts or doings. Briefly, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the former concluſion; <hi>That the Eternall fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowes
all things, becauſe he decrees them; or, that
they are abſolutely neceſſary in reſpect of his decree;</hi>
were to impriſon his infinite wiſedome, in his ſelfe-fettered
<hi>power;</hi> to reſtraine the Eternall Majeſtie
from uſing ſuch liberty in his everlaſting decrees,
as ſome earthly Monarchs uſurpe in cauſes tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
or civill: For, <hi>Papae nunquam ligat ſibi manus;
The Pope</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>never tyeth his owne hands,
by any Grant or Patents:</hi> which is a fault in him;
onely becauſe he is otherwiſe very faulty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient
to ſupport or weild ſo high a prerogative
with upright conſtancy. But, in that <hi>Holy</hi> and
mighty <hi>One,</hi> the reſervation of ſuch liberty (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
we intimate) is a point of high perfection.</p>
                     <p>6 That to be able to decree an abſolute contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
as well as neceſſity, is an eſſentiall branch of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7905:56"/>
                        <hi>Omnipotency</hi> or power infinite, ſhall (by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of this Power) be clearly demonſtrated in
the Article of Creation. That God did omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
decree a contingency in humane actions, that
the execution of this decree is a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of his communicative goodneſſe, (a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
ſo neceſſary, that unleſſe this be granted, we
cannot acknowledge him to be truly good, much
leſſe infinitely good,) ſhall (by the favour of this his
Goodneſs) be fully declared in the Treatiſe of mans
fall, and of ſinnes entrance into the World by it.
That which in this place wee take as granted, is,
<q>That Gods wiſedome is no leſſe infinite than his
power; that he perfectly foreknowes, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by his <hi>omnipotency</hi> can be done; that his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and wiſedome are fully commenſurable to
his immenſity and eternity; that all theſe rules
following, are exactly parallell in true Divinity.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>Gods Preſence is not circumſcriptible by the
coexiſtence of his creatures; He is in every one
of them as a Center, and all of them are in Him as
in a circumference capable not of them only but
of all that poſſibly can bee; onely uncapable of
Circumſcription or Equality.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>His Eternity is more than commenſurable to
time or any duration of created Entities: It is in
every duration as a permanent inſtant; and all
durations are contained in it, as a fluent inſtant
in a ſet time, or as noonetide in the whole day.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>His Power likewiſe may not be confined to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
that are, have beene, or ſhall bee: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of every thing out of nothing, argues it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7905:56"/>
to be truly infinite; and yet the production of all,
is to the infinity of it, not ſo much as a beame of
light which is ſtrained through a needles eye, is
to the body of the Sunne, or to all the light dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
throughout the world.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Leaſt of all may his infinite <hi>wiſedome</hi> be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
within thoſe effects which by his power
have been produced, or which it now doth or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
ſhall produce. But looke how farre his <hi>immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi>
exceeds all reall or compleat ſpace, or his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi>
ſucceſſion, or the duration of things created,
or his <hi>Power</hi> all things already reduced from poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to actuall exiſtence; ſo farre doth his infinite
<hi>Wiſedome</hi> ſurmount the moſt exact knowledge that
can bee imagined of all things already ereated and
their actions. Nothing that is, could have borne
any part in the world, without the light or directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Knowledge: and yet that meaſure of his
Knowledge which can bee gathered from the full
harmony of this Vniverſe, is leſſe in reſpect of it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
conſidered, then skill to number digits, is to
the entire or exact knowledge of all proportions or
other arithmeticall rules or affections, that can ariſe
from their multiplications or diviſions. The cauſes,
properties, &amp; hidden vertues of each thing created,
are better knowne to <hi>Him,</hi> than ſo much of them as
we ſee or perceive by any other ſenſe, is to us: and
yet He knowes whatſoever by infinite power poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
might have beene, but now is not, whatſoever
hereafter may be, though it never ſhall be; as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
as he doth the things which at this inſtant are,

7 The <hi>ſubject</hi> wherein this his incomprehenſible
<hi>wiſedome</hi> exhibits the moſt liuely and ſureſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
for drawing our hearts after it in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
is the harmony or mixture of contingency
with neceſſity. And this, moſt conſpicuous in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating
the free thoughts of Men or Angells, and
ordaining them to the certaine and neceſſary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of his glory. The contingent means
which by his permiſsion and donation, theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
may uſe for attaining their ſeverall ends, or
private good, may be ſucceſſively infinite. And
yet, albeit the utmoſt poſſibilities of their varieties
and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancies, were reduced to act, the <hi>ends</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
which his infinite wiſedome hath
forecaſt in their creation, ſhould by any courſe of
many thouſands, which they may take, be as inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
brought to paſſe, as if no choice or freedome
had beene left them; or as if every ſucceeding
thought had been drawne on by the former, and al
linked to that which hee firſt inſpired, or by his ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible
power produced, with indiſſoluble chains
of Adamantine Fate. We would eſteeme it great
wiſdome or cunning (to uſe S. <hi>Auſtines</hi> illuſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)
in a <hi>Fowler</hi> to be able to catch againe all the Birds,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he had formerly caught, after he had permitted
every one of them to take wings and flye which
way they liſted. God hath nets every where ſpred,
for catching ſuch as his wiſedome ſuffers to flye
fartheſt from him, or moſt to decline the wayes
which in his goodneſſe he had appointed for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
and (which is moſt of all to be admired) the very
freedome or variety of mens thoughts, ſo they be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7905:57"/>
permitted to imploy them according to their owne
liking, becomes their moſt inevitable, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable
ſnare. For all their thoughts are actually
numbred in his infinite wiſedome, and the award
of every thought determinately meaſured, or defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by his Eternall Decree. So farre is freedome
of choice or contingency from being incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with the immutability of Gods will, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this infinite variety of choice or freedome of
thought in man and Angels, wee cannot rightly
conceive him to be as infinitely wiſe, as his decree
is immutable.</p>
                     <p>8 Free it was for mee to have thought or done
ſomewhat in every minute of the laſt yeare, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the whole frame of my cogitations or actions
for this yeare following might have beene altered:
and yet ſhould God have beene as true and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
a cauſe of this alteration, and of every thought
and deed thus altered; as he is of thoſe that <hi>de facto</hi>
are paſt, or of that which I now thinke or doe.
Nor ſhould his will or pleaſure (as ſome object)
depend on mine, but mine though contingently
free, neceſſarily ſubject unto his. For unto every
cogitation poſſible to man or Angell, he hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
decreed a proportionate end: to every
antecedent poſſible, a correſpondent conſequent;
which needs no other cauſe or meanes to produce
it, but onely the reducing of <hi>poſsibility</hi> (granted by
his decree) into Act. For what way ſoever (of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
equally poſſible) mans will doth encline, Gods
decree is a like neceſſary cauſe of all the good or
evill that befalls him for it. Did we that which we
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7905:58"/>
doe not, but might doe; many things would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
follow, which now doe not. Nor doe the
things, which at this inſtant befall me, come to
paſſe, becauſe <hi>he</hi> abſolutely decreed them, and none
but them (as we ſay) in the firſt place; But becauſe
<hi>hee</hi> decreed them as the inevitable conſequents of
ſome things, which <hi>hee</hi> knew I would doe, which
notwithſtanding <hi>hee</hi> both knew and had decreed,
that I might not have done. For whatſoever I
ſhould have done and have let undone, there was
a reall poſſibility to have done it; though not inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in me, yet <hi>intituled</hi> unto mee in particular by
Gods Decree; untill ſome demerit of mine or my
forefathers, did cut off the <hi>entaile,</hi> and interrupt the
ſucceſſefull influence. For here I will not diſpute,
how farre the ſinnes of Parents may prejudice their
Children; but theſe termes <hi>ſhould,</hi> or <hi>might,</hi> being
referred to matters of duty; are as infallible ſignes
in Divinity, as in Grammar, of a <hi>potentiall,</hi> what we
<hi>ſhould</hi> have done or <hi>might</hi> have done, was poſſible
for us to have done, by that decree whence all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and poſſibility, not meerely logicall, is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
So then, both that which might befall me if I
did otherwiſe, and that which now befals mee do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as I doe, flow alike immediately from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſity of his eternall decree: whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
wiſedome herein appeares moſt
admirable; that though the variety in this kinde
were infinite, yet ſhould it comprehend all; not
one thing could fall without the actuall circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of it.</p>
                     <p>9 The generall reaſon, why moſt Chriſtian
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7905:58"/>
writers are more able and apt both to conceive
right, and to ſpeake more conſequently to what
they rightly conceive, concerning other branches
of divine abſolute <hi>infiniteneſſe,</hi> than concerning his
infinite knowledge, is, becauſe all creatures without
exception, are true participants of Gods other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
beſides his wiſedome or knowledge. For
even the meaneſt creature, the worme or gnat, hath
a portion of that being, of that power, of that dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which in him are infinite: and that portion of
theſe attributes which they have, or that quantity
of being which they have, is a participation of his
immenſity. But of his knowledge or wiſedome,
men and Angels (the manner of whoſe knowledge
is to men for the moſt part unknowne) are of all his
creatures the onely participants. And (as hath been
obſerved before) thoſe rules are alwayes the moſt
cleare and certaine, and moſt eaſily gathered; which
are gathered from an uniforme identity of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
in variety of ſubjects. Thoſe univerſall rules (on
the contrary) are hardly gathered, or (without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
obſervation) are leſſe certaine, which can be
experienced onely in ſome one or fewer ſubjects.
Another ſpeciall reaſon why we doe not conceive
ſo magnificently or ſo orthodoxally of Gods
knowledge, as were fitting; is, becauſe we want fit
tearmes to expreſſe them in. For ſeeing words are
taken as the proper veſture of our thoughts &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts;
and ſeeing moſt men are apt to conceive or
judge rather according to the veſture or outward
appearance of things, than according to the inward
truth: it is almoſt impoſſible for us not to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7905:59"/>
the manner of Gods knowledge or decrees,
into the ſimilitude of our owne conceipts, conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or reſolutions; ſo long as we put no other ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
or expreſſions upon Gods decree or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
than were fitted for our owne. To ſalve this
inconvenience, or to prevent the occaſion of this

                        </note> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> moves this doubt: How
we can ſay there is any praeſcience or foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in God, ſeeing onely thoſe things can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſaid to be foreknowne, which are to come:
whereas we know, that nothing is future unto God,
before whoſe eye, no things are paſt; things preſent
doe not paſſe by <hi>Him,</hi> things future doe not come,
upon <hi>Him.</hi> Whatſoever hath beene to us, is yet in
his view; and whatſoever is preſent, may rather be
ſaid to be <hi>knowne</hi> than <hi>foreknowne.</hi> To the ſame
purpoſe Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> would have Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of things which are to come, to bee tearmed
rather <hi>ſcience</hi> than <hi>praeſcience</hi> or foreſight; ſeeing all
things are preſent to God. But theſe two great
lights of the Latine Church, with ſome others that
follow theſe for their guides, have not in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
expreſt themſelves ſo clearly or ſo accurately
as that their expreſſions can paſſe without queſtion
or exception in the Schooles. We may not ſay (nor
did Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> or Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> as I preſume,
thinke) that God doth not ſee or know a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betweene times paſt, preſent, or to come, more
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7905:59"/>
cleerely than we doe. If then he diſtinguiſh times
preſent from times paſt or future, how is it ſaid by
St. <hi>Gregory;</hi> that nothing to him is future, nothing
paſt? If theſe differences of time or of ſucceſſion
be reall; the <hi>Eternall</hi> knowes theſe differences much
better than we doe. And if he know a difference
between things preſent, paſt, and to come; <hi>to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
paſt, or to come,</hi> is not all one in reſpect of his
<hi>Eternall knowledge.</hi> If God, as all grant, be before
all worlds; his knowledge being coeternall to his
being, muſt needs be before all worlds. And Saint
<hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelfe grants a <hi>ſcientia</hi> a <hi>ſcience</hi> or <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
in God moſt infallible, of all things that have
beene, are, or ſhall be; before they are, were, or
could be; for they could not be coeternall to him,
who is before all worlds, the <hi>beginning</hi> of the
world it ſelfe, and of all things in it. Now all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of things not yet preſent, but to come, is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge:
to determine or decree things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is to predetermine or foredecree them. And
ſeeing God from Eternity hath both knowne and
decreed the things that then were not; he is ſaid to
have foreknowne and foredecreed them. So then
God foreknowes, and man foreknowes; God hath
decreed, and man hath decreed. But the difference
between the manner of their foreknowing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing,
being not oft-times wel expreſſed by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
writers or teachers, and ſeldome duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by their Readers or hearers; the identity of
words wherewith we expreſſe our own foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
&amp; Gods foreknowledge, begets a ſimilitude
of conceipt, or will hardly ſuffer us rightly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7905:60"/>
the true difference betweene the nature and
manner of <hi>humane wiſedome,</hi> and <hi>wiſedome divine.</hi>
And this hath beene the fertile nurſery of many
errours in this Argument, which now and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we ſhall endeavour to diſplant: imitating the
Heralds, who are often enforced to give the ſame
Coat to divers parties; but alwayes with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
remarkeable to ſuch as are converſant in
the myſteries of their Art.</p>
                     <p>10 Our knowledge of things to come is many
wayes imperfect; (and foreknowledge onely) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the duration neither of our knowledge, nor
of our ſelves, as yet can reach unto that point of
time, wherein things ſo knowne, get firſt exiſtence.
We looke on them as on things afarre off, which
we expected to meet; for as things paſt reſemble
moueables going from us, ſo things future ſeem to
come upon us. And whiles they get being, which
before they had not; we get continuance of being,
and of knowledge, which before we had not; that
is, we gaine a reall coexiſtence with them: For if
the daies, or thred of our life ſhould be cut off before
the things foreknowne by us come to paſſe, or get
actuall being; wee could not poſſibly haue coex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
with them. Such being or duration as they
have, is too ſhort the one way, &amp; our exiſtence too
ſhort the other way, to make up this knot or bond
of mutuall relation, which wee call <hi>coexiſtence:</hi>
There muſt be on our part, a continuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that exiſtence which we have; and on their
part, a growth into that actuall being, which
whileſt they are meerely future, they have not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7905:60"/>
wee and they can bee truely ſaid to exiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Now if we ſhall <hi>mold</hi> the manner of Gods
foreknowledge of things future in our owne <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt</hi>
or <hi>foreknowledge</hi> of them, we ſhall erroneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
collect; that, ſeeing wee cannot infallibly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know
future <hi>Contingents,</hi> ſo neither could they be
infallibly fore-knowne by God; if to him or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his decree, they were contingents, and
not neceſſarily predetermined.</p>
                     <p>And ſome there be, which puſh our proneneſſe
to this errour forward, by another; not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
betweene contingency and uncertainty,
they argue thus;</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>That which is in it ſelfe uncertaine, cannot certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be knowne:</p>
                        <p>Every future contingent is in it ſelfe uncertaine:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not poſsible, that a future contingent
ſhould certainly be knowne.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>But they conſider not that there is a twofold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty:
one formally relative: another onely
denominative or fundamentall. That which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively
uncertaine, cannot be certainly knowne;
for ſo it ſhould bee certaine to him, to whom it is
uncertaine. But a future contingent, as it is contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
doth not neceſſarily or formally include this
relative uncertainty; although it uſually be in part
the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Cofounder of it. For relative un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
or that uncertainty which is ſo termed
with relation unto knowledge, reſults partly from
the nature of the object, ſuppoſe a future Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
or Event mutable; partly and more principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from the imperfection of the knowledge, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7905:61"/>
of which it is ſaid uncertaine. But the ſame
effect or event, which is in part the <hi>foundation of
uncertaintie,</hi> with reſpect to finite or unperfect
knowledge, may bee the diſtinct and proper object
of knowledge in it ſelfe infallible, or of knowledge
infinite. Now if we grant, that there is any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in it ſelfe infallible, we cannot imagine that
any thing poſſible (yet is every future Contingent,
though we conſider it as contingently future, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible)
ſhould bee uncertaine unto ſuch knowledge.
We ſhould againe conſider, that the <hi>Eternall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi>
doth neither know or foreknow Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
future, by interpoſed or expiring Acts; but
by interminable and Eternall Knowledge, in which
there is no ſucceſſion, nothing future, nothing paſt.
And without the interpoſition of ſome determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or expiring Acts, there can bee no errour in
men; no man erres while hee is in the ſearch of
truth, or whileſt he ſuſpends his Iudgement. Take
then away the imperfection of our knowledge or
iudgement, whileſt it is in ſuſpenſe; which is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
rather than errour; and it better reſembles
divine knowledge, than our actuall reſolutions or
determinations doe.</p>
                     <p>11 The beſt knowledge which we can have of
things contingent, is but conjecturall: and of
things meerly caſuall, we cannot have ſo much as a
true conjecturall knowledge; for, thoſe things we
tearme caſuall, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are without the reach or ſphere
of our forecaſt or conjecture. And hence it is, that
the actuall exhibition of any event, whether caſuall
or contingent, doth alwaies <hi>actuate, increaſe,</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:7905:61"/>
our knowledge. The true reaſon why we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
certainly foreknow events contingent, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our <hi>Eſſence</hi> &amp; <hi>Knowledge</hi> are but finite: ſo that
things contingent are not ſo contained in us, that
if we could perfectly know our ſelves, wee might
perfectly know them. But in the Divine Eſſence
all reall effects, all events poſſible, whether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
caſuall, or contingent, are <hi>eminently</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
the perfect knowledge of his owne Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
neceſſarily includes the perfect knowledge
not onely of all things that have beene, are, or
ſhall bee, but of all things that might have beene,
or poſſibly may be. For as Gods Eſſence is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in every place, as it were an ubiquitary cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
ſo is his Eternity or infinite duration indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
coexiſtent to every part of ſucceſſion; and
yet withall is round about it. Hee it is, that drives
things future upon us, being from Eternity as
well beyond them, as on this ſide of them. Though
hee ſhould create other creatures without the
circumference of this world, they ſhould be all
within his preſence, without which, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ought beſides him, ſhould have any exiſtence:
yet ſhould he not properly gaine any new exiſtence
in them, but onely take a denomination of coexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
with them; becauſe they have exiſtence in
Him, which before they had not. Thus, admitting
the branches of Contingency or indifferent poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
never reduced to act, to be in our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
numberleſſe; yet whenſoever any thing comes
to paſſe, which might not have beene, it cannot
fall without the ſphere of Gods actuall knowledge,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7905:62"/>
which is fully commenſurable to <hi>Eternity</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity;</hi>
and therefore is not onely coexiſtent to
every ſucceſſive act, but doth environ whole ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
And whether of ſuch things as poſſibly may
be, more or fewer bee reduced to act; nothing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crewes
to Eternall Knowledge, no new act can bee
produced in it, by the caſuall event; but only that
which was eternally knowne, having now gotten
actuall coexiſtence with Eternity, beſtowes this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall
denomination upon the Eternall Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<hi>It was foreknowne from eternity;</hi> that is, in plaine
language, knowne, when it was not, by Him that
more properly alwayes indiviſibly, <hi>is,</hi> then <hi>was</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it. And being ſuch, his knowledge of things,
which, in reſpect of us are onely future and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
doth as truly reſemble, or rather containe
our knowledge of things paſt or preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as of things
to come. Now for us to apprehend a thing paſt,
under the nature of a thing contingent, is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.
And though we certainly know it to bee
already paſt, yet this certainty of our knowledge,
doth not perſwade us, that it came to paſſe certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or inevitably; but is very compatible with our
conceipt of its contingency or caſuall production,
whileſt it was preſent. Our knowledge of ſuch
things paſt or preſent, is neceſſary; but the event it
ſelfe is not therefore neceſſary, nor to bee termed
neceſſary in reſpect of our knowledge. Much leſſe
may we ſay, either that contingent effects are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
or that no effects are not neceſſary, in reſpect
of Gods decree or foreknowledge of them. For if
we beleeve that Gods foreknowledge of all events
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7905:62"/>
to come, be they of what kinde they poſſibly may
bee, is more cleare and more infallible than our
beſt knowledge of things paſt or preſent; the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
infallibility of his knowledge, can neither
adde any degree of neceſſity to the nature of the
events foreknowne, nor take one jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
from them. God ſhould not be abſolutely infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
either in Eſſence or in Knowledge, if the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<hi>infallibility</hi> of his foreknowledge, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
of his not erring in his predictions, were
in it ſelfe grounded upon, or to be inferred by us,
from the abſolute neceſſity of the event, rather than
from the abſolute <hi>infinity</hi> of his wiſedome. For
thoſe effects which being otherwiſe in their nature
<hi>contingent,</hi> it is in our power (by Gods permiſſion,
by circumſpection and forecaſt) to alter by laying
a neceſſity upon them, which before they had not;
we are able (after this neceſſity laid upon them by
our ſelves) infallibly to foreknow and foretell, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
our knowledge ſtill remaine but finite. Now,
that ſome events, which are to day, in themſelves
and by Gods decree, truly contingent, may by our
induſtry and circumſpection, become to morrow
truly neceſſary, no intelligent Chriſtian Divine
will (I hope) deny; or if any doe deny it, we ſhall
be able (by Gods aſsiſtance) poſitively to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
the truth of this our aſſertion, and withall
demonſtrate the dangerous inconveniences of the
contradictory opinion, in the Treatiſe of <hi>Divine
providence.</hi> In the meane time, to finiſh this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
ſtemme of <hi>Divine providence,</hi> to wit, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<hi>Wiſedome;</hi> and the dependance which things
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7905:63"/>
temporall have upon his eternall knowledge: Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
we imagine as a ſcrole containing ſeverall
<hi>columnes</hi> of <hi>contingency</hi> or indifferent poſſibilities;
of which onely ſo many, or ſo much of any, as in
revolution of time, take inke, and are unfoulded,
become viſible to Men and Angels. But the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
looketh on all things, as well from that end
of time which is to come, as from that which is
paſt: his infinite and eternall wiſedome, doth not
onely encompaſſe all things that come to paſſe, as
the Circumference doth the Center; but penetrates
the whole ſcrole of ſucceſſion from end to end and
from corner to corner, more clearly then the Suns
brightneſſe doth the perſpicuous or purified Ayre.
Thoſe Columnes of meere poſſibilities never actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
which his finger from Eternity hath drawne
in Characters ſecret and inviſible to his Creatures,
are alike diſtinct and legible to his glorious eye, as
thoſe others whoſe firſt draught, being as ſecretly
and inviſibly faſhioned by him, man or other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
cauſes by his concourſe, fill with actuall or
ſenſible exiſtence; as the Embroyderer doth the
Drawers obſcure patterne, with conſpicuous bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of ſilke, gold, or ſilver.</p>
                     <p>12 But leſt we may be thought to reade the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
with no greater reverence, than we do ſome
moderne Writers from whom wee freely diſſent,
without any impulſion of envy or vainglory, let us
for concluſion of this long diſcourſe, a little reflect
upon the teſtimonies before avouched out of S.
<hi>Auſtine,</hi> and out of S. <hi>Gregory.</hi> The truth then at
which theſe two learned Fathers aimed, &amp; which,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7905:63"/>
in the charitable conſtruction of ſuch as read them
with reverence, they did not miſſe, may bee fully
compriſed in theſe obſervations following, which
are but neceſſary extracts of what hath hitherto
beene delivered. Whereas S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>Vnto
God nothing is paſt, nothing to come;</hi> the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of his meaning is, that in Gods knowledge
of things paſt, preſent, or to come, there is <hi>nihil fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum,
nihil praeteritum,</hi> no ſuch difference of time
or duration, as we expreſſe by theſe words, <hi>future</hi>
or <hi>paſt:</hi> for it alwayes is, and ſo perfectly alwayes
is, that nothing can be added to it by ſucceſsion or
variety of events, be they neceſſary, caſuall, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent.
But as his Eternal knowledge of all things,
doth not make all things, which he knowes, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
(no not in reſpect of his Eternall Decree or
Knowledge, for he eternally decrees and knowes
things temporall and mutable:) ſo neither doth the
immutable or abſolute certainty of his knowledge,
make all things ſo known by him, to be immutable
or abſolutely neceſſary, either in themſelves or in
reſpect of his Eternall Knowledge. Onely this we
are bound to beleeve, and this is all that we may in
this argument ſafely ſay: [Gods Knowledge of
things mutable &amp; unneceſſary, is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
becauſe abſolutely infinite.] Againe, it is moſt
true which S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith; that things future doe
not come upon God as they doe upon us; that
things preſent do not paſſe him, or from him, as
they do from us. Whileſt things <hi>preſent</hi> paſſe from
us, we likewiſe paſſe from them: for we continually
loſe that portion of duration or coexiſtence which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7905:64"/>
wee had with them; alwayes gaining, whileſt our
glaſſe is in running, a new <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with that which is next to come. Nothing, in this
ſenſe, can paſſe by God or from God, becauſe He
alwayes is, and the manner of his duration is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible:
He cannot loſe any exiſtence by antiquity,
nor gaine any new portion of duration, by everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
continuance. Times paſſing exonerate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the Ocean of his infinite duration, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
inlarging it; times comming inceſſantly flow
from it, without diminution of it. Times <hi>future</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
are ſaid to come upon us, or to meet us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our duration or exiſtence cannot reach to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
things, whileſt they are future: the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are not of ſo long ſtanding or duration to day,
as they ſhall bee to morrow: unleſſe things future
did come towards them, and as it were meet them,
they ſhould have no coexiſtence with them. In this
ſenſe, times future cannot be ſaid to come upon
God, becauſe he alwayes is, and exiſts every way
before them. His <hi>duration</hi> is <hi>yeſterday, to day, to
morrow,</hi> the ſame for ever; and every way the ſame
without addition of quantity, without alteration of
nature or quality: and in it are all things that are.
So much of being as things <hi>future</hi> can bee ſaid to
have, they have it in <hi>him</hi> and from <hi>him:</hi> ſo much
of being as there remaines of things <hi>paſt,</hi> remaineth
in Him, and things <hi>preſent,</hi> even <hi>preſence</hi> it ſelfe,
cannot for a moment ſubſiſt, without Him.</p>

another preſents it ſelfe to
our contemplation, which
ſome Schoole-men have
moulded in the ſame <hi>conceipt</hi>
with <hi>Eternity;</hi> of which, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
conceive it to bee the off-ſpring. Vs it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
that the true explication of the former, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
the truth of this attribute, whoſe briefe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
we now ſeeke. And perhaps, if I ſhould
ſpeake properly, the Knowledge of it, is the Off-ſpring
of our right knowledge of the former. The
attribute it ſelfe, whoſe truth in former diſputes
hath beene ſuppoſed, is <hi>Divine Immutability;</hi>
which may be thus demonſtrated.</p>
                     <p>2 All mutation ſuppoſeth a defect or imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
either in reſpect of the <hi>terme,</hi> whence, or into
which, the change is made; and therefore can have
no place in abſolute or abſtract perfection, or in
Eſſence infinite. More particularly, all mutation or
change, is either in eſſence, in quantity, in place, or
in quality; under which we comprehend all vitall
endeavors, all acts of the Will or Vnderſtanding.
In eſſence or nature, it is impoſſible the totality and
fountaine of Eſſence ſhould admit any change, as
impoſſible for him which hath no author of being,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7905:65"/>
not to bee alwayes what hee is; as for that which
now is not, to take his being to it ſelfe: unto infinit
perfection (for ſuch he is) what can accrew? On
the other ſide, nothing can fall from it, but muſt
fall into him; ſeeing, He is in being infinite. And
in that he filleth every place by his eſſentiall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
it is impoſſible hee ſhould move from place
to place, or be carryed by any circular motion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indiviſibly and totally in every ſpace that can
be imagined. And as his <hi>Immenſitie</hi> could not be
entended or contracted by extenſion of new mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes,
or by diminution or annihilation of the
<hi>old;</hi> ſo neither can his <hi>Eternity,</hi> bee ſhortned or
lenghtned by continuation of ſucceſſion, or expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of time or motion. <hi>Power,</hi> in like ſort, truly
infinite, can admit no intenſion or remiſſion, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors;
but moveth all things without motion,
and worketh all things without labour or toyle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent:
For all things are made, and brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
by his ſole will or word. Nor ſpeakes hee
ought, which from Eternity hee hath not ſpoken;
albeit ſucceding ages have ſtill new meſſengers of
his eternall will and Word, <hi>All fleſh is as graſſe, and
all the glory of man as the power of the graſſe; the graſs
withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away. But
the word of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi> And yet this
was that word of the Goſpell, which ſeemed then
firſt to be preached unto them.</p>
                     <p>3 All the difficulty wherewith fleſh and blood in
this article are uſually aſſaulted, or ſeeme to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be beſet, is, how his <hi>will</hi> or <hi>counſaile</hi> ſhould
be eternally immutable, and yet everlaſtingly free:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7905:65"/>
but ſuppoſing, what we often promiſe, and once for
all (by his aſſiſtance) ſhall undoubtedly prove; that
abſolute contingency or <hi>poſsibilities aequipendent</hi>
betwixt many effects, may as truly be the object of
his Eternall decree, as neceſſity in other workes of
nature: I ſee not what appearance of difficulty
can preſent it ſelfe, to ſuch, as beare the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
principles before mentioned <hi>levell</hi> in their
mindes and thoughts; the one, that God <hi>is abſolute
infinite in Being:</hi> the other, that <hi>Hee is abſolutely
perfect,</hi> according to all the branches of <hi>Beeing</hi>
or perfection by us conceiveable; or, more than
all theſe, <hi>Perfection it ſelfe.</hi> Now in things that
have any better portion of Being, wherein they
can truly delight; it is, to our apprehenſion, a degree
or portion of perfection to have an immutable
ſtate of ſuch <hi>Being;</hi> an imperfection, to be ſubject
to alteration or change. But, whether their eſtate
bee mutable or immutable, it is a greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be free in their operations, than to be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to ſome one or few particulars, without any
choice or variety of ſubjects, wherein they may
exerciſe their operative faculties. Bruitiſh, or meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſenſitive creatures have a delectable kinde of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
whoſe continuance they deſire; but without
all variety of choice, or deſire of any better being,
although the beſt being they have be ſubject to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
or change. Men are free in their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but mutable and ſubject to alteration, as well
in their nature, as in their operations, or in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of their freedome; and yet are more excellent
than the viſible Heavens, which are not obnoxious
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7905:66"/>
to alteration or corruption. So that, if the Heavens,
or other incorruptible ſubſtances, had their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of choice, which men have; they would bee
more perfect and excellent creatures than man is:
Or, if man were as immortall as they are, he would
be incomparably more perfect than they can bee,
without the <hi>freedome</hi> of choyce or will, which (as
we now ſuppoſe) is the inſeparable conſequent, or
companion of <hi>reaſon</hi> or <hi>intellectuall knowledge.</hi> But,
though freedome be in it ſelfe a great perfection;
yet to be free to do evil, is a branch of imperfection,
which ſprings from the mutability of the creatures
freedome. And this their mutability, though in it
ſelfe an imperfection, yet is an imperfection neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
praerequired, or praeſuppoſed to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the creature. For no creature can bee truly
perfect by nature, but by the will and pleaſure of
the Creator. And it is his will and pleaſure, to make
them mutable, before they be immutably happy.
But the Creator of all things, in that <hi>He</hi> is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect, even Perfection it ſelfe, is eſſentially im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable,
eſſentially free, and immutably happy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
infinitely good. Yet if we compare theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
amongſt themſelves, <hi>immutability</hi> is the
ground or ſupporter, not the Crowne or perfection
of <hi>freedome,</hi> but freedome rather the perfection of
immutabilitie. Yet were freedome in it ſelfe, how
perfect and complete ſoever it were, no abſolute
perfection, unleſſe it were immutably wedded unto
goodneſſe. Abſolute <hi>immutability</hi> and abſolute
<hi>freedome,</hi> may very well ſtand together, even in our
conceipts; ſo they be rightly joyned, or ſorted. To
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7905:66"/>
be freely immutable, implyes a contradiction; if
not unto the nature of immutability, yet unto the
nature of abſolute perfection, or to our true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of infinite Being. To be freely immutable, is
a branch of imperfection or impotency; which
might put al thoſe perfections, which are contained
in that nature which is no otherwiſe than freely im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mutable,
upon the hazard. If the divine Eſſence
were freely immutable, or free in reſpect of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability,
whether of nature or goodneſſe; it were
poſſible for him to put off theſe two attributes, and
to eloath himſelfe with mutability, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
charged with poſsibility of doing amiſſe.
But to be immutably free, is no point of imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but rather the period of perfection; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
inferres this perfection (which wee call
freedome) to be as unchangeable as the Attributes
of power, of wiſedome, of eternity, or goodneſſe
are. The excellency of his nature and Eſſence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
includes an Eternall liberty or freedome
in the exerciſe of his omnipotent power, and in the
influence or communication of his goodneſſe; Free
it is for him, from Everlaſting to Everlaſting, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotently
to decree as well a mutability in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of ſome things created, as a neceſsity or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability
in the courſe or operation of nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate:
That the courſe of mans life, or the finall
doome awarded to every man (though that muſt
be awarded unto all according to the diverſity of
their courſes,) ſhould be immutable; becauſe they
are foreſet by an immutable omnipotent Decree;
hath no more colour of truth, than to ſay the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7905:67"/>
Creator, muſt needs be <hi>blacke</hi> becauſe he
made the Crowes and Ebony blacke; or white, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he made the Snow and Swannes white; or
greene and yellow, becauſe hee made the Gold
yellow, and the Popinjayes greene: Or that hee
ſhould be of all colours, becauſe the Rainbow is
his creature. Let us beleeve then, that <hi>He</hi> is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
and immutably free, to make creatures of
what kinde it pleaſeth <hi>Him,</hi> that he hath printed
a reſemblance of his freedome in the mutability
of this inferiour world, and hath left a modell of
his immutability in the celeſtiall and immortall
ſubſtances. But the more immutable <hi>Hee</hi> is, the
more irreſiſtible we conceive his power to bee:
or the greater his wiſedome is, the leſſe preventa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the contrivances of it are: the worſe it would
be with ſuch as have to deale with <hi>Him,</hi> were not
his goodneſſe (which is the rule of his Eternall
Decree) immutably as great, as <hi>He</hi> himſelfe, or his
other Attributes are.</p>

(if wee take it in the abſtract, or as it is in God) is
cleare from the attribute laſt handled; that the

onely lookes upon it, with an awfull eye, as Maſters
ſometimes watch their ſervants, whether they goe
the way they are commanded.] But it is a rule in
Divinity, not contradicted, (for ought I know) by
any Chriſtian, that there is altogether as great
need and uſe of <hi>power</hi> and <hi>wiſedome</hi> infinite, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage

the Counſell of his Will, by which hee work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
be Eternall; yet all things are not yet wrought

doth or ſhall befall us? Yes, in this ſenſe we
may, [He doth not now firſt begin to decree the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:]
but in as much as his Decrees have no end, wee
ſhould remember withall, that hee now decrees
them. And it were much ſafer for every man in
particular to looke on Gods Decree concerning
himſelfe, as preſent or coexiſtent to his whole
courſe of life; rather than on it, as it was before
the world, or in <hi>Adam:</hi> for ſo we ſhall thinke of
it, as of an Act paſt and finiſhed, which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced

than the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
even theſe lawes, whiles they were in making,
ſuppoſe that Liberty in their Makers, which they
utterly tooke from them being once enacted.</p>
                     <p>2 Gods Decrees are like theirs, in that they are
in themſelves unalterable: but not in that they
make ſome evills, which befall others, inevitable;
or ſome caſuall inconveniences, unamendable. No
wiſedome, but that which is infinite, and an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Law in it ſelfe, foreſeeing all things that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
can bee, hath juſt warrant to make Decrees for
men everlaſtingly immutable. Too ſtrict oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto Lawes poſitive, or Decrees unalterable,
deprives both Lawgivers and others of their native
Liberty and opportunity of doing good. Were
the <hi>Popes</hi> wiſedome and integrity parallell to that
ſupereminent dignity, which he challengeth; it
were not amiſſe for the body whereof hee is the
lawfull head, if he exerciſed the ſame power over
his Grants or Acts, that hee doth over his breath:
alwayes reſerving a liberty to ſend them forth, or
call them in, to enlarge, contract, or invert them,
according to exigences or occaſions preſent. To
alter his opinion of men, as they doe theirs in
points of uſefull doctrine, or their demeanours in
matters of life; curbing him this yeare, whom hee
priviledged the laſt yeare; now puniſhing where
he lately rewarded; and, ſhortly after, rewarding
where now hee puniſheth; would argue no muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of mind, or unſetled fickle diſpoſition, but
rather immoveable conſtancy; if ſo in all theſe
changes he truly obſerved the rule of Iuſtice, which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7905:69"/>
becauſe it is alwayes one and the ſame, and never
varies, muſt needs afford different meaſures to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
deſerts, and fit contrary diſpoſitions with
contrary recompences. But ſeeing Princes and
Governours, are made of the ſame corrupted mold
with thoſe, whom they governe; oft-times expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by height of place to greater blaſts of mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and inconſtancy, than their inferiours; Publicke
Lawes have beene ſought out by moſt Nations, to
runne like a ſtraight line, betwixt two diſtorted and
crooked ones; and to bee as a firme, or barre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the tumultuous and raging paſſions of
Princes and ſubjects, which every foot (as we ſay)
would fall foule were they not thus <hi>fended</hi> off, one
from the other. Vpon this conſideration many
Conquerours have beene content to ſheathe up a
great part of their illimited power (retayning ſome
competent prerogatives to themſelves and their
ſucceſſors) in publicke Edicts or Lawes, not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ſo unalterable as the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and
<hi>Perſians:</hi> yet leſſe ſubject to change, then Lords
purpoſes, or Princes pleaſures: and every Act wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they paſſe their conſent, reſtraines them of ſome
former liberty, and abates ſomewhat of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
greatneſſe; to whoſe length or continnance
(as <hi>Theopompus</hi> obſerved) much by this meanes, is
added; and it were better to live an hundred yeares,
(as hee ſaid) with ingenuous <hi>health</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi>
then to ſwagger it for twenty, with gyantly force,
or Athleticall conſtitution. And albeit the Law
(which is a common looking glaſſe to direct the
Prince in commanding, and the ſubject in obeying)
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7905:69"/>
may ſometimes lay out authority, and ſometimes
<hi>obedience,</hi> or inflict puniſhment one while, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
rewards another while, in meaſure greater or
leſſe, than a wiſe &amp; juſt Arbitrator, choſen for theſe
particular purpoſes, would allow of; yet hath it
beene thought fitteſt for all parts, rather to brooke
theſe interpoſed miſchiefes, then to be perpetually
ſubject to the former inconveniences of the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;
if the Popes (ſuch as they are) or other Princes
ſhould practiſe according to the Canoniſts rule,
<hi>Papa nunquam ligat ſibi manus, The Pope never tyes
his owne hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3 But the unerrable rule of everlaſting Iuſtice,
who from eternity decrees, whatſoever may bee,
and foreſees whatſoever will be, (becauſe Heaven
and Earth may ſooner paſſe than his words or acts)
<hi>paſſeth</hi> no act to the prejudice of his abſolute and
eternall power of Iuriſdiction. What grant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
ſoever he make, cannot binde the exerciſe of
his everlaſting libertie, for a moment of time: they
laſt no longer than <hi>durante beneplacito:</hi> ſeeing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>Equity,</hi> and onely it, is his everlaſting plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
He ever was, ever is, and ever ſhall be, alike
indifferent and free to recompence every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his preſent wayes. And in that, hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ſearcheth the very hart and ſecret thoughts,
and never ceaſeth to <hi>decree;</hi> his one and indiviſibly
everlaſting decree, without any variety or ſhadow
of change in it ſelfe; fits all the changes, ſeverall
diſpoſitions, and contingent actions of Men and
Angels, as exactly, as if he did conceive, and ſhape
a new Law, for every one of them; and they are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7905:70"/>
conceived and brought forth, as wel befitting them
as the skin doth the body, which nature hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped
in it. No man living (I take it) will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch
any abſolute neceſſity from all Eternity, that
God ſhould inevitably decree the depoſition of
<hi>Elies</hi> line from the Prieſthood, or his two ſonnes
deſtructions by the Philiſtims: For this were to
bereave him of his abſolute and eternall liberty. I
demand then, whether within the compaſs of time,
or in eternity, as praeexiſtent to <hi>Elies</hi> dayes, he paſt
any act that could reſtraine his eternall liberty of
honouring <hi>Elies</hi> families, as well as any others in
their time? To ſay, He did, were impiety; becauſe
it chargeth the Almighty with impotent immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.
What ſhall we ſay then? The depoſition
of his race, the ſudden death and deſtruction of his
ſonnes, were not at all abſolutely neceſſary, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
onely upon ſuppoſed miſcariage of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
meanes and opportunities, which hee had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them for honouring him. And that eternall
decree, <hi>[They that diſhonour mee, them will I diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,]</hi>
as coexiſtent to the full meaſure of this their
tranſgreſſion, by it <hi>ſhapes</hi> their puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>4 To thinke of Gods eternall decree with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
void of danger; we muſt conceive it, as the
immediate <hi>Axis</hi> or Center, upon which every ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
or contingent act revolves: and yet withall,
<hi>that,</hi> wherein the whole <hi>frame</hi> of <hi>ſucceſsion</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency</hi>
is fully comprehended, as an unconſtant
movable Sphere in a farre greater quieſcent, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in ſuch a one (as in the deſcription of Eternity
was imagined) which hath drawne all the ſucceſſive
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7905:70"/>
parts of motion, into an indiviſible unity of durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
permanent. Every part of the larger Sphere
(this, ſwallowing up motion, in vigorous reſt)
ſhould have coexiſtence locall with all and every
part of the next moveable Sphere under it, move it
as ſlowly and ſwiftly, as the latitude of ſucceſſive
motion can admit. Whileſt we thus conceive of
Gods eternall decree, and of his foreknowledge,
(included in our conceipt of it) according to the
Analogy of what we muſt beleeve, concerning the
manner of his <hi>ubiquitary preſence</hi> or <hi>immenſity:</hi>
we ſhall have no occaſion to ſuſpect, that his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
foreknowledge of what we doe, ſhould lay a
neceſſity upon our actions, or take away all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of doing otherwiſe. Rather, we may by this
ſuppoſall, beleeve that as probable, and perceive in
part the manner how it is ſo, which ſhall by Gods
aſſiſtance be demonſtrated to be <hi>de facto</hi> moſt true.
As, firſt, that the Omnipotent doth eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
an abſolute contingency in moſt humane acts:
Secondly, that this eternall act or decree (which
we thus conceive to be throughout the whole ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of time, in every place indiviſibly coexiſtent
to each humane thought or action) doth not only
perpetually ſupport our faculties, but withall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly
inſpire them with contingency in their
choice: that is, it ſo moves them, as they may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
lett or incumbrance, move themſelves more
wayes then one: And yet, even whileſt it ſo moves
them, it withall inevitably effects the proportioned
conſequents, which from everlaſting were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained
to the choices, which we make, be they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7905:71"/>
good or bad; or according to the ſeverall degrees
of good or evill done by us, or of our affections or
deſires to doe them.</p>

<hi>entitative</hi> or <hi>tranſcendentall.</hi> A goodneſſe equally,
alike truly communicated to al things that are, from
his goodneſſe who onely is; but not participated
equally, or according to equality, by all. For as the

Ant, or Worme, be unto them as good as mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is to man: (For even the <hi>Ant or Flye being
vext,</hi> or Wormes trod upon, will bewray their

marvaile that we do not amend what we know to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
in ourſelves; ſeeing errors in every other myſtery
or profeſsion, make the profeſſor aſhamed: Onely ſuch
as erre in matter of life &amp; manners are delighted with
their errours. The Mariner takes no delight to ſee his
veſſell overturned, nor the Phyſitian in ſending his
Patient before his time unto his grave. The Oratour
rejoyceth not when his Clyent is through his errour
overthrowne. Contrariwiſe, every criminous perſon is
delighted with his crime. One ſolaceth himſelfe in
Adultery, and taketh courage to proſecute his deſires
from the very difficulty of accompliſhing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Another
delights in over-reaching others, and in theft; never
diſpleaſed with his faultineſſe, untill it prove unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
All are apt to diſſemble their faults, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
when they fall out fortunately, to reape the fruit of
them, whileſt they ſubduct the faults of them; but, a
good conſcience delighteth to ſet it ſelfe forth and to
have notice taken of it, whereas naughtineſſe is afraid
of darkneſſe it ſelfe. <hi>And as</hi> Epicurus <hi>elegantly ſaith,</hi>
A malefactor may have the hap, but not the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to be undiſcovered. But <hi>(as this Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes)</hi>
what availes it him not to have his naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
diſcovered, without hope or aſſurance that it ſhall
not be diſcovered. <hi>His concluſion is,</hi> Naughtines may
be ſafe, but it can never be ſecure.</p>
                     <p>4 The reaſon why their naughtineſſe an never
be warranted with ſecurity, is; becauſe conſcience
in men moſt vicious, ſtill beares evidence againſt
them, that they live not as ſhee would have them.
For (as <hi>Seneca</hi> in the ſame place well obſerves)
<hi>though bad cuſtome may worke a delight in naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7905:75"/>
yet even in minds drencht in the very dreggs of
filthineſſe, there ſtill remaines a ſenſe of goodneſſe: nor
is it ſo much our want of knowledge, as of our right
eſtimate of what we know to be nought, which maketh
naughtineſſe to be ſo little abhorred.</hi> The minde of
man, in that it is indued with reaſon, hath the rules
of Equity imprinted in it; which it alwaies ſeekes
to inſtampe upon the inferior faculties of the ſoule.
But this divine light of reaſon, hath as ſmall force
to kindle the love of vertue in hearts overgrowne
with ſenſuall deſires, as the Sunne in a miſt, hath to
ſet moiſt ſtuffe on fire. The unſetled affections of
youth, ſomtimes admit the impreſſion of theſe ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
characters, in actuall retired ſpeculations; ſo will
the water take the ſame ſhape from the ſeale, which
the waxe doth, but hold it no longer than the ſeale
is held upon it. The heart, which maturity of years
hath hardened with vaſt deſires, will as hardly bee
wrought into a new forme, as the ſtone, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take any other ſhape, but only by loſing ſome of
its maſſe or ſubſtance; yet if thoſe vaſt deſires be cut
off, or their hopes of ſupplyes from externalls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terecepted;
the ſoule, thus freed, becomes more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable
unto reaſon. Affability, which is as the
ſuperficiall draught of reaſon indeavouring to
ſtampe the heart with reall and ſolid kindneſſe; is as

as the exerciſe of it is not prejudiciall to his belly.
And the leſs his deſires were to ſatiſfie it, the larger
would the extenſion of his bowels of compaſſion
be towards his brethren, or poore neighbours; ſome
drops of <hi>kindneſſe</hi> may diſtill from him in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7905:75"/>
of plentie or ſtore ſufficient to feed both eye
and appetite. But in the daies of ſcarcity, he ſuckes
in cruelty as wine, and feedes upon the needy as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
delicates: Were there no more ſweet morſels
in the market then would ſerve one man; not one
of this crew, but would cut them out of his Fathers
throat, rather than ſuffer his owne weaſand to bee
defeated of its intemperate expectations. Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
then, though <hi>Epicurus</hi> could not ſee ſo
much, is, upon different occaſions, the mother as
well of cruelty and oppreſſion, as of bounty or
pitty.</p>
                     <p>2 From doing to all, as we would be done unto
by any, nothing doth hinder us ſo much (if ought
befides doe hinder us at all) as our conceipted or
opinative want of ſomewhat, which either for the
preſent we doe, or hereafter may ſtand in need off,
for ſatisfying the variety or unconſtant longings of
our unknowne deſires. How well ſoever they may
ſpeake or proteſt, experience ſchooles us; not to

matters, or have one eye alwayes upon their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

they now make ſhal not croſſe their opportunities,
when matters come to tryall. But if wee know a

that eſtate wherein his conſtant reſolution
hath pitcht content, one otherwiſe of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
deſires, and compoſed affections, able to

before anothers. For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> internall moderation
mixt with outward competency, is the onely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter
of true conſtancy. Yet cannot this mixture,
in any created Eſſence bee ſo firme or permanent,
but poſſibilities or opportunities of ſatisfying ſome
internall latent capacities, by externall proffers,
may diſſolve it. For finite exiſtence hath poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of nonexiſtence to controll it, and poſſibility of
nonexiſtence includes poſſibility of being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than it is. And therefore it is never impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to finite being either to loſe it ſelfe, or change
his properties. A more particular root of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency,
or unconſtancy in reaſonable creatures or
intelligent, is the infinite capacity of their conceits
or deſires; within whoſe compaſſe their finite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may become <hi>excentricke</hi> and <hi>irregular,</hi> as it
were a ſtarre fixed in too wide a ſphere. The deſires
of collapſed <hi>Angells,</hi> were once tuned by their
Creator in as perfect harmony as any creatures
could be: They had all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petency that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
whether of internall faculties, or of objects to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Howbeit, whilſt the chiefe Ringleader
of this rebellious Rout, ſought to ſatisfie this <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi>
of his deſire; not by participation of his joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
preſence, who was infinitely good; but by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
that greatneſſe and Majeſty infinite, which
he was enabled to conceive, but whereof his nature
was more uncaple than a whirry of an <hi>Argoes-eyes</hi>
ſaile; his capacities did overcope. And his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7905:76"/>
longings, while he was in travell of this
prodigious birth, hath imprinted that vgly ſhape
upon him, which now he beares. Hee is become
the monſtrous brood of his owne monſtrous and
deformed deſires; his mouth opening too wide to
ſwallow that which is incomprehenſible, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſince be ſhut; his ravenous appetite cannot bee
ſatisfied. Like the grave he feedes on rottenneſſe,
and by continuall gnawing and devouring that
which cannot ſatiate, he continually encreaſeth his
unquenchable hunger. His will is wedded unto
miſchiefe, and affecteth nothing but that which is
by nature evill; &amp; amongſt evills that moſt greedily
and unceſſantly, which is moſt contrary to <hi>infinite
goodneſs.</hi> The firſt man by this monſters impulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
reaching too high for that which hee could
not compaſſe, did put himſelfe from off the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Center of his reſt and revolutions; and
ſince continueth irregular and unconſtant in all
his motions, thoughts, and actions. In him, in
our ſelves, in the whole nature (beſides that part
which hath firme union with the infinite Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence)
wee finde the Maxime infallibly verified,
<hi>Mota facilius moventur.</hi> By our firſt Parents
needleſſe yeelding to one temptation, wee are not
able to reſiſt any; Our reſolutions to follow that
which wee acknowledge to bee good, or our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerence
unto that infinite goodneſs, from which
he divorced his will; can neuer in this life bee ſo
firme and ſtrong, but the allurements to contrary
evills, may bee ſo great or ſo cunningly propoſed
by the great Tempter, that, without eſpeciall grace
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7905:77"/>
we cannot reſiſt their attractions. Since our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
harmonie betwixt ſoule and body; and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
correſpondency of each faculty with other,
was diſſolved, no externalls can conſort with us.
Iuſt competency ſeemes too little, all of us being
as eaſily led by abundance, as driven by want, to
doe evill. And, which is worſt of all, our earneſt
attempts to doe that which is good and right,
drawes iniquity after them; and whiles wee take
too haſtie, or unweildy ayme at our owne welfare,
others harmes fall under our levell.</p>
                     <p>6 That which moſt improoveth the force
of temptations, whether ſuggeſted by want or
indigence, or by other occaſions or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities;
is the inequalitie, partly of our naturall
propenſions, partly of meanes which miniſter
their ſeverall contentments or annoyances.
Wealth, in ſome men, gets the ſtart of Wit, and
overſwayes them (otherwiſe not much miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined)
unto ſuch vanities, as uſually are neither
bredd nor nurſed, but by abundance. Others
wits over-reach their revenues; and imboldens
them to ſtretch their projects or inventions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the rules of right and equity. Some
mens bodies overgrow their ſoules; and theſe
are eaſily impelled to act any boyſterous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe:
Others being impotent of bodie,
ſtrive ſo much the more to furniſh their mindes
with ſubtill inventions or commodious expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience:
and by making too much uſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Proverbe, <hi>[Hee that is weake had need to
bee wilie,]</hi> are eaſily tempted to practiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7905:77"/>
policie, with delight; as the onely preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
againſt contempt, or as an inſtrument of
revenge upon ſuch as they hate or feare. And
it would goe much againſt the courſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
experience, if that wilineſſe which hath
weakneſſe for its foundation, ſhould not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
enforced to cover or ſhelter it ſelfe with
craft and fraud. To love our owne wills, is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
naturall unto all. And wee love them
the better, at leaſt more ſtrongly, when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them ſet on that which in it ſelfe is good.
Whence it is that our deſires of doing many things
which are good and commendable, often draw
us to uſe meanes not ſo commendable, for their
accompliſhment. Many, out of an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
good will unto the poore, thinke it no robbery
to cozen the rich; or to diſpenſe with publike
Lawes, for gratifying ſome private friend, whoſe
welfare in conſcience they are bound to tender.
Vnto theſe, and many like enormities, the infinite
Capacity of finite Exiſtence gave firſt poſſibility
of being, and the inequality of our internall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions,
which can never fitly match or hold juſt
proportion with externall occurrences, gives life
and improvement.</p>
                     <p>7 But in the incomprehenſible Sphere, which
hath Vbiquity for its Center, and Omnipotency
for its <hi>Axis;</hi> whoſe numberleſſe <hi>lines</hi> are all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
perfections, <hi>meaſureleſſe;</hi> there is no place
for exorbitancie. One branch of <hi>Being,</hi> cannot
miſ-ſway or over-toppe another; all being ſo
great and firme, as none can bee greater or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7905:78"/>
firmer; being not united, but poſſeſſed in ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
unity, as prevents all poſſibility of diſtraction
or diviſion. Shall wee ſay then, hee poſſeſſeth all
things that poſſibly he can deſire to have? Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he alwayes infinitely is, without all poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of not being, whatſoever poſſibly can be. And
though being infinite, he can doe all things; yet can
he not deſire to perfect himſelfe, or to be greater or
better than he is. In that he neither can feare the
impayrement, nor wiſh the inlargement of his own
eſtate; all outward imployments of his power are
for the good of his creatures. His will to have
them when they were not, was but the influence or
working of his eſſentiall goodneſſe; which is ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
ſufficient to his infinite <hi>being,</hi> that the
overflowing of it is the fountaine of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
which are good. Nothing beſides him could
poſſibly have beene, unleſſe he were in power and
in <hi>being,</hi> infinite. And unleſſe his infinite <hi>being</hi> had
beene infinitely good, nothing beſides him, ſhould
actually have beene, or beene indowed with ſuch
<hi>being,</hi> as all things that actually are, have from him.
The proper <hi>being</hi> of every thing, which actually is,
or at leaſt the continuance or amendment of ſuch
<hi>being,</hi> is infinitely deſired by all, as being the ſtamp
or impreſſion of his infinite goodneſſe, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
truly, though not equally, or in the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
communicated to all things that are. The
Entity of every thing is good to it ſelfe, and moſt
deſired.</p>
                     <p>8 And though theſe firſt aſſurances of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and loving kindneſſe, be uſually requited on
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7905:78"/>
mans part with unkindneſſe and deſpight: yet the
greatneſſe of his Majeſty, never ſwayes him to ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
revenge. Quite contrary to the corrupt nature
of man, (whoſe <hi>goodneſſe</hi> uſually is ill-thriven by
his over-growing <hi>greatnes:)</hi> the unreſiſtible ſtrength
of his Almighty power, is the unmovable pillar of
moderation and mercifull forbearance. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
potency of man being but finite, the higher it
growes, the apter it is to be overtopt with jealous
impotency. The greateſt Monarch that is, may be
prevented by others, (of whoſe power he is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous)
in the exerciſe of his power or authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him; unleſſe he carefully watch his time, and fit
ſeaſons, or take opportunity when it is offered, for
accompliſhing his projects. But of God, ſaith the
Wiſeman, <hi>Wiſd. 12. 18. Thou muſtring thy power
judgeſt with equity, and ordereſt, or governeſt us with
great favour; for thou maiſt uſe power when thou wilt.
And his will is to uſe it, when men will not beleeve that
he is of full power to doe what hee will;</hi> as the ſame
Wiſeman expreſſeth, <hi>verſ. 17.</hi> But more full unto
our preſent purpoſe, are the ſayings of the ſame
Wiſeman, <hi>verſ. 15, 16. For ſo much then as thou art
righteous thy ſelfe, thou ordereſt all things righteouſly;
thinking it not agreeable with thy power to condemne
him that hath not deſerved to be puniſhed. For thy
power is the beginning of righteouſneſſe, and becauſe
thou art the Lord of all, it maketh thee to be gracious
to all.</hi> Though this Author be not, yet this paſſage
in him, is canonicall, and fully conſonant to Gods
owne words to <hi>Ionah,</hi> Chap. 4. 10, 11. <hi>Then ſaid the
Lord, thou haſt had pitie on the Gourd, for the which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7905:79"/>
thou haſt not labored, neither madeſt it to grow, which
came up in a night, and periſhed in a night: And
ſhould not I ſpare Nineveh that great City, wherein
are more than ſixſcore thouſand perſons, that cannot

oppreſſe their tenants: but what Lord would ſpoile
his proper inheritance, whereto no other can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled;
or eate out the heart of that ground which
hee cannot alienate or demiſe? What Architect
would deface his owne worke, unleſſe the image of
his unskilfulneſſe (whereof the Creator cannot bee
impeached) be ſo apparant in it, as he cannot but
bluſh to behold it? Or who would leave a goodly
foundation bare or naked, unleſſe he be unable to
reare it up without injuſtice? Now ſeeing the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative
Good of proper <hi>being,</hi> is the <hi>foundation</hi> of
that true happineſſe which flowes from more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
participation of Gods preſence; whereſoever
he hath laid the one, it is to all that rightly conſider
his <hi>Wiſedome, Truth,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> an aſſured
pledge of his will and pleaſure to finiſh it with the
other. As his nature is immutable, ſo are his gifts
without repentance. The current of his joyfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence,
can admit no intermiſſion, much leſſe
admixture of any evill. Sorrow, woe, and miſery,
muſt ſeeke ſome other Originall; they have no hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
vent, or ſecret iſſue from the Ocean of Ioy and
Happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>9 As the fountaine of bodily light cannot ſend

the infinite Ocean of true felicity, ſend forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
influence, but ſuch as is apt to cheriſh the ſeeds
of joy and happineſſe; wherewith every creature
capable of them, was ſowne in its firſt creation.
And, as it is the property of light propagated or
diffuſed from the Sunne, to make ſuch bodies as are
capable of its penetration (as Glaſſes, Chryſtall,
Pearle, &amp;c.) ſecondary fountains of light to others:
ſo doth the influence of divine goodneſſe, inſpire
all that are conformable to his will, with deſire of
doing to others as he hath done to them; that is, of
being ſecondary authors or inſtruments of good to
all. But ſuch as wilfully ſtrive againſt the ſtreame of
his over-flowing goodneſſe, or boyſterouſly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terblaſt
the ſweet and placide ſpirations of celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
influence, become creators of their owne woe,
and raiſe unto themſelves thoſe ſtormes wherein
they periſh. Yet ſo eſſentiall it is unto this infinite
Fountaine of goodneſſe, however provoked, to
ſend forth onely ſtreames of life; and ſuch is the
vertue of the ſtreames which iſſue from him, that
as well the evill and miſeries which miſcreants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
unto themſelves, as their miſchievous intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards others, infallibly occaſion increaſe of
joy and happineſſe unto all that give free paſſage
unto their current. And this current of life, which

that the decrees of great Monarchs, who are a
kinde of Gods on earth, muſt bee reputed Oracles
of Iuſtice, and their practices may not bee reputed
unjuſt either by themſelves, or by others. But this
ſophiſticall inverſion of theſe Ancients meaning,
was too palpable to pleaſe either the wiſer or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter
ſort of Heathen, though living in thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt

<hi>Iupiter,</hi> as of a great King, ſubject to rage and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7905:81"/>

he needes no ſweet-tongued conſort to moderate

                     <p>2 To derogate ought from his power, who is

but becauſe holines doth ſo rule his power, and
moderate his will, that the one cannot enjoyne, or
the other exact any thing not moſt conſonant to
the eternall or abſtract patternes of equity. His will
revealed doth ſufficiently warrant all our actions,
becauſe we know, that he wils nothing but what is
juſt and good; but this no way hindereth, but rather
ſuppoſeth Iuſtice and Goodneſſe to be more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
objects of his will, than they are of ours. And
therefore when it is ſaid [Things are good becauſe
God wils them] this <hi>illative</hi> infers only the cauſe of

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7905:81"/>
Gods will revealed commends it for ſuch.</hi> But his will
revealed commends it for ſuch, becauſe it was in it
nature good; for unleſſe ſuch it had bin, he had not
willed it. Theſe principles though unqueſtionable
to ſuch as fetch their Divinity from the Fountaine,
will perhaps in the judgement of others that never
taſte it but in trenches, be liable to theſe exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
                     <p>3 If the goodneſſe of every thing preſuppoſe its
being, &amp; nothing can be without Gods wil, what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
be good (we ſpeake in order of nature, not of time)
before God wills it? Of being or goodneſſe actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
exiſtent in any creature, it is moſt true, neither
can be without ſome precedent Act of Gods will.
But as there is a <hi>logicall poſsibility</hi> preſuppoſed to
the working of the Almighty power: ſo is there a
goodneſſe <hi>objective</hi> precedent in order of nature, to
the Act or exerciſe of his will. And unto ſome
things conſidered as <hi>logically poſsible;</hi> this <hi>goodneſſe
objective</hi> is ſo eſſentially annexed; that if it bee his
will to give them actuall being, they muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
be actually good; nor can hee that can doe all
things, will their contraries. Hee might, had it
pleaſed him, have taken life and exiſtence from all
mankind, when he preſerved <hi>Noah</hi> and his Familie.
But to reſerve them men, and no reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
was no object of power omnipotent; much
leſſe doth his omnipotency enable him to worke
ought contradictory to his owne <hi>nature</hi> or eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

diſeaſe. And our nature being corrupted, whets
our appetites to ſuch things as are agreeable to the
praedominant corruption wherewith it is tainted,
not to the purity wherein it was created. To will
onely that which is conſonant to his nature, is ſo
much more eſſentiall to God, than unto us, by how
much his nature is more ſimple than ours is. And
ſeeing it is eſſentiall purity, altogether uncapable
of corruption, his will cannot pitch but on that
which is pure and holy. Whence the prime rule of
all goodneſſe, <hi>without himſelfe,</hi> is conſonancy to
his eſſentiall purity and Iuſtice. <hi>For as much as
thou art righteous thy ſelfe thou ordereſt all things
righteouſly, thinking it not agreeable to thy power to

without the prerogative of omnipotency; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ratified by any Parliament of the Trinitie

theſe and the like, are evill; not in us onely, to whom
they are forbidden; but ſo evill in themſelves, that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7905:82"/>
the Almighty could not but forbid and condemne
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as profeſt enemies to his moſt ſacred Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>4 To ſquare great mens actions to the dictates
of reaſon or nature, given in their good dayes, or
to bring their wills within compaſſe of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Law; ſeemes greater violence, than if we
ſhould ſeeke to faſhion their bodies by handſome
well proportioned garments, but much too ſtrait.
And yet we ſee by daily experience, that ſuch as are
moſt impatient of <hi>regulation</hi> or reſtraint, are moſt
importunate to have their owne unruly wills, the
rules of their inferiours minds and conſciences. To
doe otherwiſe than they would have them, though
they alleage the dictates both of reaſon and Gods
word, will admit no appeale from the cenſure of
<hi>peeviſhneſſe</hi> or perverſeneſſe. But for them to ſet
conſtant patternes of that morality or good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
whoſe defects in inferiours they either pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
or make advantage of; is reputed a kinde of
<hi>Pedantiſme,</hi> or <hi>Mechanicall</hi> ſervitude. To requeſt
ſuch performances, ſeemes as harſh, as if we ſhould
intreat them to ſet us copies, or ſongs, or take pains
in teaching us ſome honeſt trade. And ſeeing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
are ſecretly blinded with this pride of heart;
which breakes forth more violently in ſuperiours;
moſt of both rankes, meaſure Gods will by their
owne. But if wee will condemne this impatience
of reſtraint, as a fault in our ſelves, we muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
acquit the Almighty from the like. The infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
greatneſſe of his Majeſty, cannot wreſt his
moſt holy will from ſtrict obſervance of ſuch rules
of <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> as he ſets us to follow. That inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7905:83"/>
wherewith our firſt nature was cloathed,
was but the Image of his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> And hee that
requires us <hi>to be holy, as He is holy, or perfect as our
Heavenly Father is perfect;</hi> exacts not of us, that wee
ſhould be as holy and perfect as <hi>Hee</hi> is, in any point
of his imitable perfections. Every part of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
which becommeth Saints, is in the beſt of
them, but as the <hi>materiall</hi> forme in an houſe built of
untowardly ſtuffe, by unskilfull hands: but in <hi>Him,</hi>
according to the exacteſt Mathematicall or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeall
forme, that the cunningeſt Architect hath in
his head. The beſt examples of goodneſſe, we can
conceive, are but as dead pictures of thoſe <hi>everli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
ones, which <hi>He</hi> expreſſeth in his workes. All
his decrees concerning man, are not in themſelves
onely, but to mans eyes that looke not on them a
ſquint, ſo ſtraight and juſt, that hee will referre the
tryall unto the deliberate and ſober thoughts of his
Enemies. <hi>Is not my way equall? Are not your waies
unequall? Ezek. 18. 25.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5 This may inſtruct us, that thoſe patternes of
Holineſſe or perfections which wee are bound to
imitate in <hi>Him,</hi> are not to be taken from his bare
Commandement, or revelation of his will, but
from the objects of his will revealed, or from the
eternall practices which hee hath exhibited; as ſo
many expreſſe or manifeſt proofes, that his will is
alwayes Holy and Iuſt: albeit wee cannot alwaies
ſo expreſſely diſcerne the manner how it is juſt and
holy in ſome particular Commandements; but
muſt implicitely beleeve it to bee ſuch in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is ſo eminently and apparantly holy and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7905:83"/>
juſt in thoſe perfections, whereof our generall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are the imperfect repreſentations. Of all his
morall commandements, not one there is, whoſe
ſincere practiſe doth not in part make vs truely like
him; &amp; we are bound to be conformable to his will
revealed, that we may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to his <hi>nature;</hi>
without conformity wherevnto, we cannot parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
of his happineſſe; For, Happineſſe is the

But out of all queſtion, he that bids us unfaignedly
bleſſe our perſecutors, doth unfaignedly tender his
bleſſings to ſuch as perſecute <hi>Him</hi> in his members.
He that ſeriouſly exhorts us to bee mercifull and
kind to all, ſheweth kindneſſe to the moſt unkinde.
That charity which hee hath injoyned every man
towards all (his greateſt enemies not excepted)
though we conſider it in the moſt charitably mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Martyrs, in whoſe death it ſeemed to ſhine, were
but as weake ſparkles, or vaniſhing ſmoak, of thoſe
infinite and eternall flames of love, which burſt out
in him toward ſuch, as have deſerved worſe at his
hands, than any Tyrant of his tormented ſervants.
That truth and fidelity, which he exacts of us, the
faithfulneſſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe; is but a little
mappe, or narrow ſurface of that infinite <hi>ſoliditie</hi> of
<hi>truth,</hi> whereon his promiſes are <hi>founded.</hi> Betweene
the chaſtity and temperance of pureſt virgins, and
his eternall purity, there is the like true correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7905:84"/>
but not ſo great, as there is betwixt the
droſs and corpulency, and the refined or ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſpirits of the ſame bodies. Or could that rule
which is the fulfilling of the whole Law &amp; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<hi>Doe unto every man as we would be done unto;</hi>
be exactly fulfilled by us; it would be but a ſlender,
though a true modell or repreſentation of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
equity. <hi>He that honoureth me, him will I honor.</hi>
For in this, and the like, he expects no more than
the inward affection of mortall hearts, or prayſes of
man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, being ready
out of his goodneſſe, to recompence theſe ſilly
ſervices, with glory, love and happineſs everlaſting.
But doth he intend thus well to all, or deſtruction
unto ſome, as it is a <hi>meanes</hi> of bliſſe to thoſe whom
he loves? If ſo he did, we might be exempt from
that negative precept, of not doing evill that good
might enſue. For the only reaſon why we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
not to doe ſo, is becauſe in ſo doing we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unlike our heavenly Father, and <hi>not be perfect</hi>
as he <hi>is perfect.</hi> But as he turnes the voluntary evils
of ſome, to the good of others; ſo may wee, and
ought to conſecrate ſuch forfeitures, as legally fall
into our hands to pious uſes; or better the ſtates of
ſuch as tender publike welfare, by others deſerved
harmes.</p>
                     <p>6 Be it then granted, (which is the root of all
objections againſt theſe reſolutions) that Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
muſt as well appeare in the puniſhment of the
Reprobate, as in the beatifying of the Elect; the
conſequence will bee quite contrary to that which
their objections would hence inferre; For, if the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7905:84"/>
foundation of Gods glory, bee as ſure in the one
caſe, as in the other; the manner of his dealing
with both muſt be alike perfect, and alike behove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for us to follow. <hi>Sine bonitate</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca)
nulla majeſtas, Goodneſſe is the foundation of glory.</hi>
Now, were it true, that he did intend evill to ſome,
before they had committed any (though not as
evill to them, but as a meanes of others good) or
abſolutely ordained them to eternall inevitable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
for the advancement of his owne glory; wee
ſhould not ſinne, but rather imitate the perfection
of our heavenly Father, in robbing <hi>Iudas</hi> to pay
<hi>Peter,</hi> or in feeding the hungry, ſuch eſpecially as
be of the houſhold of Faith, with the ſpoiles of
ungodly rich men, or unbeleevers. More war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
it were to gueſſe at the perfection of his
Iuſtice towards the wicked, and of his bounty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the godly, by the commendable ſhadow or
imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it in earthly gods. To procure the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good without intention of harme to any, and
with admiſſion of as few private miſchiefes as may
be, is the chiefe praiſe of great States-men. And it
is the glory of Princes, to encourage all men unto
vertuous courſes by good example, gratious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations,
and unpartiall diſtribution of publike
honors or commodities: and yet withall to inflict
diſgrace upon haughty contemners of thoſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
allurements; and to bee ſterne in execution of
Iuſtice (without fauour) upon notorious tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors
of wholeſome Lawes. Yet not to uſe
ſeverity without ſorrow, nor draw blood but
by way of medicine; for preſerving of their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7905:85"/>
Crownes and dignities, for maintenance of publike
peace, or for preventing the like diſeaſes in other
particular members of the ſame body. Magiſtrates
that would mind theſe matters, more than rayſing
themſelves, their friends, or poſterity, more than
life it ſelfe, which they owe unto their Countrey;
ſhould exhibite us a true model, though (God wot)
but a ſlender one of our heavenly Fathers wiſdome
and loving kindneſſe: firſt in drawing men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
by gratious promiſes, and unfaigned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſalls
of ineſtimable rewards for their ſervice:
Secondly, in making the wicked and obſtinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers
of his infinite goodneſſe, ſerve to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of his endleſſe glory, and confirmation of
thoſe that love him in the immortal ſtate of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Theſe prints of his Fatherly care and Iuſtice,
are yet freſh to bee ſeene in his proceedings with
ungratious <hi>Cain. And the Lord ſaid unto Cain, why
art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
if thou doe well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? and if thou
doſt not well, ſinne lyeth at the doore: And unto thee

to doe well, is the naturall off-ſpring of
unnaturalneſſe. It beares no ſhadow of that juſtice

reaſonable conceipt, than for hate or harmefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions

is love: yea, love is his Eſſence as Creator.</hi> In that he

Hence ſaith the Wiſeman, of him that is wiſeſt of
all, of him that can neither deceive nor be deceived:
<hi>He hateth nothing that he hath made.</hi> For even their
being, and that goodneſſe which accompanies it, is
an undoubted pledge of his love. If to bleſſe God
the maker, and to curſe men which are made after
his ſimilitude, argue (in the Apoſtles ſuppoſall) a
diſſolution of that internall harmony, which ſhould
be in the humane nature: to hate ſome, and love o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of his beſt creatures, all being made after his
owne image; would neceſſarily infer a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
in the indiviſible Eſſence, beſides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
which it implyes to infinite goodnes. To
love the workes of his owne hands, is more eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to him, that made all things out of meere love,
than it is unto the fire to burn matter combuſtible:
and if his love be, as he is, truly infinite, it muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to all, ſeeing all are leſſe than infinite.</p>
                     <p>2 Love, were it perfect in us, would perfectly
fulfill Gods Law, and make up a compleate body
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7905:86"/>
or <hi>Syſtem</hi> of morall goodnes. Now the moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
perfection of that love, whereof the humane
nature (though uncorrupted) could bee capable,
would be but an imperfect ſhadow of our heavenly
Fathers moſt perfect love; which hath the ſame
proportion to his goodneſſe, that love in us (were
it as perfect as it poſſibly might bee) ſhould have to
our morall goodneſſe. That is, it is his compleat
communicative goodnes. And though theſe two in
him bee rather different names, than divers attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
yet wee love his goodnes better, whiles it is
attired with the name of Love. For, of men that doe
us equall good turnes, we love them beſt, whom we
conceive to love us moſt: and loving kindneſſe
ſeemes good and lovely, even in the eyes of ſuch as
reape no profit from it, beſides the ſight of it. The
very exerciſe of it in others, excites our weake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to the like: and our inclinations moved,
ſtir up a ſpeculative aſſent or ſecret verdict of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
to approve that truth which wee cannot
follow in the practice: <hi>Beatius eſt dare, quam acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere:
It is a more bleſſed thing to give, than to receive.</hi>
No man meaſureth that which wee call a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(as of men ſome are better natured than others)
either by the means it hath to benefit, or by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
beſtowed; but by the fervency of unfaigned
good will, and hearty deſires of doing good to all.
This is that wherein (eſpecially when it is holpen by
grace) we moſt reſemble the divine nature, which is
infinitely better than the humane nature (though ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
at the beſt) not only in reſpect of his ability to do
good, but of his good wil to do the beſt that may be.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7905:87"/>
And this his good will exceeds ours, not intenſively
only, but extenſively. For we are bound to imitate
him as well in the extenſion of our unfaigned good
will towards all, as in the fervency of our deſires to
do the beſt good we can to ſome, becauſe his loving
kindnes to man is both waies infinitly perfect, <hi>Thus
ſaith the Lord, Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
nor the ſtrong man glory in his ſtrength, neither
the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth,
glory in this, that he underſtandeth, and knoweth
me; that I am the Lord which exerciſe loving kindnes,
judgement, and righteouſneſſe in the earth: for in
theſe things I delight, ſaith the Lord. Ier. 9. 23, 24.</hi>
The firſt then &amp; moſt native iſſue of infinite <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
is the exerciſe of <hi>bounty</hi> or loving kindneſſe,
which floweth from it, without matter or motive
to incite it. This is that which gave <hi>being,</hi> and with
being, ſome portion of goodneſſe unto all things
that are; it alters the <hi>name,</hi> but not the <hi>nature</hi> in the
current. To prevent others with good turnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can expect or deſerve them, is the higheſt
point of bounty, whereto the ability of man can
reach. But God gave vs that we moſt deſire, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>being,</hi> with the appurtenances, before we could
deſire it; for it is the foundation of all deſire. From
Bounty or loving kindneſſe, or from that Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
whence they ſpring, Mercy and Compaſſion
differ only in the extrinſecall denomination taken
from different objects. <hi>Compaſsion</hi> is good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others, provoked from notice of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
and <hi>Mercy</hi> is but an exceſſe of <hi>Bounty,</hi> not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged
from ill deſervers, in diſtreſſe; ſo long as
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7905:87"/>
the exerciſe of it breedes no harme to ſuch as are
more capable of bountifull love and favour. This
incompoſſibility betweene the exerciſe of Mercy
and bounty towards particulars ill deſerving, and
the preſervation of common good, occaſioneth the
interpoſition of Iuſtice punitive; whoſe exerciſe is
in a ſort, unnaturall to the Father of mercy. <hi>For he
doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of
men. Lamen. 3. 33.</hi> Nothing in good men can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
it towards offenders, but the good of others
deſerving either better or not ſo ill, which might
grow worſe by evill doers impunity. To take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in the paine or torture of notorious malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
is a note of inhumanity: their juſt puniſhment
is onely ſo farre juſtly pleaſant, as it procures either
our owne, or others welfare; or avoydance of thoſe
grievances, which they more juſtly ſuffer, than wee
or others of the ſame ſocietie, ſhould doe. The
more kind and loving men by nature are, the more
unwilling they are to puniſh, unleſſe it be for theſe
reſpects. How greatly then doth it goe againſt his
nature, who is loving kindneſſe it ſelfe, to puniſh
the workes of his owne hands; <hi>Man</hi> eſpecially, who
is more deare unto him, than any child can be unto
his Father, for hee is the Father of all mankind?
<hi>For it is he that made us, and not we our ſelves;</hi> not
thoſe whom we call Fathers of our fleſh, for even
they likewiſe were made by <hi>Him.</hi> Hence he ſaith,
<hi>Call no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Father on earth, for one is your Father</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
                        <hi>is in Heaven, Mat. 23. ver. 9.</hi> Is the title his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
more than the realty anſwering to it? Is he
more willing to bee called the onely Father of all
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7905:88"/>
the ſonnes of men, than to doe the kinde office of a
Father to them? <hi>No, like as a Father pittieth his
owne children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that feare
him, For he knoweth our frame, he remembreth we are
but duſt. Pſal. 103. 13, 14.</hi> It ſeemes this Pſalmiſt
either was or had a moſt kinde and loving Father,
and hence illuſtrates the kindneſſe of his Heauenly
Father, by the beſt modell of kindneſſe which hee
knew. But if God truly be a father of all mankind,
he certainly exceeds all other fathers as farre in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
kindneſſe, as hee doth men in any branch of
goodneſſe or perfection. This is the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of our Faith, layd by his onely Sonne:

love children when they have them; but love to

whatſoever can bee deſired) out of the abundance
of his free bounty and meere loving kindneſſe, did

by wrong uſe of reaſon (as many mothers by

Finally, as he gives much more to our being, than
our earthly Parents, whom we ſuppoſe to give us
being; ſo all the ſweet fruits or comforts of love,
whether of fathers and mothers towards their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
of husbands towards their wives, or of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to brethren, ſiſters to ſiſters, or one friend to
another (their ſinfulneſſe onely excepted) are
but diſtillations or infuſions of his infinite love to
our nature. To witneſſe this truth unto us, the ſon
of God was made both father, and brother and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to our nature, &amp;c. Every reference or kinde
office, whereof reaſonable creatures are mutually
capable, every other creature (though voyd of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſo not voyd of love and naturall affection) may
expreſſe ſome part of our heavenly Fathers loving
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7905:89"/>
kindneſſe: but the love of all, though infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
in every particular, and afterwards made
up in one, could no way equalize his love towards
every particular ſoule created by him. Feare of
death or other danger, hath ſuch joynt intereſt
with love, (as well in the heart of man, as in other
creatures) that, albeit they would doe more for
their yong ones than they doe, if they could, yet
they doe not uſually ſo much as they might: not
ſo much for their model of wit or ſtrength, as God
for his part though infinite in wiſedome &amp; power
doth for the ſonnes of men. He that feareth none,
but is feared of al, he that needs no Counſellor, but
hath the heart of Prince and Counſellor in his
hand, makes proteſtation in his ſerious griefe, that
he hath done all for his unfruitfull vineyard that he
could, as much as poſſibly could be done for it. Or,
if his ſerious proteſtations cannot deſerve credit
with deceitfull man, his ſolemne oath is witneſſe
of greater love than hath beene mentioned, of
greater than the heart of man is able to conceive,
even towards ſuch as all their life time have hated
Him. <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, I will not the death

it be excepted, that albeit this prayer be conceived
in termes <hi>formally</hi> univerſall, yet is the univerſall
<hi>forme</hi> of it to be no further extended, than its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
matter or ſubject; and that (as will be alleaged)
is the myſticall live-body of Chriſt, whoſe extent,
or the number of whoſe members, is to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne:
the third and laſt prayer will clearely
quit this exception, and free both the former pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
from theſe or the like reſtrictions. For in
the laſt prayer wee are taught to pray for all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one which are out of the Church, that they
may bee brought into the Church, and bee made
partakers with us of Gods mercy, and the common
ſalvation. <hi>Mercifull God, who haſt made all men, and
hateſt nothing that thou haſt made, nor wouldeſt the
death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and live: have mercy upon all Iewes, Turkes, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidells,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7905:92"/>
and heretiques, and take from them all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
hardneſſe of heart; and contempt of thy Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And ſo fetch them home, bleſſed Lord, to thy flocke,
that they may bee ſaved among the remnant of the
true Iſraelites, and be made one fold, under one ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> If God therefore will
not the death of any Iew, Turke or Infidell, becauſe
of nothing hee made them men: wee may ſafely
conclude that he willeth not the death of any, but
the life of all, whom of men or infidells, hee hath
made Chriſtians; to whom he hath vouchſafed the
ordinary meanes of ſalvation, and daily invites, by
his meſſengers, to imbrace them. Hee which made
all things without invitation, out of meere love,
made nothing hatefull; nor is it poſſible that the
unerring fountaine of truth and love, ſhould caſt
his diſlike, much leſſe fix his hatred upon any thing
that was not firſt in it nature odious. Nothing can
make the creature hatefull or odious to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
beſides its hatred or enmity of that love, by
which it was created, and by which <hi>he</hi> ſought the
reſtauration of it when it was loſt. Nor is it every
degree of mans hatred or enmity unto God, but a
full meaſure of it, which utterly exempts man from
his love; as that reverend<note n="*" place="margin">Hooper in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. See Parag. 8 of this chapter.</note> Biſhop and glorious
Martyr, one of the firſt Reformers of the Religion
profeſt in this Land, obſerves.</p>
                     <p>3 If with theſe authorized devotions we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the doctrine of our Church in the publike ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme,
what can bee more cleare, then that as
God the Father doth love all mankind, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
ſo the Sonne of God did redeeme not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7905:92"/>
ſome onely of all ſorts, but all mankind univerſally
taken: Firſt wee are taught <hi>to beleve in God the
Father who made us and all the world.</hi> Now, if the
Church our mother have in the former prayers
truly taught us, that God hateth nothing which
he hath made; this will bring forth another truth:
<hi>viz.</hi> That either there be ſome men which are not
of Gods making; or elſe that hee hateth no man
(not <hi>Eſau)</hi> as he is a man, but as a ſinner, but as an
enemy or contemner of his goodneſſe. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
to this branch or corollary of this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
truth, wee are in the ſame Catechiſme, in the
very next place taught to beleeve in God the Son
who hath redeemed us and all mankind. And if all
mankind were redeemed by him, than all of this
kind were unfeignedly loved; none were hated by
him. And though in the ſame place, wee are taught
to beleeve in the holy Ghoſt as in the ſanctifier of
all that are ſanctified, yet this wee are taught with
this caveat, that he doth ſanctifie al the elect people
of God, not all mankind. All then are not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by God the holy Ghoſt, which are redeemed
by God the Sonne, nor doth God the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
all his ſpirituall bleſſings upon all whom hee
doth unfeignedly love, or on whom hee hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
the bleſſing of Baptiſme as the ſeale or
pledge of their redemption. All theſe inferences
are ſo cleere, that the conſideration of them makes
us doubt, whether ſuch amongſt us, as teach the
contrary to any of theſe, have at any time ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
unto the booke of Common prayers, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they had read it before they did ſubſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7905:93"/>
it or contradict it. That this univerſall extent of
Gods love, and of the redemption wrought by
Chriſt, is a fundamentall principle, whereon many
ſerious and fruitfull exhortations in the booke of
Homilies are immediately grounded, ſhall (by
Gods aſſiſtance) appeare in the Article concerning
<hi>Chriſt.</hi> For a concludent proofe that God doth
unfeignedly will, not <hi>genera ſingulorum,</hi> all ſorts of
men onely; but <hi>ſingula generum,</hi> every one of all
ſorts to be ſaved; take it briefely thus: All they
which are ſaved, and all they which are not ſaved,
make up both parts of the former diſtinction or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
to the full. But God will have all to bee
ſaved which are ſaved; he likewiſe willeth the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all ſuch, as are not ſaved, that is, of ſuch as
dye: therefore he willeth the ſalvation of every one
of all ſorts. That God doth will the ſalvation of all
that are ſaved, no man ever queſtioned; that God
did will not the life, but death of ſuch as dyed, the
Iewes (Gods owne people) did ſometimes more
then queſtion: and to prevent the like querulous
murmurings of misbeliefe in others, he once for all
interpoſed his ſolemne oath; <hi>As I live ſaith the
Lord, I will not the death of him that dyeth, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that he ſhould repent and live.</hi> None then can
be ſaved whom God would not have ſaved; many
are not ſaved, whom God would have ſaved.</p>
                     <p>4 But how, or by what Will doth he will that
they ſhould be ſaved that are not ſaved? Doth he
will their ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his revealed, not by his ſecret
will? Doth he give ſignification onely of his good
will towards them, whereas his good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7905:93"/>
is not finally to doe them any reall good? This
I take to be the meaning of <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neplaciti.</hi>
But, it being granted, that God doth will
the ſalvation of all men, by his revealed will, or <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate
ſigni;</hi> This alone will ſufficiently inferre our
intended concluſion [That he truly wils the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all, without the exemption of any.] Vpon
ſuch as contradict this doctrine, it lyes upon them
to prove not the negative onely, that God doth not
will the ſalvation of all by his ſecret will; but this
poſitive particular, that God doth nill or unwill the
ſalvation of ſome by his ſecret will, whoſe ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he willeth by his revealed will. Now if it be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that he doth by his ſecret will or good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
unwill or nill the ſalvation of the ſame parties
to whom he willeth ſalvation by his will revealed
or ſignified; they muſt (without remedy) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the one or the other member of this diviſion:
as, either [that there be two wils in God of as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
inclinations <hi>ad extra,</hi> as the reaſonable and
ſenſitive appetite are in man:] or [that there is a
manifeſt contradiction in the object of one and the
ſame Divine Will.] That, <hi>All men ſhould be ſaved,</hi>
and <hi>that ſome men ſhould not be ſaved,</hi> implyeth as
formall a contradiction, as to ſay, [All men are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creatures, ſome men are no living creatures.]
Now that all men ſhould bee living creatures, and
that ſome men ſhould not be living creatures, falls
not within the object of Omnipotency. And if the
will of God, be at truly undivided in it ſelfe, as the
omnipotent power is: it is no leſſe impoſſible that
the ſalvation of all, and the non-ſalvation of ſome
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7905:94"/>
ſhould be the object, or true parts of the object of
one and the ſame divine will undivided in it ſelfe,
than that the actuall ſalvation of all, and the actuall
and finall condemnation of ſome, or the non-ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all, ſhould be really effected by the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
power. Whether this divine will be clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
or in part revealed, and in part reſerved or
ſecret in reſpect of us, all is one; ſo this will in it
ſelfe and in its nature, bee but one, and undivided.
The manifeſtation or reſervation of it, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
other references it may have to us, can neither
increaſe nor abate the former contradiction in the
object. Or if <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> bee not eſſentially the
ſame with <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> there is a manifeſt
contradiction or contrariety betwixt them: If the
ſalvation of all bee the object of the one, and the
non-ſalvation or reprobation of others, be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the other.</p>
                     <p>5 Yet doe we not (like rigorous Critiques) ſo
much intend the utter baniſhment of this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of the confines of Divinity, as the confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it to its proper ſeat and place. Rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
or limited, it may beare faith and allegiance to
the truth, and open ſome paſſages for clearing ſome
branches of it: But permitted to uſe that extent of
liberty which hath beene given to it by ſome, it wil
make way for canonization <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap>eſuiticall perjuries,
for deification of mentall evaſions or reſervations.
Let us compare Ieſuiticall practices with that <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne,</hi>
which is the neceſſary reſultance of ſome
mens interpretation of Gods oath in this caſe.
Were this interrogatory put to any Ieſuiticall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinat,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7905:94"/>
imagine a powder-plotter; <hi>[Doe you will
or intend the ruine of the King or State, or doe you
know of any ſuch project or intendment?]</hi> there is
none of this crue ſo miſchievouſly minded, but
would be ready to ſweare unto this negative [As
the Lord liveth, and as I hope for life and ſalvation
by him, I neither intend the ruine of King or State,
nor doe I know of any conſpiracy againſt him.]
And yet in caſe the event ſhould evidently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his proteſtation to be moſt falſe; yet would he
reſt perſwaded, that this or the like mentall evaſion
or reſervation <hi>[I neither intended the ruine of King
or State, ſo they would become Romane Catholiques;
nor did I know of any conſpiracy againſt them, with
minde or purpoſe to reveale it unto them,]</hi> may be a
preſervative more than ſufficient, a ſoveraigne An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
againſt the ſinne of perjury, which hee had
ſwallowed or harboured in his breſt; ſpecially if
the concealement of his treaſon, make for the good
of the Church. To put the like interrogatory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Almighty Iudge, concerning the ruine or
welfare of men, no Magiſtrate, no authority of
earth hath any power. Yet <hi>hee,</hi> to free himſelfe
from that foule aſperſion, which the Iewes had caſt
upon him (as if ſuch as periſhed in their ſinnes, had
therefore periſhed, becauſe it was his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
they ſhould not live but dye,) hath interpoſed
his often mentioned voluntary oath; <hi>As I live, I
will not the death of him that dyes, but rather that he
ſhould live.</hi> Shall it here bee enough to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for him, <hi>interpretando,</hi> by interpreting his
meaning to be this? I doe not will the death of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7905:95"/>
him that dyes, ſo he will repent, which I know he
cannot doe: nor doe I will his non-repentance,
with purpoſe to make this part of my will knowne
to him; however, according to my ſecret and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
will, I have reſolved never to grant him the
meanes, without which he cannot poſſibly repent;
whereas without repentance hee cannot live but
muſt dye. But, did Gods oath give men no better
aſſurance than this interpretation of it doth, I ſee
no reaſon (yet heartily wiſh, that others might ſee
more) why any man ſhould ſo much blame the
Ieſuites, for ſecret evaſions or mentall reſervations
in matter of oath. For the performance of our
oaths in the beſt manner that wee are capable of,
is but an obſervance of a particular branch of that
generall precept, <hi>Be ye perfect as your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is perfect.</hi> Who then can juſtly challenge the
Ieſuite of imperfection or falſhood, much leſſe of
perjury, for ſecret evaſions or mentall reſervations,
when his life is called in queſtion; if once it bee
granted, that the God of truth, in matter of oath
concerning the eternall life or death of more men
than the Ieſuites have to deale with, doth uſe
the like?</p>
                     <p>6 In matters then determined by Divine Oath,
the diſtinction of <hi>voluntas ſigni</hi> and <hi>beneplaciti,</hi> can
have no place; ſpecially in their doctrine who make
the bare <hi>entity</hi> or perſonall <hi>being</hi> of men, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
object of the immutable decree concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life and death everlaſting. For the <hi>entity</hi> or
perſonall <hi>being</hi> of man, is ſo indiviſible, that an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
negation, and a particular affirmation of the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7905:95"/>
ſame thing, [to wit, Salvation] falling upon man,
as man, or upon the perſonall being of men, drawes
to the ſtricteſt point of contradiction. Farre ever
be it from us to thinke, that God ſhould ſweare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this univerſall negative, <q>
                           <hi>I will not the death of
the man that dyeth;</hi> and yet beleeve withall, that
he wils the death of ſome men that dye, as they
are men, or as they are the ſonnes of <hi>Adam:</hi> that
hee ſhould by his ſecret or reſerved will, recall
any part of his will declared by oath; that hee
ſhould proclaime an univerſall pardon to all the
ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> under the ſeale of his oath, and
yet exempt many from all poſſibility of receiving
any benefit by it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>7 Shall we then conclude that the former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
hath no uſe at all in Divinity? Or if this
concluſion be too rigorous, let us ſee in what caſes
it may have place, or to what particulars it may bee
confined. Firſt, it hath place in matters of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or of plagues not denounced by oath. Thus
God, by his Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> did ſignifie his will to
have <hi>Nineveh</hi> deſtroyed at forty dayes end; this
was <hi>voluntas ſigni;</hi> and he truly intended what hee
ſignified: yet was it his <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> his
good will and pleaſure at the very ſame time, that
the Ninevites ſhould repent and live. And by their
repentance, his good will and pleaſure was fulfilled
in their ſafety. But in this caſe there was no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
betweene Gods will declared or ſignified
.i. <hi>[voluntas ſigni]</hi> and his good will and pleaſure,
.i. <hi>[voluntas beneplaciti];</hi> no contradiction in the
object of his will however conſidered, for that was
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7905:96"/>
not one and the ſame, but much different, in reſpect
of Gods will ſignified by <hi>Ionas;</hi> and of his good
will and pleaſure, which, not ſignified by him, was
fulfilled. One and the ſame immutable will or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God did from eternity award two doomes,
much different, unto <hi>Ninevch;</hi> taking it as it ſtood
affected when <hi>Ionas</hi> threatned deſtruction unto it,
or as it ſhould continue ſo affected; and taking it
as it proved, upon the judgement threatned. All the
alteration was in <hi>Nineveh,</hi> none in Gods will or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree:</hi>
and <hi>Nineveh</hi> being altered to the <hi>better,</hi> the
ſelfe ſame rule of Iuſtice, doth not deale with it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſelfe ſame manner. The doome or ſentence
could not bee the ſame without ſome alteration in
the Iudge, who is unalterable. And in that hee is
unalterably Iuſt and Good, his doome or award,
was of neceſſity to alter, as the object of it altered.
<hi>Deus ſaepe mutat ſententiam, nunquam conſilium.</hi>
Gods unchangeable will or counſell doth often
change his doome or ſentence. The ſame rule holds
thus farre true in matter of bleſſing or promiſe not
confirmed by oath: upon the parties alteration un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
worſe, unto whom the promiſe is made, the
bleſſing promiſed may be revoked, without any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of Gods will or counſell. Yet may we not
ſay, that the death or deſtruction of any to whom
God promiſeth life, is ſo truely the object of his
good will and pleaſure, as the life and ſalvation of
them is, unto whom he threatneth deſtruction. The
ſame diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of good uſe in ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
caſes, or as applyed to men after they have
made up the full meaſure of their iniquity, and are
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7905:96"/>
cut off from all poſſibility of repentance. Thus God
willed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let his people goe out of Egypt,
and ſignified this his will unto him by <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Aaron,</hi> in mighty ſignes and wonders. This was
<hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> onely, not <hi>voluntas beneplaciti.</hi> For
though it were his good will and pleaſure, that his
people ſhould depart out of Egypt; yet was it no
branch of this his good will and pleaſure, that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
ſhould now repent or bee willing to let them
goe. Rather it was his good will and pleaſure (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
after the ſeventh plague) to have the heart of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardned. And yet after his heart was ſo
hardned, that it could not repent, God ſo puniſhed
him, as if it had beene free and poſſible for him to
repent, and grant a friendly paſſe unto his people.
But <hi>Pharaohs</hi> caſe was extraordinary; his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo exemplary, as not to be drawne into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
For as our Apoſtle intimates, it was an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of Gods great mercy and long ſuffering, to
permit <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to live any longer on earth, after he
was become a veſſell of wrath deſtinated to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
puniſhment in hell. The reaſon why God
thus plagued <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for not doing that which
now he could not doe (all poſſibility of amendment
being taken from him) was to teach all generations
following, by his fearefull end, to beware of his
deſperate beginnings, of ſtruggling with God, or
of perſecuting them, whoſe patronage hee had in
peculiar manner undertaken. And here again, there
is no contradiction betweene theſe two propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>[God from all eternity did will the death of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh;
God from all eternity did not will the death, but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7905:97"/>
rather the life of Pharaoh.</hi> For albeit <hi>Pharaoh</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
one and the ſame man, from his birth unto
his death, yet did he not all this time continue one
and the ſame object of Gods immutable will and
eternall decree. This object did alter as <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
diſpoſitions or affections towards God or his
neighbours altered. There is no contrariety, much
leſſe any contradiction, betweene theſe [God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faignedly
loveth all men; God doth not love, but
hate the Reprobate, although they be men, yea the
greateſt part of men.] For here the object of his
love and hate is not the ſame; he loves all men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faignedly
as they are men, or as men which have
not made up the full meaſure of iniquity: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made up that, or having their ſoules betroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
unto wickedneſſe, he hates them. His hate of
them as Reprobates; is no leſſe neceſſary or uſuall,
than his love of them as men. But though he neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
bates them being once become Reprobates,
or having made up the full meaſure of iniquity: yet
was there no neceſſity layd upon them by his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
decree, to make up ſuch a meaſure of iniquity.</p>
                     <p>8 How theſe deductions will conſort with ſome
moderne Catechiſmes I doe not know: ſure I am
they are conſonant to the opinion of that learned
Biſhop and bleſſed Martyr in his Preface to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of the ten Commandements; a fit Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme
for a Biſhop to make. Every man is called
in the Scripture, wicked, and the enemy of God;
for the privation and lacke of faith and love, that he
oweth to God. <hi>Et impii vocantur, qui non omnino
ſunt pii;</hi> that is, They are called wicked that in all
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7905:97"/>
things honour not God, beleeve not in God, and
obſerve not his Commandements as they ſhould
doe; which we cannot do by reaſon of this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
infirmity, or hatred of the fleſh, as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth
it, againſt God. In this ſenſe taketh <hi>Paul</hi> this word,
wicked. So muſt we interpret St. <hi>Paul</hi> and take his
words; or elſe no man ſhould be damned. Now we
know that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Chriſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the contemners of God, or ſuch as willingly
continue in ſinne, and will not repent. Thoſe the
Scripture excludeth from the generall promiſe of
grace. Thou ſeeſt by the places afore rehearſed,
that though wee cannot beleeve in God as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
as is required, by reaſon of this our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſickneſſe and diſeaſe, yet for Chriſts ſake in the
judgement of God wee are accounted as faithfull
beleevers, for whoſe ſake this naturall diſeaſe and
ſickneſſe is pardoned, by what name ſoever S. <hi>Paul</hi>
calleth the naturall infirmity, or originall ſinne in
man. And this imperfection or naturall ſickneſſe
taken of <hi>Adam,</hi> excludeth not the perſon from the
promiſe of God in Chriſt, except wee tranſgreſſe
the limits and bounds of this originall ſinne by our
owne folly and malice; and either of a contempt
or hate of Gods word, we fall into ſinne, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
our ſelves into the image of the devill. Then
wee exclude by this meanes our ſelves from the
promiſes and merits of Chriſt, who only received
our infirmities, and originall diſeaſe, and not the
contempt of him, and his Law.</p>

points propoſed, as our ignorance in aſſoyling
them, is becauſe we extend not this Maxime ſo far
as it naturally would reach; and the reaſon why we
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7905:98"/>
extend it not ſo farre, is our proneneſſe to extend
our owne power to the utmoſt, and, for the moſt
part farther then juſtice or true goodneſſe can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
it. It is our nature to be humorous, and
the nature of humor to be unconſtant. <hi>Fortunes
character</hi> may be every ſonne of <hi>Adams</hi> Motto:
<hi>Tantum conſtans in levitate, Onely conſtant in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy.</hi>
And being ſuch, nothing can imply any
conſtant contradiction to our nature; nothing that
is truly and conſtantly the ſame, but will one time
or other contradict our changeable and inconſtant
humors. And theſe enraged with contradiction,
doe, (Tyrant-like) arme power, without juſt tryall
or examination, without either reſpect or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
againſt whatſoever contradicts them. The
right uſe of power in creatures meerely ſenſitive, is
to ſatiate their appetites of ſenſe: for nothing
hath power to move it ſelfe, but what is ſenſitive:
and, all power, whether of body or minde, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on man for the execution of his will, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
his deſire of good: but, ſince his will,
by his fall, became irregular, and his deſires cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt;
his power is become like a common officer,
or undercommander to all his unruly appetites, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering
by turne or ſucceſſion; all other incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
being under the command of it. So the
wiſe man hath charactered the reſolution of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
men, <hi>cap. 1. 6. Come on therefore, let us enjoy
the good things that are preſent, and let us ſpeedily uſe
the creatures like as in youth.</hi> And <hi>ver. 11. Let our
ſtrength be the Law of juſtice; for that which is feeble
is found to be nothing worth.</hi> Even in ſuch as are by
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7905:99"/>
moſt eſteemed good men and ſober, thoſe notions
of truth and equity which are naturall and implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
are ſo weake and ill taken; that, rather than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart
carnall appetites or deſires which cuſtome
countenanceth, ſhould be enraged through their
reluctance, they preſently yeeld their conſents to
ſuch propoſalls, as (were they reſolute, firme and
conſtant) would as offenſively contradict them, as
puniſhment or paine doth our ſenſe of pleaſure.
Vnto ſuch propoſalls we often yeeld, as are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to be approved by <hi>Equity;</hi> to whom we uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
profeſſe our deareſt love and allegiance, with
promiſes to frame our lives by her rules. But love
in us (whether one ſimple and indiviſible quality,
or an aggregation or cluſter of divers inclinations,
all rooted in one Center,) is not alike ſet on divers
objects. Hence, when it comes to oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
ſenſe and reaſon, betweene our ſelves, our
private friends, and common equity, it divides it
ſelfe unequally. The particular inconveniences
whereto we are daily expoſed, by the inordinate
love of the world, and the fleſh, are infinite; all may
be reduced to theſe two originalls: Firſt, it blindes
our judgements, and makes our intentions ſeeme
upright and juſt to our partiall deſires, or at leaſt
not incompatible with the rules of equity; when
as, to impartiall judgements, they are palpably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.
Secondly, having blinded our judgements,
it forthwith abuſeth our power or authority; to
effect whatſoever is not, for the preſent, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for a groſſe and evident wrong. So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
whereon our love or liking is for the preſent
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7905:99"/>
mainly ſet, ſeemes any way impoſſible unto us; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it bee altogether without the compaſſe of our
power: And, through the variouſneſſe of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
diſpoſition, <hi>that,</hi> which we cannot like or
admit to day, will be allowed of to morrow. But
though there bee none that doth good, no not one,
yet ſome there be doe leſſe evill than others. And
ſeeing thoſe amongſt us, whoſe love to equity is
more ſtrong and conſtant than their neighbours,
are alwayes drawne with greater difficulty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with truth or approve unjuſtice; the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
neceſſarily amounting from this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
 truth, is, That <q>[if any mans judgement
in matters of equity and juſtice were infallible,
and <hi>his love</hi> to juſtice and knowne equity alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
conſtant and invincible, it would bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him to tranſgreſſe in judgement.]</q>
Thus as well the ſtrength of unconſtant humorous
deſires, as the faintneſſe of love or equity (both
which moſt men may experience in themſelves) as
the contrary vertues, which they may obſerve in
ſome few joyntly conſpire to rectifie our conceit
of God, in whom the Ideall perfection, of the ones
integrity and conſtancy, is without all mixture of
the others vice or humorous impotency.</p>
                     <p>2 The firſt rule for right extending the former
Maxime [To make both parts of a contradiction
true, is no part of the object of power omnipotent]
would be this; Many effects which are very poſſible
to power alone conſidered, or as it hath the maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over weake inclinations unto equity, neceſſarily
imply a direct and manifeſt contradiction unto
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7905:100"/>
ſome Divine Attributes, no leſſe infinite or immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
than Almighty power. Hence it followes,
that many effects or deſignes, which ſeeme <hi>poſsible</hi>
to the humane nature, may bee impoſſible or moſt
incongruous to the Divine. It is more ſhamefull
then impoſſible for rich men to lye &amp; cozen, or for
Magiſtrates to oppreſſe and wrong their inferiors;
albeit the ones riches or others power, were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
increaſed, without internall increaſe of their
fidelity. But to him that is eternally true and juſt,
yea eternall <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> it is as impoſſible to
ſpeak an untruth, or doe wrong, as for truth to be a
lye, or <hi>juſtice</hi> to be <hi>unjuſt.</hi> Many things then are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible
to meere power, which are impoſſible to it, as
linkt with truth or love; and many things againe
poſſible to it, as linkt with theſe, which yet directly
contradict the eternall patterne of juſtice or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and are by conſequent impoſſible to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
who is no leſſe juſt and good, then power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Many Pyrats by Sea, or Robbers by Land,
might they injoy but halfe the power &amp; authority
for a Month, whereof ordinary Princes by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
are poſſeſt; would doe their companions and
friends more good, and worke their enemies grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſpoyle in this ſhort ſpace, than any Monarch can
doe in his whole raigne, which holds it a point of
Majeſtie to moderate his actions by that Princely
rule; <hi>Princeps id poteſt quod jure poteſt, Princes can do
no more than they can doe juſtly.</hi> In this ſenſe, I think
we may truly ſay, all before Chriſt were theeves &amp;
robbers, or in reſpect of him very unjuſt; not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
David, Ezekiah, Ioſias,</hi> not one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7905:100"/>
might they have but halfe that power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to them over Angels for a night,
which the Son of God from everlaſting had, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
robbery; but would have thought it very poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to have removed the Romane Army with as
great terror, loſſe and diſgrace, as the Angell of the
Lord ſometimes had done the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> from <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalems</hi>-ſiege;
whoſe fatall deſtruction, God incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
cleerly foreſeeing, bewailed with teares, but
would not, but could not prevent. For to the King
of everlaſting righteouſneſſe, that onely was poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which was juſtly poſsible. And though he were
a Father to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Prince of peace, yet he
approves a moſt bloody and mercileſſe warre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an unjuſt peace, and diſgracefull to Eternall
Majeſtie; for ſo the Prophet had ſaid in his name,
before, <hi>There is no peace unto the wicked;</hi> to ſuch as
ſtubbornely abandon the wayes of peace, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
neglect ſaving health, ſo often and lovingly
tendred unto them; <hi>Hos ſalus ipſa ſervare non potuit,</hi>
and ſhall infinite power ſave them, whom infinite
ſalvation cannot ſave?</p>
                     <p>3 To have ſmitten the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
before luſt had entred in at their eyes; had
beene a worke as eaſie to Almighty power, as
blinding them in the attempt or proſecution of luſt
conceived. But that contradiction which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of this ſinne, did not imply unto Gods
power, it did (all circumſtances conſidered) neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
imply unto his Iuſtice; by whoſe immutable
and eternall rules, they were left unguarded againſt
theſe foule temptions, for wilfull contempt of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7905:101"/>
his goodneſſe, for abuſing his long ſuffering and
loving kindneſſe. But did it imply any contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to his goodneſſe or loving kindneſſe, to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the <hi>Sodomites</hi> former contempt or abuſe of
them? Out of queſtion it did, unto his eternall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
<hi>for all his waies are mercy and truth.</hi> And
theſe <hi>Sodomites</hi> wilfulneſſe preſuppoſed, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
rule of his goodneſſe and loving kindneſſe, had
appointed juſtice to debarre them, as now they
are, from reaping thoſe fruits, whereof his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as they were men, had made them capable.
The principle whence the juſt proofe of theſe
ſeeming paradoxes, as alſo the right explication of
all difficulties in this argument, muſt be derived, is
a Schoole Maxime borrowed from orthodoxall
antiquity, now not much uſed, but of much uſe in
true Divinity, and for this reaſon to bee more fully
inſiſted upon, in the <hi>Treatiſe of mans firſt eſtate.</hi> The
Maxime it ſelf is briefly thus; <hi>It is impoſsible for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
or other created ſubſtance, to be abſolutely impeccable
from his creation.</hi> Onely <hi>He</hi> that is infinite in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is infinitely good; and infinite goodneſſe onely
implyes an abſolute impoſſibility of being bad. As
God onely eſſentially <hi>is,</hi> ſo hee onely is eſſentially
and immutably good; all things beſides him are
or ſometimes were ſubject to mutability, aſwell in
<hi>Eſſence</hi> as in their ſtate and condition. Power om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
could not from the firſt Creation, have
pared off all mutabilitie from mans morall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
without <hi>periſhing</hi> the onely poſſible root of
his eternall and immutable happineſſe. To decline
to evill, implyes no contradiction to <hi>Being ſimply,</hi>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:7905:101"/>
but onely to <hi>omnipotent being:</hi> it is ſo poſſible to all
Creatures, that without this poſſibility, it were (as
we ſhall afterwards prove) impoſſible for them to
be truly like their Creator, for a moment in that
attribute, whoſe participation is the only aſſurance
of their eternall weale. If God either by his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
power, or infinite wiſedome, had neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
(though without any violence) reſtrained this
poſſibility in man, of declining from good to evill,
man had forthwith ceaſed to have beene truly and
inherently good, and ceaſing to be ſuch, had utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loſt all poſſibilities of that eſtate, whoſe pledge
or earneſt he received in his creation. Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is his happineſſe. And his participative good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is the foundation of mans happineſſe. So that
not Gods juſtice onely, but that loving kindneſſe
whereby hee created man, and appointed him as
heyre apparent of life eternall, did remove all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
from his will, becauſe the impoſition of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
(whether laid upon him by power or wiſdome
infinite) had utterly extinguiſhed that goodneſſe
wherein it was onely poſſible for the creature to
expreſſe the Creators goodneſſe manifeſted in his
creation. Now that was not Gods eſſentiall or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
goodneſſe, for that is incommunicable.
All the goodneſſe man is capable of, doth but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
Gods goodneſſe communicative. It is the
ſtampe of it communicated. As God then did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
his goodneſſe to his creatures, not by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
but freely, ſo could not the creature be truly
good (that is like his God) by neceſſity but freely.
Nor was it poſſible for him to have beene either
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7905:102"/>
confirmed in ſuch goodneſſe as he had, or tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to everlaſting happineſſe; but by continuing
freely good for ſome ſpace, or leſſe evill, than by
the liberty which God by his immutable law had
given him in his creation, hee poſſibly might have
beene. Continuing good, though but for a while,
without neceſſity, the riches of Gods free bounty,
had beene continually increaſed towards him, and
had finally eſtabliſhed him in everlaſting bliſſe by
confirmation of him in true goodneſſe, or by inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
him with immortality. Since his fall wee are
not uſually capable of mercy or of the increaſe of
his bounty; much leſſe of theſe everlaſting fruits
whereof bleſſings temporall are the pledges; but
by free abſtinence from ſome evills, unto whoſe
practices, the poſſibility of our corrupted nature
might be improved. And albeit we doe not alway
that which is in its nature evill, yet we can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
well, but even the good which we do we doe
it naughtily: yet unleſſe we doe both leſſe evill, and
the good which we do leſſe naughtily than we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
might doe, God ſtill diminiſheth the riches
of his bounty towards us; and by inhibiting the
ſweet influence of his gracious providence, ſuffers
us to fall from one wickedneſſe to another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prone to runne headlong into all, if once
the <hi>reines</hi> of our unruly appetites, bee given
into our unweildie hands. Farre bee it from
any ſonne of <hi>Adam</hi> to thinke hee is able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Gods love and favour to withdraw himſelfe
from the extremities of miſchiefe, much leſſe to
doe ſuch good as may make him capable of well-doing.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7905:102"/>
So ſtrong is our love to ſinfull pleaſures,
ſince our firſt parents gave the reines unto our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
that none can recall themſelves or repent,
without the attractions of infinite love. And yet
many whom this infinite love doth daily imbrace,
becauſe they apprehend not it, are never brought
by the attractions of it to true repentance. <hi>Deſpiſeſt
thou the riches of his goodneſſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,
<hi>Rom. 2. 4. his forbearance and long ſuffering, not
knowing that the goodneſſe of God leadeth thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?</hi>
Of whom ſpeakes he thus? of ſuch one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as truly repent, and by patient continuance in
wel-doing, ſeeke for glory, honour, and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?
nay, but, of them who for <hi>hardneſſe of heart,
cannot repent; but treaſure up wrath againſt the
day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4 Were the riches of his bounty therefore fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or did hee onely profer, but not purpoſe to
draw them unto repentance, which repented not?
this is no part of our heavenly Fathers <hi>perfection,</hi> no
fruit of that wiſedome which is from above, but a
point of earthly policy devoid of honeſty; a meere
tricke of wordly wit, to whoſe practice nothing
but weakneſſe and impotence to accompliſh great
deſires, can miſ-incline mans corrupted nature. But
doth it not argue the like impotency, though no
ſuch want of integrity in God, not to effect what he
wils more ardently and more unfainedly, than man
can doe the increaſe or continuance of his welfare,
or avoidance of endleſſe miſery? No; it being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
(as we have ſaid) that man is not capable of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7905:103"/>
endleſſe joyes, unleſſe he will be wrought by meere
love, without the impulſions of unreſiſtible power,
unfaignedly to love him that hath prepared them
for him; the ſame infinite love which continually
drawes him unto repentance, was in congruity to
leave him a poſſibility not to be drawne by it. For
coactive penitency, would have fruſtrated the end
to which repentance is but a meane ſubordinate.
The imployment or exerciſe of Gods almighty po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to make men repent againſt their wils, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were wrought to a willingneſſe by the
ſweet attractions of his infinite love, or by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of judgements not infinite or irreſiſtible,
would be like the indeavors of a loving Father,
more ſtrong than circumſpect, who out of pity to
his ſonne, whom he ſees ready to be choked with
water, ſhould ſtrangle him by violent haling him
to the ſhore. Moſt men by aſcribing that unto
Gods power which is the peculiar and eſſentiall
effect of his love, doe finally miſſe of that <hi>good,</hi>
which both infallibly conſpire to poure, without
meaſure, upon all ſuch as take right and orderly
hold of them. How ſhall wee then faſten our faith
to them aright? we are to beleeve, that Gods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
power ſhall effect without controule or checke
of any thing in heaven or earth, all things poſſible
for their endleſſe good, that truly love him; but
conſtraines no mans will to love him, being alwaies
armed againſt wilfull neglectors of his unfaigned
love. No man would argue his love to be leſſe than
infinite, becauſe not able to produce the effects of
infinite power: and as little reaſon wee have to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7905:103"/>
thinke, that power, though infinite, ſhould bee the
true immediate parent of love, which never ſprings
in any reaſonable creature, but from the ſeedes of
love or lovelines ſown in the humane ſoule, though
they doe not alwayes proſper. Conſtraint, becauſe
it is the proper and immediate effect of power, is a
companion fit for luſt; whoſe ſatisfaction breedes
rather a loathing of the parties conſtrained, than
any good wil or purpoſe to reward them for being
unwilling, unloving, or impatient paſſives; nothing
but true unforced love, can yeeld contentment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
love. Needy man, to whom benevolences
though wreſted are ever gratefull, cannot bee indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to love the parties from whom they are wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.
For, <hi>Non tantum ingratum ſed inviſum eſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficium
ſuperbè datum: Good offices whileſt they are
preſented by pride, are not onely ungratefull but odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
But God who giveth to all men liberally, and
upbraideth no man; as he eſteemes no gifts (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
given) ſo he alwayes deteſts the niggardly
backwardneſſe, and loves the cheerfulneſſe of the
giver.</p>
                     <p>5 From theſe diſcuſſions the truth of the former
rule, with the right ſolution of the maine probleme
propoſed, may bee illuſtrated, by examples of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kinds in ſubjects knowne and familiar. Be the
charge never ſo great, ſo the exonerations be well
nigh equal, the incoms are leſſe than if their charge
were little, and their exonerations none. Or, be a
mans revenues never ſo large, ſo his neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
be no leſſe, hee ſhall not bee able to doe as
much for his friend in ſome reall kindneſſe, as hee
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7905:104"/>
whoſe eſtate is not halfe ſo great, if ſo his annuall
expences be tenne times leſſe. In like caſe, though
mans love to his deareſt friend, be (in reſpect of
Gods love to us) but faint, and his power but ſmall;
yet becauſe his love to juſtice is much leſſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his partiality greater, hee oft-times effects that
for his temporall good, which God though infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in power, doth not effect for thoſe whom hee
infinitely loves. For the bequeſts or grants made
unto man by his infinite love, muſt undergoe the
examination of <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>equitie.</hi> What are alike
infinite, before they paſſe the irrevocable ſeale of
infinite power, one of theſe cannot attempt, much
leſſe abſolutely bring ought to paſſe, without the
others conſent. Infinite love cannot overſway, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gods incomprehenſible wiſedome to deviſe,
or his omnipotency to practiſe meanes for mans
ſalvation, which contradict the unchangeable rules
of infinite equity. His love is as truly indiviſible, as
infinite; and is for this reaſon more indiſſolubly
linkt unto the unchangeable rules of his owne
juſtice or equity, than unto mankinde, whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in his beſt eſtate, was but mutable; nor are any
of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity ſo capable of that infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
wherewith God embraceth them, as Gods
Iuſtice and Majeſtie are of his infinite Love. Theſe
being as He is abſolutely immutable, are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
eternity immutably loved of him, who indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
is <hi>Majeſtie, Iuſtice, Love, immutable.</hi>

this humane paſſion, did viſibly act that part which
God before his incarnation had penned, as a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
memoriall of his unconceivable love. <hi>O that
my people had hearkned unto me: and Iſrael had wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in my wayes; I ſhould ſoone have ſubdued their
enemies, and turned my hand againſt their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
The haters of the Lord ſhould have ſubmitted
themſelves unto him but their time ſhould have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for ever. He ſhould have fed them alſo with the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7905:105"/>
fineſt wheat, and with honey out of the Rocke ſhould I
have ſatisfied thee. Pſalm. 81. verſ. 13, 14, 15, 16.
Wheat</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> here promiſed, were Emblemes
of better bleſſings purpoſed towards them. And
thus avouching this his purpoſe, under no chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of courtly complement, but in the forme of
legall aſſurance; his words are undoubted tokens
of unfeigned love and deſire unquenchable of their
welfare, that did not proſper. <hi>Iſrael</hi> might have
ſaid, as <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> afterwards did of her ſorrow;
<hi>Was there ever any love like unto this love wherewith
the Lord imbraced mee in the dayes of my youth.</hi>
Notwithſtanding this exceſſive fervency of <hi>His</hi>
loving kindneſſe (whoſe will is infinite) laid no
neceſſity upon their wils to whom hee wiſhed all
this good. They had a liberty left them by eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
equity, to refuſe it. Hee out of the wiſhes of
his bounty as he proteſteth, was ready to poure
out his beſt bleſſings according to the immenſity
of his loving kindneſſe, ſo <hi>Iſrael</hi> would open his
mouth wide to receive them. <hi>But my people</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>would not hearken unto my voice; and Iſrael
would none of mee; ſo I gave them up unto their owne
hearts luſt; and they walked in their owne counſells.
Pſal. 81. verſ. 11, 12.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 Lord, who had ſinned, the heathen people or
their forefathers in like manner as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, that
<hi>in times paſt thou ſufferedſt them all to walke in their
owne wayes? Acts 14. 16. They that obſerve lying
vanities forſake their owne mercy,</hi> ſaith the Prophet
<hi>Ionah. 2. 8.</hi> Never hadſt thou given them up to
their owne hearts luſt, to treaſure up wrath againſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7905:106"/>
the day of wrath, had they not deſpiſed the riches
of thy bounty; whoſe current, nevertheleſſe was
not altogether diverted from their poſterity. <hi>To
them thou lefteſt not thy ſelfe without a witneſſe, in
that thou didſt good, and gaveſt them raine from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in fruitfull ſeaſons, filling their hearts with food
and gladneſſe.</hi> To all nations even in the time of
darkneſſe, when they were ſtrangers from thee;
theſe and the like temporall and ſenſible bleſſings,
were unqueſtionable earneſts of thy everlaſting
love, ſince more fully manifeſted; <hi>For thou ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedſt
the world</hi> (not <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely) <hi>that thou gaveſt
thine onely begotten ſon, to the end that who ſo belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

What further argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Gods infinite love, could

That this love was unfaignedly tendered to
all, at leaſt, that have heard or hereafter may heare

more infallible, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the inference of this truth is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a ſacred truth received by all good Chriſtians, <hi>viz.
[Al ſuch as have heard Gods love in Chriſt proclaimed
and not beleeved in it, ſhall in the day of Iudgement
appeare guilty of greater ſinnes, than their forefathers
could be endited of; and undergoe more bitter death,
than any corruption drawne from</hi> Adam, <hi>if Chriſt
had never ſuffered, could have bred.]</hi> I ſhall no way
wrong the Apoſtle in unfolding his exhortations to
the <hi>Athenians</hi> thus farre; but they rather offer the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7905:106"/>
ſpirit by which hee ſpake, ſome kinde of violence,
that would contract his meaning ſhorter. <hi>The times
of this ignorance</hi> (before Chriſts death) <hi>God winked
at, but now commandeth all men every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
Becauſe hee hath appointed a day, in the which
he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe, by that man
whom hee hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
unto all men, in that hee hath raiſed him from
the dead, Acts 17. 30, 31.</hi>

                     <p>3 Why all men in the world have not heard of
Gods infinite love thus manifeſted, many cauſes
may hereafter bee aſſigned, all grounded upon
Gods infinite Iuſtice or Mercy. Of Chriſts death
many which heard not might have heard; many
which are not, might have bin partakers; ſave only
for their free and voluntary progreſſe from evill to
worſe, or wilfull refuſall of Gods loving kindneſſe
daily profered to them in ſuch pledges, as they
were well content to ſwallow; fooliſhly eſteeming
theſe good in themſelves, being good onely as
they plight the truth of Gods love to them, which
he manifeſted in the death of his Sonne. With
this manifeſtation of his love, many againe out of
meere mercy have not beene acquainted; leſt the
ſight of the medicine might have cauſed their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe
to rage, and make their caſe more lamentably
deſperate.</p>

Who would not be willing to be ſaved, if hee were

ſuch as are truly kind, to be either unregarded, or
miſtruſted by ſuch as ſtand in neede of their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
And as fiſhes in beaten waters, will nibble
at the bait, although they ſuſpect the hooke: ſo
the world hath learned the wit to take good
turnes, and not to be taken by them; as ſuſpecting
them to bee profered in cunning rather than in
true kindneſſe: and cunning, where it is diſcovered
or ſuſpected, is uſually requited with craft; love
onely hath juſt title unto love. The moſt part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are ſo worldly wiſe, that none but fooles will
eaſily truſt them; howbeit our naturall miſtruſt of
others, makes all of us a great deale worſe than we
would be. And as if we thought it a ſinne or point
of uncharitableneſſe, to prove other mens conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that meaſure our diſpoſitions by their owne,
altogether falſe; wee fit our demeanours to their
miſdeemings of us, and reſolve rather to do amiſſe;
than they ſhould thinke amiſſe. Howbeit even in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7905:108"/>
this perfidious and faithleſſe age, the old ſaying is,
not quite out of date: <hi>Ipſa fides habita obligat fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
Many would be more truſty than they are; and do
much better by us than they doe, would we whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commit our ſelves to their truſt and kindneſſe.
Now, though by mans goodneſſe or badneſs, God
can neither become worſe nor better in himſelfe;
yet the riches of his bounty, or communication of
his goodneſſe, are ſtill multiplyed towards thoſe
that ſtedfaſtly beleeve him to bee ſuch as hee is:
One, whom all are bound to love; becauſe hee is ſo
kind and loving; one whom all may ſafely truſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his loving kindneſſe is ſo utterly void of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
being armed with power and juſtice infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.
<hi>Thy righteouſneſſe is like the great mountaines,
thy judgements are like the great deepe; O Lord
thou preſerveſt man and beaſt. How excellent is thy
louing kindneſſe, O God! therefore the children of
men put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy wings.
Pſal. 36. ver. 6, 7.</hi> This eſpecially ſhould move
all to admire his loving kindneſſe, that he loved all
without any other motive than his owne meere
goodneſſe or loving kindneſſe, either to incline his
will or ſtirre up his power to give them a being
like his owne: <hi>We love him</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he loved us firſt.</hi> Doe all then whom hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly
loves, love him vnfeignedly? Would
God they did: for ſo (as his will is) all ſhould bee
ſaved. Did then the Apoſtle meane that his love
to us, is no true cauſe of our love to him? yes; yet
not ſimply as it is in him, but as being unfeignedly
in him it is truly apprehended by us. Ingenuous
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7905:109"/>
love is never lawfully begotten, or fully concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
but from an apprehenſion of true lovelineſſe in
the object; and nothing can bee more lovely then
love it ſelfe, when it is firmely apprehended or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
knowne.</p>
                     <p>3 Though ſecret conſciouſneſſe of our owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovelineſſe,
in the ſtate of nature, makes us oft-times
too miſtruſtfull of others love: Yet unto our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
unregenerate and overgrowne with corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is almoſt impoſſible, not to love them whoſe
love to us we aſſuredly know to be unfaigned; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
their behaviour be very loathſome. Howbeit
even ſo we love their perſons, though not their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
wherewith againe we willingly diſpenſe, if
it may gratifie us in other things, which we much
deſire. That which makes the worlds condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo juſt, that infinite mercy may not diſpence
with it, is mens dull backwardneſſe to love him, of
whoſe glorious beauty, the moſt glorious, moſt
admired creatures are but fleeting ſhadowes, no
true pictures. Him of whoſe infinite love and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
preventions in unrecompenſable benefits,
all the pleaſures wee take in health, the joy of
ſtrength, the ſweetneſſe of life it ſelfe; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in it is good and lovely, are infallible pledges,
and yet his intention in free beſtowing them is to
bind himſelfe (more ſtrictly than man is bound by
receiving the juſt price of what he bargaines for) to
inſtate us in the incomprehenſible joyes of endleſſe
life.</p>
                     <p>Hee requires nothing at our hand, but that wee
may be more capable of his loving kindneſſe, by
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7905:109"/>
drawing ſtill nearer and nearer to him, with all our
hearts, with all our ſoules, and with all our ſtrength;
of whoſe leaſt portion he is ſole maker and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
of all whoſe motions hee is ſole author and
guide. From participation of his favour or preſence,
whatſoever is good in them, is undoubtedly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of increaſe. The ſervices wherein the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
King requires demonſtration of this our love,
are not ſo hard, as thoſe which wee willingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to corruptible men, not inveſted with any
ſhadow of his <hi>lovelineſſe,</hi> nor ſeaſoned with any
tincture of his loving kindneſſe; to men, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſo beneficiall as loving to their friends, nor
halfe ſo loving as they are lovely, though their
lovelineſſe come farre ſhort of their greatneſſe.
Far otherwiſe it is with <hi>him,</hi> whoſe Greatneſſe and
Majeſty are truly infinite: hee is as glorious and
lovely as great, as loving as lovely, and yet withall
no leſſe beneficiall than loving to thoſe which love
him, and doe his will.</p>
                     <p>4 This unfaigned love of him, raiſed from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
of his loving kindnes toward us, is as the firſt
conception or plantation of true happines, to which
once truly planted, whatſoever in this life can befal
us,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> ſerves as nutriment. <hi>Diligentibus Deum omnia
operantur in bonum. Wee know that all things worke

are called according to his purpoſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As this Article of his goodneſſe and love is to be
preſt before any other, ſo the firſt and moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
deduction, that can be made from this or any
other ſacred principle; and that which every one
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7905:110"/>
when hee firſt comes to enjoy the uſe of reaſon,
ſhould be taught to make by heart, is this: <hi>He that
gave mee life indued with ſenſe, and beautified my
ſenſe with reaſon, before I could deſire one or other of
them, or know what being meant; hath doubtleſſe a
purpoſe to give me with them, whatſoever good things
my heart, my ſenſe or reaſon can deſire; even life or
being as farre ſurpaſsing all goodneſſe, fleſh and blood
can conceive or deſire, as this preſent life, I now enjoy,
doth my former not being, or my deſireleſſe want of
being what now I am.</hi> Theſe are principles, which
elſewhere (by Gods aſſiſtance) ſhall bee more at
large extended: yet would I have the Reader ever
to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that the infinite love, wherewith God
ſought us when we were not, by which he found
out a <hi>beginning</hi> for mankind, fitted as a foundation
for endleſſe life, can never be indiſſolubly betroth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the bare <hi>beeing</hi> which hee beſtowed upon
us. The finall contract betwixt him and us, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
preſuppoſeth a bond or linke of mutuall love.
There is no meanes poſſible for us to be made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or happier than we are, but by unfaigned loving
him, which out of love hath made us what we are.
Nor are we what we are, becauſe <hi>he is,</hi> or from his
<hi>Eſſence onely,</hi> but becauſe he was loving to us. And
after our love to him enclaſped with his unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and unchangeable love to us, whoſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
muſt beget it; the faith by which it is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in us, aſſures our ſoules of all the good meanes

the <hi>infinity</hi> of wiſedome can contrive, or power
omnipotent is able to practiſe; for attaining the

end whereto his infinite love from all Eternities
doth ordaine us. And who could deſire better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
or aſſurance more ſtrong then this,
for the recompence of all his labours? or if all
this cannot ſuffice to allure us, hee hath ſet feare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

unfained love, as any father could unto his ſonne;
more than the imbecility of ſex would ſuffer a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hearted mother, to make proofe of. Doth then
the adjudging of this his owne ſon to death, rightly
argue he loved him leſſe than other parents did
their children, whoſe worſe deſerts they would not
have ſentenced ſo ſeverely? No: it rather proves
love and care of martiall diſcipline, and hate to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
in adminiſtration of civill Iuſtice, to have
beene much greater in him, than in other parents
of his time. The more juſt and equall the law hee
tranſgreſſed was, or might have beene (as for illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7905:111"/>
ſake we will ſuppoſe it to have been a law
moſt equall and juſt) the more it commends his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
ſeverity, that would not ſuffer the violation
of it goe unpuniſhed in his deareſt ſonne; whom
the more deſirous hee was to make like himſelfe in
religious obſervance of Martiall Diſcipline, and
practice of Iuſtice towards the enemy; the readier
he was to doe juſtice upon him for doing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
That exceſſive love, which he bare unto his
perſon, whileſt his hopefull beginnings did ſeeme
to promiſe an accompliſhment of thoſe martiall
vertues, whoſe firſt draught hee himſelfe had well
expreſſed; turnes into extreame ſeverity and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
after he proves tranſgreſſor of thoſe funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
rules, by which he had taken his direction;
and unto whoſe obſervance his deſire of poſterity
was deſtinated. So it falls out by the unalterable
courſe of nature, or rather by a Law more tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and immutable than nature it ſelfe, that a leſſe
love being chained (by references of ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betweene the objects loved) with a greater, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſlinke it ſelfe without ſome deeper touch of
diſpleaſure, than if the bond or reference had beene
none. The neerer the reference, or the ſtricter the
bond; the more violent will the rupture be, and the
diſſociation more unpleaſant: As there is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the enmity of brethren, if the knot of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
kindneſſe once fully untie: The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our love to our brethren, is neereſt united
with the love of our ſelves, unto which all other
love is in ſome ſort ſubordinate. True affection is
alwayes moſt diſpleaſed, where it is moſt defeated;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7905:112"/>
where moſt is deſervedly expected and leaſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
Now as partiality towards our ſelves, and
indulgence to our inordinate deſires, oft-times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
deſire of revenge upon unnaturall or unkinde
brethren: ſo doth the conſtant and unpartiall love
of equity and wholeſome Lawes, naturally bring
forth juſt ſeverity towards preſumptuous neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of them whoſe perſons wee love no leſſe, than
they do that would plead with teares for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.
Towards them, unto whom wee would
give reall proofe of more tender and true affection,
than their partiall abetters doe, could wee winne
them, by theſe or other warrantable means, to link
their love with ours, or to love that beſt which
moſt deſerveth loue. As <hi>Seleucus</hi> loved his ſon (for
ſaving the one of whoſe eyes, (both being forfait
by the law) he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to loſe one of his own)
more dearely than moſt princely mothers do their
children, for he loved him as himſelfe, yet could
not diſpence either with himſelfe, or his ſonne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he loved the publike law, and common good,
that might accrue by this ſingular example of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
better than either, better than both.</p>
                     <p>3 For every man to love himſelfe beſt, is in our
judgement no breach, but rather a <hi>foundation</hi> of
charitie. Alaw to whoſe performance every man
is bound in matters of neceſſity concerning this

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7905:112"/>
nothing can be ſo worthy of love or honour as <hi>God;</hi>
who will we, nill we, doth and muſt enjoy this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
or priviledge of loving himſelfe beſt. And if
he love himſelfe better than he doth any creature,
he muſt love equity and juſtice better than he doth
any man; for he himſelfe is <hi>equity</hi> it ſelfe, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
patterne as well of Iuſtice as of Mercy; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be unjuſtly mercifull towards thoſe men, whom
he loves more dearely than any man doth himſelfe.
And in as much as goodneſſe it ſelfe is the eſſentiall
object of his will, he loves nothing abſolutely and
irrevocably, but that which is abſolutely &amp; immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
good. So was not man in his firſt creation,
much leſs is he ſuch in his collapſed eſtate; and yet
Gods love (ſo ſuper infinite is it) extends it ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our nature ſo collapſed and polluted with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
which he infinitely hates. This his love,
which knowes no limit in it ſelfe, is limited in its
effects towards men, by the correſpondency which
they hold or loſe with that abſolute goodneſſe, or
with thoſe eternall rules of equity, juſtice, or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
in which his will is to haue man made like him.
Such as have beene either in <hi>re</hi> or <hi>ſpe,</hi> though not
as they ſhould bee, yet ſuch as either infinite loving
kindneſſe can vouchſafe to accept, to cheriſh, or
encourage to goe forward as they haue begunne;
or infinite mercy to tollerate in expectation of
their repentance, or averſion from their wonted
courſes: theſe, if once they finally diſſolve the
correſpondency, which they held with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
or burſt the linke which they had in Gods
love, (with reference to that goodneſſe, wherto the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7905:113"/>
riches of his bounty daily inviteth them) his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
towards them kindles according to the
<hi>meaſure</hi> of his former <hi>mercies</hi> or loving kindneſſe.
If being illuminated by his Spirit, they finally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate
themſelves to the ſonnes of darkneſſe, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
put on Chriſt in baptiſme, they reſume their
ſwiniſh habit, and make a ſport of wallowing in the
mire; the ſweet fountaines of joy and comfort,
which were opened to them as they were Gods
creatures, not uncapable of his infinite mercy, prove
floods of wo &amp; miſery to them as they are ſworne
ſervants of ſinne and corruption: For, hate to <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe</hi>
and <hi>uncleanneſs,</hi> is eſſentially and formally
included in Gods love of <hi>abſolute goodneſſe,</hi> righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe

eſſentiall and ſole fruit of Gods <hi>antecedent will,</hi>
whether concerning our nature as it was in the
firſt man, or now is in the ſeverall perſons deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from him. And of this love every particular
faculty of ſoule or body is a pledge undoubted;
all, are as ſo many ties or <hi>handles</hi> to draw us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

The full explication and neceſſary uſe of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
hath taken up its place, in the Articles of
Creation, or Divine Providence. Thus much of it
may ſerve our preſent turn. That Gods abſolute wil
was to have man capable of <hi>Heaven</hi> &amp; <hi>Hel,</hi> of joyes
and miſeries immortall. That this abſolute will

ſet on mans eternall and everlaſting joy, more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently

than man can conceive; yet not ſo, as to
contradict it ſelfe by fruſtrating the contrary poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
which unto man it had appointed. That
Gods anger never kindles, but out of the aſhes of
his flaming love deſpiſed. Nor doth the turning of
tender love and compaſſion, into ſeverity &amp; wrath,
preſuppoſe or argue any change or turning in the
Father of lights and everlaſting mercy; it is wholly
ſeated in mens irregular deviation from that courſe
which by the appointment of his antecedent will
they ſhould and might have taken (whereto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
kindneſſe did ſtill invite them) unto whoſe
crooked wayes, which they doe, but ſhould not
follow; from which the ſame infinite goodneſſe
doth ſtill allure them by every temporall bleſſing,
and deterre them by every croſſe and plague that
doth befall them.</p>
                     <p>2 This bodily Sunne, which wee ſee, never
changeth with the Moone, his light, his heat are
ſtill the ſame; yet one and the ſame heat in the
ſpring time, refreſheth our bodies here in this

clime, journey in the ſands of <hi>Affricke.</hi> His beames
reflected on bodies ſolid, but of corruptible and
changeable nature, often inflame matter capable of
combuſtion. But (as ſome Philoſophers thinke)
wold not annoy us (unleſs by too much light) were
we in that aethereall or coeleſtiall region wherein it
moves. At leaſt, were our bodies of the like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

rather comfort than torment us. Thus is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of lights a refreſhing flame of unquenchable
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7905:115"/>
love, to ſuch as are drawne by love to be like him
in purity of life, but a conſuming fire to ſuch as he
beholdeth a farre off; to ſuch as run from him by
making themſelves moſt unlike unto him. No
ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> there be, which in ſome meaſure
or other had not ſome taſte or participation of his
bountie. And the meaſure of his wrath is but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to the riches of his bounty deſpiſed. To
whom this infinite treaſure of his bounty hath
beene moſt liberally opened, it proves in the end a
ſtorehouſe of wrath and torments, unleſſe it final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
draw them to repentance: According to the
height of that exaltation whereunto his antecedent
will had deſigned them, ſhall the degrees of their
depreſſion be in hell for not being exalted by it.
Nor doth any man in that lake of torments, ſuffer
paines more againſt his will, than he had done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things againſt the <hi>will</hi> of his righteous Iudge
daily leading him to repenttnce. The flames of
hell take their ſcantling from the flames of Gods
love neglected; they may not, they cannot exceede
the meaſure of this neglect. Or to knit up this
point with evidence of ſacred truth; God alwaies
proportioneth his plagues or puniſhments in juſt
equality to mens ſinnes. And the onely rule for
meaſuring ſinne or tranſgreſſion right, muſt bee
taken from the degrees of mans oppoſition to
Gods delight or pleaſure in his ſalvation. Not ſo
much as a dramme of his delight or pleaſure can be
abated, not a ſcruple of his will, but muſt finally be
accompliſhed. The meaſure of his delight in mans
repentance or ſalvation, ſhall beee exactly ſatisfied
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7905:115"/>
and fulfilled. Mans repentance he loves as hee is
infinite in mercy and in bounty: mans puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he doth not love at all in it ſelfe, yet doth hee
puniſh as hee is infinitely juſt, or as hee infinitely
loveth juſtice. This is but the extract of <hi>Wiſedomes</hi>
ſpeech, <hi>Prov. 1. verſ. 24. Becauſe I have called, and
ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man
regarded: But yee have ſet at nought all my counſell,
and would none of my reproofe: I alſo will laugh at
your calamity, I will mocke when your feare commeth,
When your feare commeth as deſolation, and your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction

but they ſhall not finde mee: For that they hated
knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of the Lord.
They would none of my counſel: they deſpiſed all my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.
Therefore ſhall they eate of the fruit of their
owne way, and be filled with their owne devices. For
the turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the
proſperity of fooles ſhall deſtroy them. But who ſo
harkeneth unto me, ſhall dwell ſafely, and be quiet from

which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> refutes. For thus to
doe is neither incident to the divine nature, nor to
any other imaginable. Moſt of us, are by nature
cholericke, and often take offence where none is
given, and almoſt alwayes greater than is juſtly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
But to be offended with any thing, that goes
not againſt their preſent wills, is a way wardneſſe
of men, whereof the humane nature is uncapable.
To puniſh any, which doe not contradict their
wills, is an injuſtice ſcarce incident to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Hell. It is the mutability of our wills or
multiplicity of humors, which makes us ſo hard to
be pleaſed. Our minds (at leſt our affections) are
ſet upon one thing faſting, upon another full; on
this to day, on that to morrow; on ſweet meates
in health, on ſowre in ſickneſſe; on kindneſſe in
mirth, on cruelty in anger; and becauſe each hath
his ſeverall inconſtant motions, wee cannot hold
conſort long together, without croſſing or thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
But no man ever offended by merrily conſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7905:116"/>
with his brother diſpoſed to mirth; nor by
conſenting to wreake his will, whileſt hee was in
rage. No man ever puniſhed his ſervant for doing
that which for the preſent he would have him doe;
nor doe the Devills themſelves vex the wicked (till
Gods juſtice overtake them) but the godly; becauſe
the one doth what they would, the other what they
would not have him doe; neither could diſpleaſe
them, were it not their wicked will to have all as
bad and miſerable as themſelves. Could the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by their ſuffering, either eaſe theſe tormentors,
of paine, or abate their malice; they would be leſſe
diſpleaſed at them, and leſſe diſpleaſed, torment
them leſſe. And, whom then have they made the
<hi>ſubject</hi> of their thoughts, or did they rather dreame
than thinke on God, that ſometimes write as if it
were not as much againſt Gods will to have men
dye, as it is againſt mans will to ſuffer death. For
they ſuffer death, not becauſe God delighteth in it,
but that Gods will may be fulfilled in their <hi>ſuffering</hi>
or <hi>paſsion,</hi> according to the meaſure it hath beene
neglected or oppoſed, by their actions.</p>
                     <p>4 But though the rule of juſtice bee exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in proportioning their paines to the degrees
or fervency of his love neglected; yet ſeeing the
continuance of their neglect was but temporall,
how ſtands it with his juſtice to make their paines
eternall? The doubt were pertinent, if the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
happineſſe, wherunto the riches of Gods boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
did daily lead them during their pilgrimage on
earth, whereof they had ſweet promiſes and full
aſſurance, had not farther exceeded all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7905:117"/>
of this mortall life, for whoſe purchaſe, they
morgaged their hopes of immortality, than the
paines of hell doe theſe grievances or corrections,
which cauſed them murmure againſt their heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father. In this ſenſe we may maintaine what
<hi>Mirandula</hi> in another doth: that no man is everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
puniſhed for temporall offences as commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt God. How then? Man wilfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing
his everlaſting inheritance for momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
and tranſient pleaſures, becomes the Author
of his owne woe, and reapes the fruit of his raſh

refuſed to accompliſh Gods eternall pleaſure by

In every moment of this life, we have a pledge of
his bounty to aſſure us of a better inheritance, the
very firſt neglect whereof, might in juſtice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
us to everlaſting bondage. The often and
perpetuall neglect, turnes flames of eternall
love into an eternall conſuming fire. For if
love and mercy bee his property as hee is Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

whoſe meaning in concluſion he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to be Orthodoxall and good; albeit his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of divine wrath in the premiſſes, may ſeeme
better to fit the fragility of humane peeviſhneſſe,
than the Majeſty of the Almighty Iudge. His phraſe
(perhaps) might be excuſed in part, by the ſecurity
of thoſe times wherein he wrote; his fault (if any
fault it were not to ſpeake preciſely in an age more
preciſe for maintaining the elegancy or life of ſtyle,
than the right uſe or logicall propriety of words)
is too common to moſt Writers yet, and conſiſteth
onely in <hi>appropriating</hi> that to the Divine Nature,
which is attributed to it onely by extrinſecall deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
But leaving his phraſe (about which
perhaps he himſelfe would not have wrangled) his
argument holds thus farre true: God is more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpleaſed with ſinne, than man is, though his
diſpleaſure bee not cloathed with ſuch paſſions, as
mans anger is: and yet the motions of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

than any mans paſſions in extreameſt fury can
bee. What mans voice is like his thunder? What
Tyrants frownes like to a lowring sky, breathing

terrible ſounds, which the creatures can preſent,
but as ſo many ecchoes of his angry voice; the moſt
dreadfull ſpectacles that Heaven or Earth, or the

conſiders his infinite goodneſſe, it may ſeeme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that hee ſhould bee moved by us, or by

and to worke <hi>alienum opus,</hi> a ſtrange or uncouth
worke. The wicked and reprobate, after this life,
ſhall alwayes ſee and feele his anger: But though
they ſee him thus, immediately, they doe not ſee
his nature ſo immediately as the Elect ſhall doe, to
whom he ſhewes himſelfe in love; this is his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
viſage, the live-character of his native counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
The manifeſtation of his anger in what part

it, no torments could take hold of them; the
reflex of it upon whom ſoever it lighteth, createth
joy; the fruition of it, is that happineſſe which we
ſeeke. To conclude: <hi>Lactantius</hi> rightly inferres,
<hi>It were impoſsible ſinne ſhould not be odious to him, to
whom goodneſſe is pleaſant and delightfull.</hi> Now his
diſpeaſure at ſinne, is the true cauſe of all diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

may as quickly be rectified, if wee ſay, that <hi>Anger</hi>
and <hi>Hate</hi> are by conſequent, or upon ſuppoſall of
ſinne, as neceſſary to the Divine Nature, as Love
and Mercy, but not ſo naturall. But how either
<hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Anger,</hi> both of them being either formally
paſſions, or indiſſolubly linkt with paſſions, may
be rightly conceived to be in God, is a point worth

ſecret cariage, or cunning contrivance;
take ſmall notice of violent oppoſitions which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly
either overſhoot, or come ſhort of the
game they lye in wait for. But even ſuch moderate
politiques, if their nets be once diſcovered and the
prey caught from them, fall into <hi>Achitophels</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Indignation and mercy, becauſe incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with ſuch meanes as ſerve beſt to politique
ends, are held the companions of fooles. And unto
the world ſo they ſeeme, becauſe they are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
paſſions of reaſon throughly apprehending the
true worth of matters ſpirituall. For though gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
or good education may decently figure the
outward motions; yet is it impoſſible not to bee
vehemently moved, at the miſcariage of thoſe
things, which we moſt eſteeme. And the wiſer we
are in matters ſpirituall, the higher wee eſteeme
the promulgation of religion, the good of Gods
Church, and promotion of his glory. The better
experience we have of his goodneſſe; the more we
pity their caſe which as yet never taſted it: the more
compaſſionate wee are to all that are in that miſery
whence we are redeemed. Did we eſteeme theſe or
other duties of ſpiritual life, as they deſerve: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt
fits of paſſion, which any worldly wiſe
man can be caſt into, wold ſeem but as light flaſhes
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7905:121"/>
to thoſe flames of zeale and indignation w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſight of this miſguided world, would forthwith
kindle in our breſts. It is not then Gods infinit wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which ſwallowes up all paſſion, or exempts
him from thoſe affections which eſſentially include
perturbation; for ſo the moſt zealous and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
ſhould be moſt unlike him in heavenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
But as the ſwift motion of the heaven, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
expreſſeth his immobility or vigorous reſt, then
the dull ſtability of the earth. So doth the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of zeale, of indignation, or other paſſions of
the godly (ſo the motives be weighty and juſt) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite
a more lively reſemblance of his immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or want of paſſion, then the Stoicall apathy, or
worldings inſenſibility in matters ſpirituall can doe.</p>
                     <p>2 How we ſhould in godly paſſions bee likeſt
GOD in whom is no paſſion; or how thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
or affections which are formally in us, ſhould
bee eminently in him; cannot by my barren ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
bee better illuſtrated, then by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the circle in ſome properties with other fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.
A circle, in ſome mens definitive language,
is but a circular line; and to any mans ſenſe (as in
ſome reſpects (perhaps) reaſon muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
it is rather one line, then a comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of different lines, or a multitude of ſides inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in angles. And from the unity of it perhaps it
is, that many flexible bodies, as wands or ſmall
rods of iron, braſſe, &amp;c. which preſently breake if
you preſſe them into angles, or ſeek to frame them
into any other figure, will bee drawne without
danger into a circular forme. Notwithſtanding
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7905:122"/>
ſome infallible mathematicall rules there be expreſt
in tearmes which in ſtrict property of ſpeech
(or univocally) agree only to figures conſiſting of
ſides and angles; whoſe truth and uſe, reaſon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienceth
to bee moſt eminently true in the Circle.
Take a Quadrangle ten yards in length, and foure
in bredth, another eight yards in length, and ſixe
in bredth, a third ſeven yards every way: The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of all three is equall 28. yards; ſo is not
the ſuperficiall quantity, but of the firſt 40. yards,
of the ſecond 48. of the third 49. The ſame inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
alike ſenſible in other many-ſided figures, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords
this generall unqueſtionable rule;<note place="margin">Inter figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap> eſt capacior.</note> Among
figures of the ſame kind, whoſe circumference is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
that whoſe ſides are moſt equall, are moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious.
Yet frame a five-angled figure whoſe whol
circumference is but 28. yards, though the ſides
be not equall, the ſuperficiall quantity of it will
bee greater, then the ſuperficiall quantity of the
former ſquare: and yet a ſixe-angled figure of the
ſame circumference, though the ſides be unequall,
will bee more capacious then that. And ſtill the
more you encreaſe the number of angles, though
without any encreaſe of the circumference, the
greater will the capacity or ſuperficiall quantity of
the figures be, ſpecially if the ſides be not unequall.
From this evident induction ariſeth a ſecond tryed
rule in the Mathematique.<note place="margin">Inter figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natior eſt capacior.</note> Amongſt figures of
divers kinds, whoſe circumferences are equall, that
which hath moſt angles, is alwayes moſt capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
The circle which to our ſenſe ſeemes neither
to have ſides, nor angles; by a double title groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7905:122"/>
on both the former rules, hath the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
for capacity of all other figures. It is more
uniforme than any other, or rather the abſtract or
patterne of uniformity in figures, admitting neither
difference of ranckes, or ſorts, as triangles, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangles,
or other many-ſided figures doe: nor of
inequality betweene its owne internall parts or
lines: neither can one circle bee more capacious
then another of the ſame circumference: nor can
any line in the ſame circle bee longer then another
that is drawne from one part of the circumference,
to another, through the ſame center. It is then in
this reſpect more capacious then any other figure,
becauſe it is moſt uniforme. The ſides of other fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
may be exactly equall, but the diſtance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part of their circumference from the center,
cannot admit ſuch equality, as every part of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
circumference doth. The circle againe is more
capacious then any other figure, becauſe more full
of angles. for the angles which it no where hath
univocally, formally, or conſpicuous to ſenſe; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
apprehends it to have every where eminently.
For as the Philoſopher tells us, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a totan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
and ſo hath the prerogative or royalty, though
not the propriety of the ſecond Rule. It is more
capacious than any other figure, not onely becauſe
it is more <hi>ordinate</hi> or uniforme, but withall, becauſe
it hath more angles than any other figures can
have; even as many as can be imagined, it being a
totangle.</p>
                     <p>3 This analogy betweene ſides and angles as
they are found in the circle and in other figures,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7905:123"/>
mee thinkes well expreſſeth that analogy which
Schoole Divines aſſigne betweene wiſedome, ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
love, hatred, goodneſſe, deſire, &amp;c. as they
are found in God and in man. For no one name or
title of any affection can be univocally attributed
to the Creator and to the creature: and yet the
rules of equity, of mercy, of Iuſtice, of patience, of
anger, of love, which we are commanded to follow,
though not without paſſion or affection, are moſt
truly obſerved by him: yea their truth in him is
infinitely eminent: ſo farre muſt we be from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiting
him to bee without ardent love, without
true and unfaigned good will to us, without wrath
burning like fire to conſume his adverſaries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is without all paſſion. He is moſt loving,
yet never moved with love, becauſe he is eternally
wholly love; He is moſt compaſſionate, yet never
moved with compaſſion, becauſe he is eternally
wholly compaſſion; He is moſt jealous of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and a revenger of iniquity moſt ſevere; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
moved with jealouſie, yet never paſſionate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
becauſe to ſuch as provoke his punitive ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
hee is eternally ſeverity and revenge it ſelfe.
Againe, how the indiviſible Eſſence ſhould bee
wholly love, and wholly diſpleaſure, wholly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and wholly ſeverity, I cannot better illuſtrate
then by the circle, the true embleme of his eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which is as truly <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

ſides, as all angles. And being ſuch, the ſides and
angles cannot be diſtinguiſhed in it: but the ſides
are angles, and the angles ſides; at leaſt they are, if
not eſſentially, yet penetratively the ſame. The
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7905:123"/>
circle likewiſe is as truely <gap reason="foreign">

a totangle or totilater; and did it not contiaine mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicitie
of ſides, as well as of angles in moſt exact
and eminent uniformity, it could not have the full
prerogative of the former rules. Nor could the
indiviſible eſſence either be ſo great or excellent in
himſelfe, or a moderator of all things ſo powerfull
and juſt, as wee beleeve hee is; unleſſe he did emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
containe the perfections of all things poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as well as of any one.</p>
                     <p>4 Some Philoſophers have placed the humane
nature, as a line diameter or aequilibrium in this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſphere; making man the meaſure of all
things, as participating all other natures: much
what after the ſame manner that mixt bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the force and vertues of the elements. And
mans nature, til it was corrupt, did (without doubt)
include ſuch an eminent uniformity to all things
created, as the eye doth unto colours. As hee was
then the true image of God for his eſſence; ſo did
he in this <hi>property,</hi> beare a true ſhadow of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
prerogative, whoſe eſſence, though, for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or greatneſſe of perfections contained in it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
meaſureleſſe, is the moſt true and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<hi>meaſure</hi> of all things that are, or poſſibly can be:
All the conditions or properties of meaſure aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Philoſopher are as truly contained in the
incomprehenſible eſſence, as ſides or angles in the
circle, but farre more eminently. A meaſure it is,
not appliable to meaſurables, for kind or quantity
much different, according to diverſitie of parts,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7905:124"/>
which it hath none, for it is immutably, eternally
and indiviſibly the ſame: and unto it the nature,
eſſence, quality, and quantity of all things, are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
applyed, in that they have actuall being. It is
impoſſible the immutable Creator ſhould be fitted
to any thing created; but in that he is immutable,
and yet eminently containeth all things in his indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
eſſence, he eternally and immutably fits all
the poſſible varieties whereof contingency it ſelfe
is capable. Being all things elſe, hee is fitneſſe it
ſelfe in a moſt eminent and excellent manner: the
preſent diſpoſition of every thing, either, whiles it
firſt begins to be, or continues the ſame, or whiles
it is in the change or motion (whether from good
to evill, or from evill to good, from evill to worſe,
or from good to better) is more exquiſitely fitted
in it owne kind, by eternall, immutable and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
fitneſſe; then it could be by any other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
which the Creator himſelfe could create with
it, or deviſe for it, after the alteration or change
were accompliſhed. In that he is indiviſibly <hi>One,</hi>
and yet eminently <hi>All,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">See Eſay 66. 14, 15, 16.</note> he is immutable, contrariety
it ſelfe unto contraries:<note place="margin">Ezek. 7. 4.</note> Arithmeticall equality it
ſelfe to things equall, Geometrically equall to
things unequall;<note place="margin">Deut. 7. 9, 10.</note> according to every degree of
their unequall capacities, in what ſort ſoever. And
as of his other attributes one truly and really is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo in reſpect of man, his <hi>meaſure</hi> is his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or retribution whether of rewards or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
not the rule onely by which he rewards or
puniſheth. Vnto man in his firſt creation, and
whiles he continued as he created him, he was and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7905:124"/>
would have continued bountie it ſelfe; unto man
yet as he is his creature, he is love it ſelfe: and unto
man made by his own folly an impotent wretched
and miſerable creature, hee is ſo entyrely mercy
and compaſſion if ſelfe, that were there a diſtinct
god of love, or a goddeſſe of mercy, or two infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
living abſtracts of meere love, and meere mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;
they could not be ſo loving and mercifull unto
man touched with the ſenſe of his owne miſeries,
nor ſolicite him ſo ſeriouſly and perpetually unto

This title of

is not given
to the <hi>Sonne,</hi> or to the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> nor are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

God, and of the Attribute <hi>Almightie,</hi> (which is
proper to the Godhead) when the perſons of the
<hi>Sonne</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> with their ſeverall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
are deſcribed; may adminiſter this ſcruple to
men, not much converſant in theſe great myſteries,
<hi>[Whether the Father onely be God, or onely Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
or the onely God Almightie, in ſuch ſort as the
Sonne and holy Ghoſt are not.]</hi> To ſay the Father
onely is God, or the Father onely is Almightie,
were to wrong the Sonne and Holy Ghoſt; to
both whoſe Perſons theſe titles are due: and our
Faith in this point of the Trinitie, above all others,
muſt be uniforme and unpartiall, without reſpect
of <hi>Perſons.</hi> And for the better inſtruction of ſuch
as did not fully apprehend the right meaning
of the Apoſtolique Creede, this uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of our Faith is expreſly taught by <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.
Such as the Father is, ſuch is the Sonne, and ſuch
is the holy Ghoſt: the Father is God, the Sonne is God,
and the holy Ghoſt is God: the Father is Almightie,
the Sonne is Almighty, and the holy Ghoſt Almightie:</hi>
yet ſhall we often reade in Scriptures, and in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Orthodoxal, euen in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> himſelfe, <hi>[that
the Father is the onely God.]</hi> So ſaith the Sonne of
God, <hi>Iohn 17. verſ. 3. This is life eternall, that they
may know thee, the onely true God, and Ieſus Chriſt
whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Doth Chriſt therefore deny
himſelfe to be the onely true God? or rather is it
a part of our beleefe, and of our Saviours meaning
in that place, that wee muſt know not onely God
the Father, but Ieſus Chriſt alſo, whom hee hath
ſent, to be the onely true God? And though it be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7905:130"/>
not in that place expreſſed, yet it is neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in other Scriptures, that the holy Ghoſt is
the onely true God. No Chriſtian may queſtion
this Propoſition, (Pater eſt ſolus Deus) <hi>The Father
is the onely God:</hi> nor this, (Filius eſt ſolus Deus)
<hi>The Sonne is the onely God:</hi> nor this third, (Spiritus
ſanctus eſt ſolus Deus) <hi>The holy Ghoſt is the onely
God.</hi> The Father likewiſe is the onely Almightie,
the Sonne likewiſe is the onely Almightie, and the
holy Ghoſt the onely Almightie: on whom our
Faith is joyntly and uniformly ſet. This uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of our Faith hath for its object, the unitie of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
in the <hi>Trinitie.</hi> But to ſay (Solus Pater eſt
Deus, ſolus Pater eſt omnipotens) <hi>The Father one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is God,</hi> or <hi>the Father onely is Almightie; The Son
onely is God,</hi> or <hi>the Sonne onely is Almightie; The
holy Ghoſt onely is Almightie:</hi> were more then he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
groſſe infidelitie. For every one of theſe
ſpeeches include a deniall both of the coequalitie
of their perſons, and of the unitie of their nature.
Of the ground of this diſtinction, or of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene theſe ſeverall Propoſitions (Solus
Pater eſt Deus, Pater eſt ſolus Deus) <hi>The Father
onely is God,</hi> and <hi>the Father is the onely God, &amp;c.</hi> by
the aſſiſtance of this bleſſed Trinitie wee ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe,
after wee have proved the Sonne to be truly
God, and the holy Ghoſt likewiſe to be truly God,
in the ſeverall Articles which concerne their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and offices. Now the ſame Arguments,
which proves the Sonne to be truly God, and the
holy Ghoſt likewiſe to be truly God, will likewiſe
prove the <hi>Sonne</hi> to be the <hi>onely</hi> God, the onely Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie.

The point next in view, and firſt to bee

<hi>power</hi> and <hi>wiſedome</hi> much greater than can

                     <p>Were the queſtion propounded, what things can

                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:7905:132"/>
the anſwer would be, That is <hi>viſible,</hi> which can be

that is <hi>audible,</hi> which may be heard; that <hi>inaudible,</hi>

[1. Every object of <hi>ſight</hi> is <hi>viſible,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is <hi>viſible</hi> is the object of <hi>ſight:</hi> 2. Every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

<hi>hearing.</hi> To be <hi>viſible,</hi> or <hi>inviſible;</hi> to be <hi>audible,</hi>
or <hi>inaudible,</hi> are termes <hi>relative.</hi> And euery <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>relative terme</hi> ſuppoſeth a ground or root,
whence it ariſeth or reſults; which in nature hath
precedency of it: now it is the <hi>root</hi> or ground
from which the relation reſults, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
object of every facultie whether it be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
as our ſenſes are, or active, as our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is.</p>
                     <p>2. This relation or relative terme, to be <hi>viſible</hi>
or <hi>audible,</hi> reſults from the impreſſion, which the
proper object of ſight or hearing make upon theſe
two ſenſes, or at leaſt from the aptitude which
they have to imprint their proper ſhape or <hi>forme</hi>
upon theſe ſenſes. The object of ſight, which is
<hi>colour</hi> or <hi>light,</hi> cannot <hi>found</hi> the <hi>relation</hi> of <hi>audibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,</hi>
becauſe neyther light nor colour have any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7905:132"/>
aptitude to imprint their <hi>forme</hi> upon the eare; nor
can the relation of <hi>viſibilitie</hi> reſult from <hi>ſounds,</hi>
which are the proper object of <hi>hearing,</hi> becauſe
<hi>ſounds</hi> have no aptneſſe or power to make any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
impreſſion upon the eye. <hi>Sounds</hi> then are the
proper object of hearing, and the ground or root,
whence bodies take the denomination of being <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.
Light</hi> or <hi>colour</hi> is the proper object of ſight, &amp;
the ground or root whence bodies in which light
or colour is found, receive the relative denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of being viſible. Vnto the queſtion then,
<hi>[What things may be ſeene, what things may not bee
ſeene; what things may be heard, or may not bee
heard,]</hi> the true and onely Philoſophicall anſwer
is, Thoſe things onely can be ſeene, which are <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed</hi>
with colours, or participate of light; thoſe
things which have no colour or participation of
light cannot be ſeene. Thoſe bodies onely which
are apt to make or give <hi>ſound,</hi> can be heard; thoſe
which can yeeld no <hi>ſound,</hi> cannot be heard. If it
ſhould further be demanded, why ſounds only are
<hi>audible,</hi> when as neyther colours nor other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
can be <hi>audible,</hi> or become the object of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring?
The only way to aſſoyle this queſtion would
be to inſtruct him that makes it, in the manner how
<hi>ſounds</hi> are produced, how they are carryed by the
ayre unto the eare, how they are there entertained
by the ayre, which the eare or organ of hearing
continually harbours within it ſelfe for their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.
Hee that ſhould ſee the fabricke of the
eare, and take the uſe of its ſeverall parts (of the
<hi>anvile</hi> &amp; the <hi>hammer</hi> eſpecially) into ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7905:133"/>
would ceaſe to enquire why ſounds are
audible rather then colours, and begin to admire
the inexpreſſible skill of the Artificer, which fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
this live-eccho in all more perfect ſenſitive
creatures. No marvell if the eare perceive ſounds,
ſeeing the uſe or exerciſe of this ſenſe is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
imitation of the production of ſounds. And as
no creature underſtands the expreſſions of our ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
internall notions, ſave that onely which is
endowed with the like internall notions of reaſons;
ſo neither could the eare or ſenſe of hearing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſounds, unleſſe it had a continuall internall
<hi>ſound</hi> within it ſelfe. Hee againe that ſhould view
the ſeverall humours of the eye, the Chryſtalline
eſpecially, would never move queſtion, why co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
ſhould make that impreſſion upon the eye,
which they doe not upon the eare.</p>
                     <p>3 The point queſtioned in this part of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
or concerning the meaning of this Attribute
[Omnipotencie] comes to this iſſue. Whether
<hi>power infinite</hi> &amp; <hi>omnipotent</hi> have any object wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
it is, or may be ſo immediately terminated, as
<hi>ſight</hi> or the <hi>viſive facultie</hi> is unto <hi>light</hi> or <hi>colours,</hi>
or as the faculty of hearing is to <hi>ſounds,</hi> whence the
relation or relative denomination of <hi>poſsibilitie</hi>
doth ſo reſult, as viſibilitie doth from the ſight or
viſive facultie, as it reſpecteth colours. If infinite
power preſuppoſe any other object pre-exiſtent to
poſſibilitie, as light and colours are to viſibilitie,
this object muſt needs be eyther privative or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
Something or meere nothing. If wee ſhall
ſay this <hi>object</hi> is a poſitive entitie, eyther it was fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:7905:133"/>
Eternitie without dependence on his Almightie
power, &amp; ſo it ſhould be, as that power is, infinite.
Or if we ſay this ſuppoſed object were from him,
or by him, or had dependance on his power; then
certainly it was <hi>poſsible,</hi> and therefore cannot bee
precedent to all poſſibilitie. Whence it may ſeeme
concluded, that Gods infinite power or Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie
is the onely <hi>foundation</hi> of poſſibilitie, and
by conſequence cannot poſſibly have any <hi>object,</hi>
whereto it is or can be terminated, or ſo fitted, as
the <hi>viſive facultie</hi> or <hi>ſight</hi> is to light or colours.
Howbeit in truth the former reaſons onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the object of Omnipotencie can be no
poſitive entitie, nor the <hi>privation</hi> or negation of
any <hi>determinate</hi> being. But that the ſame <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
power</hi> may have an object purely <hi>negative,</hi> or
including a totall negation of all things numerable,
though their number were potentially infinite, the
former reaſons or the like cannot enforce us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
All things are ſaid to be <hi>poſsible</hi> unto God,
becauſe by his omnipotent power, he can make all
things not out of poſitive poſſibilities or Entities
poſſible, but of meere nothing, that is, without
any poſitive Entitie pre-exiſtent, to ſerve either as
<hi>matter,</hi> agent, or inſtrument. What? ſhall we ſay
then, that things not poſſible onely, but impoſſible,
may be done or made by power Omnipotent? Or
may wee ſay that impoſſibilitie is eyther ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or at leaſt (as ſome have taught) a degree or
part of <hi>non eſſe,</hi> or of <hi>nothing?</hi> But how can that
which <hi>is not,</hi> have any degrees or parts? Or, admit
we might conceive things <hi>impoſsible</hi> or, <hi>impoſsibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:7905:134"/>
to be degrees or parts of <hi>nothing,</hi> yet ſo concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
wee muſt needs conceive them to have the
ſame <hi>negative</hi> conditions or properties, which are
attributed to <hi>non eſſe,</hi> to <hi>ſimple not being,</hi> or to <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
that is, they might be ſuch <hi>objects</hi> of infinite
power, as <hi>non eſſe,</hi> or <hi>not being</hi> is. Yet he that made
all things that are, of nothing and can reſolve them
into nothing againe, doth never attempt or profer
to reſolve them into <hi>impoſsibilities,</hi> nor did hee
make any thing of <hi>impoſsibles.</hi> Whether then <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibilitie</hi> or <hi>impoſsibles</hi> be ſomething or nothing,
how is it poſſible they ſhould ſo reſiſt the power
Omnipotent, which can doe all things, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be made of them? Laſtly, if impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
can be no objects of Gods power, then things
<hi>poſsible</hi> or <hi>poſsibilities,</hi> muſt be the onely object of
it, and ſo we ſhall fall into the former circle, that
God can doe thoſe things onely that are poſſible,
and thoſe things onely are poſſible which God
can doe.</p>

upon Omnipotencie: nothing is <hi>relatively</hi> poſſible,
but by reference to, or by denomination from this
Almighty power. Abſolute poſſibilitie they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>ad modum objecti,</hi> as it were an object that
doth terminate Omnipotent power, not <hi>poſitively</hi>
as colours do ſight, but privatively as <hi>darkneſſe</hi> doth
ſight; or as an empty ſphere without which Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie
it ſelfe doth never worke. This abſolute
<hi>poſsibilitie,</hi> or <hi>poſsibilitie meerly Logicall,</hi> which is
preſuppoſed to <hi>relative</hi> poſſibilitie, as <hi>light</hi> or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
is to <hi>viſibilitie,</hi> cannot otherwiſe be notified
or expreſſed than by this negative, <hi>of not implying
contradiction.</hi> But here the former difficultie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>impoſsibilities</hi> meets with us in another
ſhape. For it will be againe demanded, whether
<hi>contradiction</hi> be any thing or nothing? or how it
ſhould come to oppoſe Gods Almightie power,
more then eyther <hi>non eſſe,</hi> ſimple not being, or all
things that are poſſibly can doe? Can it bee leſſe
then nothing? That is impoſſible; rather it is, if not
ſo much more, yet ſo much worſe then nothing,
as that it cannot <hi>poſsibly</hi> beare the true <hi>forme</hi> or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of any thing; and for this reaſon can be no
object of power Omnipotent. Vnder that notion
which wee have of Omnipotencie or infinite Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Truth it ſelfe,</hi> and <hi>Vnitie it ſelfe</hi> or <hi>Identitie,</hi>
are as eſſentially included, as <hi>Entitie</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> it
ſelfe. It is no impotency in God, but rather the
prerogative of his Omnipotencie, that he cannot
<hi>weaken</hi> his power by diviſion, nor admit any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of imbecilitie, that he cannot deny or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
himſelfe. In that hee is infinitely <hi>true,</hi> or infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7905:135"/>
                        <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelfe, the ratification or approbation
of contradictions, is more incompatible with his
nature or Eſſence, than falſhood is with truth, than
weakneſſe with power, than malice with goodnes.
There is no falſhood unleſſe it include ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
or ſeeds of contradiction: as all <hi>Truth</hi> is the
offspring of unitie or <hi>Identitie.</hi> In concluſion, as
all things which are or poſsibly may be, can be no
more then <hi>participations</hi> of his <hi>Beeing,</hi> who is <hi>Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſelfe:</hi> ſo they muſt by an eternall Law, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they begin to be, beare a true though an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
reſemblance of his <hi>unitie,</hi> of his <hi>Identitie,</hi> of
his <hi>veracitie,</hi> as well as of his power which is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotently
true, omnipotently juſt.</p>
                     <p>5 In anſwer to the laſt difficultie propoſed, it
muſt be ſaid that impoſsibilitie is neyther any poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Entitie, nor is it any part or branch of <hi>non eſſe,</hi>
or of nothing. For in reſpect of him who is <hi>All,</hi>
more then all things, there can be no abſolute <hi>non
eſſe. Hee calleth things that are not as if they were,</hi>
that is, hee can by his <hi>ſole wrod</hi> make all things
which yet are not, which yet have not beene, to
have true being. Hee can make any thing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
That then which we call <hi>impoſsibilitie,</hi> muſt
not be derived from <hi>non eſſe,</hi> nor from falſhood,
which is finally reſolved into contradiction. So that
the rule of contradiction is the <hi>Teſt,</hi> by which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibilities, as well as falſhood muſt be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
and it is more to bee impoſsible then to bee
falſe. From what fountaine then doth impoſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
ſpring? From abſolute and Omnipotent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or from the infinitie of the Divine nature? But
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7905:135"/>
ſeeing in him all power and being is contained,
ſeeing the very poſſibilitie of limited being takes
its beginning from him, the poſſibilitie of weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his power, the poſsibilitie of contradicting
or oppoſing himſelfe, muſt by the eternall Law be
excluded from the object of Omnipotencie. As
we ſay, two negatives make an affirmative, ſo to be
unable to diſ-enable it ſelfe, is no imperfection, no
impotencie; but the greateſt perfection, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
degree of power wherof any nature is capable,
becauſe the impoſsibilitie of diſ-enabling or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
himſelfe is a poſitive branch of the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Omnipotencie. 2. It is not ſo true an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of power in men to be illimited by law, or
to be able to doe what they liſt, as to bee willing
to doe nothing, but that which is lawfull and juſt:
unleſſe mans will be a law to his power, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
a law unto his will, how abſolute and illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſoever his power may bee in reſpect of other
men, or of any coactive law which they can make
to reſtraine it, it may quickly come to make an end
of it ſelfe. And the <hi>end</hi> or ceſſation of power ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
is the worſt kind of limit that can be ſet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
                     <p>The power of the Perſian kings, was ſometimes
ſo abſolute and ſo illimited, that <hi>Cambyſes</hi> having
no poſsitive law to curbe his will, fell in love with
his owne ſiſter. And yet ſo naturall is the <hi>notion</hi>
of mans ſubjection unto ſome law, even unto men
of corrupt mindes, that this lawleſſe King conſulted
his Iudges, whether his deſire to enjoy the love
of his ſiſter, might be countenanced by law. The
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7905:136"/>
effect of theſe Sages anſwer, was, that they knew no
law in ſpeciall, which might warrant the brother
to marry the ſiſter, but they had found a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
law, by which the Kings of Perſia might doe
what they liſt. By the like prerogative of this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
law; another King, upon her requeſt did
delegate his abſolute power unto his Queene for a
day. And ſhe by delegation of this power, having
libertie to doe what ſhe liſt, did uſe it to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of him that gave it her: for ſhee cut off his
head, before ſhe ſurrendred it. It is then a branch
of the Almighties prerogative, that his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
power cannot for a moment be delegated or
bequeathed to any other; that as he can doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he will, ſo nothing can be done or willed by
him, which may derogate from the endleſſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of his infinite Majeſtie, power, truth, or
goodneſſe.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of this doctrine concerning the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of Omnipotencie, and the abſolute <hi>impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie</hi>
of doing any thing that may derogate from
it, is in generall this. As no opinion in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Philoſophers can be convinced of abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
untill it be reſolved into a contradiction ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unto it ſelfe, or unto ſome principle of nature
from which it pretends ſome Originall title of
<hi>Truth:</hi> ſo the only rule for the diſcovering impiety
of opinions in <hi>Divinitie,</hi> or for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vincing their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of hereſie or infidelitie, is by manifeſting
their <hi>repugnancie</hi> or contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
divine Attribute, or to ſome ſpecial promiſe or

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7905:136"/>
and whoſoever denies or contradicts any part of
Gods word, doth contradict the divine truth or
veracitie which no man hath any temptation either
to deny or contradict, but from ſome doubt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
of his Omnipotencie. Of ſuch opinions as

<hi>were Canonicall writers, though their joynt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie

moſt infallible, hath declared the reaſons which
they uſed, to be moſt infallible by the teſtimonie of
two Canonical writers. The firſt is that of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
Pſal. 96. 4, 5.</hi> The Lord is great &amp; greatly to be
praiſed: he is to be feared above all gods. For all the
gods of the Nations are Idols, or gods no-gods: but the
Lord made the heavens. <hi>The Prophet</hi> Ieremy <hi>is more
expreſſe and more peremptorie. chap. 10. verſ. 10,
11, 12.</hi> But the Lord is the true God, he is the living
God and an everlaſting King: at his wrath the earth
ſhall tremble, and the Nations ſhall not bee able to
abide his indignation. Thus ſhall yee ſay unto them,
The gods that have not made the heavens, and the
earth, even they ſhall periſh from the earth, and from
under thoſe heavens. Hee hath made the earth by his
power, he hath eſtabliſhed the world by his wiſdome,
and hath ſtretched out the heavens by his diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>3. The conſonancie between the live oracles of
God and the dictates of reaſon in heathen men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
us this <hi>Aphoriſme,</hi> that it is not <hi>nature</hi> her
ſelfe (which is never otherwiſe than negatively, or
at the moſt <hi>Privatively</hi> oppoſed to the goodneſſe
of God) but the corruption of nature, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
contrarie to the good Spirit of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
men are ſeduced unto Atheiſme. And ſeeing
this corruption of nature whereof <hi>Atheiſme</hi> is the
ſymptome, is the onely diſeaſe of the ſoule; the diſeaſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7905:138"/>
and the ſymptome cannot more kindly be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
then by reviving the ſtrength of nature. The
receipt for reviving and ſtrengthning nature muſt
be compounded of theſe two <hi>Truths,</hi> both evident
by light of reaſon not eclipſed by <hi>interpoſition</hi> of
corrupt affections or malignant habits, or freed
from theſe by illumination of the ſpirit. The firſt
truth is, <hi>that this viſible world did not make it ſelfe,
but had a maker which gave it beginning and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of being:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The two main prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</note> the <hi>ſecond, that the making of this
viſible world doth evince the maker of it to be Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,</hi>
and able to effect whatſoever he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.
But before the former truth can have its
operation upon the humane ſoule which is miſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
the objections of the Atheiſts muſt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.
All his objections may be reduced to theſe
two, <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit;</hi> of nothing nothing can bee
made: whence ſeeing we acknowledge <hi>Creation,</hi>
either to be a making of all things of nothing, or
(at leaſt) to ſuppoſe that ſome things are made of
meere nothing: the truth which we Chriſtians in
this Article beleeve, may ſeeme directly to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
a Philoſophicall truth or principle in <hi>nature.</hi>
This firſt objection is ſeconded by another. To
create or to make ſomething of nothing is to bee
active: or thus, <hi>Creation ſuppoſeth an agent, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
agent preſuppoſeth a patient.</hi> Now if there were
any patient, or paſſive power praeexiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the Act
of creation, this paſſive power or patient wherein
it lodgeth was not created, but muſt have a beeing
from Eternitie. From the difficultie <hi>included</hi> in
this laſt objection, ſome philoſophers did conceive
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7905:138"/>

before the third day,<note n="*" place="margin">Of this Argument ſee <hi>Eraſtus</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his firſt Tome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus.</hi>

Nor did the waters become the common <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
or <hi>mother</hi> of fiſhes, before the fift day, <hi>Let the

that hath life, &amp;c.</hi> Now this production of hearbs
or plants out of the earth, of fiſh and fowle out of
the ſubſtance of the water, was not a meer <hi>conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>actuation</hi> of that power, which the earth &amp;
waters had before; but the Creation of a new po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in them, the continuation of which power, is
part of that, which we call the paſſive power of the
<hi>matter.</hi> Nor had the fiſhes or whales, which God
created, this paſſive power in themſelves from

their firſt creation, but received it from that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God, <hi>ver. 22. Be fruitfull and multiply, and
fill the waters in the ſeas, and let fowle multiply in
the earth.</hi> Nor did the earth become the Common
<hi>mother</hi> of vegetables, as of hearbs, graſſe, trees, &amp;c.
and of more perfect livings creatures, at the ſame
time. It received power to bring forth the one
upon the third day; not enabled to bring forth the
other, untill the fift day; God ſaid, <hi>Let the earth
bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattell,
and creeping thing, and beaſt of the earth.</hi> So that
all theſe and man himſelfe were not immediately
made of nothing, though immediately made by
God himſelfe: for they were made by him of the
ſubſtance of the earth, which was viſible &amp; praeex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent
to their making, though not made of it as of
the <hi>matter.</hi> But when it is ſaid, in the firſt of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,
[God in the beginning made the heaven and
earth,]</hi> it cannot be ſuppoſed or imported, that
he made them of any viſible or inviſible ſubſtance
praeexiſtent: and if hee made them or their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>maſſe</hi> of no ſubſtance praeexiſtent, here
was ſomething made of nothing: but how of
nothing? or what doth this particle import? not
that <hi>nothing</hi> ſhould remaine as an ingredient
in the firſt maſſe, or as if it had the like prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to it, as the earth had to living things: the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
did not ſo turne nothing into ſomething,
as our Sauiour did water into wine. To ſay any
thing could be made of <hi>nothing</hi> in this ſenſe, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the former importances of the particle
<hi>of,</hi> doth indeed imply an evident contradiction; for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7905:140"/>
ſo nothing ſhould be ſomething, and ſimple <hi>not
beeing</hi> ſhould haue a true being. To make nothing
to be ſomething, fals not within the object of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Omnipotent; it can be no part of the Almightie
makers worke. As <hi>Cyphers</hi> cannot bee multiplied
into numbers, by any skill in <hi>Arithmetique,</hi> though
ſuppoſed infinite; ſo neither can <hi>nothing</hi> be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into <hi>ſomething,</hi> nor become an ingredient in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
created by any power, though infinite. As the
Omnipotent Creator is one vnitie it ſelfe, ſo euery
thing which he makes muſt have its unitie or Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie,
it cannot conſiſt of contradictories.</p>
                     <p>2. When then it is ſaid, that all things were
made of nothing, or that creation ſuppoſeth ſome
things to be immediately made of <hi>nothing,</hi> this
particle <hi>of</hi> can onely import <hi>terminum a quo,</hi> the
terme onely of the Action, not any <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:</hi>
and yet the tearme thus imported, can bee
no poſitive Entitie, but a meere negation of any
poſitive Entitie precedent. To make the heauens
and earth of nothing, is in <hi>reall value</hi> no more, then
to make them not of any <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>Entitie</hi> praeex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent,
whether <hi>viſible</hi> or <hi>inviſible,</hi> on which their
Maker did exerciſe his <hi>efficient power</hi> or <hi>efficacie;</hi>
but to give them ſuch beeing, as they then firſt
began to have, that is, a corporeall beeing or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence,
by the meere efficacie or vertue of his <hi>word.</hi>
As, ſuppoſe the Sunne ſhould in a moment be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to tranſmit his light into a cloſe vault of
ſtone; we might truely ſay, this heavenly bodie,
did make light of darkneſſe <hi>tanquam ex termino,</hi> in
that it made light to be there, where was no light
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7905:141"/>
at all before, but meere darkeneſſe. And thus to
make light out of darkneſſe, doth no way argue,
that it turned darkneſſe into light, or that <hi>darkneſſe</hi>
did remaine as an ingredient in the <hi>light</hi> made.
After this manner, did the Amightie make the
heaven and earth of nothing, that is, he made the
<hi>corporeall</hi> maſſe or <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> out of which all things
viſible were made, where no limited ſubſtance,
whether viſible or inviſible, was before; and by the
ſame <hi>efficiencie,</hi> by which this maſſe was made, he
made <hi>place</hi> or <hi>ſpatiouſneſſe quantitative,</hi> which had
no beeing at all before; he did not turne <hi>indiviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi>
into <hi>ſpatiouſnes,</hi> or meere <hi>vacuitie</hi> into <hi>fulnes:
fulnes</hi> and <hi>ſpatiouſneſſe</hi> were the <hi>reſultance</hi> of that
maſſe which was firſt made, without any Entitie or
ingredient praeexiſtent. To make ſomething of
nothing in this ſenſe, implies no contradiction;
there is no impoſſibilitie, that the heaven and
earth ſhould be thus made, but this will not ſuffice
to refute the Atheiſt or infidell. For many things
are poſſible which are not probable, and many
things probable which are not neceſſary. The next
queſtion then is, what neceſſitie there is in the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
rules of nature and reaſon, that the Heavens
&amp; the earth, ſhould be made of nothing. Againſt the
probabilitie onely of <hi>Moſes</hi> his hiſtorie of the firſt
creation, the Atheiſt will yet oppoſe this generall
induction, <hi>That all bodily ſubſtances that begin to be</hi>
what before they were not, that all things <hi>which
we ſee made,</hi> are alwayes made by ſome <hi>efficient</hi>
cauſe, not out of meere nothing, <hi>but of ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
being praexiſtent.</hi> To examine then the general

from whoſe leaſt variation, whether by addition
or ſubtraction, whether by further commixture
or diſſolution, the cauſe or reaſon of truth ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that the rule which conſtantly holds in a great
many like particulars, will not hold in all, becauſe
they are not abſolutely or every way alike.</p>
                     <p>Hee which ſeriouſly obſerves the manner, how
<hi>right angles</hi> are framed will without difficultie
yeeld his aſſent unto this univerſall rule, <hi>That all
right angles are equall,</hi> becauſe hee ſees there is one
and the ſame reaſon of abſolute equalitie in <hi>al</hi> that
can be imagined. And this negative rule, will, by
the ſame <hi>inſpection,</hi> win our aſſent without more
adoe, that if any two angles be unequall, the one
of them (at leaſt) can be no right angle. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
likewiſe of a few particulars, will ſuffice
to make up theſe univerſall never-failing rules.</p>
                     <p>1. Firſt, that the greater any circle is, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
alwayes will the angle of the ſemicircle be.</p>
                     <p>2. The ſecond, that the angle of the leaſt ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle
which can be imagined, is greater then the
moſt capacious <hi>acute-angle</hi> that can be made by
the concurrence of two right lines. And yet it will
as clearly appeare from the inſpection of the ſame
particulars, from which the former rules do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,
that the <hi>angle</hi> of the greateſt <hi>ſemicircle</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
cannot poſſibly be ſo capacious, as every
right <hi>angle</hi> is. The conſideration of the former
rules, ſpecially of the firſt and third, will clearly
manifeſt, that the quantitie contained in theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
how little ſoever they be, is <hi>diviſible</hi> into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
indeterminate parts, or <hi>diviſible</hi> into ſuch
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7905:142"/>
parts, without poſſible end or limitation of <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
But albeit the difference of quantitie between
a right angle and the angle of a ſemicircle, bee <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially
infinite,</hi> or infinitely <hi>diviſible,</hi> according
to parts or portions in determinate; yet will it not
hence follow, that the one <hi>angle</hi> is as great againe
as the <hi>other,</hi> according to the <hi>ſcale</hi> of any diſtinct
or determinate quantitie, or <hi>expreſsible</hi> portions.
And this obſervation in Mathematicall quantitie,
would quickly checke or diſcover the weakneſſe
of many <hi>calculatory Arguments</hi> or inductions oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
uſed by great Divines in matters morall or
civill. As for example, that every <hi>ſinne</hi> deſerveth
puniſhment <hi>infinite,</hi> becauſe every ſinne is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
committed againſt an <hi>infinite</hi> Being or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie.
And the greater, or more ſoveraigne the
Majeſtie is, which wee offend; the greater alwayes
will the offence be, and meritorious of greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
Yet all this onely proves, an infinitie
of <hi>indeterminate degrees</hi> in every offence againſt
the divine Majeſtie, by which it exceedes all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the ſame kinde committed onely againſt
man: it no way inferres an <hi>infinite</hi> exceſſe or ods
of <hi>actuall</hi> determinate puniſhment,<note place="margin">See the firſt part of the Divine Eſſence &amp; Attributes, chap. 20. pag. 219. 220.</note> or ill deſerts.
For this reaſon, wee have derived the juſt <hi>award</hi>
of everlaſting ſupernaturall paines, unto tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and tranſeunt (bodily or naturall) pleaſures,
from the contempt of Gods infinite goodneſſe,
which deſtinates no creatures unto everlaſting

joyes; nor were any of them infallibly deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto everlaſting death, untill they had by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary

tranſgreſſion, or continuance in deſpiſing
of the riches of his goodneſſe, made themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of the bliſſe to which hee had deſtinated
them.</p>
                     <p>2 But to returne unto the force or efficacie of
induction: that (wee ſay) is neyther ſo cleare, nor
ſo facile in matters phyſicall or morall, as it is in
the Mathematiques. Now, the reaſon, why <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
inductions are ſo difficultly made, in matters
naturall, is, becauſe the <hi>ſubject</hi> of naturall <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi>
is not ſo <hi>ſimple</hi> or <hi>uncompounded,</hi> as Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
bodies or figures are: and yet are naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ſubject to greater <hi>varietie</hi> of <hi>circumſtances,</hi>
more obnoxious to alteration by occurrences ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
then abſtract lines, or <hi>motionleſſe</hi> figures,
or bodies are. The cunningeſt Alchymiſt (albeit
hee could exactly temper his furnace to all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
degrees of heate, that any fewell, of what
kinde ſoever, could afford) cannot by any fire, or
by any degree of <hi>heate,</hi> which iſſues from it, hatch
the moſt imperfect bird that flyes: yet if he ſhould
hence inferre, that no birds could bee hatched by
any kinde of heate, daily experience would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
his aſſertion of falſhood, and his induction,
although it conſiſted of ten thouſand inſtances or
experiments taken from the heate of the forge, or
furnace, to be altogether lame. A man mighty try
the like concluſion of hatching birds, in all the
ſands, that this Iland affords, upon the <hi>eggs</hi> of all
the <hi>fowles</hi> that breed in it, or about it, and finde
their <hi>barrenneſſe</hi> and unaptneſſe for bringing forth
any flying Creature, to bee as great, as it is for

bringing forth wheate or other corne. And I am

[No viſible agent can make any thing

cannot hatch her young ones. The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
viſible agents, may be much greater, then
the difference betweene the heate or warmth of
divers bodies. No earthly bodies can produce
heate in others, but either by heate inherent in
themſelves or by motion, yet this will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that no celeſtiall bodie (the Sunne for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
can produce heat in bodies ſublunary, unleſſe
it ſelfe be inherently hot, or at leaſt not without
motion. It is more then probable, that the Sunne
is not <hi>formally</hi> or inherently <hi>hot,</hi> and yet although
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7905:144"/>
it ſhould ſtand ſtill, (as once it did) in its ſphere

to make any perfect inductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
an vniverſall rule, from earthly bodies, which
ſhall conclude bodies Coeleſtiall, or from agents
ſublunarie or uiſible, which ſhall as uniformely
hold true in an agent inviſible and ſupercoeleſtiall,
is more difficult then to twiſt ropes of looſe ſand.
That which the Naturaliſt ſhould proove, if hee
would bee an Atheiſt or infidell in graine, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the truth of Scriptures with probabilitie,
is, that there is no inviſible or ſpirituall Agent.
And this is the point whereat the ſecond obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
aymes: there can be no agent without a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
no exerciſe of Art, or power, without ſome

Creation it ſelfe is an <hi>action,</hi> a reall <hi>action,</hi> yet not

For no reall <hi>attribute,</hi> can be in the Creator, which

the cauſe is concluded, that every agent
though Omnipotent ſuppoſeth a patient.</p>
                     <p>2. But it is one thing to ſuppoſe or require, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7905:145"/>
to require or ſuppoſe a patient, another to require

ſome reall <hi>matter</hi> or ſubject, whereon to worke.
But this kind of <hi>patient</hi> is no juſt compere, no full

the laſt ranke, (for inſtance) are <hi>Phyſicall</hi> medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
or all ſuch workes as Nature of her owne
accord, doth not attempt or undertake, but onely
as ſhee is ſet a working by Art. Natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which they are compounded by the Apothecarie:
who notwithſtanding cannot compound them
without the miniſtery or operation of <hi>Nature.</hi> The
Phyſitian may allot the ſeverall quantitie of every
ingredient, beſides the proportion betwixt them;
but the mixture muſt be immediately effected by
<hi>heate,</hi> or other naturall qualities. So likewiſe muſt
the <hi>extraction</hi> or <hi>expreſsion</hi> of many ſimples bee
wrought by Nature, but at the appointment or
direction of the Phyſitian. Nature doth not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the making of Bell-metall, much leſſe of
Bells; and yet ſhe affords all the ingredients to the
Bell-founder, who cannot mixe them by any <hi>art,</hi>
or skill, without the <hi>heate</hi> of the fire, or other ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of <hi>Nature,</hi> ſet on worke or directed by him.
Workes meerly <hi>naturall</hi> comprehend all ſorts of
bodies generable, whether the elements, or bodies
mixt. The generation of every ſuch body preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
a mutation or alteration of qualities in the
matter, before it become capable of a new <hi>forme</hi>
or <hi>nature.</hi> Every alteration of qualitie wrought in
any ſublunary body (whether it be a praeviall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
or introduction to a new <hi>forme</hi> or <hi>nature;</hi>
or whether it be accompliſhed without generation
of any new ſubſtance) is the proper effect or worke
of the agent, which cauſeth it. So is every artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<hi>worke</hi> or <hi>forme,</hi> the effect or worke of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7905:146"/>
So that Art hath its proper effects as well as
Nature, and every artificiall <hi>effect</hi> or <hi>worke</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
an <hi>efficiencie</hi> or agencie in the Art or Artiſt:
yet doth not the exerciſe of this active force or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie,
eyther preſuppoſe or require any ſuch
paſſive alteration of quality in the matter or <hi>ſubject,</hi>
whereon it workes, as <hi>Nature</hi> requires in her <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</hi>
Every <hi>Statue</hi> or Image of <hi>wood,</hi> is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the Statuarie, or a worke of the <hi>Art</hi> of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery;
yet doe not theſe workes, being meerly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall,
eyther ſuppoſe, or neceſſarily require any
<hi>alteration</hi> of <hi>qualitie</hi> in ſtone and wood. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
produceth no naturall <hi>effect</hi> or <hi>qualitie,</hi> which
was not in the ſtone <hi>before,</hi> but onely makes that
<hi>viſible</hi> and apparant to the eye, which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hidden or enveyled in the ſtone. Every <hi>Letter</hi> of
the Decalogue was in the Tables of ſtone, before
they were <hi>ingraven,</hi> eyther by the finger of God
or by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and became legible onely by their
Art or skill of ingraving; yet not made legible by
any <hi>addition</hi> of <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> of <hi>quantitie,</hi> or <hi>qualitie,</hi>
but by meere <hi>abſciſion</hi> of quantitative parts. And
this abſciſion, from which viſible <hi>characters,</hi> or <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate</hi>
figures <hi>reſult,</hi> whether in wood or ſtone, is
the proper <hi>effect</hi> of the Carver or Ingraver. Both
theſe inductions following, univerſally taken, are
falſe, (though both true in their proper ſubject:)
[1. No Statuary, or Carver, or other like Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
can produce his proper worke, without ſome
abſciſion or variation of quantitie in the ſubject,
whereon hee workes: therefore Nature cannot
produce her proper effects, without ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7905:147"/>
of quantitie in the <hi>matter</hi> or ſubject wherein
ſhee workes. 2. Naturall agents or efficients ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
produce their proper effects, but by working
ſome alteration or qualitie in the Matter: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no Artificer can produce the proper workes
of his Art, without the like alteration of qualitie
in the <hi>ſubject</hi> whereon hee workes.] Nor will it
follow, that becauſe effects meerly artificiall may
be wrought without any alteration of qualitie,
therefore mixt <hi>effects,</hi> or workes partly <hi>naturall,</hi>
partly <hi>artificiall,</hi> as compounded Medicines or
Bell-metall, can be ſo wrought. Leaſt of all can
it be inferred, that becauſe <hi>Art</hi> as well as <hi>Nature</hi>
ſuppoſeth a ſubject praeexiſtent whereon to worke;
therefore the <hi>Agent ſupernaturall,</hi> or the <hi>Efficient
ſuperartificiall,</hi> alwayes preſuppoſeth ſome matter
or ſubject praeexiſtent, out of which, or in which
hee produceth his proper worke. The reaſon why
the <hi>former</hi> Inductions faile, is becauſe the <hi>Agents</hi>
or <hi>Efficients</hi> are of a different <hi>ranke</hi> or <hi>kinde.</hi> And
the<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Ariſt lib. 1. Poſter. Analyt. cap.</note>

as of <hi>demonſtration, Non licet tranſcendere a genere

muſt not rove from one kinde of ſubject to
another. And the reaſon why in thus <hi>roving</hi> he
ſhall certainly faile of his intended concluſion, is,
becauſe the principles whence the intended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
muſt be inferred, cannot be gathered but
by induction, and no <hi>induction</hi> can prove any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<hi>Maxime,</hi> unleſſe <hi>it conſiſt</hi> of <hi>particulars</hi> of

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7905:147"/>
nor mathematicall principles from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
philoſophicall. Nor can Artificiall
<hi>Maximes</hi> or concluſions (eſpecially negative) bee
gathered from experiments naturall, nor <hi>Maximes</hi>
naturall from obſervations in ſubjects meerely <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall.</hi>
Leaſt of all can any theologicall maximes,
be ratified from experiments meerely naturall, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall,
or mathematicall; but onely by inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or reaſons abſtract and metaphyſicall, that is,
ſuch as hold true in all Arts or ſciences whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
The onely certaine rule, which all the former
inductions can afford, is this: There can bee no
reall <hi>effect,</hi> whether artificiall, naturall, or ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
without an efficient: Nothing which now
is not, or ſometimes was not, could poſſibly bee
made without ſome <hi>agent</hi> or maker: betweene
every naturall Agent and its patient, betweene eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Artificer and his worke, there alwayes reſults a
mutuall <hi>relation</hi> of efficient and <hi>effect.</hi> But this rule
will not abide the turning: Betweene every effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and its proper <hi>effect,</hi> there alwayes reſults a
mutuall relation of <hi>agent</hi> and <hi>patient;</hi> if by this
terme <hi>patient</hi> wee underſtand a <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>ſubject</hi>
praeexiſtent to the exerciſe of the agents effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie.</p>
                     <p>4 The uſuall diviſion of Agents into artificiall,
naturall, and ſupernaturall, ſuppoſeth a three-fold
diverſitie in their objects, betwixt which there is
this proportion, As <hi>nature</hi> alwayes affordeth <hi>art</hi>
a compleat naturall ſubject to worke upon: ſo the
<hi>ſupernaturall</hi> agent, or ſupreme <hi>efficient,</hi> exhibits
that imperfect ſubſtance or matter unto <hi>nature,</hi>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:7905:148"/>
which ſhee brings unto perfection. Nature doth
ſo unto Art, as it is done to <hi>her</hi> by a <hi>benefactor ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall.</hi>
Vnto this obſervation upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
diviſion, wee can adde no more, nor can any
more be required, beſides a juſt proofe that there
is an agent ſupernaturall, which ſometimes had <hi>no
matter</hi> at all to worke upon, but made even Nature
her ſelfe, and the paſſive <hi>capacitie</hi> or <hi>ſubject</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhee workes, of no worke or <hi>matter</hi> praeexiſtent.
The matter it ſelfe, and nature it ſelfe, are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<hi>effects</hi> of his active force or <hi>efficiencie.</hi>
Now to beate the Naturaliſt at his owne weapon,
wee are to make proofe of this aſſertion by full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
and ſtrength of reaſon grounded upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
in every ſubject wherein the Naturaliſt
can inſtance. Firſt, it is univerſally true of all the
workes as well of Nature, as of Art, which now
are perfect, and ſometimes were not ſo, that they
did not make themſelves, but had (reſpectively)
their ſeverall makers or efficient cauſes, which
brought them unto that perfect eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which now they have. The moſt perfect works
of nature cannot put themſelves into a <hi>perfect</hi> arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
forme, without the help of ſome Artificer.
Stones doe not naturally grow into <hi>Statues,</hi> nor
trees into the <hi>pictures</hi> or Images of men or birds:
Braſſe and Copper, with other metalls conceived
in the bowells of the earth, doe not either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or by the help of <hi>naturall</hi> cauſes which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them, caſt or mould themſelves into <hi>Guns</hi> or
<hi>Bullets.</hi> The Earth and Water doe not worke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the live-ſubſtance of plants or vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7905:148"/>
but are firſt wrought, and (as it were) kneaded
together by the heate of the Sunne; firſt altered, &amp;
then incorporated into the ſubſtance of ſuch trees,
by the vegetative faculty, which is actually reſident
and praeexiſtent in the trees or plants, which are
nouriſhed by them. There is no ſublunarie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which did not take beginning, either entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and together, or <hi>piece-meale</hi> and ſucceſſively.
The elementall bodies of the ayre and water, were
not totally the ſame a thouſand yeares agoe, that
now they are: both continue the ſame they were by
equivalencie of ſucceeding parts, or daily addition
by new generation. Now ſucceſſive generation
ſuppoſeth an end or deſtruction of that that was, &amp;
a beginning of that which ſucceedes in its place;
and the beginning of every thing, ſuppoſeth a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner
or cauſe efficient, to give it being. The <hi>race</hi>
or continuation of more perfect ſublunary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
as of vegetables and moving creatures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
the ſame, not by equivalency of ſucceeding
parts, but by a totall production of diſtinct indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dualls.
And every diſtinct individuall tree or liuing
creature, hath its immediate and proper efficient,
as well as its materiall cauſe, nothing can give it
ſelfe a diſtinct numericall being.</p>
                     <p>5 What is the reaſon then, why the workes of
nature, which are perfected in their kinde by their
proper efficients (as trees come to full growth)
cannot transforme themſelves into bodies artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
without the worke of the Artificer? What is the
reaſon why the imperfect <hi>maſſe,</hi> wherein the ſeeds
of nature are contained, cannot grow up into a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7905:149"/>
perfect or compleate body naturall, without the
<hi>efficiencie</hi> of ſome other in the ſame kinde already
compleate? <hi>Fortes creantur fortibus. Nature</hi> makes
nothing perfect, but by the help of ſome Agent
formerly made <hi>perfect:</hi> Doth the <hi>perfection</hi> of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
artificiall by an <hi>indiſpenſable</hi> Law of neceſſitie,
require a perfect worke of nature praeexiſtent to
the operation of Art: and doth this perfect worke
of nature, bee it braſſe, wood, or ſtone, by a like
indiſpenſable Law of neceſſitie, require an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
maſſe or <hi>matter</hi> praeexiſtent to the naturall <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents</hi>
or efficients, which mould or kneade it into
its perfect or ſpecificall <hi>forme?</hi> And ſhall not this
imperfect maſſe, with all its ſeverall <hi>Elements</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients</hi>
that can be required to the perfection of
any naturall body, more neceſſarily require ſome
precedent <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe of its imperfect <hi>being</hi> or
<hi>exiſtence?</hi> This cannot be conceived; for if theſe
imperfect ſubſtances, whereof any naturall body is
made, could eyther give beginning of being to
themſelves, or have it from no cauſe efficient,
they ſhould bee in this reſpect much more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
than the more perfect workes of nature, in
that they eyther make themſelves, or have no
maker.</p>
                     <p>Vpon this principle of nature, or from this <hi>impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie</hi>
in nature [That any viſible work whether
naturall or artificiall, ſhould either give it ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or have its being from no cauſe precedent] did
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> Tully Lib. de na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note>
                        <hi>Tully</hi> rightly argue, that as a man comming into
an houſe, wherein were no live creatures ſaue Rats
and Mice, could not conceive that either the houſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7905:149"/>
did make it ſelfe, or had no other maker beſides
theſe Rats and Mice, which were found in it: So
neither can it be imagined, that this viſible ſpheare
wherein the workes of Art and Nature, are daily
ſeene, and doe daily begin to be and expire; could
either make it ſelfe, or have <hi>beeing</hi> of it ſelfe,
without beginning, without a Maker ſuper-arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall,
or an efficient ſupernaturall. Every part of
this Vniverſe conſidered alone, is a worke of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but the exquiſite harmony betweene them,
is a worke more then Artificiall. All that <hi>nature</hi>
can adde to <hi>art,</hi> or art to <hi>nature,</hi> is but a ſhadow
of that great Artificers skill, which compoſed
the ſeverall workes of nature into ſo excellent a
forme, and tuneth their diſcording qualities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch exact harmony. The induction of <hi>Tully</hi>
is more briefly, but more pithily and expreſſely
gathered by our Apoſtle Heb. 3. ver. 4. <hi>Euery houſe
is builded by ſome man, but hee that built all things
is God.</hi> But if every houſe bee built by ſome man,
how is God ſaid to build all things? ſhall every
builder of an houſe be a God? No: but whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
man doth build, God doth likewiſe build.
<hi>For except the Lord doth build the houſe, they labour
in vaine, that are builders of it.</hi> Pſalm. 127. 1. Better
it were to bee idle or to doe nothing, then either
to be laborious in building houſes, or watchfull in
guarding Cities ſtrongly built, unleſſe the Lord
doe afford not onely his <hi>concurrence,</hi> but his <hi>bleſsing</hi>
to the labours of the one, and to the <hi>watchfulneſſe</hi>
of the other. But in this argument wee may expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
without impeachment of digreſſion from the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7905:150"/>
matter, or of diverſion from our ayme, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Treatiſe of <hi>divine providence.</hi>
                     </p>

are conſtituted by them, the induction is as cleare
to every mans ſenſe or underſtanding, as any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall
induction can bee. The naturaliſt is
neither able nor diſpoſed to except againſt the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalitie
of it, or to inſtance in any ſublunarie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
which hath not a true <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe, or an
<hi>agent</hi> precedent; from whoſe efficacie its phyſicall
or eſſentiall <hi>forme,</hi> was either made, or did reſult.
The queſtion onely remaines about the <hi>efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>
or <hi>production</hi> of the <hi>prime</hi> or common <hi>matter.</hi>
Seeing it is the <hi>mother</hi> of generation, wee will not
vexe the Naturaliſt by demanding a <hi>generative</hi>
cauſe <hi>efficient</hi> of its beeing, but that it muſt have
ſome cauſe <hi>efficient,</hi> wee ſhall enforce him to grant
from a generall Maxime moſt in requeſt with men
of his profeſſion. The Maxime is [That the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall
progreſſe from effects to their cauſes,
or from inferiour to ſuperiour cauſes, is not like
Arithmeticall or geometricall progreſſions; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee infinite.] Wee muſt at length come to
one ſupreme cauſe <hi>efficient,</hi> which in that it is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame,
is a cauſe of cauſes, but no effect, and being
no effect, nor cauſe ſubordinate to any other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7905:150"/>
it can have no limit of Beeing, it can admit
no reſtraint in working. Whatſoever we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
as poſſible to have limited Beeing, or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of ſuch Beeing, muſt haue both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it &amp; by it.
Now if the perfect workes of nature, bodies ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunarie
of what kind ſoever, ſuppoſe a <hi>poſſibilitie</hi>
phyſicall included in the prime and common
matter, before they have actuall Being; if it imply
no contradiction for them to have <hi>beginning</hi> of
<hi>Beeing,</hi> it will imply no contradiction, that the
prime <hi>mater</hi> it ſelfe or imperfect <hi>maſſe,</hi> whereof
they are made, ſhould have a beginning of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
<hi>beeing;</hi> That Phyſicall beeing which it hath,
doth preſuppoſe a logicall <hi>poſsibilitie</hi> of beeing, as it
is; that is, no contradiction, for it ſometimes to be,
and ſometimes not to haue beene. This ſupreame
cauſe or agent which (as we ſuppoſe,) did reduce
the logicall <hi>poſsibilitie</hi> of the prime matter of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
bodies into Act, cannot be the heavens, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of the hoaſt of heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither the ſun, moon
nor ſtars. For, albeit the Sun be the efficient cauſe,
by which moſt workes of nature in this ſublunarie
part of the world, are brought to perfection: yet
is it no cauſe at all of that imperfect maſſe or part
of nature, on which it workes. Vnleſſe it had
ſome matter to worke upon, it could produce no
reall or ſolid effect by its influence, light or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
how ever aſſiſted with the influence of other
ſtars or planets. Yet muſt this prime matter, have
ſome cauſe; otherwiſe it ſhould be <hi>more perfect</hi> than
the bodily ſubſtances, which are made of it. For
they all ſtand in neede, both of this prime <hi>matter,</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:7905:151"/>
as a cauſe in it kinde concurrent to their producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of the <hi>efficiencie</hi> of the Sunne or other
coeleſtiall Agents to worke or faſhion the <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls</hi>
or Ingredients, of which they are made. If
either this common matter of ſublunary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
or the Sunne which workes upon it, had
no ſuperiour cauſe to limit their beeing or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
their offices; both of them ſhould bee <hi>infinite</hi>
in Beeing; both <hi>infinite</hi> in operation. Now if the
matter were infinite in beeing: the Sunne or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
coeleſtiall Agents, could have no <hi>beeing</hi> but
in it, or from it. For if the <hi>Sunne</hi> were infinite in
operation, the matter it ſelfe could bee nothing at
all; no part of nature, unleſſe it were a worke or
effect of the Sunne. Infinitie in beeing <hi>excludes</hi> all
poſſibilitie of other Beeing <hi>ſave in</hi> it and <hi>from</hi> it.
And infinitie in operation, ſuppoſeth all things
that are limited, whether in beeing or operation,
to bee its workes, or <hi>reſultances</hi> of its illimited
efficacie.</p>

to wit, that as well the <hi>efficient</hi> as the <hi>materiall</hi> cauſe
derive the neceſſitie of their cauſalitie from the

The <hi>Sunne</hi> doth not runne its daily courſe from
Eaſt to Weſt, or make its annuall progreſſe from
North to South, to get it ſelfe heate, or for the
increaſe of its native force or vigour, by change of
Climates; but for the propagation of vegetables,
for the continuance of life and health in more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſublunary ſubſtances. If then wee can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
that thoſe vegetables or more perfect ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
bodies, for whoſe continuall propagation, for
the continuance of whoſe life and well-fare the
Sunne becomes ſo indefatigable in its courſe, had
a true beginning of beeing, that the propagation is
not infinitely circular: the cauſe will be concluded,
that as well the common matter, whereof they are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7905:152"/>
made, as the Sunne it ſelfe which produceth them,
had a beginning of <hi>beeing</hi> and <hi>operation</hi> from the
ſame ſupreame cauſe, which appointed the <hi>Sunne</hi>
thus to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> its heate and <hi>influence,</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
and comfort of this inferiour world. To
prove that theſe ſublunarie more perfect bodies,
as vegetables, &amp;c, had a beginning of beeing or
propagation; no Argument can be more effectuall
to the Naturaliſt, or others that will take it into
ſerious conſideration; than the diſcuſſion of that
probleme, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath propounded, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Egg were before the Hen, or the Hen before
the Egg.</hi> The ſtate of the queſtion will be the ſame
in all more perfect vegetables, or living Creatures,
which uſually grow from an imperfect or weake
eſtate to a more perfect and ſtronger: <hi>[Whether the
Acorne were before the Oake, or the Oake before the
Acorne. Whether the Lyon had precedencie of nature
to the Lyons whelp, or the Lyons whelp unto the Lyon.</hi>
The induction may be for eyther part moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate,
in reſpect of all times and of all places, if
with the Naturaliſt wee imagine the world to have
beene without beginning, or without ending. No
Naturaliſt can ever inſtance in any more perfect
<hi>feathered</hi> fowle, which was not firſt covered with
a ſhell, or contained in ſome more imperfect <hi>filme;</hi>
in any Bull which was not firſt a Calfe; in any Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was not firſt a whelp; in any Oake,
which did not firſt ſpring from an Acorne: unleſſe
he inſtance in painted Trees, in brazen Bulls, or

univerſally true, (Omnia ortus habent, ſua<expan>

incrementa) <hi>All have their beginning, all their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
increaſe or augmentation.</hi> The induction again
is for the other partie as compleate and perfect.
There never was a true Acorne, which did not
preſuppoſe an Oake; nor a Lyons whelp which
did not preſuppoſe a Lyon to beget it, and a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſſe
to bring it forth. Now every productive
cauſe, every live-ſubſtance, which produceth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by proper <hi>cauſalitie</hi> or efficiencie, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
precedencie of nature and of time, in reſpect
of that which is produced by it. The Lyon is in
order of nature and of <hi>time,</hi> before his whelp, and
yet is every Lyon wherein the Naturaliſt can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
a whelp before it be a Lyon; ſo is the Oake,
in order of nature and of time, before the Acorne,
and yet cannot the Naturaliſt inſtance in any Oake,
which was not an Acorne or plant before it grew
to be an Oake. If then eyther the race of Lyons, or
the propagation of Oakes, had no beginning; it
would inevitably follow, that Oakes had beene
perpetually before Acornes, and Acornes perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
before Oakes; That Lyons whelpes from
eternitie had precedency or prioritie of time of
Lyons, and Lyons the like precedencie or prioritie
of time of their whelps. And if they had bin mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
each before other from eternitie, according to
prioritie of time and nature, they muſt have beene
mutually each after other. How the Naturaliſt will
be able to digeſt this circular revolution of priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and poſterioritie, in reſpect of the ſame indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall
natures, or what hee will ſay to theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inconveniences, I cannot tell, but deſire to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7905:153"/>
know: Every whole or perfect <hi>Fiſh,</hi> which the
Naturaliſt hath heard or read of, had beginning of
its individuall Beeing from Spawne. This induction
is moſt compleate and perfect in the Schoole of
Nature, moſt irrefragable by the ſuppoſition of
the Naturaliſt with whom wee diſpute. Every Fiſh
hath a beginning from Spawne, and that which
hath a beginning from Spawne, hath a beginning
of its beeing. No Fiſh or Spawne is or hath beene
immortall, or without beginning. Now if it bee
univerſally true, that every particular Fiſh hath its
beginning, it implies an evident contradiction, to
ſay that the race of Fiſhes, which conſiſt onely of
particular Fiſhes, was without beginning. There
muſt in every race of Fiſhes be ſome firſt Fiſhes, or
firſt Spawnes, before which there was none of the
ſame kind, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which this mutual propagation did
take its beginning. And though this propagation
be without end, yet could it not be without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
unleſſe wee would grant that fiſhes are
not onely of an <hi>incorruptible</hi> nature, but of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
infinite or eternall. If there were no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this mutuall propagation, it would bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
whether the number of fiſhes or Lyons
that ſhall bee (granting what the Naturaliſts ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that this propagation ſhall be endleſſe) can
ever be as great, as the number of thoſe Fiſhes and
Lyons that have beene? Or whether the number
of thoſe that have beene, may not be conceived to
be more infinite, or in another ſort infinite, than
the number of thoſe that ſhall be. That the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Fiſhes, or Lyons, which, from this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7905:153"/>
may be, (ſuppoſe the world were never to
end) can be no otherwiſe infinite then potentially
or ſucceſſively onely, or by addition, becauſe there
ſhall never be any laſt Lyon, or fiſh, &amp;c. after which
there ſhall bee no more, the Naturaliſt will not
denie. For thoſe Lyons or fiſhes, which from this
point of time ſhall be, have as yet no actuall beeing,
nor have they before this time had any ſuch bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Whence it is cleare, that their number can
never be actually infinite, but infinite onely by <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>

if fiſhes have beene produced from Spawne, and
Spawne from fiſhes, without any beginning of

Fiſh, which could produce Spawn, had actuall bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

had beene without beginning, their number
muſt needes be actually infinite, ſo infinite that
there could have beene no more than have beene,
that there can be no more than now are. <hi>That</hi> onely
is <hi>actually</hi> infinite, unto which nothing of the ſame

had beene from eternity, the number of things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
ſhould have been actually infinite in every
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7905:154"/>

thing ſhould be actually <hi>infinite</hi> from eternitie, and
not bee alike actually infinite throughout every

ſhall be to morrow. It is againe impoſſible, that
any thing ſhould be actually infinite in any part of

made all things viſible in their kind, not by meanes

or Omnipotent power, by which he made the firſt
maſſe out of nothing. In the prime and Cardinall

though by ſupernaturall efficiencie, in that
order or method, which Nature, by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

But in the ſeverall fountaines or roots of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

is interſerted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> onely for diſtinction ſake,
or in reſpect of our incapacitie to conceive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
of Gods workes. But if all things had

<hi>[In the beginning God made the heaven and the
earth]</hi> we doe not reade, that God ſaw it was
good. What is the reaſon? becauſe as yet they
were not perfected in their kind; but deſtinated
onely unto more perfection. Of the light which
was created the firſt day (ſaith <hi>Moſes) God ſaw
that it was good.</hi> But ſo he ſaith not of the ſecond
dayes worke, which was the ſeparation or diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betweene the <hi>waters</hi> which are above the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,
and the <hi>waters</hi> beneath it. What doth
this omiſſion of the divine approbation intimate
unto us? thus much, if no more, That the ſecond
dayes worke did not bring the waters to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and uſe whereunto they were deſtinated.
But of the third dayes worke, in which the earth
was ſevered from the waters, under the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and enabled by his creative power, to bring
forth Hearbes and other Vegetables, God (ſaith
<hi>Moſes) ſaw that it was good.</hi> And ſo it is likewiſe ſaid
of the fourth dayes worke, in which the Sun and
Moone and the Stars were made; and ſo likewiſe
of the fift, wherein the water was authorized to
bring forth fowles and fiſhes perfect in their kind:
and laſtly of the ſixt day, wherein man was made,
it is ſaid, that God ſaw all that he had made, and it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7905:156"/>

The concluſion it ſelfe, or the laſt propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and nothing, cannot be more in number or
more infinite, than are the entitive degrees of any
created ſubſtance. And theſe are not actually or
abſolutely infinite, nor can the diſparity betwixt
ſomething and nothing, betwixt <hi>nothing</hi> and the
moſt <hi>excellent eventure</hi> that is, be ſo great or ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
infinite, as is the diſparity betwixt the
moſt excellent creature that is or can be, and the
<hi>one</hi> Omnipotent Creator, who alone is abſolutely

                     <p>2 But be it onely ſuppoſed, no way granted,
that the power of making ſome viſible ſubſtance
out of nothing, might be delegated to ſome Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
the exerciſe of this power thus delegated,
would not inferre the <hi>Exerciſer</hi> of it, but only the
<hi>Author,</hi> to be Omnipotent. For to be Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
includes as much as to be able to do all things,
which imply no contradiction; as much as to make
all things that can be conceived as <hi>logically poſsible,</hi>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:7905:159"/>
out of nothing, becauſe all ſorts or kinds of <hi>being,
numerable</hi> or <hi>comprehenſible,</hi> are <hi>eminently</hi> contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the incomprehenſible Eſſence; of which
the attribute of Omnipotency is a chiefe preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
It is not then all one, to be enabled to make
ſome thing, ſuppoſe a gnat or flye, out of nothing;
and to be able to make as many things, as now are
extant in the world, or much better than theſe are,
out of meere nothing. It is a maxime evident by
light of reaſon, that no Doner can really give more
than he hath to give: ſuppoſe he were willing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
and authorized to give himſelfe: to give its
whole nature with the appurtenances to any other
Creature already extant, or in poſſibility to bee
<hi>created.</hi> It being then ſuppoſed, that an Angell by
ſome ſpeciall delegation from the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Eſſence or power Omnipotent, might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to make ſomething of nothing, it were not
poſſible that he ſhould make any nature or eſſence
more excellent than himſelfe. Yet it is poſſible,
that there might be ſome more excellent created
ſubſtance than this Angell: yea of neceſſity there
ſhould be a poſſibilitie of his being more excellent
in his kind, than now he is. However; for him to
give, for him to beſtow a more excellent being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that which is not, than, for the preſent he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
hath, is no way poſſible. Suppoſe then hee
might entirely <hi>alienate</hi> from himſelfe, or bequeath
the beſt being, which for the preſent he hath, upon
ſome poſſibility of being, or advance ſome nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
not <hi>being</hi> to his own eſtate by his utter anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation;
this could not argue him to be Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7905:159"/>
becauſe there be many other effects poſſible,
which are not in his power to produce; albeit he
could reſume that which he had given unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and beſtow it againe where he pleaſed. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſeeing the prime Eſſence, who alone is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
infinite, did not make all things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by a neceſſity of nature, but becauſe it was
his will ſo to make them: no creature by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated
power imaginable, could poſſibly make
any one thing, or more things out of nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
thoſe which the Omnipotent was willing
ſhould be ſo made; nor theſe any better either for
ſubſtance or qualitie, than his will was, they ſhould
be. Nor could any creature be enabled by his will
out of nothing to make any thing, which was not
<hi>eminently contained</hi> in the nature of that creature,
to whom this power of creating, is ſuppoſed to be,
by his will, delegated. For albeit ſome efficient
or productive cauſes bring forth effects for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
or qualitie more excellent then themſelves:
yet this they never doe, this they cannot doe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they worke upon ſome advantage, which the
ſubject or matter whereon they worke doth afford
them. But this advantage cannot be ſuppoſed in
the production of any ſubſtance, out of no <hi>ſubject</hi>
or <hi>matter</hi> praexiſtent. All the excellency, which
any effect or ſubſtance ſo produced can have, muſt
be intirely derived from its efficient. And that can
be no greater excellency or perfection, than the
efficient it ſelfe hath; not altogether ſo great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it muſt be <hi>eminently</hi> contained in the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its efficient: if ſo be the efficient have any
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7905:160"/>
perfection or being left, after the production of
ſuch an effect. So that every efficient cauſe, which
is or can be ſuppoſed, as an inſtrumentall cauſe of
creation, or as enabled to produce ſomething out
of nothing, is thus farre limited, that it can produce
no effect more excellent that it ſelfe, and being
thus limited in it ſelfe, and by dependance on an
higher cauſe, as well in its being, as in its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it cannot be conceived to bee Omnipotent.
For that includes as much as to be <hi>illimited</hi> in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or, which is all one, to bee the operative
power of the incomprehenſible Eſſence, or of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>infinite.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3 But though to be able to make ſomething out
of nothing be not formally <hi>aequipollent</hi> to the <hi>attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute</hi>
of Omnipotency: yet can it not hence be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that any agent beſides the one Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
is either able or can be enabled to produce
the leaſt ſubſtance that is, the leaſt portion or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ingredient to any bodily ſubſtance out of meer
nothing. To lay the firſt foundation or beginning
of being of any <hi>finite</hi> ſubſtance, is the ſole effect of
<hi>being</hi> it ſelfe, and therefore of that which is truly
<hi>infinite</hi> in operation. Whatſoever is finite or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
can have no other kind of being, than <hi>borrowed</hi>
or <hi>participated.</hi> And this kinde of <hi>being</hi> muſt bee
immediately derived, without intervention of any
inſtrumentall cauſe, from <hi>being</hi> not <hi>participated or
borrowed,</hi> but from <hi>increated</hi> and <hi>authentique being.</hi>
To create, is to give actuall being or exiſtance,
without the help or furtherance of any Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Confounder. Now if this power of creating
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7905:160"/>
could poſſibly bee delegated to any created ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
it were poſſible for that which is created by
it, to have its being <hi>extra infinitum eſſe,</hi> that is, it
ſhould not be immediately and intirely contained
in the infinite and incomprehenſible Eſſence or
Being. For in this very <hi>ſuppoſall</hi> [That one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſubſtance might by power delegated from
Omnipotency, create another] it is neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
that the ſubſtance created ſhould have its
<hi>being</hi> intirely, or <hi>part</hi> of its <hi>being</hi> immediately
from the other, which, by power delegated, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to <hi>create</hi> it. And having ſuch being, as it
hath, either intirely or in part immediately from
the other, it could not be <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>intirely</hi>
contained in the firſt cauſe of all things. And if the
leaſt <hi>ſubſtance</hi> poſſible, could have its Being, not
immediately and intirely from the firſt cauſe or
ſupreame Efficient, he could not bee actually and
abſolutely infinite in Being, or Omnipotent in
working. For that onely is <hi>abſolutely</hi> infinite, or
<hi>infinite</hi> in <hi>Being,</hi> in which all things poſſible are
immediately contained; without whoſe incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
Being, nothing can have exiſtence;
without whoſe immediate operation nothing can
begin to be or exiſt.</p>

the ſtrength &amp; ſoundneſs of that treble rule or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall

by the ſole power of the Almighty Father? To
beleeve all this, is but the firſt part of our beleefe of
this <hi>Article of Creation.</hi> For better apprehending
the intire object of our beleefe in this point, we are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7905:162"/>

he hath finiſhed his worke, doth not continually
<hi>ſupport, preſerve</hi> or apply it to thoſe uſes, unto
which it ſerves; but leaves this unto their care for
whoſe convenience it was made. The Clocke-maker
doth not tye himſelfe to keep all the Clocks

perpetually, or to obſerve them as curiouſly as
Phyſitians doe their ſicke Patients. Againe, the

great and perpetuall it is, not in reſpect of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances

it is <hi>workable</hi> or <hi>faſhionable</hi> unto any ſet forme, this
likewiſe is an effect of his operative power; it could

an ocular demonſtration, yet a <hi>viſible repreſentation</hi>
of this truth, in that <hi>perpetuall dependance,</hi> which
light diffuſed (whether through the celeſtiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as the moone or ſtarres, or through the ayre
or other inferiour elementary bodies capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning)
hath on the <hi>Fountaine</hi> of Light, to wit,
the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Sunne:</hi> or which the <hi>light</hi> in rooms,
otherwiſe dark, hath on the light of <hi>Fire</hi> or candles
by night. So perpetuall, ſo eſſentiall is this depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
which <hi>light,</hi> in bodies inlightned by others,
hath on the bodies which enlighten them; that
ſome<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barel. de Lumine.</note> good Philoſophers, from obſervation of
this dependance, have concluded, that [Lumen.
non eſt inhaeſive in corpore illuminato, ſed in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore
lucente<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] <hi>The lightſomneſſe which appeares
in theſe inferiour bodies, or in bodies not lucent in
themſelves, is not inherently or ſubjectively, in the
borrowers, or bodies enlightned, but in the bodies
which enlightens them.</hi> To prove this concluſion,
they uſe this Antecedent, that light borrowed or
participated, doth follow the motion of the body
which beſtowes or <hi>lends</hi> it; and this Antecedent
they thinke ſufficiently proved by ſenſe. For if we
hold a <hi>looking-glaſſe</hi> to a candle by night, the light
which for the preſent appeares either in the whole
glaſſe or in ſome part of it, will alter its place or
ſeat according to the <hi>motion</hi> of the candle. If you
move the candle <hi>higher</hi> or lower than it was, the
light in the glaſſe will remove with it, from the
higheſt place to the loweſt, and from the loweſt to
the higheſt, as it ſhall pleaſe the <hi>mover</hi> to alter the
<hi>aſpect</hi> betwixt them, ſo will the light move from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7905:163"/>
one part of the <hi>roome</hi> to another, as the candle is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.
And if you take the candle quite out of
the roome, the light will follow it, and leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but darkneſſe behind. The ſame obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
holds as true in a Dyall, in which the light or
ſhadow conſtantly followes the motion of the Sun.
But to hold this concluſion, [That light borrowed
from the Sunne or a Candle, ſhould be <hi>inherently</hi>
or ſubjectively in the Sunne or Candle] is more
than true Philoſophy will warrant; more than the
unqueſtionable truth of the former experiment
can <hi>logically</hi> inferre. For though <hi>light</hi> in bodies
not <hi>lucent</hi> in themſelves, bee not their owne, but
borrowed; yet in that it is <hi>borrowed,</hi> it muſt bee
truly in the borrower, not in the body which lends
it. For every one which <hi>lends,</hi> is preſumed to
<hi>transfer</hi> the uſe of what hee lends unto him that
borrowes: the borrower muſt have the <hi>poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
of what is lent him, during the time of the
loane. As for the former experiments, they may
be retorted upon ſuch as uſe their helpe for infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this pretended concluſion, [<note n="*" place="margin">Vide An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion. de coloribus.</note> That light diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is not inherently in the body enlightned, but
in the body lucent, or enlightning.] For the <hi>muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>ſeat</hi> of <hi>borrowed light,</hi> whether in a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſe
held to a candle, or in a Sun-dyall, will
be the very ſame, albeit the Candle or Dyall ſtand
ſtill in the ſame place; if ſo we move the <hi>Looking-glaſſe</hi>
the ſame way from the Candle, or the Dyall
the ſame way from the Sunne, by which the Sun
did move from the Dyall, or the Candle was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the <hi>Looking-glaſſe.</hi> This concluſion is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7905:164"/>
moſt certaine, [That the motion of light, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the motion of the body which diffuſeth it,
doth no way inferre the light not to be <hi>inherently,</hi>
(according to the inherency which it hath) in the
body, through which it is diffuſed; but rather that
this light, however inherent in the body enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
hath a perpetuall indiſpenſable dependance
upon the light of the body which produceth it; a
dependance on it, not onely in <hi>fieri,</hi> that is, whileſt
it is in production, which is in an inſtant; but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
in <hi>facto,</hi> ſo long as it continues in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
enlightned. And we cannot better conceive
the manner, how a <hi>line</hi> ſhould be made by the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi>
fluxe of a point, or a ſurface by the <hi>continued</hi>
motion of a line; or how time ſhould receive its
continuation from the continued fluxe of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
than by obſerving the manner how <hi>light</hi>
being produced in an inſtant in the body, which
borrowes it (the extremity of it being terminated
to a mathematicall point or line) doth vary its place
of reſidence in the ſame body, moving continually
from one part to another, according to the degrees
of motion, either of the <hi>body</hi> which gives the light,
or of the <hi>body</hi> which is enlightned, one from the
other. If either body could <hi>move</hi> or bee moved
from the <hi>aſpect</hi> of the other, in an inſtant, the light
would remove from the body enlightned in the
ſame inſtant. But <hi>moving</hi> as it doth, the motion
of the light from one part of the ſame body or
roome into another, is perpetuall; there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
in the motion ſo much as momentary,
no <hi>interpoſition</hi> of darkneſſe ſo long as the motion
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7905:164"/>
laſts. And yet it is not the ſame numericall light,
which thus moveth in the bodie or roome enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
There is a continuall <hi>production</hi> of light fully
anſwerable to the continuall <hi>ſucceſsion</hi> of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The light, whileſt in motion, continues no
longer the ſame than the aſpect betweene the bodie
<hi>enlightning</hi> and <hi>enlightned</hi> continues the ſame.
And it may be queſtioned, whether there be not
a perpetuall production of <hi>new</hi> light, even whileſt
neyther the body enlightning nor enlightned <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi>
one from the other, whileſt both ſtand or
reſt upon their ſeverall centers.</p>
                     <p>3 But what ever Philoſophers may diſpute one
way or other concerning the proper <hi>ſubject</hi> of light
<hi>diffuſed</hi> or participated, or concerning the identifie
or multiplication of it in <hi>bodies</hi> not <hi>lucent</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but enlightned: the dependance of <hi>borrowed</hi>
or <hi>participated</hi> light upon the fountaine of light,
whence it is borrowed, is the moſt perfect Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme,
which the eye of man can behold, of that
<hi>dependance</hi> which all things <hi>numerable</hi> that are, or
can be, have on the <hi>incomprehenſible</hi> Eſſence, or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible
fountaine</hi> of Beeing. Whether light
participated or diffuſed, have any true inherence or
no in bodies enlightned, or whether it be preſent
with them or in them, (ad modum ſpiritalium) <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuch a manner</hi> as ſpirits are in ſublunary bodies,
or with them; this is certaine, that light participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is not deduced or drawne out of any <hi>matter</hi>
praeexiſtent, or out of any <hi>poſitive qualitie</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
it is produced out of darknes or want of light.
And herein it is the true Embleme of created Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7905:165"/>
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were not made of any entities praeexiſtent,
but of nothing. As light participated or diffuſed,
hath no permanent root in bodies enlightned: So
things created have not their <hi>root</hi> of beeing in any
<hi>maetter</hi> praeexiſtent, nor hath the prime <hi>matter,</hi> of
which things generated are made, any root prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
out of which it groweth. Such <hi>being</hi> as it hath,
it hath intirely by its perpetuall dependance upon
<hi>beeing it ſelfe.</hi> The moſt excellent <hi>numerable bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
that can be imagined, is more truely participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or borrowed from <hi>beeing</hi> it ſelfe, than the <hi>light</hi>
of the Moone or Sarres, than the <hi>light</hi> in the <hi>ayre,
water,</hi> or <hi>yce,</hi> is from the body of the Sunne. And
albeit the formes or perfect bodies, which, by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of efficients <hi>naturall,</hi> reſpectively reſult or
are produced out of the <hi>matter,</hi> have a being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from the <hi>matter,</hi> out of which they are made
or produced: yet even theſe have the ſame imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
dependency upon the <hi>incomprehenſible Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi>
or inexhauſtible fountaine of Beeing, which
the prime <hi>matter</hi> hath. As the reſplendencie or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiation
of coloured glaſſes, be they <hi>yellow, greene</hi>
or <hi>azure,</hi> have the ſame immediate dependance
upon the light of the Sunne, which the light diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
throughout the heavens, water, ayre, or pure
glaſſes, hath; unleſſe the Sun ſend forth his beames
upon them, theſe colours have no reſplendencie,
they cannot <hi>affect</hi> the ſenſe of ſight. Nor can any
created Agent (albeit endowed with qualities ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
more forcible and permanent, than any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
glaſſes can bee) produce any reall effect,
without the cooperation or coagencie of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7905:165"/>
Eſſence,</hi> or <hi>inexhauſtible fountaine</hi> of
Beeing. As impoſſible it is, that any <hi>agent</hi> ſhould
move, or be moved, otherwiſe than by the vertue
of his Almighty <hi>power,</hi> as that it ſhould have <hi>beeing</hi>
or exiſtence (extra infinitum eſſe) <hi>without his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Beeing or immenſitie,</hi> or that the continuance
of it in ſuch <hi>being,</hi> ſhould not be comprehended in
his infinite and interminable duration, which wee
call Eternitie. Againe, as light borrowed or diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
throughout this inferiour world, hath a <hi>beeing</hi>
in its kinde diſtinct from that <hi>light,</hi> which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manently
ſeated in the fountaine of light, on
which, notwithſtanding, all borrowed light abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
depends as being eminently contained in it:
ſo every <hi>numerable</hi> beeing, or <hi>part</hi> of this <hi>world,</hi>
the <hi>Sunne,</hi> the <hi>Moone,</hi> the <hi>Starres,</hi> the <hi>Elements,
mixt bodies, vegetables, man,</hi> and <hi>beaſt,</hi> have their
proper kinde of Beeing diſtinct each from other,
and diſtinct againe from the incomprehenſible
<hi>fountaine</hi> of <hi>beeing;</hi> on which notwithſtanding all
of them have more immediate, more eſſentiall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance,
than either the <hi>lights,</hi> or different ſhapes
in a glaſſe, have on the <hi>Sunne</hi> which gives the light,
or on the bodies which they repreſent. And in this
incomprehenſible fountaine of <hi>beeing,</hi> all things
not onely which are, but which poſſibly may bee,
are more <hi>eminently</hi> contained, than the leaſt-ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles
or portions of borrowed light, which appeare
in broken glaſſes, are in the body of the Sunne.</p>
                     <p>4 In this point onely, or in this eſpecially, is the
production of light in this inferiour world by the
Sunne, unlike the Creation of all things by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7905:166"/>
Father of <hi>lights,</hi> in that the Sunne produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<hi>light</hi> or reſplendency, without any free choice
or intelligence, but by a neceſſitie of nature, that is,
it ſo produceth light, as it hath no power not to
produce it. So doth not the Almighty Father ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
create the things that are, or preſerve them in
their eſtate of beeing, or cooperate with them in
the production of ſuch effects, as they in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>kindes</hi> and <hi>rankes</hi> are truly ſaid to produce. For
albeit the Almighty Father, bee more immutable
than the Sunne, yet is hee immutably free. For
freedome of will, by which creatures rationall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
all creatures meerly naturall, or capable of no
better endowment then ſenſe, being a true and
reall branch of <hi>beeing,</hi> a perfection of the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
creatures, muſt be as truely and really, though
in an <hi>eminent manner,</hi> contained in the <hi>Maker</hi> of all
things, as any other branch of <hi>numerable beeing</hi> is.
Now the object of this freedome of will in the
Omnipotent Maker, is not onely the <hi>Creation</hi> or
<hi>not creation</hi> of things that are or may bee; not the
preſervation or deſtruction of things <hi>created,</hi> or of
the ſeverall endowments or qualifications: but
part of this <hi>object</hi> of divine freedome is the ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
or inhibiting of all his creatures, to exerciſe
thoſe qualities or faculties which are to them moſt
naturall, and in their kinde moſt powerfull. Albeit
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had power to make the flames of
inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded perſecution, much hotter than any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fire; though other Tyrants might have power
to make the like againe, much hotter than hee did,
or to environ Gods Saints with the fire of Hell; yet
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7905:166"/>
if the Almighty Creator withdraw the <hi>influence</hi>
of his power from ſuch fire or flames, they can
have no more power to burne or ſcorch his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
than they have to coole them; although we
ſuppoſe their nature and qualities to be preſerved
ſtill entire, by the ſame power, by which they were
created. For as (but now) was ſaid, the <hi>inhibition</hi>
or <hi>enabling</hi> of naturall qualities or faculties to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
their native force, is as truely the object of
divine freedome, as the preſervation or deſtruction
of the Agents themſelves, with their qualities or
endowments is. For the ſame reaſon, the <hi>Sunne</hi> was
no way wounded in his ſubſtance, nor <hi>hurt,</hi> nor
<hi>tainted</hi> in its influence or other qualitie, when, by
the divine power, which is immutably and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
free, it was inhibited in its courſe or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>5 That the Almightie Creator neyther in our
time, nor in the times long before us, hath laid any
ſuch reſtraint upon the Sunne, that it ſhould not
move, or upon the <hi>fire,</hi> that it ſhould not burne, is
not from any reſtraint which hee hath laid upon his
<hi>power</hi> by his eternall <hi>decree;</hi> but from his <hi>immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
and <hi>eternall freedome.</hi> Wee may not ſay, that he
cannot, for the times preſent or which are to come,
lay the like inhibition upon the <hi>Sunne,</hi> upon the
<hi>fire,</hi> or upon other celeſtiall or ſublunarie bodies,
for exerciſing the functions moſt naturall to them.
That hee will not, at any time, lay the like reſtraint
upon them, wee are not bound to beleeve, untill
thus much be by his word revealed unto us. That
God cannot at this time bring ſuch a generall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7905:167"/>
upon the earth as hee did in the dayes of
<hi>Noah,</hi> we may not ſay or thinke: but that hee <hi>will</hi>
not deſtroy the world by <hi>water,</hi> wee muſt beleeve,
becauſe wee have his ſolemne promiſe to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſealed unto us, by the ſigne of the <hi>Bow</hi> in the
Cloud. But when the iniquitie of this preſent
world ſhall come unto the ſame height and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
which the old world had made up, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
hee will deſtroy it by fire. For other mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the courſe of nature, the condition or exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of times enſuing, may be ſuch, as that they
may be as <hi>ſtrange</hi> and miraculous, as at any time
heretofore they have beene. The not interpoſing
of miracles in theſe our dayes, proceedes not from
any Act <hi>paſſed</hi> by the Almightie to the contrary,
nor from the <hi>unchangeableneſſe</hi> of his eternall will;
but from the condition or courſe, which his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
hold <hi>de facto,</hi> whoſe condition or eſtate is
in it ſelfe, and by his Almighty will ſo to have it, ſo
changeable and ſo improveable to different pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
that many events, which to our obſervation
would be moſt ſtrange, might upon ſpeciall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
be produced, without any change or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his power, whoſe exerciſe <hi>ad extra,</hi> that is,
<hi>in reſpect of effects producible in the creature,</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably
free, untill hee promiſe to inhibit them, as
hee hath done the generall Inundation. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee be moſt immutable in all his promiſes
or inhibitions: yet doth not every promiſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
which hee makes, induce an abſolute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutabilitie
or neceſſitie of the things promiſed or
inhibited. Their immutabilitie or neceſſitie is the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7905:167"/>
proper effect of his more ſolemne or peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.
Nor are ſuch inhibitions as he hath ſet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the water abſolutely neceſſary from Eternity,
but grow neceſſary in revolution of time, by the
<hi>changeable</hi> condition of the Creature. And albeit
we can neither preſcribe limits to his will, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any reaſon of the mutations which fall out in
the Creatures by his inhibition, by his <hi>permiſsion,</hi>
or by his poſitive <hi>enabling</hi> them to exerciſe their
native functions; yet of the leaſt <hi>mutation,</hi> that can
fall out in the world, he knowes a cauſe or <hi>reaſon,</hi>
nor doth he ſuffer any thing to be done, for which
his immutable <hi>freedome</hi> in <hi>governing</hi> the world,
hath not an <hi>eternall</hi> rule or reaſon <hi>infinitely</hi> more
perfect, than the wiſeſt man living can give any for
his beſt Acts or undertakings. But ſuppoſe the Sun
to have that freedome of power in the <hi>emiſsion</hi> or
not emiſſion of his beames, which men have over
their breath, or that dexterity in tempering or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating
its light or influence, which skilfull Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
have in modulating their <hi>voices:</hi> and the
former repreſentation of that power which God
hath over all his creatures, and of their dependance
on him in their beings and operations by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
which light hath on the Sunne, would
be more lively and full.</p>
                     <p>6 But the Pſalmiſt hath made choice of that
free power, which man hath over his <hi>animall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi>
as over his <hi>breath</hi> or <hi>operation</hi> of his ſenſes;
as the faireſt picture of Gods free power creative
and providence over his Creatures. <hi>Theſe wait all
upon thee, that thou mighteſt give them their meat in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7905:168"/>
due ſeaſonſ. That thou giveſt them, they gather: thou
openeſt thine hand, they are filled with good. Thou
hideſt thy face, they are troubled: thou takeſt away
their breath, they dye, and returne to their duſt. Thou
ſendeſt forth thy ſpirit, they are created: and thou
reneweſt the face of the earth. The glory of the Lord
ſhall endure for ever: the Lord ſhall rejoyce in his
workes. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth:
he toucheth the hils and they ſmoake. Pſal. 104. verſ.
27. &amp;c.</hi> Yet even in theſe and the like emblemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
expreſſions of the <hi>Creators</hi> free power over his
Creatures, or in the choiſeſt that can bee taken or
gathered out of the Propheticall deſcriptions,
from the exerciſe of mens free and pureſt thoughts,
there will ſtill remaine this diſparity: We cannot
alter the objects of our intellectuall or abſtract con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,
without ſome alteration or change of
<hi>Acts.</hi> It is then the prerogative of the <hi>Almighty,
freely</hi> to will things moſt contrary and different,
without any diverſity in his will. And this his free
will not onely worketh greater varietie or change
in the Creature, than the wits of all men in the
world can conceive, but withall <hi>irreſiſtibly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
the iſſue of every poſſible change, without
any ſhadow of change or alteration in his thoughts
or reſolutions; which in him are not many, but
more truly one <hi>infinity,</hi> than any one thought in us
is one. This diſparity betweene the Identity of his
Eternall <hi>knowledge,</hi> and of his <hi>immutable</hi> freedome,
and the manner of our underſtanding or intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

Gods glory, which amounts from conſideration
of his workes; the intelligent Reader will informe
himſelfe, that the continuall riſing and ſetting of

aſcent of ſpringing waters into the hills, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall

of the Seas ebbing and flowing, the daily

things on the earth and in the waters, are as
immediately and as intirely aſcribed unto the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
power of the Creator, as their firſt Creation
out of nothing was. Yet the reaſon of their aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
all this unto the immediate and ſole power
of God, will no way warrant the truth of their cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſme,
who teach that neither the fire doth truly
heat or burne, or the water really coole or moiſten,
or that no viſible creature hath any reall operation
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7905:169"/>
upon another, but that our aſſigning of their <hi>moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
or operations, as true cauſes (in their kind) of
the effects which we ſee daily produced, is but a
ſolaeciſme of vaine Philoſophy, or of ſciences falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo called; whereas the right reſolution of this
ſolaeciſme into diſtinct and Chriſtian phraſe, is but
this, <hi>God doth produce heat, cold, moiſture, vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and other living things,</hi> (ad praeſentiam crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turarum)
<hi>the Fire, Water, Sunne, Earth, &amp;c. being

by <hi>which</hi> operation alone, all thoſe effects
are produced, which the Philoſophers aſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Creatures. And moſt true it is, that the
Creator doth daily worke all thoſe effects, which
we attribute to naturall agents: yet doth hee not
worke ſuch effects onely in them, or where they
are preſent, but he truly <hi>worketh</hi> by them and with
them. And if the Omnipotent power be truly ſaid
to worke by and with natural <hi>meanes or cauſes,</hi> they
muſt truly worke <hi>with him,</hi> in their kinde. When
the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>in him wee live and move, and
have our beeing,</hi> this neceſſarily implies, that wee
have a life in its kinde diſtinct from his life, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power different in its kinde from his <hi>power,</hi> a
kinde of <hi>beeing</hi> likewiſe diſtinct from his infinite
Eſſence, or from <hi>being-it-ſelfe.</hi> But in as much as
the life of all things living, the motions of every
thing that moveth, the being of every numerable
<hi>thing,</hi> that is, hath ſuch an abſolute dependance as
hath been declared upon his <hi>creative</hi> power; hence
it is that the Prophets and Divine Philoſophers,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7905:170"/>
aſcribe all the viſible effects or events, which time
preſents or place accompanieth, no leſſe intirely to
the Creator, than the firſt production of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
and naturall cauſes. As for the former Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes,
in whoſe language, God onely worketh in
his creatures, or (his creatures being preſent) they
might with as good reaſon, affirme that the Sunne
did not really <hi>move,</hi> but that God did move, the
Sun being preſent; yet could <hi>he</hi> not <hi>move</hi> or create
motion <hi>ad praeſentiam</hi> Solis, unleſſe the Sunne did
truly move. The truth is, the Sunne doth move,
or is moved by Gods <hi>preſence</hi> in it, but he doth not
move with it or by it. But with the <hi>Sunne</hi> or other
Creatures, he truly worketh, as they truly worke
with <hi>him.</hi> And, by this conceſſion of ſome true
power and property of working unto naturall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
more is aſcribed to the Creator of all things,

God do make the things that are, whether hee

will make other things which yet are not, or the things
which are, after a better manner than as yet they have
beene made: or if he be or hath beene a maker, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to make things better, whether he do all this out

not onely of the ſix dayes
worke, but that he ſtill makes all
things that are, and ſhal make all things which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
ſhall be. So long as any thing which hath
beene continues in beeing, ſo long as any thing
which now is not, ſhall beginne or not ceaſe to be,
ſo long the Almighty continues a Maker. And in
as much as ſome things which are made, or which
hereafter ſhall be made, ſhall have no end, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
an everlaſting Maker. This title of Maker
is none of his Eternall Attributes, but a denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
aſcribed unto him from his workes which all
had their beginning in time, or rather with time,
or with duration finite or numerable. It is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Attribute, for that properly is everlaſting,
which though it have beginning yet it hath no end.
But albeit the acts or exerciſes of his will or power
had a beginning with the world, (for they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in the creature or effect) yet his will and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to make the world are eternall: So is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
by which he made it, ſo is the combination
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7905:173"/>
of all theſe, to wit, his providence, by which hee
orders and governes all things, coeternall to his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
All moderne controverſies to my knowledge
account it an heatheniſh ſoleciſm to ſay, God only
did make or hath made the world and all things in
it, he doth not now make them. For this were to
deny the neceſſity of his everlaſting worke in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
ſupporting, and continuing all things in
their proper being. And to deny this, would bee
more than a ſoleciſme of ſpeech, a reall branch of
infidelity. Is it then a leſſe ſoleciſme of ſpeech to
ſay, or a ſmaller portion of infidelity to thinke, that
God only hath decreed before all times what ſhall
fall out in time, but doth not now decree nor ſhall
any thing hereafter be decreed by him? Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
if his decree be coeternall to his power, the
ſame with his will or purpoſe, if hee ceaſe not to
worke or will, he ceaſeth not to worke or decree.
He did decree to worke when he did not worke, or
produce any effect <hi>ad extra,</hi> but hee never produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
any effect or worke when hee did not decree.
For he worketh all things by the Counſell of his
will, not by the Counſell of his will as paſt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but by the Counſell of his will, which was,
which is, and which is to come. And he decreeth
all things for the times preſent after the ſelfe ſame
manner that he decreed them from eternity, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
his decree were not eternall, could have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of eternity. To infer that Gods decree
is an act paſt, or that God doth not now decree,
becauſe he hath decreed al things before all worlds,
is a ſoleciſme or ignorance, to ſay no worſe, of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7905:173"/>
ſame nature, quality &amp; ſcantling, as if you ſhold ſay,
God was before the world was, therefore God is
not ſince the world was, nor ſhall be after the end
of this world. For the world could neither begin,
continue, nor ceaſe to be, but by his eternall and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible
decree, which neither hath beginning
nor end, nor can admit any interpoſition of change.
It is true, that if we conſider the Deity in himſelfe
or his decree as it is in him, or the ſame with him,
there is neither <hi>praeteritum</hi> nor <hi>futurum,</hi> no ſuch
difference in them as wee character or notifie by
theſe termes <hi>paſt</hi> or <hi>to come:</hi> yet if wee conſider
God or his eternall Decree, as they include a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of precedency to things temporall, paſt, or to
come, or as times current have coexiſtence with
him, wee may not deny that God was before all
times, and did decree things to come, that he is in
all times current, and doth decree the iſſue of times
preſent or enſuing. Thus in all times, and in all
places, the Almighty Father is preſent with us, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in us, as our maker and preſerver, preſent by
his eternall providence to order and governe us.
And the government of the world, ſpecially of
Men and Angels, is in true Divinity, the proper
object of the Eternall Decree. And if God be thus
with us, nothing can goe amiſſe with us, ſave only
by our ignorance, by our misbeleefe or weake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
of this firſt Article.</p>
                     <p>2 The true, that is, the firme and ſound beleefe
of every morall or ſacred truth, ſpecially of ſuch
fundamental truths as are contained in this Article,
alwayes include a correſpondency in the beleever
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7905:174"/>
unto the thing beleeved. And this correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
muſt have its place, not in the braine or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
faculty onely, but in the affection. The
ſympathy of affection unto the thing beleeved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
from the impreſſion which the ſpeculative
<hi>forme</hi> or repreſentation in the braine makes upon
the heart, which is the ſeat of the affection. The
<hi>meanes</hi> ſubordinate to the Spirit of God for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this impreſſion, are two: A right explication
or branching of the article or object to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
&amp; a ſerious and frequent meditation upon the
object rightly branched, or a taking not of the truth
onely, but the conſequences of it into deepe and
ſetled conſideration; or as we ſay, a laying of both
to heart. The maine branches of this Article are
three: Firſt, that God is the maker of all men that
are, not of <hi>Adam</hi> onely. Secondly, that he is the
preſerver of all. Thirdly, that he perpetually or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
and governeth all things, even the thoughts
of men, by the irreſiſtible unceſſant working of his
Omnipotent decree or will. In our beleefe of the
two firſt branches (bee it leſſe or more, weake or
ſtrong) ſo it be uniforme, it is <hi>eſſentially</hi> included,
that God is good to all, in that he hath given life
and being unto all. Of this his goodneſſe no man
can want ſtore of witneſſes, ſo long as either he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes
himſelfe or the neceſſary ſupplyes of life.
One ſpeciall duty, whereunto the beleefe of this
Article doth immediately bind all men, is expreſly
commended to us by our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 6.</hi> The
generall neglect whereof is more than ſufficient to
condemne not the Heathens or Infidels onely, but
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7905:174"/>
the greateſt part of ſuch as profeſſe the Chriſtian
Faith, of infidelity: <hi>Take no thought for your life,
what ye ſhall eate, or what ye ſhall drinke, nor yet for
your body what you ſhall put on. Is not the life more
than meat? and the body than rayment?</hi> It is a ſin
for him which beleeves that God hath given him
that life and being which he hath, not to beleeve
that God did give him both for his greater good,
or that he will not increaſe his bleſſings upon him,
ſo he doe not diſtruſt his fatherly care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
A greater ſinne it is to ſuſpect or queſtion,
whether God have not a more fatherly care over
all men, than he hath over other creatures. So our
Saviour addes, <hi>Behold the fowles of the ayre: For
they ſow not, neither doe they reape, nor gather into
barnes, yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are
ye not much better then they?</hi> In that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
man a better kind of life and being than the
fowles of the ayre; this is an undoubted pledge
unto all, that he hath prepared far better food for
them than for birds and beaſts, an everlaſting food;
ſo they do not diſtruſt his providence. And as hee
provideth better food for man than for beaſt, ſo
hath he better rayment for them in ſtore, than he
hath for vegetables; ſo they will ſeeke it from him,
and not be their owne carvers. <hi>Which of you by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thought can add one cubit unto his ſtature? And
why take ye thought for rayment? Conſider the Lillies
of the field, how they grow; they toyle not, neither do
they ſpin. And yet I ſay unto you that even Salomon
in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of theſe: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if God ſo cloath the graſſe of the field, which to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7905:175"/>
day is and to morrow is caſt into the Oven; ſhall hee
not much more cloath you, O ye of little faith.</hi> That
to diſtruſt Gods providence or doubt of his love,
of ſuch love as is ready to beſtow better rayment
upon them than <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his royalty had, is a
point of infidelity, is included in our Saviours infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
or concluſion: <hi>Therefore take no thought, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
What ſhall we eate? or what ſhall we drinke? or
wherewithall ſhall we be cloathed? For after all theſe
things do the Gentiles ſeeke. For your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knoweth that ye have need of all theſe things.</hi> Is
it then unlawfull to make any thing which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
ſought after, any part of our care? No, the
Gentiles after their faſhion, ſought after God, who
(as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>giveth to all life and breath
and all things,</hi> even to the Gentiles, <hi>that they ſhould
ſeeke the Lord: if happely they might feele after him
and finde him. Acts 17. 25, 27.</hi> The onely reaſon
why they did not find him, was becauſe they
ſought him amiſſe. And the reaſon why they
ſought him amiſs was their ignorance of this truth
which our Saviour and S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught, to wit,
that God did give the very Gentiles themſelves
food and rayment, with other neceſſaries of life,
even life it ſelfe, with all its contentments, to the
end that they might ſeeke him and taſte his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
But they ran counter, and ſought only after
thoſe things which were good not in themſelves,
but as they were pledges of his goodneſſe. And
the more eagerly they thus ſought after theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
good things, the further they ran from the
Fountaine of goodneſs, which alone muſt ſweeten
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7905:175"/>
the beſt things we can deſire, and ſeaſon our ſoules
for the right entertainment or fruition of them.</p>
                     <p>3 Our ſpeculative aſſent unto this Article, or
approbation of this truth, whereof theſe Gentiles
were ignorant, will rather aggravate than mitigate
our Saviours cenſure of them; if we be as greedy
ſeekers after the neceſſities of life, or as ſolicitous
hunters after ſuperfluities, as the Gentiles were.
The diſtinctions or diviſions of <hi>care,</hi> with annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
what kinde of care, is by our Saviour forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
what allowed of, are eaſie to be found almoſt
in every Writer, eſpecially in the Expoſitors of
that 6. chapter of <hi>Matthew.</hi> But whether through
the default of hearers or of teachers, or reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of both: too much liberty is every where taken
for employing the greateſt part of mens times and
indeavours in providing things of this life. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the prohibitions which have been
given by our Saviour to the contrary: <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
and <hi>ambition,</hi> the two grand enemies of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
in God and his loving providence, have no
where in any age thriven better, than amongſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Chriſtian profeſſors in theſe later times. And
which is moſt to be lamented, Scripture is ſecretly
oppoſed to Scripture for juſtifying or countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
unchriſtian care of wordly matters. The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,

                        <hi>Paul, He that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth
not for his family is worſe then an Infidell,</hi> is
uſed as a <hi>countermand</hi> to our Saviours prohibition.
For the right limitation whereof, the onely caveat
which I have to commend unto the Reader, is this,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7905:176"/>
As S. <hi>Paul,</hi> how mightily ſoever he debaſe workes,
not ceremoniall onely, but morall, doth never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
their uſe or neceſſity either for attaining to
juſtification, or for making our Election ſure, but
onely ſeeks to ſtrengthen our relyance upon Gods
mercies in Chriſt by denyall of our ſelves, and of
the beſt works w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we can do, whether before rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
or after: ſo our Saviour, albeit he ſeeme
univerſally to forbid all care of minding temporall
contentments, yet in deed and reall meaning, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
us onely to place any part of our hopes or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in our owne endeavours. He doth not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
forbid all care of things temporall, but ſo farre
onely as it is an hindrance to our care and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
for trying and taſting the goodneſſe of
God, or as it weakens our relyance upon his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
providence. If we be watchfull in prayer, and
frequent in meditations upon Gods goodneſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
experienced, our care of heavenly things and
eſtimate of Gods goodneſſe will better teach every
one of us in his ſeverall calling, the right limitation
of his domeſtique cares, than any generall rule
which can be gathered from the nature, quality, or
quantity of cares. For concluſion, he which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
us to take care for the morrow, commands us
to pray this day for to morrowes bread, that is, to
pray every day for the good ſucceſſe or bleſſings
of the dayes following, with all attention and
watchfulneſſe.</p>
                     <p>4 Another fundamentall duty, and one of the
moſt formall effects of faith, as it reſpects this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
is that of the Preacher, <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> the 12.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7905:176"/>
verſ. 1. <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of
thy youth.</hi> But why is this duty in particular preſt
upon youth? Becauſe the prints of Gods creative
power are then moſt freſh in our nature, and might
tranſmit a fairer copy or truer eſtimate of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
goodneſſe unto old age, than old age can take
any: ſo young men by often reflecting upon the
preſent comforts of health and ſtrength, upon the
activity of body, the quickneſſe of ſenſe and ſpirit,
would ingroſſe them deeply in their memories.
Youth then is the fitteſt ſeaſon for eſtimating the
benefits of Creation, and old age the choiceſt time
for ſurveying our unthankfulneſſe to our Creator.
If the former contentments of youth, with the
comforts which accompany our beſt thoughts
and actions, were truly calculated in our freſh and
choiceſt daies, and rightly waighed upon their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
center, our thankfulneſſe would reciprocate
upon the Fountaine from which they flow, and be
returned to their doner in a meaſure equiponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to their waight upon our ſoules. And nothing
but want of thankfulneſſe in ſuch as have taſted the
ordinary benefits of Creation, can hinder the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
of Gods choice of bleſſings in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
Would we but ſequeſter that delight which
we take in health and ſtrength from our ſelves, and
ſurrender it wholly into his hands that gave it, he
is ſtill ready to renew and better our preſent and
former eſtate. Did we empty our hearts of pride,
of ſelfe-delight, or complacency, by powring
forth ſuch joyfull thankſ giving as the Pſalmiſt
doth, It is he that hath made us, and not wee our
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7905:177"/>
ſelves: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t is he that gives us all thoſe good things
wherein we joy, we did not receive them from our
friends or parents, wee cannot take them to our
ſelves: the ſame Lord, as the Pſalmiſt elſewhere
avoucheth, would give us our hearts deſire, even
fill our hearts with joy and gladneſſe which ſhall
never ſaile or decreaſe. This is his ſole and proper
gift, for though we could take unto our ſelves all
the temporary contentments of tranſitory plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
which either our hearts could wiſh, or our
inventions calculate, yet ſhould wee not have our
hearts deſire, ſo long as we fixe our delight either
in the things enjoyed, or in the enjoying of them,
and not in the Lord which gave them unto us, and
us power to enjoy them.</p>
                     <p>From thus delighting in the Lord, or from ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
according to the benefits beſtowed upon us,
the generall withdrawments are but two. Firſt, an
over prizing of ſuch externalls as procure or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
our contentments. Secondly, an ouervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the feare or dread of mens perſons, or other
externalls which ſeeme to menace diſgrace, vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or torment unto us, if we ſhould doe as in our
calmeſt thoughts we often deſire to doe. The ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
ſway of both temptations or withdrawments
from the duties commended unto us, cannot be
otherwiſe counterpoized than by taking the laſt
branch of this Article into deepe and ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
The laſt branch was, that God doth
nor onely make and preſerve us, but doth withall
perpetually order, direct, and governe both us and
all the externalls which we love or feare, by his all-ſeeing,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7905:177"/>

ſoules or ſenſes have for once or twice beene over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
with the poſſeſſion of any externalls or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall
cauſes of contentment, let us call to
minde, that as the Almighty Creator gives both
us and them their being, ſo hee likewiſe ſtints and
limits as well their operations, as our capacities to
receive their impreſſions at his pleaſure. The ſame
externalls which formerly wrought our comfort
or contentments, may procure our griefe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
by too much or unſeaſonable familiarity with
them, or fruition of them. If in feare or dread of
evill menaced by man, or repreſented to us by fire,
by ſword, or other unruly inſtruments of wrath or
vengeance, wee cannot hope that the Almighty
Creator will by miracle abate their ſtrength, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
the exerciſe of their native qualities or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
as he did in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three childrens

true: No agent or inſtrument, whether
of temporall harme or comfort, whether of joy or
griefe, can worke any other wayes or any further
than he by his Eternall Decree or Providence hath
appointed it for the preſent to worke. And in that
promiſe made unto us by our Apoſtle, <hi>That hee

it is included that he will ſo reſtraine or abate the

force and efficacy of all ſecond cauſes, as they ſhall
not conquer our patience or quell the comfort of
our unwounded conſcience.</p>

the immutability of Gods Decree to the contrary,
may with greater facility and ſtrength of the ſame

God immutably decrees mutability. Now who
will ſay that things mutable, are in reſpect of Gods

are truly moveable in themſelves, abſolutely
moveable, not immoveable in reſpect of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

doth not know them to be immoveable becauſe he

to ſpeake properly, the natures of contingency and

For in as much as both are immediate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

Now if Contingency have a true and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute

the firſt cauſe deprive it of that abſolute nature,
which the Omnipotent efficacy of the cauſe of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
hath irrevocably beſtowed upon it. Briefly, if
Contingency be any thing, it is that which it is by
the Omnipotent Decree; and being ſuch, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as impoſſible that ſome effects ſhould not
be abſolutely contingent, as that ſuch effects as the
Divine Decree hath appointed to bee neceſſary,
ſhould not be at all. Or if we would make impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
inquiry into the originall of all things, nothing
without the precincts of the moſt glorious and
ever bleſſed Trinity, is abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>4 By <hi>Contingency</hi> (leſt haply we might be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken)
we underſtand the <hi>poſsible meane</hi> betweene
neceſſity of being and neceſſity of not being, or of
being ſuch, or of not being ſuch; or betweene ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of doing, and neceſſity of not doing, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of being done, or neceſſity of being left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.
This <hi>meane</hi> betweene neceſſity of doing,
and neceſſity of not doing, is that which in agents
intellectuall, as in men and Angells wee call free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of will or choice. Vnto which freedome,
neceſſity is as contradictory, as irrationability is to
the nature of man, and contingency as neceſſarily
preſuppoſed as life and ſenſe are to reaſon. Adde
reaſon to contingency, and we have the compleat
definition of Free-will. In thoſe caſes wherein the
Creator hath exempted man from reſtraint of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
his will is free. The divine will it ſelfe is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7905:180"/>
not free in thoſe operations which are eſſentiall,
though moſt delectable. God the Father is more
delighted in the eternall generation of his Sonne:
ſo is God the Father and the Sonne in the eternall
proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt; than in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
production, or preſervation of all the creatures.
Yet are not theſe or other internall operations of
the bleſſed Trinity ſo <hi>free</hi> in reſpect of the divine
nature, as is the production of the world. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
God decrees he decrees it freely, that is, ſo
as he might not decree it. Whatſoever he makes
he makes it freely, that is, he ſo makes it, as that it
was not neceſſary for him to make it.</p>

law or rule it is, that if the one be true, the other

the world, which is ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as the
exiſtence of the Divine Nature, or the internall
operations of the Trinity. Whence it is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7905:180"/>
theſe two propoſitions <hi>[The generation of

be capable of truth. The firſt is ſo abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and ſo neceſſarily true, that the latter is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
falſe. But ſuch is not the caſe or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe two propoſitions following: <hi>[The
Creation or Exiſtence of the World is neceſſary: The

Theſe are not contradictories for their form,
nor equivalent to contradictories for their matter
or ſubject, and therefore may admit a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them. To ſay the creation or exiſtence of
the world was abſolutely neceſſary, hath no truth
in it: for it had a beginning of exiſtence and being,
and may have an end: and the other extreame or
contrary <hi>[The not creation or non exiſtence of the

of truth in it. It remaines then, that the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorie

true. The contradictory to the former is this:
<hi>[The creation or exiſtence of the world is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>[The not creation or non exiſtence of the

it ſhould be created: both theſe propoſitions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
(ſeeing either of them is a true meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the two former extreames or falſe ones,)
are moſt true: <hi>[1 The creation of the world was
poſsible, 2 The not creation of the world was poſsible.]</hi>
And if as well the not creation, as the creation of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7905:181"/>
the world, was poſſible; wee may not deny that
God did freely create it: ſeeing freedome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
taken, includes or is a poſſibility of doing or
not doing. It was likewiſe free for the Almighty, to
create or not to create Man or Angell. But his free
purpoſe to create them after his owne Image be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuppoſed: it was not meerly poſſible, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
neceſſary that they ſhould bee created
good. In as much as he is goodneſſe it ſelfe, it is
not poſſible that evill ſhould bee created by him,
that he ſhould be the Author of it. As is his being,
ſo is his goodneſſe, perpetually abſolute, eternally
neceſſary. But though Men and Angels were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
created good, yet their goodneſſe in the
beginning was mutable, not perpetually neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
The queſtion is, whether continuance in that
goodneſſe, wherein God created them, were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
poſsible in reſpect of Gods decree, unto ſuch as
have not ſo continued, or their non continuance
neceſſary: Or whether, neither their continuance
or non continuance were neceſſary, or both alike
poſsible. To ſay that <hi>Adams</hi> continuance in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
was, in reſpect of Gods decree, neceſſary, is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>vidently convinced of falſhood by his fall. So that
the other part onely remaines queſtionable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Adams</hi> non continuance in the ſtate of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
were ſo abſolutely decreed by God, that it
was not poſsible for him to continue. For reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this point, we are to inquire, Firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in reſpect of Gods power it were poſsible.
Secondly, whether in reſpect of his goodneſſe it
were neceſsary or moſt congruent, to ordaine or
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7905:181"/>
decree neither a neceſsitie of continuance, nor a
neceſsitie of non continuance in goodneſſe; but
the meane betweene them, that is, an abſolute
poſsibilitie of continuance, and an abſolute poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie
of non continuance. That it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to decree ſuch a mutuall poſsibilitie, may
thus be proved.</p>
                     <p>2. Whatſoever implies no contradiction, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
poſſible, and fals within the object of om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie.
But this mixt poſſibilitie of <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
or <hi>not continuing,</hi> being a meane betwixt the
neceſſitie of <hi>Adams continuance,</hi> and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>not continuance</hi> in the ſtate of integritie, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
no contradiction: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was poſſible for
God to decree it. That it implies no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in reſpect of the <hi>forme,</hi> is a point ſo cleare from
the firſt principles of <hi>argumentation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> that hee
which vnderſtands not this, is neither fit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
nor to be diſputed with. But the ſame <hi>forme</hi>
(notwithſtanding) of contrarietie applied to the
divine nature, the perſons in Trinitie, or their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
operations, admits no <hi>meane.</hi> What is the
reaſon? The nature and <hi>attributes</hi> of the <hi>Deitie</hi>
are <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſſary and precedent to all divine
decrees or effects of Gods power. And it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a contradiction, that any thing which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<hi>neceſſarie,</hi> ſhould admit any mixture of
contingency, or of poſſibilitie of the contrary.
But the <hi>nature, ſtate, condition,</hi> or <hi>exiſtence</hi> of man,
are not proper obiects of the divine decree, yet
proper effects of his power, and being ſuch, they
are not abſolutely neceſſary; and not being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7905:182"/>
in themſelves, they cannot <hi>incomber</hi> or <hi>involve</hi>
propoſitions, for their <hi>forme,</hi> not neceſſarie with
abſolute neceſſitie. Whatſoever had a true poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
of beeing before it was, may bee actually
ſuch as it was abſolutely poſſible for it to be, or ſuch
as it might pleaſe the Almightie Creator (who
is free in all his actions <hi>ad extra)</hi> to make it. It was
poſſible for him to make mans goodneſſe or his
continuance in it, not to be neceſſary, but contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
He that made man of <hi>nothing,</hi> had nothing
to reſiſt or hinder him from <hi>ſquaring</hi> or <hi>framing</hi>
his <hi>nature,</hi> to that <hi>abſtract forme</hi> of truth which was
in its ſelfe, or (as we ſay) <hi>objectively poſsible.</hi> For
abſolute <hi>Omnipotencie</hi> includes an abilitie to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſe</hi>
or fill meere logicall poſſibilities, with true
and Phyſicall ſubſtances or qualities, as truely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
unto them, as naturall <hi>bodies</hi> are to <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
mathematicall. But concerning Gods power
to decree an abſolute contingencie in the ſtate,
Condition, or Actions of men, there can bee no
queſtion amongſt ſuch as grant his <hi>Omnipotencie</hi>
to be out of queſtion. What could neceſsitate his
will to lay a neceſsitie of ſinning upon <hi>Adam,</hi>
whoſe fall or firſt ſinne, if it were neceſſary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Gods decree, the neceſsitie muſt needs
proceed from Gods Omnipotent decree, without
which nothing can haue any reall poſsibilitie or
true title of beeing, much leſſe a <hi>neceſsitie</hi> of bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For Divine Omnipotencie is the firſt and ſole
<hi>Foundation</hi> of all <hi>Beeing,</hi> otherwiſe then by it; and
from it nothing can come to paſſe either neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
or contingently.</p>

3. Whatſoeuer is and hath not beene, muſt of
neceſſitie have ſome cauſe of now beeing. And
as is the event or effect, ſuch muſt the cauſalty bee.
If the one be neceſſarie or inevitable, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the other ſhould bee contingent or meerely
poſsible. Both, or neither, muſt bee neceſſarie.
Man we ſuppoſe did once ſtand upright, his <hi>firſt
ſinne</hi> or fall, <hi>That</hi> action what ſoever it were, which
brought him downe, the evils which thence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued,
are not meere <hi>nothing:</hi> Evill it ſelfe got
ſome kinde of beeing by his negligence, which
from the beginning it had not. Of all, or any of
theſe, the queſtion ſtill <hi>revolves,</hi> whether they
were neceſſary or not neceſſarie, but <hi>Contingent.</hi>
If <hi>Contingent,</hi> we have no more to ſay, but Gods
peace be on them, which ſo ſpeake and thinke: If
any reply, that they were neceſſarie, he muſt aſsigne
a neceſſary cauſe of their beeing. For without
ſome cauſe they could not be, and without a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitating
cauſe, there was no neceſsitie that they
ſhould bee. Was this <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> neceſsitie then
from man or from God? from any ſecond cauſe,
or from the firſt cauſe of all things? if from man
onely or from other ſecond cauſes; then were
they neceſſary not in reſpect of the firſt cauſe, but
in reſpect of the ſecond: that is, ſome ſecond cauſe
did make them neceſſarie, when as the firſt cauſe
had left them free, or meerely poſsible; which to
affirme is contrary to their poſitions, with whom
we diſpute, and in it ſelfe unconceiveable. For
who can make that <hi>neceſſarie,</hi> which God hath
made contingent or ſubject to <hi>change?</hi> What can
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7905:183"/>
be ſaid then? that God did <hi>make</hi> mans fall, his firſt
ſinne or <hi>appetite</hi> of the forbidden fruite, to bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie,
or neceſsitate his will in his ſiniſter choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
This were all one, as to ſay, that God were
the immediate and <hi>neceſſarie</hi> cauſe of ſinne, of
death, of all the <hi>evills</hi> that have befallen mankinde
ſince <hi>Adam.</hi> For he is the <hi>ſole immediate</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
cauſe of all things which hee ſo decrees as
they cannot poſsibly fall out otherwiſe. For him
to erre in decreeing, or for the execution of his
decree to bee defeated, is impoſsible. In reſpect of
his proper and adaequate object, and peremptorily
intended <hi>effect,</hi> his will is a more irreſiſtible, more
powerfully <hi>neceſsitating</hi> cauſe, than any other cauſe
whatſoever. Now if Gods <hi>will</hi> had beene, to leave
no poſsibility for <hi>Adams</hi> perſerverance, his <hi>fall</hi> had
beene the compleat object of Gods decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our firſt eſtate, and by conſequence
Gods <hi>decree,</hi> or <hi>will</hi> had beene the firſt cauſe of
<hi>ſinnes</hi> firſt entrance into the world.</p>

from a prime cauſe or <hi>Creator</hi> of evill onely, not
of any thing that was good. And better it is (for it
is more conſonant to our Saviours adviſe) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the <hi>tree</hi> for evill, where the <hi>fruite</hi> is
evill, then to juſtifie it for good, when the fruite
is apparently and of neceſſitie <hi>naught.</hi> The perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie
or ſtiffeneſſe in this common error, <hi>[Evils
and miſchiefe, or wicked actions fall out by neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie]</hi>
being preſuppoſed aequall; they adde leſſe
ſinne or errour to it, which hence acknowledge a
<hi>prime</hi> cauſe of <hi>evill,</hi> or a cauſe <hi>evill</hi> by <hi>fatall</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie;
then thoſe which hold <hi>evill</hi> to be <hi>neceſſary</hi> in
reſpect of his Omnipotent decree, who is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good. In fine, the <hi>Manichees</hi> were groſſe hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques
in holding evill and miſchiefe to fall out
by inevitable neceſsitie; but this hereſie once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
it was rather a conſonancy of error, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
addition of new hereſie, to admit two prime
<hi>cauſes</hi> or Creators, the one of good, the other of
evill. They durſt not ſlander <hi>goodneſſe</hi> with any
crime, or for being the Author of any thing that
was not <hi>good:</hi> nor were they diſpoſed to flatter
greatneſſe, as if <hi>evill</hi> were <hi>no evill,</hi> becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from it.</p>
                     <p>2. That which the Ancients reprooved in the
<hi>Stoicks</hi> opinion, as moſt injurious to God and all
good men, was, that they held all things (and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
things amongſt the reſt) to fall out by <hi>fate</hi> or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7905:184"/>
unavoydable <hi>neceſsitie.</hi> This foundation being
once laied, the rootes of vertue muſt utterly periſh,
and that which we call <hi>vice</hi> ſhould bee a meere
name, or matter of nothing: there is no place left
for juſt <hi>reward</hi> or <hi>puniſhment.</hi> Whether by <hi>fate</hi>
the <hi>Stoicks</hi> meant the influence of ſtarres, the
courſe of nature, or the decree of GOD (who to
them was all one with Nature;) <hi>all</hi> was one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the former inconveniences, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
followed from admiſsion of an inevitable
neceſſitie in humane actions, whence ſoever <hi>that</hi>
be derived. To ſay, it comes from the firſt cauſe,
or from the ſecond, is meerly accidentall to the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
or inconvenience ſo ſharply &amp; juſtly reproved
by the primitive Church. In reſpect of a Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
commoditie, it is all one, whether he be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
for ſetting up or trafiquing, by the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of his own profeſsion, or by ſome higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
ſo the prohibition or reſtraint be as large &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie,
without hope of releaſe: or if he bee
reſtrained upon his allegiance by the Prince or
privy counſell, his hopes of thriving will be much
leſſe, then if he were <hi>tied</hi> onely by the locall ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of ſome pettie Corporation. Thus if the
Stoick derived the neceſsitie of all things from the
revolution of the Heavens, or from other ſecond
cauſes, as their ſuppoſed guides: the impoſsibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of doing otherwiſe then we doe, was, in every
Chriſtians conceipt, evidently much leſſe, then if
we derive this neceſsitie from the <hi>Omnipotent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</hi>
Now the danger or incenvenience of their
opinion, did <hi>formally</hi> conſiſt, in nurſing a conceipt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7905:185"/>
in men, that it was impoſsible for them to doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then they doe, or to avoyd the <hi>evills</hi> and
miſchiefes into which they fall. And theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
or inconveniences, are ſo much greater in
Chriſtians then they were in the <hi>Stoicks;</hi> as the
God which wee acknowledge is more Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
then nature or the <hi>Stoicks</hi> god. For the more
Omnipotent he is, the more impoſsible is it for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
creature to avoid the neceſsitie which by <hi>his</hi>
decree is layed upon him.</p>
                     <p>3. In reſpect of the former inconveniences, or
of the opinion it ſelfe, it is meerely accidentall,
whether this neceſsity bee layed upon us by coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or willingly and cheerefully entertained by
us; whether it proceed from Gods power or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion,
or from his wiſdome: ſo our actions and
their iſſues, bee, in reſpect of his Omnipotent
power or will, alike unavoidable. If birds and
fiſhes could ſpeake, I ſuppoſe the one would as
much complaine of thoſe that in hard <hi>froſt</hi> or
<hi>ſnow,</hi> allure them with baites to come within the
<hi>fall</hi> of the trappe, as the other would doe of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for driving them violently into their nets. If
the birds once taken be uſed as hardly; their expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations
would be ſo much more juſt, as their
uſage before their taking, was more kinde. To
make a man willing to undoe himſelfe, upon faire
promiſes made, not with purpoſe to doe him
good, but to circumvent him; is greater cruelty
then can accompany open violence. Hee that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
miniſters poyſon inſtead of Phyſick, is in all
mens judgement, as true a Murderer, as hee that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7905:185"/>
kils with the ſword, albeit the partie to whom it
is miniſtred, having no reaſon to ſuſpect any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
doe willingly drinke it. And the leſſe ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or more charitably affected hee is to his
profeſſed Phyſitian, the greater wrong he hath in
being thus uncharitably dealt with. It would lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
boote the malefactor in this kinde, to plead;
Albeit <hi>I gave it him, hee might have choſen</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would have drunke it, becauſe I did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
him with a drawen Dagger or other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
to be his owne executioner. In many caſes,
one may be the true cauſe of anothers death, and
deſerve death himſelfe, although he be not any <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
cauſe</hi> of his death, or plot his deſtruction
without poſſibilitie of avoidance. But if our <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
choyſe of thoſe waies which lead to death,
be neceſſarie in reſpect of the Almighties decree,
ſo that there be no poſsibilitie left, to eſcape it; hee
is a more neceſſarie and more immediate cauſe of
all their deaths that thus periſh, then any man can
be of his death whom he poiſons. And if the caſe
ſtood thus with any, their miſerie were greater, by
how much they did leſſe ſuſpect his goodneſſe:
However, moſt miſerable, becauſe moſt deſperate.
Reaſon and knowledge (the two ornaments of the
humane nature) ſhould be to them a curſe. He that
neither knowes nor doth his Maſters will, ſhall be
beaten; becauſe it was poſsible for him to have
known it: but w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> fewer ſtripes, becauſe not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, there was no poſsibility left for him to doe
it. But <hi>he that knowes it,</hi> and <hi>doth it not, ſhall be beaten
with many ſtripes,</hi> becauſe the knowledge of his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7905:186"/>
will to puniſh ſinners, and reward the righteous,
did include a poſſibilitie to avoyd death, and to be
made partaker of life. If otherwiſe, there bee no
poſſibilitie left for him, that knowes Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
againſt ſinne, to avoid the <hi>wayes</hi> of ſinne (thoſe
are death;) his caſe before and after death, is much
more miſerable than his, whom God in juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
hath deprived of knowledge. And the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver
of men ſhould be accounted much more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to ſtocks and truncks, than unto many

acquit this decree, or the <hi>Author</hi> of it from being
the <hi>Author</hi> of evill? did the <hi>Stoick</hi> condemne all

hath framed this anſwer to the queſtion propoſed:

unto men. And if <hi>nature</hi> or temper of bodie make

ſome of our owne ſtamp and ranke more noyſome
than theſe creatures are, unto their neighbours; to

which is due unto the other, is no <hi>injuſtice,</hi>
no <hi>inequality.</hi> And<note n="*" place="margin">In Dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtam.</note>

culpae fatalis paena,) <hi>puniſhment is fatall to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
crimes.</hi> But this is <hi>principium petere,</hi> to take that

which malefactors do and ſuffer, be truly <hi>fatall;</hi> the
one is no true crime, the other is no juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
To <hi>Galen</hi> I anſwer, that if we could by any
skill in phyſick or complexions diſcerne ſome men
to bee as naturally diſpoſed to <hi>miſchiefe</hi> all that
come in their way, or by chance offend them; as are
the Snake, the Sloworm, or other ſerpent, it would
be the wiſeſt way for ſuch as love their lives, to rid

creatures, as faſt as they met with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
ſome certaine daies for hunting them, as wee
do noyſome beaſts. But to examine their ſuſpitious
<hi>intentions,</hi> to queſtion their actions, to arraign their
perſons, or put them upon a <hi>formall</hi> or legall tryall
of their life, would be as ridiculous, as to produce
<hi>witneſſes</hi> againſt a Snake, to <hi>empannell</hi> a Iury upon a
mad Dog, or to take bale for a Wolfes appearance,
before a Butcher, in an aſſembly of Maſtives.</p>
                     <p>5 The common <hi>notions</hi> of good and evill, &amp; the
ingraffed opinion of contingency in humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7905:187"/>
have taught the Lawgivers of every nation, to
put notorious malefactors unto more exquiſite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
than we do harmfull creatures; either to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
them to utter, what no <hi>deſtiny</hi> nor complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
makes them voluntarily confeſſe, or elſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre
others (that are as naturally diſpoſed to evill,
as they were) from doing the like. Scarce any male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
(unleſs he be <hi>poyſoned</hi> with this opinion of
abſolute neceſſity) but will acknowledge that it was
poſſible for him to have done otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath
done; poſſible for him to have avoided the doome,
which is paſſed upon him by man: which to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
had been abſolutely <hi>impoſsible,</hi> if it were to
be awarded upon him by Gods eternall decree, or
(which is all one) if in reſpect of this decree, it had
been neceſſary. As ignorance of the true God, and
his ſaving truth, makes the <hi>former</hi> error more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable
in the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> than in ſuch Chriſtians as ſhal
maintain it: ſo might impotency exempt that God
which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> worſhipped, (whether Nature,
<hi>Fate,</hi> or ſome other diſtinct celeſtiall <hi>power)</hi> from
thoſe imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, unto which omnipotency makes
the God of Chriſtians lyable, if all things were by
vertue of his decree abſolutely neceſſary. It was a
received opinion among many Heathens, that the
gods themſelves were ſubject unto <hi>Fate,</hi> &amp; for this
reaſon, when any thing fell out in their judgement
amiſs; <hi>Fates</hi> commonly did either intirely bear the
blame, or the greateſt part of it. And their gods (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed)
had deſerved pity rather than blame, if they
could do no better than they did, as being <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſtered</hi>
by <hi>Fates.</hi> But for a Chriſtian to inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7905:187"/>
                        <hi>Fates,</hi> is to accuſe or deny his God. If <hi>Fates</hi>
be nothing, hee hath no reaſon to complaine of
them: if any thing they bee, they are of the true
Gods <hi>making,</hi> who made all things, who cannot
poſſibly be ſubject to any thing that he hath made.
Nor can it ſtand with our <hi>allegiance</hi> to ſay when any
diſaſters befall us, that our God could no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
chooſe, that our miſchances were the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary effects of his Omnipotent decree.
One ſpeciall cauſe of this error, and of ſome mens
adherence to it, is a jealouſie or zealous needleſſe
feare, leſt they ſhould grant God to be impotent,
or not ſo omnipotent but that ſome things might
take poſſeſſion of <hi>beeing</hi> without his leave or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
The originall of this feare, is, want of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
betweene <hi>chance</hi> or <hi>caſualty,</hi> and ſuch
<hi>contingency</hi> as hath beene expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>6 Many reaſons might be alledged ſufficient to
demonſtrate the inevitable abſurdities of this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
abſolute neceſſity. But it is one labour to
convince an error before indifferent hearers; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make men forſake the errours which have
long poſſeſſed them: a third to win them unto a
liking of the contrary truth. For effecting the two
latter, no meanes can be ſo effectuall in reſpect of

God did allow or approve his eating of it, ſeeing
he threatned it with death. But if, by his decree,
he did not allow it, he did <hi>permit</hi> it onely in ſuch a
<hi>ſenſe,</hi> as we may ſay the Lawes of our land, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
men to be hanged becauſe they keepe not men

no tyrant did ever before hand forbid ſuch a fact,
under paine of death, without a ſuppoſed naturall
poſſibility to avoid it. And juſt Lawes afford or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
or civill meanes for ſatisfying nature in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
leſt theſe (as they know no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w) enforce
men to uſe their naturall poſſibilities or faculties
amiſſe. The lawes of this Land and others, which
make theft matter of death, permit men the free
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7905:189"/>
imployment of bodily faculties, to <hi>earne</hi> their
bread, or (if they be impotent) to crave or accept
the <hi>benevolence</hi> of others, leſt they ſhould periſh
for hunger, or be enforced to ſteale. If our lawes
or Lawgivers, not permitting any of theſe meanes
or the like, ſhould puniſh the taking of a loafe of
<hi>bread</hi> or cup of drinke, with death; they might be
more truly ſaid to enjoyne, then permit theft;
to be more delighted with the bloud of the <hi>needy,</hi>
than with preſervation of publike peace; albeit
they did not ſet other mens meat before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when
they are hungred, nor lead their hands to take it. In
like manner, he that ſaith, God did permit <hi>Adam</hi>
to eate the forbidden fruit, and by eating to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
death, doth neceſſarily imply, that God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him the free uſe of his externall and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
faculties to ſatisfie his appetite, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meate. Now the free uſe of any faculty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the <hi>concourſe</hi> or <hi>cooperation</hi> of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it is impoſſible any creature ſhould
move. And this concourſe was a part of his decree
or <hi>will</hi> as it concerned this <hi>act.</hi> More plainly: He
that permitted <hi>Adam</hi> to ſinne, did more than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to abſtaine from ſinne, or to perſevere in
obedience. If then God in <hi>permitting</hi> him onely
to ſinne, did afford meanes neceſſary for reducing
this poſſibility of ſinning into a ſinfull act not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
his <hi>more</hi> than <hi>permiſsion</hi> of him to abſtaine
from ſinne, <hi>his commandement to perſevere in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
did not onely ſuppoſe a true poſſibility for
him to abſtaine and perſevere, but include withall
better meanes for reducing this poſſibility into act,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7905:189"/>
then were afforded for enabling him actually to
ſinne. Theſe two contrary poſſibilities, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
meanes for accompliſhing them, muſt beare a
proportion anſwerable to a meere permiſsion
without approbation, or to a prohibition, and to a
peremptorie command of civill authoritie. Now
every juſt Lawgiver affords better meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
for accompliſhing his commands
or requeſts, then he doth for breaking or negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
them.</p>
                     <p>2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For concluſion, when they ſay God, by his
aeternall deree, did permit <hi>Adams fall,</hi> their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
rightly expreſſed, is no more then this; God
did <hi>not</hi> decree that his <hi>perſeverance</hi> ſhould bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.
For <hi>neceſsitie</hi> of <hi>perſeverance</hi> excludes
all poſsibility of falling. But if his fall had beene
<hi>neceſſarie</hi> in reſpect of the aeternall <hi>decree,</hi> it had
not onely beene <hi>permitted,</hi> but <hi>allowed</hi> and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
It remaines then that both were poſsible,
neither neceſſary in reſpect of the divine decree.
Or to untwiſt the knot a little further; God by
his decree did <hi>permit</hi> and <hi>allow</hi> him a poſsibility
to fall; but he did not allow the reduction of this
poſsibility into act, that is, he gave it him, not to
the end that he ſhould fal, but that his perſeverance
might be more beneficiall. He did not onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
or allow him a <hi>poſsibitie</hi> of perſeverance, but
did command and require the reduction of this
poſsibilitie into act.</p>
                     <p>3 This forme of wholſome doctrine admitted,
will clearely <hi>enlighten</hi> the truth of another diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or reſolution much uſed, but mightily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7905:190"/>
or rather quite ſtifeled, by ſuch as hold all
things neceſſary in reſpect of the aeternall decree.
The diſtinction is: <hi>God is the cauſe of every action,
but he is not the cauſe of the obliquitie which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
ſinfull actions, nor of ſinne as it is ſinne.</hi> This
is their laſt Apologie for avoyding that imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of making God the author of ſinne. Herein
wee both agree; The coexiſtence of the <hi>all-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
decree (or divine cooperation) is neceſſarily
required to every action or effect. Every action
includes a <hi>motion,</hi> and <hi>in him wee move, wee live,
and have our beeing.</hi> But hee that will grant this
<hi>cooperation</hi> or actuall coexiſtence of the all-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
decree to be the <hi>neceſſarie cauſe</hi> of every acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
unto which it is moſt neceſſarily required;
muſt, upon the ſame tearmes, grant, God to bee
not the <hi>neceſſarie</hi> onely, but the onely cauſe of all
and every <hi>obliquitie,</hi> of all and every ſinne, of all
that hath beene, is, or can be <hi>blame-worthy</hi> in men
or <hi>devills,</hi> from their <hi>creation</hi> to euerlaſting. The
demonſtration of this inconvenience or abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
wherewith we charge the adverſe opinion (but
no maintainer of it) muſt be referred unto the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſsions
of the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Innocency</hi> and the manner
of ſinnes entring into the world: we are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to extract a better meaning out of their
other words, than they themſelves expreſſe, or
can truely be contained in them, untill they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the opinion of abſolute neceſsity in humane
actions, as they have reference to the aeternall
decree.</p>
                     <p>Seeing it is agreed vpon, that God and man are
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7905:190"/>
joynt agents in every ſinfull action, or in effects
<hi>eſſentially</hi> evill (ſuch queſtionleſſe was mans deſire
to be like God, or his luſting after the forbiden
fruite:) The Probleme remaines, why both
ſhould not be aequall ſharers in the ſinne: or how
it is poſſible juſtly to condemne men of iniquitie,
without ſome imputation unto God, who is the
principall agent in all actions. <hi>Shall wee bee partiall
for him or ſeeke to excuſe him by his greatneſſe?
Shall wee ſay hee cannot doe amiſſe, becauſe he is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Lord over all, and may doe with his creatures
what hee liſt?</hi> To ſuch as count the donative of
robbers a true <hi>boone</hi> or reall curteſie; to ſuch as
can magnifie their owne integrity, whereof they
give no proofe, ſave onely as he did by negatives,
(non hominem occidi,) <hi>I am no murtherer.</hi> The
Poet hath ſhaped an anſwere, as fit as pertinent,
(non paſces in cruce corvos,) <hi>Thou ſhalt not feede
Ravens upon a Gibbet.</hi> To ſay God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of ſinne were hideous blaſphemie: yet to ſay
he is no <hi>tempter,</hi> no ſeducer of mankind to evill,
is not to offer praiſe unto him. Let my ſpirit va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
with my breath, and my immortall ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to nothing, rather then ſuffer her ſelfe to be
overtaken with ſuch a dead ſlumber, as can reſt
contented to ſet forth <hi>His Glory</hi> by <hi>bare negatives,</hi>
or by not being the Author of ſinne, who is moſt
highly to be praiſed in all his works, whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is infinitely greater in concurring to ſinfull
actions, then the goodneſſe of his beſt creatures
in the accompliſhment of their moſt ſyncere
intentions.</p>

                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:7905:191"/>
4 The truth of this concluſion is neceſſarily
grounded upon theſe aſſertions hereafter to bee
diſcuſſed: <hi>That mans poſsibilitie or hopes of attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
everlaſting happineſſe, was of neceſsitie to bee
tempered with a poſsibilitie of ſinning, or falling into
miſerie.</hi> To permit or allow man this poſſibility of
ſinning, &amp; to beſtow upon him the contrary poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of not ſinning and hope of happines was one
&amp; the ſame <hi>branch</hi> of divine goodneſſe. One &amp; the
ſelfe ſame branch of Gods goodneſſe it was, to
allow this poſſibilitie of ſinning, and to afford his
concourſe for reducing of it into Act. For unleſſe
he had decreed to afford his concourſe thereto, it
had beene impoſſible for man actually to have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And if for man to ſinne had beene made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible
by Gods decree: it had been alike impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for him to have <hi>done well</hi> or ill, or to become
truly happy. Briefly, God in that hee decreed a
mixture of contrary poſsibilities, decreed withall
a concourſe or cooperation <hi>ſutable</hi> unto, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for the actuall accompliſhment of both. To
the probleme propounded, the anſwere from theſe
grounds, is eaſie: <hi>Albeit God</hi> and man bee joynt
<hi>agents</hi> in every action or effect eſſentially <hi>evill,</hi>
yet the whole ſinne is wholy mans: becauſe the
nature of ſinne conſiſts either in mans uſing the
poſsibility of <hi>ſinne</hi> allowed of God for his good,
to accompliſh ſuch acts, as God diſallowes, or in
not uſing the contrary <hi>poſsibilitie</hi> unto ſuch acts,
as he not onely alloweth and approveth, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
and commandeth, ſuch as he moſt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
rewardeth, and unto whoſe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7905:191"/>
hee affordeth, not his ordinarie concourſe
onely, but his ſpeciall furtherance and aſſiſtance.
In every ſin of commiſſion, we approve and make
choice of thoſe acts which his infinite goodneſſe
diſalloweth. In every ſinne of omiſſion, we do not
approve thoſe acts, which he approveth: although
perhaps it may be queſtioned, whether there can
be any ſinne of pure omiſſion, or not mixt with
commiſſion; that is, any ſinne wherein we doe not
either like what God diſlikes, or reject and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
what he likes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mends unto us for good.</p>
                     <p>5 From theſe reſolutions we may finde ſome
truth in an uſuall poſition; which, without this
truth preſuppoſed, is palpably falſe. <hi>Every action
or effect, as it is an effect or action, or as it proceeds
from God, is good.</hi> The beſt meaning whereof it is
capable, muſt be this; Gods goodneſſe is ſeene in
every action, even in thoſe which are moſt ſinfull. To
vouchſafe his cooperation to <hi>them,</hi> is a branch
of his goodneſſe, becauſe man could not be happy
without a poſſibility of deſerving to be miſerable.
But humane actions or effects in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
indefinitely conſidered, or in the abſtract as
they are actions, are neither morally good, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
bad. When it is ſaid that every action, as an
action, is good, this muſt be underſtood of tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
goodnes only, of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> kind of goodnes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
evill or ſin it ſelfe is partaker. If every action, as
it is an actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were morally good, it were impoſſible
any action ſhold be morally evill. If we conſider hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
actions not indefinitely, or with this redupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as they are actions, but deſcending unto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7905:192"/>
ſome <hi>are good,</hi> ſome <hi>are bad,</hi> and ſome <hi>(per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)</hi>
poſitively indifferent, but of this hereafter.</p>

meere wiſhes of <hi>winde</hi> which vaniſhed with the

out of tender affection to his people and country,
without commiſſion from his Maker? or was <hi>He</hi>
leſſe affected towards his people then this his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,
that his meſſage wants the waight of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
truth? To theſe and the like demands, of
many bad anſwers, this is the beſt and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
<hi>God would undoubtedly have made his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
good, and done aſwell by Iſraell as here hee wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
if Iſraell could have turned to him or done what
he requires.</hi> But that, ſay the ſame men, was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of Gods decree or ſecret will, <hi>impoſsible.</hi>
Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſeeing the condition neither was nor could
be performed by Iſrael, God was not bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
theſe bleſſings upon them, but free to reſerve
his ſtore unto himſelfe, or for ſome other people;
which was profered (but upon conditions impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to bee performed) unto Iſraell. Might not
churliſh <hi>Naball</hi> have promiſed abundance of
bread, of wine and fleſh to <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants, upon
like tearmes? May not cutthroate Vſurers aſſure
bags of Gold to bedridden or decrepit limbs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition they will fetch them from the toppe
of high towers or ſleep mountains? But what kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
what ſynceritie could there be in ſuch laviſh
profers, ſpecially if the impotent wretches were by
covenant excluded from al uſe of crutches? Yet
is it more poſſible for a <hi>creeple</hi> to goe without
his crutches, then for Iſraell to walke in the waies
of God, without his aide or aſſiſtance. Neceſsitie
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7905:195"/>
therefore conſtraines us to confeſſe the one of
theſe <hi>two, Either that there was no more ſynceritie

meant to uſe, but upon performance of impoſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:
Or elſe his promiſes, if they had any ſyncerity
in them, did include his furtherance and aſsiſtance
unto Iſraell for performing the condition requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Now unto whatſoever effect or event the
<hi>furtherance</hi> or ſpeciall <hi>aſsiſtance</hi> of Omnipotent
power is, upon the truth and <hi>ſynceritie</hi> of divine
promiſe, alwaies ready and aſſured, the ſame <hi>effect</hi>
cannot truly be deemed <hi>impoſsible</hi> in reſpect of the
aeternall decree. And whatſoever is not in reſpect
of this decree impoſsible, the non exiſtence of it, or
the exiſtence of the contrary effect, cannot, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the ſame decree, be neceſſarie. So then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was Iſraels well-doing and proſperitie, nor
their ill-doing and calamitie at any time abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>neceſſarie,</hi> in reſpect of Gods decree; both were
poſſible, both contingent.</p>
                     <p>4 The truth of theſe collections from Gods

neceſſarie and evident unto Artiſts, may from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
poſitive authorities of the ſame word be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

take their anſwere <hi>verbatim,</hi> as they uttered it?
No, God did not appoint him to keepe a <hi>Regiſter</hi>

convicted to have ſaid, <hi>wee will every one doe

imaginations of their heart were evill, and they
had reſolved to retaine their wonted principles,

The true and literall paraphraſe of their replye,

<hi>Iew,</hi> as the deſtruction of Ieruſalem (whereof it
was both times the principall cauſe and moſt

authorized another Prophet (after <hi>Ieremie)</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe

as univerſally true to all, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient
to any queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
things to come. The truth of every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive

exclude all poſſibility of the others reduction into

be ſufficient to evince the truth of my disjunctive

would bee as evident; becauſe the propoſition,
which he was to make good againſt me, was but

disjunctive: ſo that of any two minutes in the whole
day, if the one were rainy, and the other faire, my
univerſall disjunctive muſt needs be falſe, and his
apparantly true, becauſe directly contradictory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <p>2 When wee ſay that God in many humane

our meaning is, that the tenour of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
&amp; omnipotent word, from which all things
derive as well the <hi>law</hi> and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="5 letters">

as their being it ſelfe: is in reſpect of the ſeverall
<hi>poſsible</hi> events decreed, not conjunctive or catego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall,
but disjunctive. And we hold it a ſinne to
thinke or ſay, that the onely wiſe Almighty <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
is not able to conceive or make propoſitions as
truly <hi>disjunctive,</hi> as any of our making are, or not
able to make as formall and contradictory <hi>oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
betweene their ſeverall parts, as any humane
wit can conceive. Thus much being granted, our
intended inference is an everlaſting truth. Gods
decree or determinate <hi>propoſition,</hi> concerning the
ſuppoſed multiplicity of poſſibilities or manifold
events, all alike poſsible; is alwaies exactly fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
when any one of the events, whoſe <hi>poſsibilities</hi>
are decreed, goes actuall exiſtence. To reduce more
of them then one into <hi>act</hi> at one and the ſame time,
is, in many caſes altogether impoſſible, and falls not
within the <hi>object</hi> of Omnipotency. If the reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any one of them, into actuall poſſeſsion of its
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7905:198"/>
owne being, were in reſpect of his decree, or by
any other meanes, altogether neceſſary; his decree
ſhould neceſſarily; be broken, and his omnipotency
might be overborne. For the <hi>neceſsity</hi> of ones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
takes away all <hi>poſsibilitie</hi> of being from the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorie,</hi>
which omnipotency (as is ſuppoſed)
had beſtowed upon it. Finally, Gods decree in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of all and every part of its proper object, is
alike Omnipotent: and therefore it is as impoſsible
for any <hi>neceſsity</hi> (by vertue or <hi>reſpect</hi> of what cauſe
ſoever,) to incroach upon thoſe events, the Law
or manner of whoſe production God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
to be contingent; as for <hi>Contingency</hi> to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the production of thoſe events, the law or
manner of whoſe production or exiſtence, he hath
decreed to be <hi>neceſſary.</hi> As impoſsible for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to mingle with abſolute contingency, from
which God hath ſeparated it; as for contingencie
to be <hi>wedded</hi> to abſolute neceſsity, whoſe <hi>mariage</hi>
God hath forbidden by an everlaſting decree.</p>
                     <p>3 The onely difficulty,<note place="margin">Objection</note> wherewith theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
can (as I conceive) with probability bee
charged, may be conceived thus: <hi>Admitting Gods
decree</hi> concerning the <hi>houſe</hi> of Iſraels <hi>life</hi> or <hi>death,</hi>
were (as evidently it was) disjunctive, and did eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially
include a poſſibility of <hi>life,</hi> and a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>death,</hi> in reſpect of all or moſt of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or of their publike ſtate; Yet no man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
but that amongſt the ſeverall or oppoſite <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
of this or the like decree, God wills one, more
than another. For ſo he ſaith, <hi>That hee willed not
the death, but the life of him that dyed.</hi> Now if that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7905:199"/>
which God willeth not, may come to paſſe; and
that which he willeth may not come to paſſe; or if,
of two poſsible events, that whoſe actuall being he
willeth tenne thouſand times more ardently, never
get actuall being or exiſtence (as being prevented
by the actuall accompliſhment of the contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
or incompatible event which he leſſe willeth,)
How can his will, in this caſe bee fulfilled? and if
his will be not fulfilled, his decree muſt needs bee
broken; and if his decree may be broken, how is his
will ſaid to be <hi>irreſiſtible?</hi> how do we beleeve him
to be Omnipotent? Some perhaps would hence
conclude, that if of two objects, which we ſuppoſe
to bee alike truly <hi>poſsible,</hi> there bee no neceſsity,
that <hi>that</hi> ſhould come to paſſe, which GOD
willeth moſt, or any probabilitie for that to come
to paſſe, which he leſſe willeth, or willeth not at
all, but rather the contrary: Then there is a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
or rather a neceſſitie, that his will ſhould
not be alwaies fulfilled, that he might ſometimes
ſit downe with a kinde of loſſe, and ſay with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
man,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 
                        <hi>I have failed of my purpoſe.</hi> The beſt
preparation for fit and peaceable entertainment of
the Orthodoxall ſolution to theſe difficulties, will
be to declare the evident and neceſſary truth of
that aſſertion, which they object unto us, as a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
inconvenience able in their judgement to
infer the laſt concluſion.</p>
                     <p>Truth fully and evidently declared will juſtifie
it ſelfe againſt all gainſaiers. The aſſertion which
we grant will neceſſarily follow from our former
diſcurſions, and comes now to juſtifie it ſelfe is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7905:199"/>
this; <hi>That ſuch things as God no way willeth, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
come to paſſe, when as their contradictories,
which he wils moſt ardently, come not to paſſe.]</hi> The
principall inſtance for juſtifying this truth, is the
<hi>repentance</hi> and life of a ſinner, which God hath
ſworne that he willeth; ſo doth hee not his death,
if we will beleeve his oath. If any mans verdict
ſhall ſcatter from mine, or others, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
this doctrine, I muſt call God and his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to witneſſe, whether he hath not left that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> God wold have had him to do, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
done, that which God would have had him
not to doe? Let him that will anſwere negatively
to this Interrogative, indite that confeſſion which
we daily make in our Liturgy of falſhood or ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Let him call for <hi>Iacobs Ladder</hi> downe from
heaven, and require a <hi>guard</hi> of Angels to conduct
him ſafely into Gods preſence. For if hee have as
truely and continually done Gods will here on
Earth, as the Angels doe it in heaven; hee may
juſtly challenge ſpeedie <hi>admiſsion</hi> into their ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
But if he can with ſafe conſcience <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi>
with us ſinnefull men, in that confeſſion; his
exceptions againſt our aſſertion are but needleſſe
ſcrupuloſities, altogether againſt reaſon? what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they bee in reſpect of his conſcience, yet
to his exceptions wee are to frame a further anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were.</p>
                     <p>4 There is an abſolute neceſſity, that Gods will
ſhould alwayes be fulfilled: but there is no ſuch
neceſsitie, that it ſhould alwayes bee fulfilled by
the parties to whom it is revealed or directed.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7905:200"/>
They are tyed indeed by neceſsitie of praecept,
and at their perill, alwayes to doe it; but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
God, doth not referre the <hi>fulfilling</hi> or
<hi>evacuation</hi> of it, to their fidelitie, choice or reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for ſo the certaintie or infallibilitie of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his decree, ſhould bee but commenſurable
to the fragility of our Nature; and that which
ſome object unto us would fall directly upon
themſelves, to wit, That Gods will ſhould depend
upon mans will. As hee alwayes grants the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
of the faithfull, or, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes,
<hi>gives ſuch as delight in him, their hearts deſire,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he alwaies gives them not the particulars or
<hi>materialls</hi> which they requeſt or heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:
ſo he knows how to fulfill his own will, or do
his pleaſure, albeit thoſe particulars or materials,
which he ardently <hi>wils</hi> and takes moſt pleaſure in,
be not alwayes done by us. And this anſwer might
ſuffice unto a Reader not ſcrupulouſly curious. But
ſophiſticall and captious objections require artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
and <hi>formall</hi> ſolutions. The former objection
may perhaps be framed more captiouſly thus. Of
more <hi>particulars</hi> propoſed to the choiſe of men, if
that bee not alwayes done, which God willeth
moſt, his will is not done at all. For as a leſſer good
whileſt it ſtands in competition with a greater, is
rather evill than good: ſo, that which is leſſe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or deſired, cannot be ſaid to bee willed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
at all, in reſpect of that which is more deſired,
ſpecially in the language of Gods Spirit, which
expreſſely ſaith, that <hi>God will have mercy, and not
ſacrifice.</hi> Whence it will follow, that when ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7905:200"/>
was offered, without performance of duties
of mercy, or obedience; Gods will was not done,
but broken. It is Gods will likewiſe, that <hi>we ſhould
goe unto the houſe of mourning, rather then unto the
houſe of mirth.</hi> The duties to be performed in the
houſe of mourning are many: <hi>To mourne, to faſt,
to pray,</hi> with other branches of humiliation; all
which God truly willeth, in different meaſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the diverſity of their <hi>nature,</hi> or the more
or leſſe intenſive manner of their performance.
The tranſgreſſions likewiſe uſuall and frequent in
the <hi>houſe</hi> of unhallowed <hi>mirth,</hi> are many and
much different as well in quality as degree; all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
of God as contrary to his moſt holy will,
but more or leſs deteſted according to their <hi>nature,
quality</hi> or <hi>degree,</hi> or other circumſtance. Suppoſe
a man, to whom choiſe of going into the houſe of
<hi>mirth</hi> or <hi>mourning</hi> is ſolemnly propoſed; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
of the one, and gracious acceptance
of the other in Gods fight, ſeriouſly preſt by Gods
Miniſter; do vtterly reject the <hi>Preachers</hi> counſell,
and adventure upon the moſt deſperate evill that
is practiſed in the houſe of mirth: ſhall wee ſay
Gods will is in this caſe fulfilled? Yes, though the
<hi>evils</hi> which he willeth not, were tenne thouſand,
and man did deſperately reſolve to doe the very
worſt and moſt contrary to his will; yet that which
he willeth moſt, ſhall ſtill be done: for it is his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
and peremptory will, that all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
offered to mans choice, as well thoſe which his
Holineſſe moſt abhorreth, as thoſe which hee <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi>
moſt, ſhould bee truly <hi>poſsible</hi> for a man to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7905:201"/>
chooſe without impediment, that none ſhould bee
neceſſary. Now this liberty being left to man
which way ſoever his will inclineth, Gods will ſhall
be moſt <hi>infallibly</hi> fulfilled, in the ſelfe ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
as if the very beſt had beene choſen by man;
ſeeing it is his abſolute will to grant him freedome
(at his perill) to chooſe the very worſt and refuſe
the beſt. And the perill is, that Gods will ſhall be
done upon him according to the meaſure it was
neglected by him. As this propoſition [The Sun
will either ſhine or not ſhine this day at twelve of
the clocke] will be as true if the Sunne ſhine not,
as if it ſhine: ſo Gods <hi>will</hi> being (as is ſuppoſed
in this caſe) disjunctive, ſhall bee as truly fulfilled,
albeit man doth that which he willeth not, as if he
did that which he willed moſt. For his will (as was
now ſaid) may (according to the ſame meaſure) be
fulfilled two wayes, either by us, or upon us; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be this way or that way fulfilled, it is all one
to God, but much better for us <hi>to doe it,</hi> then <hi>to
have it done upon us.</hi> And though it be poſſible for
us not to doe it, yet not doing it there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
left, that it ſhall not be done upon us. In as
much then as Gods will muſt of neceſſity be done,
and no man can doe it by doing evill, (ſeeing it is
ſet onely on that which is truly good;) the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch as continue to doe evill, is abſolutely
neceſſary, that is altogether as unavoydable, as if
they had beene appointed to it from all eternities,
or created to no other end, then that they might
be <hi>puniſhed.</hi> For the puniſhment of evill is good,
and is for this reaſon a part of Gods <hi>will,</hi> or rather a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7905:201"/>
part of the <hi>object</hi> of his irreſiſtible will or inviolable

or into <hi>voluntatem ſigni &amp; beneplaciti.</hi> The
uſe notwithſtanding of the firſt diſtinction [of his
antecedent and conſequent will] is moſt ancient;
warranted by the authority of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and well
exemplified by <hi>Damaſcene.</hi> And of this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I have made choiſe in other meditations, as
moſt commodious (to my apprehenſion) for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
many problemes ariſing out of Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and Euangelicall paſſages, concerning the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of Gods will in his threats or promiſes. The
ingenuous Reader will not bee ſo uncharitable or
injurious towards <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> or <hi>Damaſcene,</hi> as to
ſuſpect, that either of them imagined two <hi>wills</hi> in
God; unto which imputation, they are more juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
liable, which <hi>affect</hi> the diſtinction of Gods <hi>ſecret</hi>
and revealed <hi>will,</hi> or of <hi>voluntatis ſigni &amp; benepla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citi.</hi>
For every diſtinction of Gods will, muſt bee
framed <hi>ex parte volitorum, non ex parte volentis,</hi> in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7905:202"/>
reſpect of the things willed, not in reſpect of him
that willeth them. We muſt in charity and good
manners permit <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Damaſcene</hi> that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of ſpeech which we take our ſelves. Now it
is uſuall with all of us, to attribute that <hi>verbo tenus</hi>
unto the cauſe, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> really and properly belongs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto the effect, or to denominate the intellectual
faculty from the qualitie of the object to which it
hath reference; as when we ſay <hi>the Sunne is hot, the
underſtanding is practique, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning of
thoſe two good Authors, whom we follow in the
uſe of the diſtinction of Gods <hi>antecedent or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
will,</hi> was this, or the like: <hi>That God by one
and the ſame indiviſible will, might differently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or approve divers objects, according to the nature
quality or degrees of goodnes contained in them.</hi> And
certaine it is, that the immenſity or greatneſſe of
our God, doth not make his power or will to bee
unweildy. Though he be in <hi>power</hi> truly <hi>infinite,</hi> yet
he alwayes worketh not according to the <hi>infinity</hi>
of his power, but oft-times more <hi>gently</hi> and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidly,
then the weakeſt or ſofteſt ſpirited of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creatures can doe. Though his will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be alwayes irreſiſtible, yet is it not alwayes ſo
peremptorily ſet on this or that particular object
willed by him, as mans will, for the moſt part, is.
The variety of particular objects which hee truely
willeth in different meaſure, is much greater than
the wit of man can comprehend So is the liberty
or variety of choiſe, which hee alloweth unto his
creature, much greater then we can without grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
afford to ſuch as have dependance on us.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7905:203"/>
Some things he willeth in the firſt place and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly;
though not ſo peremptorily, but that things
leſſe willed by him, or contrary <hi>evills,</hi> which hee
willeth not, may get the ſtart or take place of them
in humane choiſe. Other things he willeth in the
ſecond place, or by conſequence, as in caſe, <hi>that</hi>
which in the firſt place he willed, be (by abuſe of
mans free will) rejected. The <hi>former</hi> he is ſaid to
will by his <hi>antecedent</hi> will, becauſe the object wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by him, hath <hi>antecedence</hi> or <hi>preeminence</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his <hi>beneplacitum</hi> or <hi>acceptance:</hi> the latter
he is ſaid to will by his conſequent will, that is not
in the firſt place or directly, but by <hi>conſequent,</hi> as
ſuppoſing thoſe <hi>objects,</hi> which he better approved,
to be neglected. Whatſoever is good in it ſelfe,
and good withal for a reaſonable creature to make
choiſe of, that, God is ſaid to will by his antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
will, as the repentance of a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fruits which the <hi>ſinner</hi> ſhall reape by his <hi>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie.</hi>
Whatſoever in it ſelfe is not evill, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the rule of goodneſſe, but evill to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creature, which muſt ſuffer it, as ſickneſſe,
death, all kinde of torture or calamity, <hi>that God
willeth onely by his conſequent will.</hi> We may not
deny but that he truly willeth the death of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſinners, yet this he willeth by his conſequent
will. Their obſtinacy in ſinne he willeth not at all,
for if he did, he would not puniſh it: for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the neceſſary conſequent of his <hi>will</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
Both theſe branches of one and the ſame
<hi>will</hi> (which from the reference onely which they
have unto their different <hi>objects,</hi> wee conceive to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7905:203"/>
bee two or divers) are ſubordinate to his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and peremptorie will, which is, that man
ſhould have a libertie of doing, and not doing
thoſe things which in the firſt place he willed or
liked better. But is not this libertie of man an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection?</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>An iſſue</hi> though a blemiſh to youth and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
is ofttimes a good meane or principall
cauſe of health to an unſound and craſie bodie. So
<hi>poſsibility</hi> of declining to evill, albeit in it ſelfe
an imperfection, and not poſsibly incident to <hi>aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
and <hi>immutable</hi> goodneſſe, is no way contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the participated actuall goodneſſe of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creature; whereof it is an eſſentiall or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive
part, at the leaſt a neceſſarie ingredient
or condition precedent to the conſtitution of it.
And imperfection with reference to this end, may
be the object of Gods antecedent will, or part of
that which in the firſt place he willeth and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
intends. But inaſmuch as <hi>actuall</hi> evill is <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi>
diſſonant to actuall goodneſſe; hee which is
<hi>actually</hi> and <hi>infinitely</hi> good, cannot but hate or
diſlik actuall evill in whomſoever it is <hi>found,</hi> as
much as he loveth the contrary good. Now <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi>
or <hi>malum poenae,</hi> being as neceſſarie a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
of Gods hate or diſlike of ſinne, as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
or happineſſe is of his loue to <hi>vertue</hi> and
<hi>pietie:</hi> the reaſonable creature by declining from
vertue to vice, from good to bad, doth <hi>ipſo facto</hi>
and inevitably bring evill <hi>[malum poenae &amp; damni]
tribulation</hi> and anguiſh upon it ſelfe. By reward
and puniſhment in this place, wee underſtand not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7905:204"/>
onely life and death everlaſting (of whoſe refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Gods aeternall decree, we ſhall in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
diſpute hereafter, if Superiours ſhall ſo think
fit:) but every temporall bleſsing or croſſe, all
proſperity or calamitie, ſpecially publike &amp; remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable.
Proſperitie we alwayes take to be a pledge
of Gods love (though not alwaies of the Perſon,
on whom it is beſtowed, yet of ſome good quality
in him or in ſome of his, ſerving for publique uſe
or private imitation;) and is alwayes (in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at leaſt) an effect of Gods antecedent will.
Calamitie we take alwayes for a token of Gods
diſlike, though not alwaies of the perſon afflicted,
yet either of ſomewhat in him to bee amended, or
of ſomewhat formerly done by him, to bee by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
avoided; and is an effect of Gods conſequent
will. For hee wils <hi>no evill</hi> at all, not <hi>malum poenae,</hi>
but as it is either a puniſhment or correction for
evill done, or good neglected, or as it is a mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
to prevent the doing of evill, or neglect of
goodneſſe.</p>
                     <p>3 From the infinite varietie of <hi>poſsibilities</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by the aeternall decree, and their corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
conſequences, which one time or other
actually follow upon their <hi>reductions</hi> into Act, by
the irreſiſtible award of the ſame decree; wee may
reſolve many difficulties, and abandon ſundry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
wherewith the Heathen in their
vaine ſpeculations, and many Chriſtians in more
grievous temptations, <hi>charge,</hi> either the truth or
goodneſſe of Gods <hi>Providence.</hi> The varietie of
ſuch poſſibilities, amounts, partly from the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7905:204"/>
nature of the objects, made poſſible by the
divine decree: partly from the ſeverall degrees
of <hi>good</hi> or evill contained in ſuch objects, or in
mens actions concerning them. The whole lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
(if I may ſo ſpeake) of Gods providence, as
it concernes kingdomes, ſtates or <hi>perſons,</hi> conſiſts
in moderating and ordering the poſſible devoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or alternations of the <hi>reſonable creature</hi> from
his <hi>antecedent</hi> will to his <hi>conſequent.</hi> The alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or devolutions themſelves, may be number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,

opinions of the <hi>Caldean</hi> and <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
concerning the power or efficacie of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
over ſublunary bodies. The<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantium.</note> Caldeans were
impious not in practiſe only but in opinion, in that
they held the operation of the heavens to be unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
and unpreventable by the wit, induſtry or
skill of man: all which ſuch as follow <hi>Ptolomie</hi> the
Aegyptian, expreſſely deny, &amp; bring good reaſons
for their deniall. If their practiſes to foretell things
to come, bee no worſe than their opinions
concerning the <hi>manner</hi> how they come to paſſe;
it would bee no great ſinne to be their Schollers.</p>
                     <p>4 There is no Chriſtian but will grant his God
to be greater then Heatheniſh <hi>Fate,</hi> and his Law
to be above all controll of any other Law or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
whatſoever. And yet by the doctrine of many
Divines, the Almighty Lawgiver is made aeternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubject to his owne decrees. Their meaning is
taken by many to be in effect this: <hi>That albeit God
be Omnipotent,</hi> yet it is true of him,</p>
                     <q>Poſt ſemel emiſſum volat irrevocabile verbum.</q>
                     <p>That he had paſt his <hi>Omnipotent</hi> word, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ordering and managing of all things to
come, before it could be taken or accepted by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
creature: and that by his word thus paſt
once for all for ever, ſuch irrevocable doome had
<hi>paſſed</hi> upon ſome of his beſt creatures before their
nonage, (in their non exiſtence;) as they would not
have accepted life or being it ſelfe, when they firſt
<hi>entred vpon</hi> poſſeſſion of it, if they had knowne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7905:208"/>
what hard conditions it had beene tendred. Or,
were it yet left free for them to diſclaime thoſe
covenants or conditions of life and beeing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they never gave their conſent; The greateſt
part of divine <hi>goodneſſe</hi> which they could hope to
be partakers of, were to be releaſed from the <hi>right</hi>
of creatures, and to returne againe to nothing.
Briefly, by making God ſupreame Lord of ſuch
hard <hi>weirds</hi> or ſiniſter <hi>Fates,</hi> as are by theſe men
inevitably awarded to abſolute <hi>reprobates;</hi> they
doe not adde ſo much unto his greatneſſe, as they
derogate from his goodneſſe, in reſpect of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
gods. For, unto ſuch of the heathens, as gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Fates a negative voice in ſome caſes againſt the
good purpoſes of their gods; it was ſome comfort
to thinke, that their gods wiſhed them well, and
did entreate them, as great perſonages or cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
gentlemen do their ſutors, whom for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
they cannot pleaſure, as being overborn by the
oppoſite faction. But alas, what can it boot poor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
man, to beleeve his Maker was not from ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie
ſubject to Fates, or any other law; if by his
owne Lawes, or decrees, he hath bound them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world had beginning, (without all hope or
poſſibility of releaſe) to harder conditions of Life,
then the heathens imagined could bee injoyned by

The Platonicks, which derive moſt humane events
or ſucceſſe from the order or diſpoſition of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall
cauſes, call this diſpoſition, <hi>Fate;</hi> when it is
ſo ſtrong, that no endeavours or skill of man can
prevaile againſt it: but when the ſtrength of it is of
ſuch a middle ſize, as may prevaile againſt ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and careleſſe men, but may bee vanquiſhed by
the vigilant and induſtrious, they call the ſame
diſpoſition <hi>Fortune.</hi> In both caſes they admit a
Divine Providence, which worketh to ends

<hi>Fates,</hi> were commonly remarkable <hi>checks</hi>
given, they know not by whom, to humane poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

or cunning contrivances. They were, as the

is like a game wonne by a <hi>bungler,</hi> againſt a skilfull

This kinde of <hi>Fate</hi> or ſtrange <hi>Fortune,</hi> of which
moſt of the Heathen knew not well what to make,
wee may define, <hi>To be the incomprehenſible diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,

conſpiring for the infallible execution of Gods will,</hi>
maugre all plots or conſpiracies of men to defeate
the events, which hee had purpoſed. Siniſter or
diſaſterous <hi>Fates</hi> were the infallible execution of
his conſequent will. Good fates or fortune, were
the infallible effects of his antecedent will; both
were ſometimes ſtrangely &amp; remarkeably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
againſt cunning and potent oppoſitions,
not ſo much for the parties ſakes whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell,
as for others. Many diſaſters have befallen
ſome men, though deſervedly for their owne ſins,
yet withall for the admoniſhing of others, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

equitie, whoſe juſtice is ſtill allayed with mercy.</p>

The reclaiming of men from this one Errour is
my preſent and ſcope.</p>
                     <p>2 For the better effecting whereof, we will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
at length unto their general Maxime, <hi>[That
all things are neceſſary in reſpect of Gods decree,]</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition they wil not extend it beyond its <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi>
and proper <hi>ſubject,</hi> or not take <hi>decree</hi> in the
<hi>Stoicall,</hi> but in a <hi>civill</hi> ſenſe. Now hee that ſaith
[All things are neceſſary in reſpect of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,]
cannot in <hi>civill</hi> conſtruction bee conceived
to meane any more then thus; <hi>All</hi> things which
God hath decreed are neceſſary. The queſtion
then is, whether every thing that is, may truly bee
ſaid to be the <hi>object,</hi> or part of the object of Gods
decree. To which queſtion our anſwer muſt be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.
For thoſe things onely are properly ſaid
to be decreed, which are enacted and appointed
for better ordering and moderating ſuch things as
either by <hi>nature, cuſtome,</hi> or ill example, are apt to
grow worſe, or may be amended by good educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wholeſome advice or diſcipline. Every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7905:221"/>
of man ſuppoſeth the ſubject or party whom
it immediately concernes, to be capable of <hi>perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
to <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evill,</hi> to be alterable in his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
through feare of puniſhment, or hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
Magiſtrates or <hi>Corporations</hi> take order that
mad men or dogs ſhould doe no harme; yet are
not theſe creatures the proper ſubject of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
or ſanctions. They do not tie <hi>Maſtives</hi> by
penall laws not to bite, they do not bind <hi>mad men</hi>
to good behaviour: but they i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>joyn men of reaſon
and underſtanding to muzzle M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſtives leſt they
bite; to keepe <hi>mad men</hi> or franticks, cloſe, leſt they
ſhould doe miſchiefe by going abroad. Now the
Divine decree concerning the ordering of man, is
the rule or patterne of all humane decrees, and
therefore ſuppoſeth ſomewhat in man, which
makes him more capable of the divine <hi>ſanction,</hi>
than <hi>reaſonleſſe</hi> or <hi>inanimate</hi> creatures are. This
capacity of the reaſonable creature or man, conſiſts
in freedome of choiſe or contingency, in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or reſolutions. The donation of this freedome
upon man, is an act of Gods <hi>free bounty,</hi> and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed
as the proper ſubject to the <hi>divine decree,</hi>
or to all acts or awards of divine juſtice or mercy.
The proper and <hi>formall</hi> object of the ſame decree,
is, the moderation of this <hi>contingency</hi> or freedome
of man, by awarding the iſſues or conſequences,
in <hi>mercy,</hi> juſtice, or bounty, exactly proportioned
to the nature and manner of his choiſe and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For illuſtrating the truth of our intended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
let us take the Epigrammatiſts<note n="*" place="margin">See Cha. 20.</note> relation,
or that idaea of <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>Fortune,</hi> which hee hath
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7905:222"/>
pictured, for a true ſtory. It was not neceſſary in
reſpect of the divine decree, that the one ſhould be
ſo extreame <hi>poore,</hi> or the other ſo miſerably <hi>rich,</hi>
as to come within the compaſſe of that <hi>ſnare,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the latter was taken. The meanes by which the
one came to that depth of poverty or melancholly
paſſions, wherewith hee had almoſt beene ſtifled,
and the other to that height of covetouſneſſe, from
which he fell headlong into deſpaire, were contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
Neither were driven into ſuch exceſſe of
paſſion or diſtemper by irreſiſtible neceſſity. But
taking them as now they have made themſelves;
that the one ſhould be led <hi>unto</hi> temptation, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>into</hi> it; fell not out by chance, but by the eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
diſpoſition of the Divine providence. The
great <hi>Tempter</hi> intended miſchiefe to the one, but
failed, God having yet a bleſſing in ſtore for him.
To the other, perhaps he intended not this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
harme, untill opportunity did offer it. So
that the inriching of the one by a chance rare and
unuſuall, in reſpect of man, was neceſſary in reſpect
of Gods decree of mercy and fatherly providence;
the delivering of the other unto Sathan, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<hi>neceſſary,</hi> in reſpect of Gods juſtice.</p>
                     <p>3 Now if ſuch events, as to the apprehenſion of
meere naturall men <hi>come by chance,</hi> be neceſſary in
reſpect of the divine decree: diſaſters by common
conſent reputed fatall, muſt by efficacy of the ſame
decree be divorced from contingency, with which
formerly they had connexion. For though <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>
as well as <hi>Fate,</hi> be a branch or particle of the
proper object of the divine decree; yet as they have
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7905:222"/>
reference to man, this difference may in the laſt
place be obſerved betwixt then: Thoſe things fall
out by meere <hi>chance</hi> or fortune, whoſe procurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or prevention hath not beene thought of at all
by man, or but ſleightly, before they happen:
Thoſe by <hi>fate,</hi> which have beene often and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
thought of, but either farre exceed all expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or fruſtrate ſollicitous care or forecaſt. Oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the unexpected accompliſhment of one
mans expectation defeates the induſtrious hopes or
anxious contrivance of another, and ſuch events
are in a twofold ſenſe termed fatall.</p>

by his decree:</hi> I ſhould have Infidels only for mine

for effecting ſome things, is more ſtrict and

ſuppoſed his covenant for day and night to

all at <hi>Ioſuahs</hi> ſuit, and may againe be diſpenſed with

Such was the wiſedome of the Lawes given unto

The point is this; maine events which at this

prevented by diverſity of practices, not onely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
but acceptable by the divine appointment,
may in ſucceſſion or revolution of time, become

all eternities, nothing can truly be reputed, beſides
the Deity, and the internall operations of the ever

(their contraries or incompatible oppoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by the continued ſiniſter ſway of mans thoughts
and practices, beene drawne from meere poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

of neceſſity: yet at the firſt not abſolutely or
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7905:224"/>
irreſiſtibly neceſſary. Some meanes there may be,
though but a few left of many, and thoſe not eaſie
to be put in practice, for preventing them. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
of greater conſequences which ſtood thus,
were with the Heathens accounted <hi>Fata minora:</hi>
For Fates (as we ſaid before) admit the ſelfe ſame
diviſion or degrees that <hi>neceſsity</hi> doth. The ſame
events by omiſſion of practices appointed by the
divine decree for their prevention, become altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
irreſiſtible and abſolutely neceſſary in reſpect
of any meanes poſſible for averting them: yet not
abſolutely neceſſary from eternitie, but abſolutely
neceſſary only from that point of time, wherein
the eternall decree or providence did cut off all
contrary poſſibilities, which before were concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
with the poſſibility of their being. And events
thus utterly beſtript of all contingency, or al poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of being recalled or avoyded, were by the
Heathens aſcribed [Fato majori] <hi>to greater Fates.</hi>
The <hi>ſymptomes</hi> or <hi>characters</hi> of events becomming
thus irreſiſtibly &amp; abſolutely <hi>neceſſary,</hi> come<note n="*" place="margin">In the Treatiſe of Prodigies &amp; of their uſefull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</note> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
(by Gods aſſiſtance) to be deciphered. Here
it ſufficeth to advertiſe the Reader, that as divers
things beſides, ſo neceſſitie may be enſtyled <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi>
many waies, but two eſpecially. Some things
are ſaid to be abſolutely neceſſarie, that is, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inevitable, albeit this neceſſitie or inevitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
did accrue from ſome occaſions or ſet points
of time lately paſt. As many diſeaſes, in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
curable, and eaſie to have beene cured by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
medicines (if they had beene adminiſtred in
time,) do, by ſome few daies ill diet, by careleſſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7905:224"/>
attendance, or caſuall relapſe, become altogether
incurable, by any after-care or helpe of phyſick.
Other events there be, which were abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
in reſpect of all times: their exhibition or
production could not by any policie of man have
beene prevented. So our Saviours death was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary from the beginning of the World,
but whether abſolutely neceſſary from eternity, or
abſolutely neceſſary, without ſuppoſall of <hi>Adams</hi>
fall (which was not neceſſary) ſhall not here be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed.
Certaine it is, that nothing decreed by
God, can be ſo abſolutely neceſſary as the Divine
Nature, or bleſſed Trinity is. Many errors have
found opportunity to mingle themſelves with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
truth for want of a commodious diſtinction
or explication of this indiſtinct and confuſed terme
<hi>Abſolute:</hi> the anatomy of it were worth the paines
of the Learned. Evident it is, that ſome things
which are not to day, may to morrow be, in their
kind, <hi>abſolute.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3 We truly ſay, that the ſumme of mony wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
one man ſtands bound unto another, is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
due from the time of the forfaiture, or non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the condition: that is, there is no plea
left in Law, no courſe or meanes of Iuſtice to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd
the payment of it. Yet was not the ſame ſum
abſolutely due from the firſt date of the bond; the
performance of the Condition in due time had
prevented the loſſe, which negligence or breach of
promiſe hath now made <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>irrecoverable.</hi>
Moneys lent upon no other conſideration, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
meere good will, to be repayd whenſoever the

party lending ſhall demand them; are <hi>abſolutely</hi>

that which is abſolutely due, there is a neceſſitie
of payment or ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>4. Some <hi>diſaſterous</hi> events become, by divine

be actually accompliſhed, or inflicted: ſuch was

grievous ſinne then committed, or for ſome remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable

though neither bee abſolutely and determinately

Suppoſe a Iudge ſhould be tied by oath to execute
juſtice upon a malefactor within eight dayes; there
is no neceſſity that he ſhould performe his vow the
firſt, ſecond, third or fourth day. The execution
or not execution of Iuſtice, is during the firſt ſeven
daies, free and contingent, without any breach or
violation of oath: but omitting the opportunities,
which the firſt ſeven dayes have offered, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Iuſtice upon the eighth day, is as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
as his <hi>honeſty</hi> or <hi>fidelity;</hi> as neceſſary, as if hee
had beene tied by oath to execute it upon that day
alone. The parts of indefinite time, or of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
promiſed or threatned by man, may be farre
more than this inſtance implies. So that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of thoſe duties or promiſes, which for a
long time was free and arbitrarie, and might have
beene performed in different meaſure, becomes at
length abſolutely neceſſary, and neceſſary to ſuch a

there was no neceſſity queſtionleſſe, that

but after he, by his actuall tranſgreſſion, had utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

as <hi>neceſſary</hi> in reſpect of Gods mercy and

have forfeited their reall poſſibilities, or ordinary

when God firſt made his promiſe to the Woman
and her ſeed, the birth of <hi>Abraham</hi> was not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

birth was. It was poſſible to have written <hi>Terah</hi> as

that <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhould have a ſonne called <hi>Ieſſe,</hi> or that
<hi>Ieſſe</hi> ſhould have a ſon called <hi>David,</hi> a man after
Gods owne heart. That glory, which long after
Gods oath to <hi>Abraham,</hi> befell the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
was (for ought we know or can object unto the
contrary) a part of that dignity; whoſe poſſibility
was once really poſſeſſed by <hi>Reuben,</hi> though utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forfeited by his miſdemeanour. But after <hi>Iacob</hi>
had propheſied, that the Scepter ſhould <hi>not depart
from Iudah,</hi> till <hi>Shilo</hi> come, or rather after the Lord
had <hi>ſworne</hi> not to <hi>faile David</hi> in beſtowing the
prerogative promiſed to <hi>Iudah</hi> upon his ſeed, the
neceſſity becomes as great, that our High Prieſt,
after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> ſhould bee the

ſonne of <hi>David</hi> as the ſon of Man, or ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
Now if we can perſwade our ſelves, that

error, which holds all events to be <hi>fatall;</hi> albeit of
ſuch twofolded fates or ſucceſſe, the one part or
the other muſt by abſolute neceſſity be fulfilled, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

in <hi>Achilles,</hi> is evidently contained in Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
covenant with Iſraell, and ſealed unto
us by manifeſt experience in <hi>Davids</hi> line. For of
Gods ſpeciall providence over the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
or the Iewiſh nation in generall, we have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at large in the firſt Booke of the Comments
upon the Apoſtles Creed. The contrary <hi>Fates</hi> of
<hi>Davids</hi> kingdome in ſucceeding ages, ſeeme to
wraſtle &amp; ſtrive, as <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> did in the womb,
or to counterſway each other, like two oppoſite
<hi>ſcales</hi> unequally ballanced, by turnes. That thus it
<hi>fared</hi> with <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdome, doth not argue
Gods decree concerning it to have beene mutable,
but rather immutably to have <hi>elevated</hi> &amp; <hi>depreſſed</hi>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:7905:231"/>
both Prince and People, according to the degrees
of their mutability in turning to him or from him.</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Salomon</hi> had the largeſt talent of wealth, and
the greateſt meaſure of wit to uſe it, that any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
King either before or after him had. His poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
to increaſe his kingdome, and propagate
greatneſſe to his poſterity, were much greater than
any earthly Monarch ſince him might expect. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts of Gods glorious promiſes made to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
were literally meant of him, which were never
literally fulfilled in him, or in his naturall linage;
becauſe they did not performe the conditions,
which God required, that they might bee more
capable of his extraordinary undeſerved favours.
The Covenant with <hi>David</hi> is expreſſed <hi>Pſal. 89.
I have found David my ſervant: with my holy oyle
have I anointed him. With whom my hand ſhall bee
eſtabliſhed: mine arme alſo ſhall ſtrengthen him. The
enemy alſo ſhall not exact upon him: nor the ſonne of
wickedneſſe afflict him. And I will beat downe his
foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.</hi>
This promiſe pertaines to <hi>David</hi> and to his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors:
but however the promiſe was on Gods
part unalterable, yet the prerogative promiſed was
ſubject unto change on contingency. For ſo a little
after the Pſalmiſt diſtinguiſheth betwixt <hi>Davids</hi>
ſeed and <hi>Davids</hi> ſonnes. <hi>His ſeed will I make to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
for ever, and his throne as the dayes of Heaven.</hi>
This he ſpeakes not of many, but of one, to wit, of
Chriſt, to whom onely the Kingdome of <hi>David</hi>
was predeſtinated. Of ſuch as were ordained to
this Kingdome, he ſpeakes in the plurall, not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7905:231"/>
but conditionally: <hi>If his children forſake my
Law, and walke not in my judgements; if they breake
my Statutes, and keepe not my Commandements:
Then will I viſit their tranſgreſsion with the rod, and
their iniquity with ſtripes.</hi> The tenour then of Gods
Covenant with <hi>David</hi> as it concerned Chriſt was
abſolute, but as it concernes <hi>Davids</hi> other ſonnes,
it was disjunctive, or conditionall. If any ſhall
queſtion why God for many generations did deale
no better with <hi>Davids</hi> ſucceſſors, than with the
ſucceſſors of other Kings, the anſwer from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Covenant is plaine, <hi>They forſooke his
Lawes, and would not walke in his Iudgements.</hi> Pſal.
89. verſ. 32. <hi>and thus breaking his Statutes, their
viſitation was altogether unevitable,</hi> not on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
but by degrees. The Lords arme even in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi>
time was ſtretched out, ready to <hi>fetch</hi> the
blow, which after his death fell upon his ſon <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi>
as heire to his <hi>chaſtiſements.</hi> The blow was
ſudden and ſmart; for of twelve Tribes, ten were
rent from his Kingdome by <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> The wounds
Inflicted by the Egyptian upon <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi>
and upon <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> her ſelfe, were grievous,
though as yet not uncurable. So grievous as might
give that people plainly to underſtand, that the
proſperity of <hi>Davids</hi> earthly Kingdome was not
like the dayes of heaven, nor the glory of <hi>Salomons</hi>
throne like <hi>the Sunne</hi> in the Firmament, altogether
priviledged from change, or mutability. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the motion of the <hi>creature,</hi> appointed to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Gods wrath, were ſudden, yet the waight of
Ieruſalems burthen was not permanent, becauſe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7905:232"/>
ſhee was not as yet frozen in ſinne.</p>
                     <p>3 Of <hi>Rehoboams</hi> ſucceſſors ſome were good,
and theſe by their penitency and heroicall <hi>reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
ſet <hi>back</hi> the Diall of ſuch diſmall <hi>Fates,</hi> as ſtill
did threaten them: many were bad, and did draw
Gods plagues upon themſelves and their people.
And whileſt the <hi>blow</hi> of Gods ſtretched out arme,
is diverted and borne off by the fervent prayers
of godly <hi>Princes;</hi> the waight of the whole Nations
burthen, is much increaſed by the iniquity of the
people. Either the number of the ſupplicants was
not equall to the number of the delinquents; or
the fervency of their prayer and repentance, not ſo
conſtant, as the others delight in ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
The waight of their <hi>ſiniſter Fates,</hi> by this
meanes ſecretly and inſenſibly increaſing (even

the ſwiftneſſe or violence of the motion,
when by permiſſion of the Divine Decree, they
had liberty to take their wonted courſe. <hi>Ioas</hi> and

judgement, not againſt the King and Nobles
onely, but againſt City and Temple, in ſuch a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
voice, as if deſolation had even then beſieged
the City round about, and utter deſtruction was
ready to enter in at the breach: <hi>Therefore ſhall Sion
for your ſake be plowed as a Field, and Ieruſalem ſhall
become heapes, and the mountaine of the houſe, as the
high places of the Foreſt. Micha 3. ver. 12.</hi> Spake he

of their Magiſtrates and Politicians, moſt of their
Prieſts and Prophets, untill this very inſtant had
ſaid to the like purpoſe: <hi>Is not the Lord among us,
none evill can come upon us. verſ. 11.</hi> This vaine
confidence preſumptuouſly and falſly grounded
upon the immutability of Gods promiſes, made the
doome menaced by <hi>Micha</hi> more neceſſary and
<hi>fatall</hi> at this time, than otherwiſe it would have
beene; though to ſuch as underſtood the tenour
of Gods Covenant with his people, neither at
this time nor many yeares after, altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable.</p>
                     <p>4 The good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> knew the Lord did
not threaten in jeſt, and for this reaſon his feare was
hearty, and his prayers earneſt: <hi>Did he not feare
the Lord, and beſought the face of the Lord? Ier. 26.
ver. 19.</hi> But did this his feare or hearty prayes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
the preſent poſſibility or neceſſity of the
plagues threatned? Yes, <hi>The Lord repented him.</hi> Of
what? that he had denounced all this evill againſt
Ieruſalem, or intreated <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſo roughly by his
Prophet <hi>Micha?</hi> no: <hi>But the Lord repented him
of the evill which he had denounced againſt him and
meant to execute.</hi> For who <hi>repents</hi> himſelfe of that
which he did not ſo much as truly intend? Is God
then as man that he ſhould repent? It is impoſſible
that there ſhould be any <hi>change</hi> of purpoſe in God,
&amp; herein he is moſt unlike to man, or the ſon of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
whoſe repentance alwayes includes ſome internall
alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>wil</hi> or <hi>purpoſe,</hi> not of the matter purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
only. Our beſt intentions of <hi>good</hi> to others, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7905:233"/>
expire upon particular reſpects, and cannot be
revived againe, albeit we neither had juſt occaſion
to take diſlike, nor the ſame reaſons to continue it,
which we had to take it. Through the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of our nature we loath to morrow what we like
to day: our affections alter without any change in
the matter affected by us. Far otherwiſe it is with
God, whoſe will or purpoſe is ſtill <hi>immutable;</hi> and
yet exactly fitteth every <hi>change</hi> or <hi>mutation</hi> in the
<hi>creature.</hi> To have puniſhed Ieruſalem continuing
her wonted courſe (but ſixe moneths longer after
the Prophet had thus warned her) with ſuch miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
as <hi>Senacherib</hi> had menaced, was one part of
the eternall and unchangeable decree: another
part of the ſame decree (no leſſe immutable) was
to avert theſe plagues from Ieruſalem truly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon their denunciation. No former wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
could alienate his love from her, or make him
recall the bleſſings promiſed to <hi>David,</hi> ſo long as
this people was ſo affected, as in that covenant was
required.</p>
                     <p>5 The <hi>poſsibility</hi> of the deſolation menaced by
<hi>Micha,</hi> was, for the preſent, as great, as the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian
was potent. It might truly have beene ſaid
of this City, in reſpect of his army, what one ſaith
of Navigators:</p>
                     <q>Eſt tua tam prope mors, quàm prope cernis aquam.</q>
                     <p>That extraordinary power wherewith the Lord
had armed this Tyrant to take vengeance upon his
neighbour nations, might well make the preſent
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7905:233"/>
avoydance of the plagues menaced by <hi>Micha,</hi>
ſeeme almoſt <hi>impoſsible.</hi> But good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> by
turning with all his heart, and all his ſoule unto the
Lord, unto whom all things are poſſible, did not
only remove deſtruction threatned from the City
and Temple, but cauſed it to turne upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer.
Ieruſalem and Iudah, by the unfained pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence
of <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> became the object of
Gods <hi>antecedent will,</hi> and fell under the former
part of Gods Covenant with <hi>David: The enemy
ſhall not exact upon him, nor the ſonne of wickedneſſe
afflict him. And I will beat downe his foes before his
face, and plague them that hate him. Pſal 89. verſ.
22, 23.</hi> The Aſſyrian by going beyond his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
in daring not <hi>Hezekiah</hi> only, but the Lord
of Hoſts, unto whoſe protection <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had
fled, becomes the object of Gods <hi>conſequent will,</hi>
which by divine appointment, he was at that time
to execute upon Ieruſalem; but upon Ieruſalem
fallen away by diſobedience, not upon Ieruſalem
returning in heart unto her God.</p>
                     <p>6 That this people might have ſome time of
breathing and reſpite to gather themſelves for the
better accompliſhing of ſo great a worke, as <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
had begun; the Lord in his wiſdome ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that <hi>Tirhakah King of Cuſh</hi> ſhould make for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to entertaine <hi>Senacherib</hi> with battaile at that
very inſtant, wherein he had purpoſed to give the
on ſet upon Ieruſalem. This unexpected removall
of preſent terror, was (no doubt) a ſure <hi>pledge</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the people for ſtrengthning their relyance on
Gods promiſe, for <hi>ſetling</hi> their hearts and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7905:234"/>
their conſtancy in fervent prayers, during the
time of the enemies abſence. And ſeeing the force
of Egypt and Cuſh were not ſufficient to diſſipate
<hi>Senacheribs</hi> mighty army, perhaps not able to hold
him play any longer; the Lord ſends <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and
his people deliverance from heaven: <hi>Then the
Angell of the Lord went forth, and ſmote in the Camp
of the Aſſyrians, a hundreth foureſcore and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand:
and when they aroſe, early in the morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
they were all dead corpſes. Iſaiah, 37. verſ. 36.</hi>
The noiſe of this great overthrow was as the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſound of a Iubile unto Ieruſalem, and did por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
another more admirable and victorious Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile

witneſſe to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and the people, that rather
then one tittle of Gods Covenant with <hi>David</hi>
ſhould fal to the ground, the hoſt of heaven ſhould
leave their ſtation, and keepe garriſon on earth. A
little after this miraculous deliverance, the Sun is
compelled to goe fifteene degrees backwards, for
ſetting forward the courſe of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his life,
whom <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Fate</hi> had now, in the worlds
ſight, arreſted. God hereby teſtified unto Prince
and People, that if they would continue ſuch in
<hi>health,</hi> as they were in <hi>ſickneſſe,</hi> ſo well-minded in
peace and proſperity, as they had beene in ſtrait
ſiege, or other diſtreſſe of war: Ieruſalems good
dayes might become as certaine and conſtant, as
the dayes of heaven; ſeeing that great light, which
was appointed from the beginning to rule the day,
did now give place to <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> prayers. But moſt

of this people were moſt unlike their Prince, albeit
even he, after he had received thoſe two miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
pledges of Gods loue, <hi>did not render according
to the reward beſtowed upon him.</hi> 2 Chron. 32. v. 25.
<hi>For his heart was lifted up, therefore there was wrath
upon him, and upon Iudah and Ieruſalem. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
Hezekiah humbled himſelfe for the pride of
his heart (both he and the inhabitants of Ieruſalem:)
ſo that the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in
the dayes of Hezekiah.</hi>

curteſies ſutable to their congratulations, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the Lord had bleſſed him: willing (perhaps)
to give their maſter and the world to wit, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the former wars and exactions, hee
was no begger; but a fit confederate for neighbour
Princes, to <hi>curbe</hi> the inſolency of the Aſſyrian,
whoſe ſtrength though much abated by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
blow, which the Angell of the Lord had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Senacheribs</hi> hoſt, was not quite broken till ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7905:235"/>
thoſe implanted ſeeds of cruelty in him, which
when they came to be ripe, would be more noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to the Kings and Princes of Iudah, than his

Hezekiah, Heare the word of the Lord: Behold,
the dayes come, that all that is in thy houſe, and that
which thy fathers have laid up in ſtore unto this day,
ſhall be caried unto Babylon: nothing ſhall bee left,
ſaith the Lord. And of thy ſonnes that ſhall iſſue
from thee, which thou ſhalt beget, ſhall they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and they ſhall bee Eunuches in the palace of
the King of Babylon.</hi> 2 King. Chapter 20. verſ.
17, 18.</p>
                     <p>8 Any Heathen which had held <hi>Eſaias</hi> for an
undoubted <hi>Sooth-ſayer,</hi> would inſtantly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
hence, that the captivity of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
and all the miſeries which the Babylonian
afterwards brought upon Iudah and Ieruſalem,
were abſolutely <hi>fatall,</hi> altogether impoſſible to be
avoided. And many good Chriſtians (perhaps)
will queſtion, whether the plagues here threatned,
were not from this point of time, neceſſary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Divine Decree. To anſwer this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
by interrogation: Why ſhould not the ſpirit
of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> be as truly ſubject to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
propheticall rule, as <hi>Micahs</hi> was? Now God,
according to that rule, was ready to repent him of
all the evill, which he had threatned, whenſoever
the people ſhould repent them of whatſoever they
had done. The Lord had given <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and his
ſucceſſors a farre larger and longer time, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the evill which <hi>Eſay</hi> threatned, than they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7905:235"/>
had for avoiding the doome denounced by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah.</hi>
The very tenour of the denunciation made
by <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſhewes them a ready meanes for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the woe denounced; ſo they would have laid
it to their hearts, or followed the adviſe of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prophets. But <hi>mortality</hi> muſt needs be rife,
where variety of diſeaſes and multitudes of unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Empyricks do meer. The common tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the people, are the epidemicall diſeaſes of
States: and ſuch projects as Princes or Stateſmen,
without the preſcript of Gods Word, or ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
of his Providence, uſe for their recovery, are
like unſeaſonable miniſtration of <hi>Empyricall</hi> or <hi>old
wives medicines,</hi> to craſed bodies. They uſually
invite or entertaine the deſtruction or ruine of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
otherwiſe ready to depart. Not the beſt
amongſt the Kings of Iudah, but were ſmatterers
in empyricall or ſecular policy. Some were more,
ſome leſſe, all too much given to put confidence
in multitude of men and ſtore of treaſure. And for
increaſing this ſuppoſed <hi>ſinew</hi> of Warre and nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Peace, they uſed meanes, neither warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
by Gods written Law, nor by the rule of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
To prevent this miſchiefe which is the root
of all evill, what perſwaſion could be more fit or
pertinent, than this prediction of the Prophet:
<hi>That the wealth which Hezekiah and his fathers had
heaped together,</hi> which his ſucceſſors would be too
carefull to increaſe, would in ſucceeding ages ſteale
their children, for whom it was provided, from
them, and make them miſerable captives in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Land. To heape up riches we know not for
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7905:236"/>
whom, is a vanity; to heape them up with care and
toile to the deſtruction of our beſt private friends,
and advancement of the publike enemy, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of folly mixt with miſery. Had <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
his ſucceſſors beene as ready to aske counſell of
Gods Prophets as of Politicians; theſe could have
inſtructed them, that the miſeries foretold by <hi>Eſay,</hi>
were <hi>fatall</hi> unto covetouſneſſe and unconſcionable
care for poſterity; yet not ſimply <hi>neceſſary</hi> after co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe
was much increaſed in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.
For long after the going out of this decree,
whenſoever the Princes of Iudah repented for
their owne oppreſſion, and the oppreſſion of their
fathers, the Lord <hi>repented him of the plagues</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
and ſhewed himſelfe ready to remove
the oppreſſor from them. And though in peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in other ſinnes, did in part concur; yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in violence and oppreſſion, was the principall
ſtring and <hi>fatall</hi> cord, by which the Princes of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah
did draw <hi>captivity</hi> upon themſelves and their
children, and <hi>deſolation</hi> upon the City.</p>
                     <p>9 <hi>To paſſe over the various alternation of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dahs
and Ieruſalems different fates, in the dayes of</hi>
Manaſſes Ammon, <hi>and</hi> Ioſias, <hi>and come to</hi> Iehoikim,

then it was well with him? He judged the cauſe of the

                     <p>10 Too much skill in ſecular policy made them
put too great confidence in the ſtrength of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:
and this confidence in the helpe of man,
made them ſecure, whileſt they were conſcious of
breaking the Covenant which their Fathers had
made, and they lately renewed with their God.
The probabilities of the Aegyptians ſucceſs againſt
the Chaldean, were (in all politique eſteeme) very

and Iudahs earthly glory, there was no poſſibility
left, ſo long as they wreſtled with <hi>Fates,</hi> and made

Seeing all of them were made by his word, and are
continued by his meere will and pleaſure; ſooner

that are not theirs. They are terrible and dreadfull:
their judgement and their dignity ſhall proceed of

and their horſemen ſhall come from far, they ſhall flye
as the Eagle that haſteth to eate. They ſhall come all

as the Chaldeans ſudden greatneſſe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
in battaile, was the accompliſhment of Gods
conſequent will upon Iſrael and other neighbour
Countries, growne, by ſpeedy increaſe of their

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7905:246"/>
owne greater good; ſo they had gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
his goodnes in making them ſo great.
But when theſe <hi>Battaile-Axes</hi> began to lift up

with them; <hi>he</hi> abated their edge and ſoftned their
temper. Of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> whoſe exceſſive

                        <hi>Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of the laſt forecited prophecie, was literally fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in him, of whom it was meant; <hi>Then ſhall his
minde change, and he ſhall paſſe over, and offend, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
this his power unto his God.</hi> Habak. 1. v. 11.
And <hi>Balſhaſhar</hi> his ſonne not taking warning by
his humiliation, nor by the hand writing upon the
wall, was ſurprized with ſudden deſtruction, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſelfe ſame night wherein the hand was
ſeene writing, or (which is more probable) the
ſame night of ſome yeare following. He had filled

as the <hi>boules</hi> wherein he carouſed were with

                     </p>
                     <p>2 Now according to the Chaldeans growth in

which (perhaps) the Lord would not ſo highly
have advanced them, or uſed them as his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in this ſervice. But even theſe, and all other

were ready, when opportunity ſerved, to rob the

was through the midſt of it; and the ſtreame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

                        </gap>loodgate through which it paſſed. His ſtratagem
to make this entrance into the City now drowned
with wine, opens to us the literall meaning of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
aenigmaticall prophecies: <hi>A drought is upon
her waters, and they ſhall be dryed up: for it is the
Land of graven Images, and they are madde upon
their Idols. Ier. 50. v. 38.</hi> Whatſoever <hi>Cyrus</hi> might
intend, it was Ieruſalems and Syons curſe upon
Babylon, which gave ſucceſſe unto his ſtratagem.
<hi>The violence done to me, and to my fleſh, be upon Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
ſhall the inhabitants of Zion ſay; and my blood
upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, ſhall Ieruſalem ſay.
Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, Behold I will plead thy
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7905:252"/>
cauſe, and take vengeance for thee, and I will dry up
her ſea, and make her ſprings dry. Ier. 51. ver. 35, 36.</hi>
All theſe plagues here threatned, are exactly fitted
to the patternes of cruelty which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
had exhibited in the deſtruction of the holy City,
and the deriſion of her and other captivated Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Ieruſalem in the preſent ſenſe and freſh me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of her griefe had thus complained: <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
the King of Babylon hath devoured me,
he hath cruſhed me, he hath made mee an empty veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell:</hi>
(therefore muſt Babylon bee drawne dry of
water) <hi>he hath ſwallowed mee up like a Dragon; hee
hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath caſt me
cut.</hi> Ier. 51. verſ. 34. Therefore muſt <hi>Babylon
become as heapes, a dwelling place for Dragons, an
aſtoniſhment, and an hiſsing without an Inhabitant.</hi>
verſ. 37. It is ſignificantly foretold by <hi>Habakkuk</hi>
that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar had conſulted ſhame to his
houſe.</hi> Habak. 2. And it is the opinion of good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,
that the woe following ſhould be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatly
directed unto him and to his family: <hi>Woe
unto him that giveth his neighbour drinke; that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
thy bottle to him, and makeſt him drunke alſo;
that thou maiſt looke on their nakedneſſe. Thou art
filled with ſhame for glorie; drinke thou alſo, and let
thy foreskinne bee uncovered: the cup of the Lords
right hand ſhall be turned unto thee, and ſhamefull
ſpewing ſhall be on thy glorie.</hi> Habak. 2. verſ. 15, 16.

                        <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did uſe to make himſelfe ſport,
by making his captive Princes drunke. This and
the like inſolencies the Lord avengeth upon his
ſonne and people: <hi>In their heate I will make their
feaſts, and I will make them drunken, that they may
rejoyce, and ſleepe a perpetuall ſleepe, and not
awake, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Ier. 51. verſ. 39. and when
the time appointed was come (whether that were
the firſt or ſecond yeare after the hand writing
upon the wall) the Lord gave <hi>Cyrus</hi> notice of the
Babylonians intended aniverſary revellings, whom
hee had now more infatuated, then they at other

people, nations, and languages trembled and feared
before him: whom he would, he ſlew; and whom hee
would, he kept alive; and whom hee would, hee ſet up;
and whom hee would, hee put downe. But when his
heart was lifted, and his minde hardened in pride:
he was depoſed from his Kingly throne, and they took
his glorie from him. And hee was driven from the
ſonnes of men, and his heart was made like the Beaſts,
and his dwelling was with the wild Aſſes: they fed
him with graſſe like Oxen, and his body was wet with
the dew of heaven, till hee knew that the moſt high
God ruled in the kingdome of men, and that hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth
over it whomſoeuer he will. And thou his
ſonne O <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> haſt not humbled thine heart,

of ſilver, and gold, of braſſe, yron, wood and ſtone,
which ſee not, nor heare, nor know: and the GOD
in whoſe hand thy breath is, and whoſe are

9 Thus wold <hi>Daniel</hi> have cured Babel, but ſhe was
not cured by him; howbeit <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was more
kinde to <hi>Daniel</hi> then to himſelfe, then moſt great
Princes are to Gods beſt Prophets that reprove
them: <hi>For he commanded and they cloathed Daniel
with ſcarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, &amp;
made a proclamation concerning him, that he ſhould
be the third Ruler in the kingdome. In that night

Darius <hi>the Median tooke the kingdome being about
threeſcore and two yeere old.</hi> Dan. 5. verſ. 29, 30, 31.
For it is not the beſtowing of a Scarlet robe, of
Court holy water, or of reall honour in greateſt
meaſure upon Gods ſervants, that can couer a
ſcarlet ſinne in Princes. The ſtaine of blood can
never be waſhed off, nor the crie of the oppreſſed

<hi>Iſrael is a ſcattered ſheepe, the Lyons have driuen him

and laſt this</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>King of Babylon

of Babylon and his Land, as I have puniſhed the king
of Aſſyria. And I will bring Iſrael againe to his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.

                     <p>One materiall circumſtance there is in <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
which is not ſo much as intimated by <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon;</hi>
and it is this: Albeit the Babylonians could
neither have prevented <hi>Cyrus</hi> in diverting the
courſe of the River, nor withſtood his entrance by
its chanell; yet might they with eaſe have ſtopped
his paſſage along the chanell, or his entrance into
any ſtreet of the Citie, had they beene mindfull to
ſhut thoſe gates, which at the end of everie ſtreet
did open upon the river. But that night being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
to revelling, the paſſage by water from
one part of the City to another was freely permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
They had a ſolemne cuſtome of leaving thoſe
gates open that night, which on other nights were
to be ſhut. And by this meanes, deſtruction found
a more eaſie entrance into that great City.</p>

and whatſoever overſights the Politician can
diſcover in her (related by <hi>Xenophon</hi> or <hi>Herodotus)</hi>
was, that the fulfilling of <hi>Ieremies</hi> Propheſies a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt
her, might become more manifeſt to ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ages: <hi>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut
aſunder and broken? how is Babylon become a deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among the nations? I have layd a ſnare for thee,
and thou art alſo taken, O Babylon, and thou waſt not
aware: thou are founde and alſo caught, becauſe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7905:261"/>
thou haſt ſtriven againſt the Lord. The Lord hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
his armorie, &amp; hath brought forth the weapons
of his indignation; for this is the worke of the Lord
God of hoaſts, in the land of the Caldeans. Come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her from the utmoſt border, open her ſtorehou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
caſt her up as heapes, and deſtroy her utterly, let
nothing of her bee left.</hi> Ier. 50. verſ. 23, 24, 25, 26.
For ſhe had carried away all that was in <hi>Ezekias</hi>
houſe, all that his father had laid up in ſtore, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was left, as <hi>Eſaiah</hi> had foretold. c. 59. v. 36.
the exact fulfilling of whoſe Prophecie is regiſtred
by the ſacred Hiſtorian. 2 Chron. 6. verſe 18. The
ſudden ſurprizall of the Citie and Court of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
made the <hi>finding of the treaſure of Darkeneſſe
and the riches of ſecret places,</hi> which the Lord by
his Prophet had promiſed to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> more eaſie,
then if his entrance at that time had beene ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
or feared: for ſo the beſieged might have had
leiſure to have hid their treaſure where the enemy
ſhould hardly have found it.</p>
                     <p>16 But what ſpeciall comfort is this to Sion,
that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had done to Babylon, as Babylon had
done to her. This might ſatiate or ſomewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
the <hi>boyling heat</hi> of a revengefull minde. But
is the miſerie of an enemy of like uſe unto Gods
people, as was the Brazen ſerpent? Can the ſight
of it cure their griefe, or beget true happineſſe
in ſuch as looke on it? It is very probable that
Babylons ſpoiles did helpe to reedifie Ieruſalem.
And albeit, the God of <hi>Sion,</hi> had other meanes in
ſtore (more by many, then man can number or
conceive) for reducing his people into their owne
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7905:261"/>
Land; we may, notwithſtanding, without cenſure

<hi>Machiavel</hi> is of a contrary minde, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thereto, by ſuch a reaſon, as argues he had not
God or his providence in his thoughts; that his
thoughts were not his owne, when he conceived
it: ſo diſſonant it is to truth and his owne politick
principles. His words are theſe; <hi>If no other State
did ever compaſſe ſuch a mighty Empire as Rome did,
why ſhould this be attributed to Fortune, rather then
to good lawes and diſcipline?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 With <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Machiavel</hi> it fares juſt ſo
in this controverſie, as it uſually doth with other
controverſors; each of them hath the truth under
his levell, whiles he oppugnes the adverſe opinion;
both of them overſhoot it whilſt they deliver their
owne. <hi>Plutarch</hi> rightly denies the morall or civill
goodneſſe, whether of Romane lawes or lives, to
have brought forth their greatneſſe. Hee erreth
as much in adjudging all that to <hi>Roman fortune,</hi>
whereto <hi>Roman vertue</hi> had no juſt title. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
if by <hi>Fortune</hi> hee meant any certaine la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
cauſe more then humane, which did convay
ſucceſs to the <hi>current</hi> of Roman policies, by ſecret
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7905:263"/>
and hidden paſſages; his meaning is better then his
manner of expreſſing it. To thinke thus charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of this ingenuous Philoſopher, wee have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as knowing him to be a perfect enemy, aſwell
to Epicurean chance, as to Stoycall Fate: and
therefore no adverſary of Divine Providence. In
favour of <hi>Machiavels</hi> opinion, who deſerves no
favour himſelfe, thus much on the other ſide
might be ſaid; <hi>If the</hi> auncient Romans had beene
as vaine as the Graecians, as luxurious as the Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aticks,
as perfidious as the Carthagineans, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civill
and barbarours as many nations, which they
conquered: they ſhould not have beene ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
fortunate in their enterpriſes at home, and
abroad, as <hi>Livie</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> had obſerved them
to bee. That is, in our language, <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
would not have <hi>deſtined</hi> them unto that
greatneſſe, unto which at length they grew, if
they had beene alwayes, or for the moſt part, as
bad, as in the period of their proſperitie, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
For albeit God be debtor unto none; yet
the abandant riches of his bountie, will no ſuffer
him to leave morall vertues or conſtant execution
of Lawes <hi>comparativly</hi> good, vnrewarded with
bleſſings temporall. All this, notwithſtanding
will not inferre, what <hi>Machiavell</hi> undertooke to
prove that the Romans did raiſe themſelves, more
by vertue, then they were raiſed by Fortune; if wee
take Fortune (as in all probabilitie <hi>Plutarch</hi> did)
for an hidden fountaine, ſecretly feeding thoſe
courſes which the Romans tooke for their good,
with ſucceſſe and ſpeed farre above their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:7905:264"/>
Vnder this indefinite latitude of unknowne
cauſes, the Divine Providence or <hi>coeleſtic fortuna</hi>
(as the Pythagorians terme it) may bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and this divine providence or celeſtiall
<hi>Fortune</hi> it was, which raiſed the Romans: they
did not raiſe themſelves by their vertues. For wee
do not uſe to ſay that Princes favorites do advance
themſelves, albeit Princes would not adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce them
to ſuch great dignities as they enjoy, unleſs they
were in ſome meaſure qualified unto their liking.</p>
                     <p>3 Some nations have beene, others might have
beene more obſervant of better Lawes then the
Romans knew, and have uſed the ſame diſcipline
of peace and warre, even all their policies, with
greater ſinceritie of good intentions then they
did; &amp; yet not have propagated their ſoveraignty
ouer others, halfe ſo farre, as the Romane Empire
was (by Gods ſpeciall Providence) propagated.
For vertues morall, and ciuill diſcipline, or refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of miſdemeanors, (though all more exact,
then the practiſe of any nation could hitherto <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternize)</hi>
are no ſuch meritorious cauſes of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
proſperitie or Dominion, as may binde God
in juſtice, to diſpenſe the one in greateſt plentie,
where the other moſt aboundeth. Without theſe
qualifications the Romans had not beene capable
of ſuch proſperitie, as God in bountie beſtowed
upon them; but the true poſitive cauſe of their
extraordinary greatneſſe, was the ſpeciall ſervice,
whereto his wiſedome had appointed them. The
rule of his liberalitie in diſpoſing kingdomes, is
the correſpondency or proportion, which tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7905:264"/>
greatneſſe holds with the execution of his
will, whether for puniſhing thoſe which have
made up the meaſure of their Iniquitie, or for the
propagating or preſervation of his Church alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
planted, or for preparing or ploughing up the
hearts of <hi>wilde</hi> and unnurtured Nations, for better
receiving the ſeed of his Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>4 When the meaſure of that <hi>proſperitie,</hi> which
GOD for theſe and like purpoſes had allotted
Rome heathen, and her iniquitie became full; ſhee
and her Provinces became a ſwifter prey to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Nations, ſome ſcarce ſo much as heard
of before, then any neighbour countries had beene
to <hi>her.</hi> The incredible ſucceſſe of the Goaths
and Vandals, of the Franks and Almaines &amp;c, but
ſpecially of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> (whoſe furious progreſſe
was like to the Vultures flight, &amp; ſeem'd to preſage
the ſlaughter which they made) will juſtifie the
probability either of <hi>Xenophons</hi> ſtories concerning
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> or of <hi>Curtius, Arianus,</hi> or other writers of
<hi>Alexanders</hi> conqueſts. Was it then naturall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
or skill in warre, which did ſeate all, or moſt of
theſe barbarous Nations in theſe weſterne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries?
Vertues they had not many amongſt them,

Romane Empire was decreed by Fate; and with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to this end, as Rome could not in her growing
age be overthrowne, ſo it was expedient that ſhe ſhould
often be oppreſſed and afflicted, that her Stateſmen
might become more wary and wiſe, for procuring that
greatneſſe which Fates had decreed to accompliſh by
them. <hi>Wherefore, that all theſe might take place:</hi>
the Fates <hi>(which as he grants, uſe meanes conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for effecting their purpoſe)</hi> had put Camillus to
exile, not to death; ſuffered the City to bee taken by
the Gaules, but not the Capitoll: and that the Citie
might be taken with leſſe adoe, they had likewiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
that the greateſt part of the Romane army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcomfited by the Gaules, ſhould not retire to
Rome, but flye to Veios. To knit up all <hi>(as he ſpeakes)</hi>
                        <pb n="271" facs="tcp:7905:268"/>
in a bundell, it was the ordinance of Fates, that the
Romanes ſhould for this turne uſe neither their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
wit, nor diſcretion, for averting the evills which
befell them, and yet have all things made ready to
their hands, for defending the Capitoll and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the City. By the forecaſt of Fates, not of the
Romanes, it was, that exiled Camillus, who was no way
guilty of the wrongs which the Senate had done unto
the Gaules, no way obnoxious unto them, but free
from all obligements, ſhould bee at Ardea with one
army, and expected at Veios by another, that they
might with joynt forces aſſault the Gaules, when they

<hi>men cannot avoid the neceſsitie of fate, but rather fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
the events by it decreed: So vnable are they
to undoe the contrivances or contextures of deſtinie,
that by how much the more they ſtruggle with them,
they weave and knit them faſter.</hi> But ſhall ſtate-pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots

wayes of <hi>Fates</hi> to be ſo obſcure, that they cannot
be knowne, if neither <hi>knowne</hi> nor <hi>unknowne,</hi> they
can bee avoided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It would inſpire our indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
with greater alacrity, and our indeavours
would be <hi>bleſſed</hi> with better ſucceſſe, were wee
taught (as the truth is) that ſuch events as Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
terme <hi>fatall,</hi> are in their nature, alterable,
though not by us, or by any humane skill or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
yet by him whoſe almighty ayd, is alwayes
ready for us, ſo we ſeeke it with due humilitie. But
<hi>Machiavel</hi> (if I miſtake him not) was once of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that <hi>Fates</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> interpoſe their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
only in ſome more principall humane affaires;
he acknowledgeth no generall providence over
all. The generall Maxime whence hee falſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
his fruitleſſe inference, is, <hi>That Gods Decree</hi>
(whereof Fates good or bad, are neceſſary bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches)
<hi>is altogether immutable.</hi> The moſt neceſſary,
immediate, and moſt uſefull conſequent of which
<hi>truth,</hi> is this, As long as the parties againſt whom
he decrees evill, continue the ſame; the evill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
is as immutable as his decree, and men by
ſeeking to avoid it by their wit or ſtrength, doe
draw it more ſpeedily, or more heavily upon them.
For, it is impoſſible, that humane power ſhould
not bee foiled, whileſt it oppoſeth it ſelfe againſt
<hi>Omnipotency;</hi> or the devices of humane <hi>wiſedome</hi>
not be defeated, whileſt they counterplot <hi>Wiſdome
infinite.</hi> But though in the Almighty, or in his
decree, there be no ſhadow of change; yet as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
ſpeakes, <hi>he changeth times and ſeaſons;</hi> and in
that his <hi>mercy</hi> is <hi>immutable,</hi> he is alwayes ready to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7905:270"/>
repent him of the <hi>evills</hi> forethreatned, when men
repent them of the <hi>evill,</hi> for which hee threatneth
them. Or, in termes (perhaps) more proper, it is
one eſſentiall part of his immutable decree to alter
the events <hi>decreed,</hi> or <hi>foreſignified,</hi> (bee they good
or bad) according as men alter their mindes for
<hi>better</hi> or <hi>worſe.</hi> But how <hi>Fates</hi> are invited or may
be <hi>avoyded,</hi> wee are to ſpeake more particularly
hereafter.</p>
                     <p>10 The very inſtance whence <hi>Machiavel</hi> fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his forementioned Aphoriſme, will bee a fit
example for illuſtrating our preſent rule. The
Romanes (as he obſerves) were uſually moſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
obſervers of the Law of nations, and whileſt
they continued thus, Gods bleſſings did reſt upon
their policies: But at the time when the Gaules
inuaded Italy; the <hi>Fahii,</hi> being ſent Embaſſadours
in a Treaty of peace, unaduiſedly put on the girdle
of warre, and ſlew a ſtandard-bearer of the Gaules
in defence &amp; quarrell of the <hi>Cluſini,</hi> betwixt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they ſhould have been indiferent arbitrators. And
in ſtead of juſt puniſhment (which by the Law
of nations was, to have beene delivered up unto the
Enemies whom they had wronged,) the Romans
did grace them with the office of Tribunes, at
their returne, and appointed them chiefe managers
of that warre with the Gaules, which<note n="*" place="margin">Imprimis igitur ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benda ratio eſt earum rerum, quae fato ipſo, ſeu aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxu, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire viden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ut reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamus, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna non permittit.

Some times require quick diſpatch, others

ground: and ſo might he well have loſt his
late purchaſed fame, and Rome her prize; unleſſe
there had beene more skill uſed in playing the
game, than the ſuppoſed Roman Gameſters pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed.
As ſuppoſe <hi>Fabius</hi> had beene ſent to have
bid <hi>Hannibal</hi> play in Africk, and <hi>Scipio</hi> appointed
to keepe the goale in Italie: Rome and Carthage,
by the miſplacing of theſe two men, might have
changed <hi>Fates</hi> and <hi>Fortunes.</hi> Rome, in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
had beene taken, when <hi>Fabius</hi> ſaved it; and
Carthage inriched with Romane ſpoiles, at the

become <hi>ſtumbling-blocks,</hi> to cauſe her to fall. And,
although it had beene poſſible for the ſeverall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
of her ancient and choiſeſt Senators, to
have beene aſſembled together in counſell for her
good; yet what poſſibilitie was there left to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the <hi>combination</hi> of ſecond cauſes ſecretly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring</hi>
her deſtruction, when as the unavoidable
miſchances of Nations, which they knew not, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the diſaſters of her enemies became <hi>confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi>
with domeſtick miſcariages to worke her
miſchiefe. If we conſider onely the viſible cauſes,
or <hi>meanes</hi> obſervable, by which this mightie Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
came to miſerable ruine: not all the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights
committed by any one, though the very

ſow the ſeedes of ſo much evill and miſhap, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel
her from one example of ſeveritie, unſeaſonably
practiſed by the<note n="*" place="margin">Bonfin. lib. 2 dec. 1.</note> King of Goathes, upon a wicked
woman, that ſought to cover her adultery, by her
abuſed husbands <hi>blood.</hi> The fact indeed deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the <hi>height</hi> of Princely indignation, and more
then an ordinary death, but to pull her in peeces
with horſes (as <hi>Hermanarichus</hi> commanded) was
ſo indignely taken by her brethren, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
they killed this grave and auncient King;
by whoſe wiſedome and authoritie the Goathes
had beene able ſo well to have matched the Huns,
as the Romanes might have ſtood as arbitrators
to moderate the quarrell as they ſaw fit, or to have
devided the prey. But the Goathes, being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
deprived of their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Governour in the very

                        </hi> when the warre was begun, left their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Hunnes, and (upon proteſtations of
more then ordinary fidelitie and good ſervice) got
to be admitted as naturall ſubjects within the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
which by this meanes became expoſed to a
double miſchiefe. It hath the Hunnes as neare,
but more inſolent and noiſome neighbours, then
the Goathes had beene: and through the folly and
greedineſſe of the Imperiall <hi>officers,</hi> the Goath
in ſhort time of a former open enemy, became a
treacherous friend. The Romans <hi>nurſt</hi> this young
<hi>ſnake</hi> in their boſome, after ſuch an unpleaſant and
untowardly faſhion, as they might bee ſure, hee
would be ready to uſe his <hi>ſting,</hi> when God ſhould
ſend him one. And albeit the Goath and Hun, did
naturally worſe agree, then the Toade &amp; Spider:
yet in relation to the <hi>execution</hi> of Gods juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Roman Empire, they hold this exact ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,
that whereſoever the one had broken
<hi>skinne,</hi> the other was ready to infuſe his poyſon;
the one alwaies ready to inlarge the <hi>wounds,</hi> which
the other had made, before they cloſed. Howbeit,
when both theſe enemies had done the worſt to
Rome that they intended, (for both of them had
power in reſpect of any help that man could make,
to do her as much harm, as they liſted) yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſpeech concerning Iſrael, was remarkably
true of her, <hi>Perditio tua ex te O Roma,</hi> Romes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
was from her ſelfe. Her very enemies
would have healed her, but Babylon-like ſhee
would not be healed. <hi>Alaricus</hi> the Goath had
taken the Citie, but made conſcience of defacing
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7905:276"/>
it: he ſpared the ſuppliants for the Temples ſake.
<hi>Attilas</hi> was kindly intreated by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> not to
viſit it; the rather thereto perſwaded, becauſe
God had viſited <hi>Alaricus</hi> for polluting it. It was
the crie of the noble <hi>Aetius</hi> his blood treacherouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the reaſon is plaine: for <hi>Contingences</hi> are no

number in any other ſubject ſo incomprehenſible
to the wit of man. It is hard to uſe wit and valour
both at once; hard to ſpie an errour upon the firſt

commiſſion of it, harder to redeeme the time, or
regaine opportunities loſt. It is a groſſe errour
which hath inſinuated it ſelfe into ſome Politicians
thoughts, if wee may judge of their thoughts by
their writings; that the chances which may fall
out contrary to Warriours expectations, are not
ſo many but that they may be forecaſt or numbred.
It is the Politicians errour likewiſe, (though would
to God it were his alone) to think all occurrences
which are caſuall in reſpect of man, to be from the
firſt occaſions of warre begun, ſo determined by
him, which gives ſucceſſe in battaile, as that victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Theſe caſualties of War, or doubtfull inclinations

grounds for out of his owne Art, have ſeene, the
mighty preparation and couragious reſolution of

warres, nor better proofes of his juſt <hi>title</hi>
to be the Lord of Hoſts; than the contrivances of
ordinary cauſes and occurrences in martiall affaires
of moderne times, doth or might afford to all ſuch
as rightly ſurvey them. To make a mighty armie
fall by the free and unimpeached exerciſe of their
owne valour and ſtrength, can be no leſſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to unpartiall eyes, than to ſcatter them by fire
and lightning, than to beat them downe by mighty
haileſtones from heaven. To cauſe the ſtronger
and more skilfull in warre to faint, without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing

the Lords doing, than if their hearts had beene

foreſight of advantage, but in honour of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or of that Nation; which was perhaps an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight
in point of warre. However, this wing
was fiercely aſſaulted by the oppoſite wing of the
Germane Armie, which was a great deale the
ſtronger, eſpecially for horſemen. God by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevicii pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. in vita Iagell.</note>providence did ſo diſpoſe that this advantage
ſhould redound unto their greater overthrow. For
the Lituanians being the farre weaker part of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gello</hi>
his Army, both for want of skill and of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
after a furious encounter fled the faſter: and
the Germane wing, which had put them to flight,
not ſuſpecting but that their other wing had beene
as able to match the Polonian, as they had beene
to defeat the Lituanian; purſued the victorie ſo
long and ſo farre, that they were neither able ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſuccour the other wing being ſcattered and
broken by the Polonians, before their returne, nor
to flye from their enemies with that ſpeed they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired;
as being over wearied with the former
chaſe. Of the Germans, by this overſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
fiftie thouſand were ſlaine, and (as ſome
relate) almoſt as many taken priſoners. They had
put their confidence in the valour, skill and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7905:280"/>
of their Armie, which did conſiſt of an
hundred and fortie thouſand choice ſouldiers.
The good King <hi>Iagello</hi> his truſt was in his praiers
to God; and in the preſumption of his Enemy,
which had beene ſo triumphant before the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ſo certaine of victorie before the joyning of the
battaile; that they would not give <hi>Iagello</hi> leave to
ſay his prayers, or doe his wonted ſervice unto
God, but ſent him two ſwords in mockerie, one
for himſelfe, and another for his brother <hi>Vitou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
as if they had wanted weapons to defend
themſelves; profering him withall, that if the
place wherein hee then was, were too ſtrait for
ordering his men they would goe back, as in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and ſcorne they did, and make him roome.
This inſolent meſſage was by the religious King
embraced, as a welcome prognoſtique that they
ſhould give him place againſt their wils. And ſo
it fell out, that they were not able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
within their trenches; their Tents and cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
became a prey to Polonians, being ſo well
fraught with all manner of proviſion, not for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
onely, but for pleaſure, that <hi>Iagello</hi> cauſed

pieces, leſt his ſouldiers ſhould be overcome with
plenty of wine, after they had overcome their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
enemies, or at leſt be hindred from further
purſuite of victorie. There a man might have ſeen
a ſtrange ſpectacle, a flood or ſtream not of blood
or wine, but as if it had bin of gore by the mixture
of the wine and the blood alike violently ſhed in
the Germane Camp. The gaudineſſe of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7905:281"/>
would not ſuffer ſuch as eſcaped by flight,
toly hid in the fennes or reeds into which they
ranne. This was the iſſue of their unhallowed

This our Generall found true in himſelfe, being

God was apparent upon him, that hee ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,

armies did without a ful battel. The war was mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
as if it had bin a game at Cheſs, wherein divers

Charles</hi> the Emperour, did in the eſteeme of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
manage his buſineſſes more cautelouſly
than the Confederates did: and yet if wee ſhould
ſpeake in the ordinary Politician or Souldiers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
was more beholding to Fortune, than to
prudence or counſell of Warre. It was a great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight
to expoſe himſelfe unto ſuch imminent
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:7905:282"/>
danger, as he did at<note n="*" place="margin">Thuanus ibidem.</note> 
                        <hi>Genge,</hi> out of a deſire to view

if the confederate Princes had beene as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
to take advantage, as he was careleſſe to give
it; they might have put an end to this war, as ſoone
as it was begunne. It is noted likewiſe, as a great
overſight in them, that they did not aſſault him,
whileſt hee was encamped about Ingolſtade and

and the Low Countries: yet the loſſe of this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
they had eaſily redeemed not long after,
had not their project beene diſcloſed to <hi>Charles,</hi>
who removed his Camp before they had notice,
and, by favour of the great windes, which that
night hapned, ſurprized <hi>Donaverd,</hi> a place of good
importance for his preſent deſignes; That Count
<hi>Egmond</hi> with his Netherland forces, on whoſe
skill and valour <hi>Charles</hi> did moſt relye, ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape

For unleſſe his Souldiers had been perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the Landgrave was nearer to them over

to them, or ſooner upon them in the morning, than
they could have wiſhed. But this falſe Alarum, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by <hi>Magius,</hi> made them willing, though much
wearied, to march all night. Not long after their
ſafe conduct unto the maine Campe, the chiefe
Counſellors of warre were inſtant with <hi>Charles</hi> to
diſſolve his Army for that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Spring. That his reſolution to the contrary, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſo ſucceſſefull, was more than in humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
could be forecaſt; ſo long as the ſucceſſe of
<hi>Maurice</hi> Duke of Saxony, and the Bohemians
which had invaded the Territories of <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke
of Saxonie, was uncertaine. But the prevailing
power of this unexpected enemie, being a known
Profeſſor of that Religion for whoſe maintenance
his noble Vncle and Father in Law had taken arms,
enforced the Confederates to divide their Army,
which could not but give advantage to <hi>Charles.</hi>
But that <hi>Henry</hi> the eight of England, and <hi>Francis</hi>
the firſt of France, (neither of them likely to have
ſtood as by-ſtanders in this great buſineſſe, if they
had lived) ſhould both dye in this <hi>interim,</hi> this
was the Lords doing, not <hi>Fortunes. Charles</hi> could
not ground any reſolution upon the hope of it, nor
could the confederate Princes foreſee the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
which from their death did redound unto
them. Yet after all theſe prejudices on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
Princes behalfe, <hi>Charles</hi> his expedition
into Saxony againſt <hi>Iohn</hi> Prince Elector, who had
retired thither with part of the Army, to prevent
<hi>Maurice</hi> his further proceedings; was very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and full of danger: and yet was <hi>Charles</hi> (who
before had ſhewed himſelfe to bee more timorous
and backward) more reſolute and forward, in this
expedition, than any of his Captaines or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders.</p>

or Counſell of Warre ſhould boaſt, as if their own
right hands, their policy and ſtrength had gotten

the victory; the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> the Lord mighty in
Battaile, did ſo diſpoſe that the Emperour one
while ſhould feare, where no feare was, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while be couragiouſly wilfull or reſolute, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his grave Counſell of Warre, and againſt all
probabilitie of hopefull ſucceſſe. At Nordling,
when his Army was full, and his Souldiers freſh,
when the Spaniards (after ſome difficult paſſages
had beene conquered by their undaunted Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,)
were perſwaded that victorie was hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them; <hi>Charles</hi> would not give them leave to
overtake it, or (as if it had beene ſnatched out of
their jawes) they did gnaſh with their teeth for
very indignation; nor was this hope of victory in
the Spaniards conceived from intemperate heate
of warre, or longing deſire to fight without good
grounds of reaſon. For <hi>Maximilian Egmond,</hi> a
wiſe and well experienced Commander, was ſo
taken with the ſame perſwaſion, that when the
Emperour called him back, he pulled his Helmet
off his head, and for anger and indignation, threw
it with violence againſt the ground. Had <hi>Egmond</hi>
followed his advantage and preſently overcome
his enemies, this might have beene attributed to
<hi>Scipioes</hi> valour in him. Or, if <hi>Charles</hi> himſelfe had

ſtead, than any ten Captaines in his Army, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſolved to try the fortune of Battaile that day.
Thus the Lord of Hoaſts, as skilfull as mighty in
battaile, can turne and winde the whole fabrick of
Warre with the leaſt finger of his hand, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
or eſtabliſh the cunningeſt projects of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Princes, and their Counſels of Watre, by the
experience and information of a ſilly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Countrey
Swaine. Captaines may conſult, but he determines;
they throw the Dice, he appoints the chance; they
may ſet their men as it pleaſeth them, but he in the
iſſue will play the game as it pleaſeth Him. When
we ſee great Stateſmen, or ſubtile Politicians more
groſſely infatuated in ſome particulars of greateſt
conſequence, then ordinary men uſually are; this
is a ſure token, that the wiſdome which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
uſed, was not their owne: but when we ſee
them wittingly cunning to worke their owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow,
this is an argument that there is one wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
then they, which ſometimes gives wiſedome,
ſometimes onely <hi>lends</hi> it ſo, as he will require ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:7905:285"/>
for the miſ-imployment of it. And it is
not ſo great a wonder, to ſee a wiſe man infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or utterly deprived of wiſedome, as to ſee his
wit and skill continually imployed in weaving a
net, to inſnare himſelfe in, and ſuch as rely upon
his projects and power.</p>
                     <p>9 Hitherto <hi>Charles</hi> the fift had the fortune of
good Dice, and played the fore-game exceeding
well. But ſeeing Religion lay at the ſtake, God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs
others to play the after-game a great deale
better againſt him; albeit he had two great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
the one for matters of State, the other for
Warre, to wit, the Duke of Alva, and <hi>Granvel</hi> the
Chancellor, as by-ſtanders to helpe him. The ſum
of their advice, was to account ſeverity the beſt
fruits of victory; and to keepe them under by
ſtrong hand, whom hee had conquered; and to
bring them in by cunning, which had yet ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to ſtand out againſt him. His firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
was in committing the ever-renowned Duke
of Saxony, to the cuſtody of a Spaniard, to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſus
Vives,</hi> brother to the famous <hi>Ludovicus.</hi>
This bred great alienation of affection and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in ſome Nobles of Germany, of whoſe fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and good ſervice in this Warre, he had proofe
ſufficient. But more mightily overſeene he was, in
the cunning draught of thoſe Articles, upon which
the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſen</hi> did yeeld himſelfe, not as
a Priſoner, but as a reconciled friend, or Subject, as
he preſumed. The Emperour and his Counſell,
had wit enough to take this man priſoner, but not
to foreſee the blot, which would hereupon follow,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7905:285"/>
not to the ſtayning onely of the Emperours
honour, but to the hazard of the maine game,
and utter loſſe of his late Conqueſt. They
did not conſider that <hi>Maurice</hi> of Saxonie,
ſonne in Law to the <hi>Landgrave,</hi> was as ſubtill as
valorous, and being as ambitious as ſubtill, would
meditate as full a requitall of this reall diſgrace and
deluſion, (he being intereſted in the reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
as hee had done of a friendly but ſharpe
check, given by his Vncle and Guardian (the now
captive Duke of Saxonie) for being too prodigall
of his patrimony in his nonage. But <hi>Maurice</hi>
his diſpoſition and abilities, were happily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
unto the Emperour: and it was not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
for a forward young Captaine, not above
twentie ſix yeares of age, to be of as deepe a reach
in matters of State, as his gray headed and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Counſellors. The more patient hee
was for the preſent, the more deeply hee layed his
plot, the more vigilant hee was to entertaine all
opportunities which ſhould be offered for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of his Father in Law, and the libertie
of his Countrie. The making of <hi>Maurice</hi> Prince
Elector in his captive Vncles ſtead, did adde much
to his power: the Spanyards ſecuritie and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
expreſſed in their printed bookes of the
conqueſt in Germanie as of ſome meaner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
or appendix to their affected Monarchie,
did much exaſperate the Germane Princes eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
all but of Brandeburgh hitherto a faithfull
adherent unto <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and a truſty friend
and companion unto <hi>Maurice,</hi> to whom he was

                        </gap>kt by the ſure tye of common
diſcontent. The firſt opportunitie, which <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>
had for effecting his long concealed plot, was
the manifeſtation of <hi>Charles</hi> his purpoſe for redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Romiſh religion into the free States and
Cities of Germanie (which had abandoned it) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his former promiſes, when hee ſolicited
their ayde againſt the Duke of Saxonie and <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
of Heſſen, not as the chiefe maintainers or
patrons of reformed religion, but as rebels againſt
his imperiall Majeſtie. This unexpected purpoſe
of <hi>Charles</hi> was moſt clearely bewrayed in the ſiege
of Magdeburge, againſt which Citie, no occaſion
of hoſtility could be pretended, beſides her Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
reſolution to maintaine that religion, which
by publique Authoritie had beene eſtabliſhed.
The whole body of Germany beſides, was in a
manner ſo drowned and choaked, that libertie (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in points of religion) could ſcantly draw
breath, ſave onely through <hi>Flaccus Illyricus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> his
penne. For ſubduing this Citie, which for a
while had held out ſtoutly againſt others ſet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſige
it, <hi>Maurice</hi> of Saxony was adjudged the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
man, who being imployed in this ſervice,
gaines opportunity by protraction of the warre
to make leagues as well with the French King as
with ſome Princes and States of Germany: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
many ſuſpitions and jealouſies taken againſt
him, ſo cunningly goes on with his project, that
he came upon <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour on ſuch a
ſudden manner at Inchborrouh, as made him and
his Courtiers, with the forraine Embaſſadours
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7905:286"/>
there attending, to leave the Supper which had
beene provided for them unto <hi>Maurice</hi> and his
company. There was a horſe-liter and torches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for the Emperour himſelfe with ſome few
attendants, but ſuch ſcarcity of horſes for the reſt,
that a man might have ſeene that common reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance

really acted in the confuſed flight of this great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
amazed Court. Dukes, Earles, &amp; Lords,
great Commanders in Warre, common Souldiers
and Kitchin Boyes, were glad to trudge it on foot
in the mire hand in hand; a Duke or Earle not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
to ſupport or helpe up one of the blacke
Guard ready to fall, leſt he himſelfe might fall in
the mire, and have none to helpe him. This was
the iſſue of the greateſt Warre which Germany
had ſeene or knowne ſince the dayes of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great; in the managing and proſequution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
more excellent Commanders were imployed
by <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, than any Prince in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ſince hath had to imploy.</p>
                     <p>10 Vnto many is given power and wit ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for compaſſing the conqueſt of their potent
enemies, unto whom the wiſedome of uſing the
victorie aright (which they oftentimes purchaſed
at too deare a rate) is denyed. The ſame Lord of
Hoaſts which put his hooke into <hi>Senacheribs</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrills,
and thereby dragged this furious Monſter,
which had ranged farre and neere to devoure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
into his owne Land; there to fall by his
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7905:287"/>
owne bowells in the houſe of his falſe gods; had
all this while led <hi>Charles</hi> the fift (a Prince of more
calme and moderate ſpirit,) as it were in a ſilken
ſtring, yet ſtrong enough to bring this roving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector
back againe within the Rheine, where he is
now to encounter with the French. And being
thus overwearied in the Germane Warre, the
Duke of Guiſe at the ſiege of Metz, beates his
Souldiers out of heart and breath, and makes
<hi>Charles</hi> himſelfe thus to pant: <hi>Iam me deſertum &amp;
circa me nullos viros video; Now I ſee I am a man
forſaken, and have no men about me.</hi> Few there
were beſides himſelfe, that were willing to have
the ſiege continued any longer: and one of his
common Souldiers, out of the bitterneſſe of his
diſcontented ſoule and diſeaſed body, calls him the
ſonne of a mad woman to his face, for continuing
it ſo long. But whether his undertaking or proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuting
this ſiege, did reliſh more of his mothers
diſpoſition, than of his owne; let Warriours judge:
he never ſhewed more wiſedome in any enterpriſe
before, then he did in this; that he ſought not from
this time, to wooe his wonted fortunes, by wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with Fates. But after he perceived the Lord
of Hoaſts did not goe out with his Armies, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had done; he willingly puts off his imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Robes with his Armour, and betakes himſelfe
to a private retired life. How much happier in this
reſolution, than either the <hi>Davus</hi> or <hi>Diabolus Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniae,</hi>
than the often mentioned <hi>Maurice</hi> of
Saxony, ſurnamed the Victorious, or the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

their undertakings, in their ſecret confederacies,
whether for <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, or againſt him, had
aymed more at their private ends, than at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique

For if he had lived but a little longer, the wings of

cut a great deale ſhorter throughtout Germany and

argument of Gods favour towards the profeſſors
of the reformed Religion throughout Germany,
that the Duke of Saxony and Landgrave of Heſſen
had not the victory which they expected over the

their agreement during the time of the war,
was not altogether ſo good, as to promiſe any

few yeares captiuitie, was a fatherly chaſtiſement,
no plague or token of Gods wrath againſt them.
As the unjuſt detention of the Landgrave, brought
greater diſhonour to the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> then
any one Act that ever he did: ſo the Duke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xonie
wonne himſelfe more honour by his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

and ſuch, as many Heathen have ſcorned
or not affected. But for a Prince by birth, which
had beene continually borne upon the wings of
better Fortune, alwayes reputed the chiefe ſtay
and pillar of his Country; to endure captivity in
an uncouth Court, with ſuch conſtancy of minde,
as could turne the intended contempt and ſcorne

fame unto poſterity. This was a bleſſing peculiar
to Gods Saints. That character which forraigne
Writers have put upon him, will hardly befit any
that is not a Chriſtian inwardly and in heart; [Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que

pitie, (if we may ſpeake after the manner of moſt
men, and as many Germanes in thoſe times did,)
that ſo noble a Prince ſhould be puniſhed with the
perpetuall loſſe of his Electorall dignity? Yet even
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:7905:289"/>
this (that we may with veneration rather admire
than queſtion the ſecret wayes of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
was no loſſe, but gaine unto Gods Church,
and the publique weale of Saxony, which he more
ſought, than his owne ends or commodities. For
by his falling into <hi>Charles</hi> his hands, the Electorall
dignity of Saxony fell into another Collaterall
line, which proved as beneficiall and favourable to
good learning and Reformed Religion, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

This good Authors Comment upon this accident

but to the Reader. Onely of one clauſe pertinent
as well to the Diſcourſe following, as to that or the

This Earle was alwayes delighted to ſow the
ſeeds of warre, war being (as he and the World
thought) the chiefe field or ſureſt ground of his
glory, and he ends his thus honoured life with a
bloody and unglorious death. This was by Gods
appointment the moſt naturall crop and proper
harveſt of ſuch a ſeed-time as he had made. Yet
was not the finger of God more remarkable in
knitting theſe two Princes, which al their life times
had ſtood (as we ſay) at the ſtaffes end, than in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the ſtrict link of mutuall amity between other
ancient Friends, and ſworne Confederates; albeit
the Politician ſeeke in this caſe, as in the former,
altogether to cover or obliterate all impreſſion of
it. For it is his manner or humour, as was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:7905:291"/>
before, to bring as much <hi>griſt</hi> as he can, and
more then he ought, to his owne <hi>Mill;</hi> to entitle
ſuch partiall and ſubordinate meanes, as fall within
the compaſſe of his profeſſion, ſole or prime cauſes
of thoſe effects which are immediately produced
by <hi>Divine Providence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4 He ſpake merrily that ſaid, <hi>A man could not
beſtow his almes worſe than on blinde men, ſeeing they
could finde in their hearts to ſee their beſt benefactors
hanged.</hi> But it hath beene delivered in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
as a cautelous rule by ſome politique <hi>Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,</hi>
that the moſt thankleſſe office any great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage
can doe to his deareſt friend, were to make
him King. It is a leſſon of every dayes teaching,
<hi>The greater men grow, the more they ſcorne to bee
thought to be beholden unto others.</hi> The very ſight
of ſuch as they have beene more beholding unto,
than they can handſomely requite, ſeemes to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
ambitious minds. Hee is a meane Hiſtorian
that cannot inſtance in divers upſtart Princes,
which could not long ſuffer the heads of thoſe
men, whoſe hands had put Crownes on theirs,
unto which they had no lawful title, to ſtand where
nature had given them lawfull poſſeſſion, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their owners ſhoulders. Politique rules or Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes
grounded upon hiſtoricall obſervations of
this kinde, are not altogether without uſe. But
the doctrine inveiled in Poeticall fictions, is in this
and many other caſes more Catholique than the
Hiſtorians or Politicians obſervation. Vſuall it is
with the Poets when they repreſent the originall
and progreſſe of tragicall diſſentions betweene

                        <hi>quondam</hi> friends; in the firſt place to diſpatch the
Furies abroad with fire-brands in their hands to
kindle or blow the coales of cruell and (without
the mutuall blood of the Actors) unquenchable
hatred. And to ſpeake the truth without fiction,
it ſeemes ſcarce poſſible that ſuch light ſparkles of
humane anger as are uſually the firſt ſeeds of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
betweene neighbour Princes or confederate
States, ſhould grow unto ſuch raging and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
flames as they often doe, unleſſe ſome ſpirit
more potent than the ſpirit or breath of man did
blow them. Now if by Furies the Poets meane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall
Fiends or evill Spirits, their language doth
not varie much from the ancient dialect of Canaan.
<hi>God</hi> (ſaith the Author of the Booke of Iudges, cap.

moſt <hi>infallibly</hi> unto ſuch ends as hee appoints, by

if we would diligently conſider the works of God
in our dayes, they are as apt to eſtabliſh true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
unto the rules of Chriſtianity ſet downe in
Scripture, as were the Miracles of former ages,
wherein Gods extraordinary power was moſt
ſeene: yea the ordinary events of our times, are
more apt for this purpoſe in this age, than uſe of
miracles could be. For the manifeſtations of Gods
moſt extraordinary power, ceaſe, by very frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
to be miraculous; and men (ſuch is the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity

events (were they frequent or continuall) did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from ſome alteration in the courſe of nature,
rather than from any voluntary exerciſe of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
power in the God of nature. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of theſe ordinary events, which the all-ſeeing
wiſedome of our God daily and hourely
brings to paſſe, is moſt apt to confirme the faith of
ſuch as rightly conſider them. For by their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
variety, the amplitude of his unſearchable
wiſdome is daily more and more diſcovered, and
by their frequency the hidden fountaine of his
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:7905:294"/>
Counſell, whence this multiplicity flowes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
more clearly to be inexhauſtible. Only the
right obſervation or live-apprehenſion of theſe his
works of wiſedome, is not ſo eaſie and obvious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch as minde earthly things, as his workes of
extraordinary power are. For ſuch works amate
the ſenſe, and make entrance into the ſoule, as it
were by force; whereas the effects of his Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or Counſell, make no impreſſion upon the
ſenſe, but upon the underſtanding only, nor upon
it, ſave onely in quiet and deliberate thoughts. For
this reaſon, true faith was firſt to be planted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted
in the Church by Miracles, but to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
and ſtrengthned in ſucceeding ages, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of his providence. The limits of this

of God doth ſometimes defeat the cunningeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
or deepeſt plots of Politicians, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

and <hi>Eſter</hi> (unknowne to bee of the captive
Hebrewes kinde) admitted to be <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> his mate,
juſt at that time, when <hi>Haman,</hi> the Iewes ſworne
enemy, was exalted next to the King and Queene
in dignity; this can only be aſcribed to him, who,
as the wiſe ſonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> ſpeakes, hath made all
things <hi>double, one againſt another, Ecclus, 42. v. 24.</hi>
Againe, that the King, the very night before hee
came to the banquet which <hi>Eſter</hi> had prepared,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:7905:295"/>
ſhould take no reſt; this was the Keeper of Iſraels
vigilant care over his people, who neither ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
nor ſleepes, whileſt his enemies are a plotting
miſchiefe againſt them. Againe, that the King ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no reſt ſhould ſeeke to ſolace his reſtleſſe
thoughts by reading the Chronicles, that reading
them hee ſhould light on that place, wherein the
now diſtreſſed <hi>Mordecaies</hi> faithfull ſervice, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying
the treaſon intended againſt his perſon, by
<hi>Bigtan</hi> and <hi>Tereſh</hi> his Eunuches, was regiſtred: All
this doubtleſſe, was only from his wiſedome, that
hath the diſpoſition of al the <hi>lots,</hi> much more of all
the plots which man can caſt. Many other occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
might here be conſidered, no one of which
conſidered apart, from the reſt, but is ordinary and
uſuall; and yet the entire frame or compoſture of
them, ſuch as cannot bee referred to any but his
<hi>workmanſhip,</hi> who hath created all things in <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
waight,</hi> and <hi>meaſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet a Politician that ſhould have read this ſtory
in the Perſian Chronicles, could at the firſt ſight
have diſcovered a great overſight in <hi>Haman,</hi> in not
putting ſooner in execution this his abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
<hi>Semper nocuit differre paratis.</hi> Perhaps
this conditionall propoſition may bee true, that if
he had executed his Commiſſion with ſpeed, the
Iewes had fared worſe; but for this cauſe the Lord
did not ſuffer him to entertaine this reſolution.
Yet, let us ſee whether <hi>haſte</hi> in execution could
accompliſh the like deſignes againſt a State in
<hi>like</hi> caſe.</p>
                     <p>3 <hi>Fliſcus</hi> that nobly deſcended and potent <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeſi,</hi>
                        <pb n="325" facs="tcp:7905:295"/>
with his <hi>familiar Verina,</hi> had enacted as cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
a Law againſt the <hi>Dorian</hi> Family, and the other
Nobility of Genoa; which they had reſolved to
have writen, firſt with characters of blood upon
their pretended enemies breſts, &amp; after their death,
to have condemned them by proclamation, when
as <hi>Fliſcus</hi> through popularity ſhould have got the
Diadem.<note place="margin">Vide Thuanum anno. 1547</note> Their plot for effecting their enemies
death and their owne advancement, was layed as
exactly as policy could deviſe; their <hi>practiſe</hi> and
execution of meanes invented, was more exact
then the patterne which <hi>Machiavel</hi> gives for like
deſignes. Firſt, becauſe ſtore of armour and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was neceſſary for ſuch an action, and proviſion
of ſuch ſtore of munition would be ſuſpicious for a
private man to undertake in a <hi>popular</hi> and <hi>factious</hi>
State; <hi>Fliſcus</hi> perſwades young <hi>Doria</hi> (whoſe
death he eſpecially ſought) to be his partner in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out a Man of Warre againſt the Turkes. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
kindly accepts the offer, altogether ignorant of
the others intent, which was by this colour to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
himſelfe with armour and munition out of the
Countrie for <hi>Doriaes</hi> overthrow. And being once
furniſhed with ſuch tragicall attire, without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any tragedy to enſue: for to provide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
of ſutable actors; hee invites a multitude of
the Commons to a night feaſt, where in ſtead of
thankſgiving before meat, hee makes a patheticall
oration, exhorting them to banquet it that night
in the Nobilities blood, aſſuring them that they
ſhould bee their owne carvers for ever after, of
the good things of that Citie. Some for love to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7905:296"/>
                        <hi>Fliſcus,</hi> others for hate to the <hi>Nobility,</hi> ſome for
feare of preſent danger, and others for hope of
greater dignities; for one cauſe or other, all at
length, ſave two (who deſired to be ſpared for their
faint hearts) offer themſelves to <hi>Fliſcus</hi> his ſervice.
And by their forwardneſſe, the City gates, next to
the <hi>key,</hi> whoſe <hi>command</hi> made moſt for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
are preſently ſurpriſed: yet not without ſome
noiſe, which comming unto <hi>Doriaes</hi> eare, makes
him ſuſpect that his Mariners were quarrelling;
and rifing out of his bed to <hi>compoſe</hi> the ſuppoſed
quarrell by his preſence, he falls immediately into
his enemies hands before he was ſought for. But
however this yong gallant had committed no <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
crime, that by courſe of humane law, deſerved
a violent death by ſuch executioners; yet the right
hand of the Lord had found him out, for conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by <hi>Piracy</hi> to diſturbe the publique peace lately
concluded betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> the fift and the Turke:
which peace the Genoezes amongſt others, the
Dorian faction above other Genoezes, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
this young <hi>Doria</hi> &amp; his Fathers houſe (which
had ſtood for <hi>Caeſar</hi> againſt the French) were bound
in conſcience to obſerve. But leaving the cauſe of
his death unto the righteous Iudge: his ſudden end
in any Politicians judgement was a good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to <hi>Fliſcus</hi> miſchievous deſignes. And what
more could <hi>Machiavel</hi> have in the next place given
in charge, but that the Gallies which made ſome
ſtirre at the noiſe, ſhould with all ſpeed bee boor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to make all ſure, untill the Tragedy were fully
acted. This <hi>Fliſcus</hi> ſought to put in execution with
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7905:296"/>
as great ſpeed as <hi>Machiavel</hi> in like caſe could have
wiſhed. But haſte (as wee ſay) makes waſte: his
forward minde had made him forget, that his <hi>body</hi>
was not ſo nimble in armour, as out of it; not ſo
apt either to avoid a ſlip, or to recover himſelfe
when he began to ſlide. By his haſty treading up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a looſe plank (as if the ſnare had been ſet for his
ſoule by the Almighties hand) he, and one or two
of his companions, fell ſome yard or two ſhort of
their purpoſe, and drowned themſelves and their
plot, even whileſt it was come to ſuch perfection,
that the younger <hi>Fliſcus</hi> yet hoped to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
Duke of Genoa, as haply he might have done,
if the Lord had lent him ſo much wit as to have
concealed his elder brothers death, ſcarce knowne
to any till he bewrayed it to ſuch as enquired for
him, in hope to finiſh all inſtantly by his preſence.
But they partly amazed with the elder brothers
ſudden diſaſter, and ſeeing no ſufficiency in the
younger, to ſatisfie their expectation, diſſolve the
rout, and ceaſing to project the ruine of others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
every one to ſeek the beſt meanes for his owne
ſafety. Thus hath this politique Gentleman <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
ſhame unto his houſe,</hi> his ſtately Palace is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed,
and his Noble Family almoſt extinct.
Yet were all the conditions which greateſt plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters
require in ſuch projects, exactly obſerved
in this: the plot it ſelfe as acurate as could by the
reach of man be deviſed, their counſell communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
but to a few at the firſt, the execution of it ſo
ſpeedy, that the appointed actors could have no
leiſure to deliberate whether it were better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7905:297"/>
or goe forwards; and yet the ſucceſſe more
diſmal and ſudden, than their enemies could expect
or wiſh. Thus <hi>Machiavels</hi> rules have their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
but the Prophets Calendar is never out
of date; <hi>Non eſt viri dirigere greſſus ejus.</hi> Not <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi>
himſelfe had he been preſent, could ſo have
directed <hi>Fliſcus</hi> his ſteps, that his treadings ſhould
not ſlip; yea, he ſhould have fallen, though <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi>
had held the plank. For his iniquity had
overgrown his plot, and being come to ful height,
it ſtrikes upon that immutable &amp; irreſiſtible doome
which God by <hi>Moſes</hi> had pronounced, Deut. 32.
v. 35. <hi>Vengeance and recompence are mine, their
feet ſhall ſlide in due time, and the day of their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is at hand, and the things that ſhall come upon
them, make haſte.</hi> Theſe men we ſpake of, haſtned
their owne deſtruction, by making too much haſte
to deſtroy others.</p>
                     <p>4 Perhaps the Politician will reply: As <hi>Haman</hi>
was too ſlow, ſo <hi>Fliſcus</hi> was too haſty, and ſhould
have obſerved the contrary rule,
<q>Differ; habent parvae commoda magna morae.</q>
Suppoſe this hot-ſpur were <hi>revived,</hi> to re-act his
former or the like cunning plot, and for his better
remembrance ſhould take the <hi>Dolphin</hi> and <hi>Harrow</hi>
for his deviſe, with this inſcription, <hi>Feſtina lente;</hi>
it were not poſſible his ſpeed ſhould be better, ſo
long as his intentions were as bad, or worſe then
they had beene; and his adverſaries no worſe then
they were, when he conſpired their death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="329" facs="tcp:7905:297"/>
To omit more examples ancient or foraigne:
the freſh memory of the Powder treaſon eclipſeth
all that have gone before it. No Politician can
juſtly accuſe the Actors of this intended Tragedy,
either of <hi>Hamans</hi> too long delay, or of <hi>Fliſcus</hi> his
haſte. Such maturity and ſecrecie they uſed in their
actions and conſultations, as none on earth could
have uſed more, conſidering the many lets and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
which did croſſe their projects. Hell it
ſelfe had gone ſo long with this hideous monſter,
that it was weary and well content to make an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ortive
brood, as fearing the <hi>pangs</hi> that muſt have
accompanied the full delivery of what had beene
conceived within her bowels, would be unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But <hi>Achitophel</hi> had wit at will, to plot a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to his Soveraignes overthrow; yet herein <hi>blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
by <hi>him,</hi> that gave him ſight in other projects,
that he could not forecaſt what harmes might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
him by <hi>Abſoloms</hi> folly. And though the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotter</hi>
were <hi>Vir profundae diſsimulationis,</hi> one that
could give traiterous counſell, as the deſtroying
Angell of the Lord, and hide his counſell as deep as
Hell; though he had this extraordinary quality in
him, of making his friends ſo ſure unto him, that
they would adventure both body and ſoule at any
time for his ſake: yet thus farre infatuated he was,
as not to conſider, that ſome of them which were
ſo willing to worke a publique miſchiefe for his
pleaſure, might alſo have a deſire to ſecure their
private friends from danger, by giving them ſome
generall or ambiguous admonition, albeit againſt
their oaths of ſecrecie. That one of them ſhould
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7905:298"/>
ſeeke to admoniſh his Honourable friend of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
danger, was a thing not extraordinary, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in this, that ſo much good nature could be left
in his breſt, that could conſent unto his Countries
ruine. That a man of the Ieſuites inſtruction, ſhould
finde an evaſion in an oath, which he held lawfull,
is a matter uſuall. And who knowes whether hee
that permits evill, becauſe he knowes to turne it
unto good, did not at this time make uſe of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
doctrine of playing faſt and looſe with his
ſacred and dreadfull name, to animate this Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
to diſpenſe with that ſolemne oath of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
which he had taken, and afterward to forſweare
the fact ſo deeply. I do not think he durſt have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
upon either, without ſome <hi>ſecret mentall
reſervation.</hi> But without all queſtion, it was his
<hi>counſell</hi> which moderateth the maine deviſes of
mans heart, that moved him to expreſſe his minde
in ſuch <hi>termes,</hi> as might repreſent or call the fathers
diſaſter, unto the remembrance of his royall ſonne,
whom nature had taught to make jealous conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of every ſpeech, word, or circumſtance,
that might revive the memory of the intendments
againſt his father, and to forecaſt all poſſible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
of all occurrences, which might por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
or intimate the like deſignes againſt himſelfe.
As the ſincerity of his royall heart and conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of clemency towards all, eſpecially towards
that faction which deſerved none; had brought
our Soveraigne aſleepe in ſecurity: ſo the collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which he made out of the diſcloſers aenigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
admonitions, were ſuch as a man would make,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7905:298"/>
that had heard the Letter read in a dreame or ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
not ſuch as ſo wiſe and learned a Prince would
in other caſes have made in his vigilant and waking
thoughts. But from what cauſe ſoever the dreame
came, the interpretation was from the Lord, and
<hi>Let it be unto the Kings enemies for ever.</hi> The event
hath proved the diſcloſer to have beene a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and to have ſpoken preſumptuouſly when he
ſaid, that <hi>God and man had concurred to puniſh the
iniquity of thoſe times,</hi> by ſuch a <hi>blow</hi> as he meant.
We muſt with the true Prophet make confeſſion:
<hi>Not unto us Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name
give the glorie.</hi> It was not God and man, but God
alone, that did ſute and order the ſeverall occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by which the intended blow was prevented. It
was not God, but the devill, that did intend it.</p>
                     <p>5 That the Iewes in the dayes of <hi>Mordecai,</hi>
that the Genoezes within this age, that this Land
and people within our memory, have not become
a prey unto their malicious enemies, was meerely
from the counſell of the Lord, which muſt ſtand,
for our good, if we decline not unto evill. It is not
the breath or vapour of Hell, that can undermine
our State, or ſhake our Princes Throne; whileſt
God is with us. But if he be againſt us, what can be
for us? If he doe but ſpeake the word, even the
leaſt word of mortall man, whoſe breath is in his
noſtrils, ſhall be ſufficient to <hi>blow up</hi> or overturne
a Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>If ſubjects ſhould rebell, as often as Princes
breake jeſts upon them, they might worke their
owne greater real diſgrace, and wrong both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:7905:299"/>
and their poſterities farre more in deed, than
the other had done in words. But opportunitie
makes a theefe, and want of opportunitie oftimes
keepes great mindes much diſcontent, from rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
But when it ſhall pleaſe him that hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the perfect knowledge of times and ſeaſons to
himſelfe, not to diſpoſe their opportunities to any
Land or peoples good; a womans unſeaſonable
word may breed mightieſt Empires greater reall
miſchiefe, than Emperours Swords for many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
can redreſſe. So it fell out, when <hi>Iuſtin</hi>
the Emperour had removed <hi>Narſes</hi> the Eunuch
from his <hi>regency</hi> of <hi>State</hi> upon importunate accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which, for the preſent, he could not put off,
but only by putting him from his place. <hi>Sophia</hi> his

and of his encouraging of this King to revenge his

that his enemies at the appointed time may fall

                     <p>The onely uſe which the Politician hath made
of this and like experiments, is this: Firſt, that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls
ſhould bee very wary what words ſhould
paſſe throughout their army, and for this purpoſe
to keepe ſervants, women, or other talkative or
clamorous creatures, farre from the army, when
any ſervice is toward. Secondly, to accuſtome
their Souldiers, onely to reſpect their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſpeeches, and to account of others as winde,
that blowes afarre off. Theſe caveats were given
above 70 yeares agoe; and yet have greater forces
than theſe Italians had, beene upon as light occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
defeated in their intended ſurpriſalls of Cities
by night, after they had blowne open their Gates
with <hi>Petars.</hi> However, the admonition hath its
uſe and ſeaſons, though oftentimes obſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſucceſſe, becauſe it is too much relyed upon.
<hi>Mordecai</hi> ſpake with confidence unto <hi>Eſter; If
thou holdeſt thy peace at this time, comfort and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance

was for their good. But though <hi>Souldiers</hi> ſhould
hold their peace, and Generalls ſpeake nothing but
what the Politician ſhould <hi>prompt,</hi> yet ſhall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
come upon them upon other occaſions; if the
counſell of the Lord bee once againſt them. Yea
though the parties diſagreeing ſhould lay all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
aſide, and conſult for the eſtabliſhing of
peace, yet ſhall they conclude in blood, if the Lord
of Hoſts be diſpleaſed with them.</p>

9 A fit inſtance to this purpoſe is regiſtred, as
<hi>Camerarius</hi> tels us in foraigne Annalls, though not
intimated by our Engliſh Hiſtorians, who had as
much reaſon as any other to have recorded it, if
the ſtory had beene true. But ſeeing they have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it, I will not expect the Readers hiſtoricall
aſſent unto it, but only commend it unto him as an
example for illuſtrating the probability of the laſt
obſervation. The Engliſh and French Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ready to joyn battell in Normandy, the French
Captaines perſwade their King to intreat a parley
with the King of England, that ſo all matters might
be compromiſed without further harme or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to either partie. The place agreed upon for
the parley was a ruinated Chappell, a little diſtant
from both armies. A friendly compromiſe was by
both Kings reſolved upon to be further ratified up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deliberation of their ſeverall Counſells. But
before their parting, a huge Snake, whether ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up by the noiſe of their attendants which wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without, or upon other occaſions, ſeemed by
her hiſſing and ſwelling necke to make towards
them. Both of them alike afraid, draw their ſwords,
and yet neither willing to truſt other within the
walls, run out with their naked Swords in their
hands: their attendants upon this ſight miſdeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome outfall in the Chappell betweene them,
doe the like; and the Armies upon this view joyne
battaile, and could not bee recalled, untill much
blood on both parties was, and more had beene
ſpilt, unleſſe the night had come vpon them.</p>
                     <p>10 Be this, as it may be, a true ſtory, or a fiction:
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:7905:302"/>
the poſſibility of ſuch unexpected occurrences (all
which are at the Almighties diſpoſition) are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
and cannot be comprehended, much leſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the wit of man which is but finite. So
that although the plots and deviſes of mans heart
be many, yet hath the Lord more counterplots
perpetually in ſtore, and therefore of all counſells,
<hi>the counſell of the Lord it ſhall ſtand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whileſt I reade ſome ſpeculative Politicians,
that ſeeke by obſerving the errors of former times
in managing civill affaires or projects, to rectifie or
correct their overſights, and take upon them to
make an Ephimerides of future events: their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
in my ſlender obſervation, argue a greater
ignorance in them, of divine Providence, than their
practiſes would in the Mathematicks, that would
labour out of a ſurd number to extract a perfect
ſquare. He that knowes the rules of Arithmeticall
diviſion, might in every <hi>working</hi> or attempt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
a full number into its proper <hi>ſquare,</hi> come
nearer and nearer to the ſquare number, and yet be
ſure not to finde it, though he ſpent <hi>Neſtors</hi> yeares
in dividing and ſubdividing the ſame number, or
reſolving fractions into fractions. The reaſon is
this, how little ſoever a ſurd number exceeds the
next ſquare, yet the overplus is in diviſion infinite.
And ſo are the events which the Politician ſeeks to
rectifie or determine of, and therefore not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rectifiable or determinable; ſave onely by him
whoſe wiſdome is actually infinite. It is an errour
incident to little children to think they might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
ſhake hands with the <hi>man</hi> in the Moone, or
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:7905:302"/>
with <hi>Endymion</hi> kiſſe the Moone it ſelfe, if they
were upon the next hill where it ſeemes to them
to ſet: and if you bring them thither, they think
they came but a little too late; if they could bee
now at the next hill where they ſee it goe downe,
they imagine they might doe ſo yet. Such for all
the world is the practicall Politicians errour, the
cauſe of both in proportion the ſame. Children
are thus deceived, becauſe they imagine no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
betweene heaven and earth, or betweene
heaven and that part of earth which terminates
their ſight. And ſo the ſecular Politicians minde,
reacheth no farther than the hemiſphere of his
owne facultie. Either he knowes not, or conſiders
not, how farre the height and depth of his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and counſell that ſits in the heavens, and
rules the earth; exceeds the utmoſt bounds or ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rizon
of his foreſight and limited skill: in this only
different from the childe, that his wit is more ſwift
and nimble than the others body, ſo that he is not
ſo ſoone weary of his purſuit. But if hee miſſe of
his purpoſe at the firſt, he hopes at his next flight
to ſpeed, and thus in ſeeking after true felicity
(which was hard by him, when hee beganne his
courſe) he runnes round all the dayes of his life,
even as he is led by him that daily compaſſeth the
earth. Better might Painters hope, by looking on
the multitude of men now living, to draw accurate
pictures of ſuch as ſhal be in the Age to come; than
any Politician can expect, either by obſervation of
former times, or experience of his owne, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
exact rules for managing of future projects.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:7905:303"/>
For if we conſider the whole frame or compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of circumſtances, or all the ingredients, (if I
may ſo ſpeake) of every event; there is as great a
varietie in humane actions, as there is in mens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Never were there two events of moment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth altogether alike; each differs from other,
either in the ſubſtance, number, or quality of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences,
or in the proportion of their conſonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
or diſſonancy unto the counſell of the Lord; as
there is no viſage but differs from another, if not
in colour or complexion, yet in ſhape or figure. I
have beene perhaps rather too long, then too bold
in decyphering the vanity of this proud Criticke,
which accuſeth Chriſtianity of cowardize in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and devotion of ſtupiditie and dulneſſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation
of State. But ſo might Bats and Owles
condemne the Eagle of blindneſſe, were tryall of
ſight to be made in that part of twilight, wherein
darkneſſe hath gotten the victory of light. Some
men not able to diſcern a friend from a foe, at three
paces diſtance in the open Sunne, will reade their
<hi>Pater noſter</hi> written in the compaſſe of a ſhilling
by moone ſhine, much better than others clearer
ſighted, can reade a Proclamation print. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinde
ſee beſt by night, yet not therefore better
ſighted than others are, becauſe the abſolute triall
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ight is beſt made by day. So is the meere Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician
more quick fighted, than Gods children in
matters permitted by divine providence, to the
managing of the Prince of darkneſſe. For albeit
the righteous Lord do in no caſe permit, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with perjury, fraud, or violence; yet he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:7905:303"/>
many events to be compaſſed by all or ſome of
theſe, or worſe meanes. Now when matters uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
managed by ſpeciall providence, come by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
permiſſion once to catching; hee that makes
leaſt conſcience of his wayes, will ſhew moſt wit
and reſolution. For whatſoever falls to Satans
diſpoſalls, ſhall aſſuredly bee collated on him that
will adventure moſt. It is his trade and profeſſion
to lend <hi>wit, might,</hi> and <hi>cunning,</hi> for ſatisfying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
deſires, upon the mortgage of ſoules and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.
And his Scholar or Client (the politique
Atheiſt) perceiving fraud and violence to proſper
well in ſome particulars, imagines theſe or like
meanes throughly multiplied to be able to conquer
all things, which he moſt deſires. But when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
commiſſion is recalled, or his power by Gods
providence contracted; the cunningeſt intentions
or violent practiſes of Politicians, prove much like
to a peremptory warrant out of date, which being
directed to one County is ſerved in another. Both
indanger the party proſecuting, and turne to the
advantage of the proſecuted. I conclude this

would be ready, upon like provocation or cuſtome
to deale as boyſterouſly with their vanquiſht foes,
as <hi>Adonibezech</hi> did with his, rather than to make
the like ingenuous confeſſion; though God did
call their ſinnes to minde by ſuch ſenſible remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
as awaked him. This I have generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that lighter touches of Gods afflicting
hand, did more affect the outragious people of the
old world (unleſſe ſuch as were delivered up into
a reprobate ſenſe) than his ſevere blowes do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
amongſt us, which have the reputation of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
of civill, yea of ſanctified men. The minds
of moſt men are ſo blinded and choakt with cares
of this world, that they looke no further than into
ſecond cauſes; and hence (like idiots) they ſuſpect
ſuch blowes as are reached them from heaven, to
be given by ſuch as are next unto them. But even
amongſt ſuch as look farre enough beyond ſecond
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7905:306"/>
cauſes; amongſt ſuch as ſee God in his word, and

miſtake, (perhaps from both) whatſoever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
befalls them, after they have taken ſpeciall
notice of their regeneration, is entertained as a
meere loving correction, ſent for no other end
than to worke for their future good, not as a touch
of Gods punitive juſtice requiring ſerious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for ſome particular ſinnes paſt. But whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may be thought of the diſtinction it ſelfe, this
application of it, was not in uſe amongſt the ancient
Saints and people of God.</p>
                     <p>4 Few moderne Spirits of ingenuous birth and
breeding, but would ſcorne to be ſuſpected of ſuch
rude and vaſt behaviour, as ſome of <hi>Iacobs</hi> Sonnes
uſed towards their Father, others towards <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>
or the Shechemites. And yet, how quickly doth
the feare, rather than the ſufferance of lighter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
than <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſuffered at their hands, call their
offences againſt <hi>him</hi> to their remembrance. They

he feared more than any thing elſe, beſides
death; which was the only cauſe why he ſo much
feared his diſpleaſure. And is it not (as the wiſe
King ſpeakes) a vanity of vanities, or more than ſo,
a miſery of miſeries, that the feare of this laſt <hi>point</hi>
or cloſe of life, ſhould make great men ſlaves, for
the moſt part of their lives, and bring a neceſſity
upon them, of fearing every one with more than
a ſlaviſh feare, that may in probability be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as an inſtrument or meſſenger of its approach.
Now this King was ſo exceſſively afraid of death,
that he had given it in ſtrict charge unto his friends
and followers, not to give him warning of this his
laſt <hi>enemy,</hi> by <hi>name,</hi> whenſoever it ſhould (to their
ſeeming) approach: but to exhort him onely to a
confeſſion or expiation of his ſinnes. Yet was it
his ill hap or <hi>fate,</hi> after he had ſet his houſe in order,
and after his dejected ſpirits had beene ſomewhat
rayſed with new hopes of recovery, to have death
rung into his eares by his ſervants, after ſuch an
indiſcreet and unmannerly faſhion, as if they had
ſought to put him into purgatory, whileſt he was
alive. His <hi>Barber,</hi> with others, (whom he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded

if they had come unto him, rather as Iudges to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the ſentence of death upon him, than as
gentle remembrancers of his mortality) told him
bluntly and peremptorily, that his houre was come,
that hee was not to expect any further comfort

to ſhoot at all that came neere his Caſtle gates, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe

In fine, he was more afraid to be delivered
out of his Priſon, by the Nobility of France, than
his Captives were to be put in ſuch cages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That

                     <p>7 The particular evills which <hi>Lewis,</hi> by Divine
Iuſtice, in this life, ſuffred (haply) had never come
to the exact <hi>notice</hi> of poſterity, unleſſe <hi>Cominaeus</hi>
his wits, had beene ſet on worke to obſerve them,
by his experience or foreſufferance of the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
from <hi>Lewis,</hi> or by his procurement. Beſides
this Authors impriſonment eight months in the
iron <hi>Cage;</hi> another evill there was, wherein no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ſervant or follower of this King, but had a
large portion. For, he had either a naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or a diſpoſition acquired by cuſtome, to hold
them, whom he did not formally ſentence to any
ſet puniſhment, in a perpetuall feare or anxiety of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7905:311"/>
minde. Now the conſciouſneſſe of this his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
and cuſtomary practice in his beſt and able
dayes, did (as it were) binde him over to indure
the like torments in his feeble and declining yeares.
<q>
                           <hi>Metus peſsimus Tyrannus,</hi> To live in perpetuall
feare, is to live under the moſt cruell Tyranny,</q>
that can bee. And unto this Tyranny greateſt
Tyrants are more ſubject and more obnoxious,
than their inferiours can be to them. For though
it be poſſible for one man to keepe many thouſands
in perpetuall awe and feare, yet is it not ſo much
for every man (of ſo many) in his owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to feare <hi>one</hi> man, (how greatly ſoever) as it is
for <hi>one</hi> man (how great ſoever) to ſtand in feare,
but of halfe ſo many. Yet can no man be ſo great
or ſo well guarded, as not to have often and juſt
occaſion to feare ſome harme or other, from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one, whom he hath made to feare him more
than is fitting. Whence, he that ſeekes to ſowe
the ſeedes of feare in the hearts of others, doth
but thereby (as it were) conſecrate his owne
heart or breſt to be the receptacle or ſtore-houſe
of the multiplied increaſe or crop. For even in this
caſe that ſaying is moſt true, <hi>As every one ſowes,
ſo ſhall he reape.</hi>

                     <p>What other iſſue could be expected from <hi>Lewis</hi>
his rigid practiſe upon others, and his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
timorous and ignoble diſpoſition, than ſuch
tormenting jealouſies and perplexities, as <hi>Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>

deareſt friends, not daring to truſt ſonne or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

of that name. The accident is not recorded by
Gods Spirit, yet the experiment (as unpartiall

Gods Spirit, and affords as good inſtruction for
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:7905:314"/>
moderne Princes, as examples in the Sacred Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
did to poſterity. This youthfull King in the

the Lord did ſtrengthen, to kill the Favourite, who
after many bitter provocations had drawne him

though moſt juſt, doth no way excuſe the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
injuſtice of this King, who hath this juſtice

ſolemnized theſe and the like triumphant

pedigree of unhallowed policies ill ſucceſſe,
as our owne Annalls of thoſe times doe.</p>
                     <p>2 Vnto <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond and his miſleaders,
it ſeemed a branch of plauſible policy to baniſh his
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:7905:316"/>
cozen (<hi>Henry</hi> of Bullinbrook) this land; the vicinity
of whoſe heroicall ſpirit was an heart-ſore to this
degenerate Prince. But what ſucceſſe did the
Counſell of the Lord award unto this jealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe?
<hi>Bullinbrook</hi> by his preſence amongſt foraine
Nations (which ſcarce knew him before) gained
ſo much honour, and ſo much love with the chiefe
Peeres of this Realme (which had knowne him
before) by his abſence, that <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond
was taken in his owne feare, and his Crowne ſet
upon <hi>Bullingbrookes</hi> head, with generall applauſe.
But the leſſe right he had unto it; the greater was
his jealouſie, leſt <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, or ſome other
more principall ſtemme of the royall Stock might
take it off againe. The only meanes, as he thought,
for ſecuring himſelfe from this feare, and for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Crowne upon the Houſe of Lancaſter,
was, to put the poore depoſed King to death;
whoſe errours deſerved pitie and compaſſion from
every true Engliſh heart, if not for his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
yet for his heroicall Fathers ſake, that <hi>Gideon</hi>
which had brought ſo much honour to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Nation. And after <hi>Richards</hi> death, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece
of his policy was, to ſuffer <hi>Mortimer</hi> the
lawfull heyre unto the Duke of Clarence, and now
unto the Engliſh Crowne, to live a miſerable
Captive under the enemy, who had more reaſon
to revenge himſelfe upon the Engliſh by <hi>Mortimers</hi>
death, than <hi>Bullinbrook</hi> had to murther <hi>Richard</hi> the
ſecond. This ſoule ſinne of <hi>Bullinbrooke</hi> was viſited
upon the third generation. His grandchilde and
heyre, <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt, a man more free from ſtaine
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:7905:317"/>
of guiltleſſe blood, than either <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond
or <hi>Bullinbrooke</hi> had beene, is cruelly murthered by
<hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, a ſtemme of <hi>Mortimers</hi> ſtock,
and of <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of Clarence. For though God
hath ſworne not to puniſh the children for their
fathers offences; yet he hath profeſſed it, as a rule
of his eternall juſtice, to viſit the ſinnes of fathers
upon the children. And from the equity of this
rule, many Princely Races have utterly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and expired, in the dayes of ſuch Princes as
were moſt free from the actuall ſinnes of their
Anceſtors, which were the cauſes of their expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as is in other Meditations ſhewed at large.</p>
                     <p>3 But though it were juſt with God to viſit
<hi>Bullinbrookes</hi> ſinne on <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt: did <hi>Edward</hi>
the fourth commit no injuſtice by doing <hi>that</hi>
which God would have done? yes; he did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
moſt unjuſtly, becauſe he did doe that, which
God would not have done by him. And therefore
the Counſell of the Lord, which overthrew the
bloody deviſes of <hi>Bullinbrooke</hi> for ſetling the
Crowne of this Kingdome on himſelfe and his
heyre males, did more ſpeedily overthrow the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth. God viſits his ſinne in
the next generation upon his lovely and harmleſſe
Sonnes in their nonage, before the <hi>deviſes</hi> of their
hearts were capable of any evill or miſchiefe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
men, and did viſit them by the hands of
their bloody uncle <hi>Richard</hi> the third, who, by their
Fathers appointment, had practiſed butchery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Houſe of Lancaſter, that he might become
a more skilfull ſlaughterman of the Houſe of York.

Thus did blood touch blood, and for a long time
run in the blood of his royall race, untill the iſſue

                           <hi>Acts 22. 20.</hi> And when the blood of thy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſhed, I alſo was ſtanding by, and conſenting unto his death, and kept the rayment of them that ſlew him:</note> as had beene done by his conſent unto Saint
<hi>Stephen,</hi> even as much as they themſelves deſired,
which did deſpite him no leſſe than their countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and brethren in iniquity, had done S. <hi>Stephen.
For they drew him out of the Citie, ſuppoſing he had
beene dead. Howbeit as the Diſciples ſtood round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, he roſe up and came into the Citie, and the
next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. Acts
14. 19, 20. Paul</hi> (wee may conclude) was more
extraordinarily preſerved by God, not leſſe rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
dealt withall by the Iewes, than Saint <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
had beene. That he was extraordinarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
we have reaſon to beleeve, becauſe he was
appointed to be a patterne of ſuffring more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
than this, from the time of his calling. That
he was appointed to bee a patterne of ſuffering e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills,
we muſt beleeve, becauſe God himſelfe doth
expreſly teſtifie as much, at the time of his calling,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:7905:320"/>
unto <hi>Ananius,</hi> who was to ratifie his calling ſo
farre as the notice of it concerned the viſible
Church. For when <hi>Ananias</hi> did demurre upon
his admiſſion into the Church, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto
him, goe thy way: for he is a choſen veſſell unto mee,
to beare my name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and
the children of Iſrael. For I will ſhew him, how great
things he muſt ſuffer for my names ſake. Act. 9. 15, 16</hi>
And yet (perhaps) Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had not been made
ſuch a ſpectacle to the world of <hi>ſuffrance</hi> or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
unleſſe he had perſecuted more than Saint
<hi>Stephen;</hi> unleſſe hee had made havocke of the
Church.</p>
                     <p>4 It is not probable, that theſe Iewes had any
minde to puniſh <hi>Paul</hi> for his offence againſt <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen;</hi>
of which if they had any notice or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
this would have made them more ready to
pardon him, for preaching the Goſpel at this time,
than to put him to death for perſecuting ſuch, as
had preached it before. Their reſolution to ſtone
him, at this time, rather than beat him with rods,
as their uſuall manner was, argues that their wills,
though otherwiſe free (more than enough) to doe
miſchiefe, were, by the all-ſeeing Providence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
or guided in the manner of practiſing
miſchiefe. To ſay, <hi>the Author of beeing,</hi> and <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

any decree, abſolutely neceſſitate them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſo full a meaſure of miſchiefe, as now poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

the ſupreme moderator of mens thoughts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,
as Iudge of their actions, did not onely
permit or ſuffer, but direct, appoint, and order, that

this heathen Antiquary, expreſly and fully diſcern
the power of Divine Iuſtice in this event; from the

and from the place of their diſcomfiture. His

eyeſight or apprehenſion herein, was as cleare as
any Chriſtians. Wherein then conſiſts his error?
In attributing this award of Divine Iuſtice unto
the Gods of Greece. But did any <hi>Southſayer</hi> of
Greece foretell, that the fathers <hi>breach of truce</hi>
ſhould be thus viſited upon their children as <hi>Elias</hi>

did then rule and <hi>execute judgement unto the ends

Nation, <hi>as he did with Iſrael; neither had the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

morall Analogie of this ſacred embleme, collect
that the ſame holy Lord would not ſuffer the
ſonne of that malignant cruell Pagan Fratricide,
which had imbrued his hands in the blood of his
Prieſts, and murthered his annointed King in the
holy place, to beare rule over his houſe, or
Church. This his unſeaſonable ambitious humor,
without any other actuall remarkable crime, might
in Divine Iuſtice exact ſome print of the ſupreame
Iudges indignation. All this (notwithſtanding)
being granted; doth not prove, there was no good
thing found in the partie, that was thus puniſhed,
as well as in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> child. It was a fauour to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7905:325"/>
the one, that he dyed in peace, though in his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and it might be ſome matter of honour or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

as ſhe had lived, ſo ſhe dyed, a malitious blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Pagan; a cruell bloody ſtep-dame to
Chriſts infant Church, in that Kingdome. The
ſtorie (I know) will unto many ſeeme ſtrange,
yet in my obſervation very capable of credit; if we
conſider the exigence of thoſe times, and the then
deſperate ſtate of <hi>Boheme.</hi> Chriſtianity and paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme
lay then at ſtake, whether ſhould be entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

policie (which aymes at nothing but
ſome private end, alwayes readie to hazard what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
lyes within their levell, rather then miſſe of

their bloody plots, removed ſo many principall
men out of the way, that there was no poſſibilitie
left, ſave onely in the Almighties <hi>immediate hand,</hi>
to make any thing of the aftergame. Now in caſe
of ſuch deſperate extremities (ſpecially when they

thou ſaidſt, Aha, againſt my Sanctuary when it
was prophaned, and againſt the Land of Iſrael, when
it was deſolate, and againſt the houſe of Iudah when

deliver thee to the men of the Eaſt for a poſſeſsion,
and they ſhall ſet their palaces in thee, and make
their dwellings in thee: they ſhall eate thy fruite, and
they ſhall drinke thy milke. And I will make Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah

thou haſt clapped thine hands, and ſtamped with thy

                     <p>Thus ſaith the Lord God, becauſe that Moab and

The Lord will bee terrible unto them: for hee
will famiſh all the gods of the earth, and men ſhall

[I have heard] <hi>are emphaticall,</hi> They intimate as

Prophet had ſaid, <q>Though Moab ſaw not me, yet
I heard him (for I was preſent with him) when

what I heard I cannot forget, nor will I forgive:

                     <p>6 The cryers of Edom againſt Ieruſalem when
Ieruſalem was drowned with her childrens teares,
(which yet could not quench the fire then kindled
in her pallaces) were more bitter then the cry of
Edom and Ammon againſt Iudah had beene.
<hi>[Raſe it, raſe it, even to the foundation thereof.]</hi>
The ſcope at which their wiſhes did ayme, was
that Ieruſalem and the Temple, might ſo be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
that they ſhould never be raiſed againe. And
according to this ſcantling of their malicious
wiſh, the Pſalmiſt proportions that imprecation
againſt Edom, which in the iſſue proved a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie:
<hi>Remember O Lord the Children of Edom, in

The more full expreſſion or ratification of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit

                        <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> knew that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
and <hi>Iudah</hi> were juſtly puniſhed for their
offences againſt the righteous Lord, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be the appointed executioners of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
yet all this doth no way excuſe them, for
their preſumption in the manner of execution. <hi>My
people have beene loſt ſheepe, their Shepheards have
cauſed them to goe aſtray, &amp;c. All that found them
have devoured them, and their adverſaries ſaid, Wee

the habitation of Iuſtice, even the Lord, the hope of
their Fathers.</hi> Yet all this acquits not <hi>Babylon</hi> from
guilt of Gods judgments in ſpoyling Gods people:
for ſo it followes; <hi>Remove out of the midſt of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,

ſpoile; all that ſpoyle her ſhall be ſatisfied, ſaith the
Lord, becauſe yee were glad, becauſe yee rejoyced, ô yee
deſtroyers of mine heritage.</hi> Not onely the practiſe,
or reall intention of miſchiefe, but the delight, or
joy, which men take in the calamitie of others by
whomſoever it bee procured or intended, doth
make men lyable to the rule of Retaliation.
For every degree of delight or joy in others
miſery, includes a breach of that fundamentall
Law of equitie, [Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri
ne feceris] <hi>VVhatſoever wee would not have done
vnto our ſelves, wee ſhould bee vnwilling to doe,
or to ſee done vnto others.]</hi> And all viſitation by
the rule of Counterpaſſion, as it concernes
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:7905:331"/>
wrongs intended or done by one man to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is but a reſarcination or making up of that
breach, which hath beene made in the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Law of equitie, that is, <hi>of doing as wee would be
done unto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8 But beſides the wrongs which Potentates or
priuate men practiſe upon, or intend to others,
there is a peculiar diſpoſition, which makes men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the iudgements which they feare, or at leaſt
haſten the execution of iudgements otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.
And that is a tempting God by the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſitie
of ſuperſtitious feare, or by diſſimulation.
An inſtance to this purpoſe (and that is all which at

revealed unto the Prophet, may ſeeme to have
ſuggeſted unto him the time of the Childes death,
with other circumſtances. The Prophets eies were
dimme, that he could not diſcerne her by ſight, but
the Lord ſo ſupplyed this defect, that hee knew

his embaſſage to Conſtantinople (how long after
I know not) which was upon the mariage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> about the
yeare 1555. The Chriſtian Hungars of thoſe times
after the loſſe of their late mentioned King, had as
juſt cauſe to inſert that lamentation into their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,
as <hi>Ieremie</hi> had to take it up: <hi>The annointed
of the Lord was taken in their nets, of whom we ſaid,
under his ſhaddow we ſhall be preſerved alive among

the Heathen.</hi> Lamentations 4. 20. As full an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in that complaint of the Pſalmiſt, as the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Iewes had during the time of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
or <hi>Antiochus</hi> his rage: <hi>The dead bodies of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
have they given to be meate unto the fowles
of the heaven, the fleſh of thy Saints unto the beaſts
of the earth, their blood have they ſhed like water,
&amp; there was none to burie them.</hi> Pſ. 79. 2, 3. The pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
women of Iudea did eate their Children, when
<hi>Titus</hi> beſieged Ieruſalem. The women of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie
(no leſſe mercifull (as may be preſumed) than
other Chriſtian women are, buried their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
alive, leſt their timorous outcryes might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
the place of their abode, or latitation, when
<hi>Soliman</hi> and his <hi>furious</hi> helhounds did ſo greedily
hunt after their lives. The people of Hungary
would not take example from the miſeries which
had befallen Iudea, nor breake off thoſe ſinnes
which brought this miſerie upon them: GOD
grant the Prophets and Seers of this kingdome,
eyes to diſcerne, and this whole people, one and
other, patient hearts to heare thoſe ſinnes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of practiſe, or opinion diſcovered, which
threaten the like judgements unto this Land, as
have befallen the Kingdome of Hungarie, one of
the moſt flouriſhing Kingdomes in the Chriſtian
world, within a few yeares before its ruine.</p>
