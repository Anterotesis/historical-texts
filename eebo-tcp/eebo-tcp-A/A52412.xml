         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>COntroversies of Religion, and
particularly this, have been
managed of late with that Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
of Passion and Indecency of,
Language, after such a Rude <hi>Bear-Garden</hi>
way, so much more like
Duelling or Prizing than Disputing,
that the more good Natured and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Bred part of the World are
grown almost Sick of them and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd
against them, not being able
to see Men Cut and Slash and draw
Blood from one another after such
an inhuman manner only to vent their
own Spleen, and make diversion for
the Savage and brutalized Rabble,
without some troublesom resentments
<pb facs="tcp:50055:4"/>
of Pity and Displacency. And truly
'tis hard for a Man to read some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
things of this Character without
being disturb'd, and growing out of
humour upon't, and being even out of
Conceit with Mankind, such an Idea
do they raise of the Malignity of
Human Nature, and so do they
ruffle an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Chagrine</hi> the Mind of
the Reader: From which impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he will hardly recover himself
till he meets with some Book or other
of a Contrary Spirit (whereof the
Bishop of <hi>London-Derry</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Discourse of the <hi>Inventions
of Men in the Worship of God</hi>
is a very eminent Instance) which
may serve to recompose the One, and
give him a better Opinion of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I have endeavour'd in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the present Argument to
use such Christian Temper and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:50055:4"/>
as becomes the Search of Truth,
and may argue a Mind Concern'd
only for the finding it. For of all
the ill-sorted things in Nature I
think it the most improper and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
to reason in a Passion,
especially when 'tis in defence of that
Religion which neither needs at nor
allows it. And therefore laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
all Anger and Disaffection (which
even for the advantage of well rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
ought to be laid aside) I have
set my Self to observe the Laws of
Decency as well as those of good Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
to Consider things as they
really are in their own Natures, to
represent them as I find them with all
Calmness and Sedateness, to regard
nothing but the pure Merits of the
Cause, and to treat that Party of
Men I write against with that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and Respect as may the better
dispose them to lend Attention to
<pb facs="tcp:50055:5"/>
my Arguments, Considering it as
one of the Principal Rules of the
Art of Perswasion to gain upon the
Affections of Men in order to the
Conviction of their Iudgments. And
I do not know that I am guilty of any
incivility towards the Men I deal
with, unless it be that of <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting</hi>
them. Wherein as they
are even with me, so I hope they
will not be less so in the other part,
but will treat me with the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of Civility and good Temper,
in Case they shall think fit to make
any.</p>
            <p>The Occasion of this undertaking
was a Certain late Book call'd
<hi>Christianity Not Mysterious,</hi>
one of the most Bold, daring and
irreverent pieces of Defiance to the
Mysteries of the Christian Religion
that even <hi>this</hi> Licentious Age has
produced, and which has been sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb facs="tcp:50055:5"/>
to have done great Battery and
Execution upon them, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a very shrewd and notable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
even by people of competent
Sense and Learning, not excluding
the Author himself who to shew his
good Opinion both of his Cause and
of his Management of it, has since
publish'd a Second Edition of his
Book, with <hi>inlargements,</hi> and
with his <hi>Name.</hi> To which I
thought once to have return'd a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and Formal Answer by way of
Solution of his Objections, till upon
further Consideration I judg'd it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to give an Absolute Account of
the Positive Side of the Question;
and after having laid such grounds in
it as might be made use of for the
Confutation of his Book, to make a
short Application of them in a few
Strictures upon it at the End of
Mine. But after I had laid those
<pb facs="tcp:50055:6"/>
Grounds in the Absolute part, I
found the Application of them was
so easie to the Author's Objections,
that they might as well be made by
my Reader, who might with such
readiness out of the Principles here
establish'd form an Answer to all
that deserves one in that Book, that
I thought there was no need of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
the Bulk of mine upon that
account. Which accordingly tho' I
do not call by the Name of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to <hi>Christianity Not My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious,</hi>
I cannot but reckon to
have all the Substance (though not
the Formality) of a Reply to that
Treatise, it being much the same
thing in effect either to unlock a door
for a Man, or to put into his hands
a <hi>Key</hi> that will.</p>
            <p>I write neither for Favour nor for
Preferment, but only to serve the
Cause of Christianity (for so I call
<pb facs="tcp:50055:6"/>
that of its <hi>Mysteries)</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of that Church which is so
great a Friend to it and Maintainer
of it according to its purest and most
Primitive State of Apostolical and
Evangelic Perfection. Of whose
Communion 'tis my Happiness to be a
Member, my Glory to be a Priest,
and that I had better Abilities to do
her Service, my highest Ambition.
However such as they are I humbly
devote and imploy them to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as I do this and all other my
Labours. I hope what I have
written may do some Service to
the Cause whose Defence it Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes,
and if it does, I shall not
much regard the resentments of
any Designing or not so well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Persons, Great or Little,
whose displeasure it may provoke,
tho' I have taken all due Care not to
give any body any reasonable Offence.
<pb facs="tcp:50055:7"/>
And so I Commit the following
Papers to the attentive Perusal
of the Candid and Considerate
Reader, and to the Blessing of
God.</p>

the First of those Viols

the Wicked, and usher in
the Terrours of the Great Day, shall
fall upon the Christian World, that
<hi>Christendom</hi> shall be utterly dissolv'd,
broken in pieces, and destroy'd, and
that the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be replaced and

               </gap>establish'd upon its Ruins. And, to
render it Worthy of so Sore a Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
that the generality of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
shall not only greatly depart
from the Primitive Power of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelic
Spirit, by Apostatizing from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50055:9"/>
the Purity and Perfection of both
Christian Faith and Life (which we
have already seen come to pass) but
shall even lay down their Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
renounce their very Faith and
Religion, and turn Infidels. Upon
the latter part of which Opinion those
Words of our Saviour seem to cast
a very suspicious Aspect,<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 8.</note> 
               <hi>VVhen the
Son of Man cometh, shall be find Faith
upon the Earth?</hi> As upon the Former
do also those words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 19, 20, 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>Thou
wilt say then, The Branches were broken
off, that I might be graffed in.  VVell;
because of unbelief they were broken off,
and thou standest by Faith. Be not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,
but fear. For if God spared not
the Natural Branches, take heed lest he
also spare not thee. Behold therefore the
Goodness and Severity of God: On
them which fell, Severity; but towards
thee, Goodness, if thou continue in his
Goodness. Otherwise thou also shalt be
cut off:</hi> that is, as a dead, wither'd and
unfruitful Branch, as were the <hi>Iews</hi>
for the same Reason before, and as
our Saviour tells us every unfruitful
Branch shall be.<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. And truly if one were to judge
of these Mens Opinion by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
face and state of things, one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50055:9"/>
would be inclined to think it true,
and that they had the right <hi>Key</hi> of
Prophecy in their hands. For sure
by all Signs and Appearances, the
Course of the World seems to drive
this way; and if there be such a
Fatal Revolution to come, no doubt
but that we are with large steps
hastening to it. For how are the
Vitals of Religion continually struck
at, the Foundations of it unsettled
and undermined, its venerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
disputed and ridiculed, and by
what a slender thread does Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
hang! The great Complaint
for a long while has been of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of Christian Piety, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Corruption of Manners. But
now our Religion is corrupted as
well as our Manners, and we every
day make shipwrack of our <hi>Faith</hi> as
well as of a good <hi>Conscience.</hi> So that
we have now fill'd our measure, and
are every way ripe for Destruction.
Some deny all Reveal'd Religion,
and consequently the Christian;
others allowing the Divinity of the
Religion deny that of its Author,
together with the Doctrines of the
Trinity, Incarnation and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
others again owning his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50055:10"/>
deny the necessity of Believing
it; others again granting that, and
the other Points, deny the necessity
of his Satisfaction, which is not only
resolv'd into mere <hi>Prudential</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(as formerly) instead of being
grounded upon the <hi>Essential Order</hi>
and <hi>Iustice</hi> of God, but is brought
down so low of late as to be made
an Accommodation and Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to, and a gracious Compliance
with the common Weaknesses and
Prejudices of Mankind. Thus is the
Christian Religion so mangled and
dismember'd by some, and so odly
and insidiously represented by others,
that between them both the general
Faith of the thing is indanger'd, and
a ready way prepared to <hi>Scepticism</hi>
and <hi>Infidelity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Not that I think it ought to be
any just matter of Scandal to any
considering Christians, or Prejudice
to their Holy Religion to see so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Corruptions of it, and Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Revoltings from it; since
this is no more than what the Holy
Spirit of God has often forewarn'd
us shall come to pass in the latter
days; wherein we are expresly told,
that perillous times shall come, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50055:10"/>
that Men shall resist the Truth,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.</note> be
proud and high-minded, of corrupt
minds, and reprobate concerning the
Faith. And moreover that they
shall privily bring in damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.</note>
even denying the Lord that
bought them. This therefore I say
ought in reason to be no matter of
scandal to any Christians. And so
neither ought the poor, humble,
suffering condition of Jesus Christ
to have been any to the <hi>Iews,</hi> since
this also was plainly foretold of the
Messias, and made a notable part of
his Character. And yet we find
that the Cross of Christ was a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block
to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and so no
doubt are the present sufferings, I
may say <hi>Crucifixion,</hi> of his Religion
to many Christians; the generality
of which measure the certainty of
their Faith by the firmness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of its Professors, and are apt
more to stagger and take offence at
the untoward appearance of any
Event, than to be confirm'd in their
belief from its agreement with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Prophecies.</p>
            <p>4. In the mean time what do those
<hi>without</hi> think of us! Particularly
the <hi>Heathens,</hi> among whom no doubt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50055:11"/>
there are some that neither want In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
nor Curiosity to acquaint
themselves with the present state of
<hi>Christendom.</hi> What a confirmation
must it be to these Men in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
to see Christians grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their own Religion, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to part with those great and
weighty Articles of it for which the
holy Martyrs shed their Blood, and
which could not be extorted from
them by all the might and power of
<hi>their</hi> cruel Emperours. Can it be
expected that these Men should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
a Religion which they see thus
continually deserted by its own Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples!
Or rather instead of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves to Christianity will
they not look every day when the
Christians shall come over to <hi>them!</hi>
For truly this seems to be the state
of the Christian World at this time.
We are posting as fast as we can into
Heathenism, and stand even upon
the brink of Infidelity. The great
Articles of our Religion are giving
up every day, and when Men have
parted with these, we are very much
beholden to them if they retain any
of the rest, there being nothing in
Christianity considerable enough,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50055:11"/>
when the great Mysteries of the
Trinity, Incarnation <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are taken
away, to make it appear an Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
worthy of God, or to challenge
the Assent of any thinking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Man But why do I talk
of running into Heathenism? I am
afraid we are tending further. For
as from a <hi>Socinian</hi> 'tis easie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
a <hi>Deist;</hi> so he that is once a
<hi>Deist</hi> is in a hopeful way to be an
<hi>Atheist</hi> whenever he please.</p>
            <p>5. I do not speak these things out
of a Spirit of Peevishness and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction,
as some who being full
of a Querulous Splenetick Humour,
and knowing not how better to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of it to their ease, give it vent
upon the <hi>Times,</hi> of which they are
always complaining right or wring.
No, the deplorable and dangerous
state of Christianity, and the too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
growth of <hi>Socinianism</hi> and <hi>Deism</hi>
among us extort these Reflections
from me, and have given me many
a troublesome and uneasie Thought
in my private Retirements. For my
Satisfaction under which, my best
<hi>Salvo</hi> has been to consider that God
governs the World, and that Jesus
Christ, who is the Head of his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50055:12"/>
Church, will preserve it from all
the Powers of Earth, and even from
the Gates of Hell. And that tho'
now he seems to be asleep in this
Sacred Vessel while the Tempest
rages, and the Waves beat against
it, and almost cover it, yet 'tis to be
hoped he will awake, and rebuke the
Winds and the Sea, and make all
calm and quiet again. However in
the mean time 'tis fit the Mariners
should work, and neglect the use of
no means that are necessary to the
safety of their Ship; some by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
others by private Discourse, and
all by Prayers and a good Life.</p>
            <p>6. But now whereas all Rational
Method of Cure is founded upon the
knowledge of the Cause of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
he that would contribute
any thing to the stopping this
Contagion of <hi>Religious Scepticism,</hi>
that now reigns among us, ought in
the first place to consider the Reason
of it, what it is that makes Men so
disposed to waver in their Religion,
and so ready to part with the great
Articles and Mysteries of it. Now
to this purpose I call to mind a very
considerable Observation of <hi>Descartes</hi>
concerning Atheism, which I take
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50055:12"/>
to be equally applicable to Infidelity,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the Preface to his</hi> Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical Meditat.</note>
particularly to this of the Mysteries
of the Christian Faith: The Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is this, <q>That those things
which are commonly alledged by
Atheists to impugne the Existence
of God, do all turn upon this, that
either we attribute some Humane
Affection to God, or else arrogate so
great force and penetration to our
own minds as to go about to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and determine what God
can, and ought to do. So that if
we would but carry about us this
Thought, that our Minds are to be
consider'd as Finite, but God as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
and Infinite, there
would be no further difficulty in
and of their Objections.</q> Thus that
very Acute and Judicious Person
concerning the Grounds of Atheism.
And in like manner I think it may
be said of Infidelity as to the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Christianity, That the great
Reason why so many that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Christians do so obstinately
cavil at them and dispute them, is,
that either they think too meanly of
God, or too highly of themselves;
that either they ascribe something
Humane to <hi>his</hi> Nature, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50055:13"/>
Divine to their <hi>own;</hi> that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they set too narrow limits to
the Divine Power and Greatness, or
carry out too far those of their own
understandings; in one word, that
either they <hi>Humani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> God, or <hi>Deify</hi>
themselves and their own Rational
Abilities.</p>
            <p>7. And they confess in effect as
much themselves. For the Reason
that these Men commonly give out
and pretend for their not allowing
the Mysteries of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
any room in their Creed, is,
that they are above the reach of their
Understandings. They cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them, or conceive how they
can be, and therefore will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them; having fix'd it as a Law
in the general to believe nothing but
what they can comprehend. But
now where does the Ground of this
Consequence rest at last, or upon
what Principle does it ultimately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend?
How comes the Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
of a Point of Faith to be
a presumption against it; why is its
being above their Reason in Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that it is not true? Why I say,
but only because in the first place
they attribute so much to their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50055:13"/>
Reason (at least by a Confuse Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
as to presume it to be the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Standard of all Truth, and
that nothing that is True can really
be above it. Here I say the stress of
the matter will rest at last. For
should the Argument of these Men
be reduced to a Syllogistical Form,
it must necessarily proceed thus,
<q>
                  <l>Whatever is above our Reason is not
to be believ'd as true;</l>
                  <l>But the Reputed Mysteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
are above our Reason:</l>
                  <l>Therefore the Reputed Mysteries of
Christianity are not to be believ'd
as true.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now the only contestable Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in this Syllogism is the Major,
which can be prov'd by no other
Principle than this, That our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is the Measure of all Truth, and
whose Proof must be in this Form,
<q>
                  <l>Whatever is above the Measure of all
Truth is not to be believ'd as true;</l>
                  <l>But our Reason is the Measure of all
Truth:</l>
                  <l>Therefore whatever is above our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is not to be believ'd as true.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50055:14"/>By this Analysis of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into its Principle it is plain,
that this their Reason of disbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Mysteries of the Christian
Religion, <hi>viz. Because they are above
their Reason,</hi> does at last resolve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this, <hi>That their Reason is the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of all Truth,</hi> and that they can
comprehend all things. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
how should their not being able
to comprehend a thing, be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that it is not true? This I presume
is a Principle our Adversaries
would be loth to own, and indeed
with good Reason, it being the most
extravagantly absurd and self-arrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
one that can possibly enter
the Thought, or proceed from the
Mouth of a Man. And accordinly
I do not know any <hi>Socinian</hi> that had
the immodesty in terms openly to
assert it. But this is what they must
come to if they will speak out, and
what in the mean time they do ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
and implicitly say. So then their
procedure in short seems to be this,
They first set their Reason above all
things, and then will believe nothing
that is above their Reason. And if this
be not in an unreasonable measure to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50055:14"/>
exalt that Faculty, to carry it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
its due bounds, nay to set it no
bounds at all, but strictly to make
it Infinite, and so to ascribe to it no
less than a Divine Perfection, I must
profess my despair ever to know
what is.</p>
            <p>8. To be the adequate Measure
of all Truth, so as to have no one
Truth above the comprehension of
it, is as much as can be said of the
Reason and Understanding of God
himself. His Infinite Understanding
is indeed truly and necessarily so,
and whatever is above his Reason is
for that very reason most certainly
not true. Because he essentially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
all that truly is, it must
necessarily follow that whatever he
does not comprehend must be <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
But to say the same of the
Reason of a Man, or of the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the most illuminated Angel,
would be to confound all distinction
between Finite and Infinite, God
and Creature, and to advance the
most absurd, and withal the most
impious and blaspemous Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
imaginable. And yet this is the
general Principle upon which the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50055:15"/>
Body of <hi>Socinianism</hi> turns, and by
which it would be most directly and
most compendiously confuted.</p>
            <p>9. I shall therefore take hold of
it by this handle: And since that
which is a Principle one way, as we
argue forwards from the Cause to
the Effect, may be considered as a
Consequence another way, as we
argue backwards from the Effect to
the Cause; and since there are these
two general ways of Reasoning, I
shall therefore proceed both these
wayes in the management of the
present Argument, which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shall turn chiefly upon this double
Hinge. First, I shall overturn their
Principle (I call it theirs, because 'tis
what they must at last necessarily
come to) by shewing that Humane
Reason is not the measure of Truth,
or that there may be some things
True which are above the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of Humane Reason, and that
therefore a things being above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is no concluding Argument of its
not being True. Secondly, I shall
argue <hi>ab Absurdo,</hi> by shewing that if
a things being above Reason were
an Argument of its not being True,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50055:15"/>
then it will follow that Humane
Reason is the Measure of all Truth,
which if I bring them to, I shall
think them reduced to a sufficient
Absurdity. These I intend as the
two great Pillars of this Work,
which like the sides of an Arch will
strengthen and bear up one another,
that which is liable to exception in
the former part being made out in
the latter, and that which is liable to
exception in the latter being made
out in the former. For if it be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
in the First Part whether this
be indeed their Principle, <hi>That Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Reason is the Measure of all
Truth,</hi> that will appear in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
wherein it will be shewn to
follow from their supposition. And
if it be question'd in the Second Part,
whether this their Principle be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
and so whether they are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to an Absurdity, that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the First, wherein this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
is shewn to be False.</p>
            <p>10. And when by this Method I
have shewn in general both <hi>a Priori</hi>
and <hi>a Posteriori,</hi> that a things being
above Humane Reason is of it self
no sufficient Argument of its not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50055:16"/>
true, I shall then make applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all to the Mysteries of the
Christian Religion, which I shall
shew may be true notwithstanding
their being above Humane Reason,
and so that their being above it is no
just ground to conclude them False,
and that therefore they ought to be
<hi>believed</hi> notwithstanding their being
above our Reason, which in this
case ought to be no prejudice to our
Faith, supposing them otherwise suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
revealed. Which whether
they are or no I shall not discuss,
my design at present not being to
enter into the detail of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
to <hi>prove</hi> the particular My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of the Christian Faith, such
as the Trinity, Incarnation, or the
like, but only to lay a general ground
and foundation for the belief of those
Articles, and to destroy that upon
which the Body of <hi>Socinianism</hi> stands.
The Great and General Principle of
which I take to be, That nothing is
to be believ'd as reveal'd by God,
that is above the comprehension of
Humane Reason; or, That a Man
is to believe nothing but what he
can comprehend. Which Principle I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50055:16"/>
hope by the help of God, with the
utmost Evidence and Demonstration
to overthrow. And because in order
to this I must first give a direct and
profess'd Account of <hi>Reason</hi> and
<hi>Faith,</hi> besides what will be said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
and Occasionally of them
in the Course of the Treatise, whose
main design is so to adjust and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
the Natures and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of these two things together, as
to shew the Reasonableness of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the Mysteries of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion; thereupon it is that
I intitle the whole, <hi>An Account of
Reason and Faith, in relation to the
Mysteries of Christianity.</hi> This is
the Gross of what I design, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of which will be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
laid down and accounted for
in the following Chapters.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="1" type="chapter">
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:50055:17"/>
            <head>CHAP. I. Of Reason.</head>
            <p>1. AMbiguity of Words being
one great occasion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of Thoughts; whoever will
Discourse clearly and distinctly of
any Subject, must in the first place
fix and settle the signification of his
Terms, in case they are Ambiguous;
that is, if one and the same Term be
applyed to different Ideas. In this
case, Definition of the Name is to go
before the Definition of the Thing;
between which two I conceive the
difference to be this, That in a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi>
Definition the word is only
determin'd to such a certain Idea,
whereas in a <hi>Real</hi> one, the Idea it
self is opened and explained by some
other Ideas that are supposed to be
contain'd and involv'd in it. Upon
which account it is that <hi>Nominal</hi>
Definitions are Arbitrary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
incontestable, and therefore may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50055:17"/>
be used as Principles in Discourse, as
they are in <hi>Geometry;</hi> whereas <hi>Real</hi>
Definitions are not Arbitrary, but
must be conform'd to the Nature of
things, and so are not to be taken
for Principles, whose Truth is to be
<hi>supposed,</hi> but for disputable Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whose Truth is to be <hi>proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Reason</hi> therefore being an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous
word, and of various accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
before I proceed to give an
account of the Nature of the thing
it will be necessary that I define the
Name; which will also be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>defined,</hi> if it be first <hi>distinguisht.</hi>
Now all Distinction being a sort of
<hi>Division,</hi> in which, according to the
Rules of <hi>Logick,</hi> the Distribution
ought to be into the most general,
and most immediate Members, I
shall accordingly distinguish of the
several meanings of this word, <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
by the same measure as I would
divide any whole into its parts.</p>
            <p>3. I consider therefore that the
most general distribution of Reason
is into that of the Object and that of
the Subject; or, to word it more
Intelligibly, though perhaps not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
so Scholastically, into that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50055:18"/>
of the Thing, and that of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
Reason <hi>objective,</hi> or of
the Thing, is again very various:
Sometimes it is taken for <hi>Truth,</hi> and
that both for Truth of the Thing,
namely the Essential relations that
are between Ideas, and for Truth of
the Proposition which is its confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to those Ideal Relations. Thus
it is taken the first way for the Ideal
Relations themselves, when we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether the <hi>Reasons</hi> of Good
and Evil are <hi>ab Eterno,</hi> meaning by
<hi>Reasons</hi> the Essential Relations or
Differences. Thus again it is taken
the second way, for the agreement
or conformity of a Proposition with
those Essential Relations; as when
we say, <hi>This is Sense and Reason;</hi>
meaning that the Proposition is true,
and conformable to the Nature of
things. Sometimes again it is taken
for the Medium, Argument, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
whereby as Truth is proved; as
when we say, <hi>Do you prove this by
Reason or by Authority?</hi> Sometimes
again for the Rules and Measures of
Reasoning; as suppose I should say,
<hi>That Reason is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50055:18"/>
to mean those Rules and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
whereby we ought to reason,
and so to intend a commendation of
<hi>Logick.</hi> Sometimes again it is taken
for Moderation; as when we say,
<hi>There is Reason in all things.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for Right, Equity or Justice;
the observation of which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call'd. <hi>Doing a Man Reason.</hi>
It is also taken for the End or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of an Action; as when we say,
<hi>For what Reason do you this or that;</hi> in
which sense it is used by the Poet;
<q>—stat pro Ratione voluntas.</q>
            </p>
            <p>4. Come we now to the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Reason, as 'tis taken <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively,</hi>
the other general part of
its distinction, in which also there is
some variety of Acceptation. For
it is sometimes taken for the Act,
sometimes for the Habit, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the Natural Power or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of Reasoning. For the Act;
as when we say of a Man asleep,
that <hi>he is deprived of his Reason.</hi> For
the Habit; as when we say of a
Man, that <hi>he has lost his Reason,</hi>
when his Intellectuals are mightily
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50055:19"/>
disorder'd and impair'd by a Disease.
For the Natural Power or Faculty
of Reasoning; as when we say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>That Man is a Creature indued with
Reason.</hi> Which being a Proposition
of Universal Truth, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
of Man as Man, must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
be verified of every Man, and
consequently must not be meant of
the Act or Habit of Reason, (for
these are not at all times in every
Man) but of the Natural Power or
Faculty of it, which is not lyable to
be suspended as the Act, nor lost as
the Habit, but is Essential to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man, that which constitutes
him what he is, and distinguishes
him from other Creatures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
is inseparable from him,
whether asleep or awake, whether
sick or well.</p>
            <p>5. Reason thus consider'd as it
stands for a Power or Faculty in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature, may be taken again ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
largely or strictly. Largely, for
the Power of Thinking or Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in general, whereby a Man is
capable of knowing or understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Truth, let it be by what
means, or in what order or method
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50055:19"/>
soever. Strictly, for the same Power
proceeding after a certain special
manner, and according to a peculiar
order and method, namely, from the
knowledge of one thing to that of
another, or to the knowledge of
what is, as yet, obscure and unknown,
by the knowledge of what is more
clear and better known; concerning
which a fuller account by and by.</p>
            <p>6. After having thus distinguisht,
with what exactness of order I
could, the several Acceptations of
the word <hi>Reason,</hi> I shall in the next
place define in which of these Senses
I now use it. By Reason then in this
place, I intend not Reason of the
Object, but that of the Subject; and
that not as to the Act or Habit, but
as to the Natural Power or Faculty
of Reasoning. And that again not
as it is taken strictly, as it uses a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
particular process in its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but as it is taken more at large
for the power of perceiving or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in general. According to which
Sense <hi>Reason</hi> is here the same with
<hi>Vnderstanding.</hi> And so it is often
used; as when we say, <hi>The Reason
of a Man teaches him this or that;</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:50055:20"/>
meaning his Understanding at large,
or the general Power whereby he
understands. For if <hi>Science,</hi> which
strictly taken is that particular kind
of Knowledge which is acquired by
Demonstration, be yet often used
more largely for Knowledge in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
why may not <hi>Reason,</hi> the great
Principle and Faculty of <hi>Science,</hi>
which strictly taken signifies a Power
of Knowing by such a certain way
and in such a certain manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
be taken as well in a greater
latitude, for the Power of Knowing
or Understanding in general?</p>
            <p>7. And the Nature of the Subject
and Question now under Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
requires that it should be thus
used here. For when 'tis inquired
whether there be any thing in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
above Reason, the meaning cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
can be no other than whether
there be any thing which surpasses
the Power and Capacity of a Mans
Understanding to comprehend or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for? And he that says there is
nothing in Religion above Reason,
is supposed to mean, that there is
nothing in it beyond the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a Mans Natural Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50055:20"/>
nothing but what he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
and fathom. And so also he
that says, that there are Mysteries in
Christianity, or things above our
Reason, must be presumed to mean,
that there are Reveal'd Truths that
so far exceed the measure of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Faculties and are of a size
so disproportionate to our Minds, that
with all the force and penetration of
Spirit, and the utmost application of
Thought, we cannot possibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them, be our method of
proceeding what it will. I do not
intend by this to state the Question
(which shall be done more fully in
its due place) but only to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of one of its Terms, and to
shew that by Reason I both do and
should here mean, A Mans Natural
Power of Knowing or Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in general. In which use of the
word, 'tis no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Authority to me
that the Excellent and most Accurate

he must mean the same as <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50055:21"/>8. What this Power or Principle
of Understanding is in its self, or in
its own Nature and Essence, I do not
pretend to know, as not having any
clear Idea of my own Soul, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as not knowing my self at all
by <hi>Idea,</hi> but only by a confuse Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
of internal Consciousness.
And therefore I shall not go about to
examine what it is. For the same
reason also I shall not set my self to
consider whether the Understanding
be any Power or Faculty really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the Soul, or only the Soul
it self acting after a certain manner,
this being almost as obscure as the
other; and I care not to employ ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my own Thoughts, or my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
upon things whereof I have
not any clear Conception. All that
I shall therefore further treat of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Understanding (for so I
now call our Reason) shall be with
respect to its <hi>Operations,</hi> by which
the Nature of it is best known, and
whereof we are not only Conscious
by way of <hi>Sentiment,</hi> but have also,
or at least by self-reflexion may have,
some Notion and Conception by way
of <hi>Idea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:50055:21"/>9. Now these are ordinarily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be three, <hi>Apprehension, Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>Discourse:</hi> By <hi>Apprehension,</hi>
meaning the simple view or percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a thing; by <hi>Iudgment,</hi> the
joining or separating of Ideas by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
or Negation; by <hi>Discourse,</hi>
the collecting of one thing from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And upon this threefold ground
our Systems of <hi>Logick</hi> have for a
great while proceeded with great
Agreement. But as Authentick as
Time and Consent have made this
Division, I cannot think it right,
when I compare it with what by self-reflexion
I find to pass within my
own Mind. For supposing it were
true as to the matter of it; that is,
I mean, that Judgment and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
did really belong to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
(which yet the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
of the <hi>Carcesian</hi> way will by
no means allow) yet the Form of it
must needs be very unartificial and
inaccurate. For Truth being the
general Object of the Understanding,
and there being nothing in Truth
but Ideas and the Relation that is
between them, 'tis impossible there
should be any more operations of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50055:22"/>
Understanding than <hi>Perception</hi> and
<hi>Iudgment;</hi> Perception as to the Ideas
themselves, and Judgment as to their
Relation. Which Judgment 'tis true
may be either Immediate or Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate;
Immediate when the Relations
of Ideas are judg'd of by the very
Ideas themselves, or Mediate when
they are judg'd of by the help and
means of some other Idea, but then
all this is but Judgment still, though
in two different ways, the difference
between them being the same as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
judging of a thing under the
Formality of a Proposition, and
judging of the same thing under the
Formality of a Conclusion. These
indeed are different ways of judging,
but still they are both but Judgments,
and one as much as the other. So
that in reality that which these Men
call <hi>Discourse</hi> is but a <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and if for that reason they
will consider it as distinct from Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and make it a third Operation,
they might as well have put in the
other <hi>species</hi> too (Judgment imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate)
and so made a fourth. But
then this is against the great Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Law of Division which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50055:22"/>
that one of the Members
ought not to be so included in the
other, as that the other may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
of it. Which is plainly the
Case here, this being such a kind of
Division, as if one should divide a
Living Creature into a Plant, an
Animal and a Man, and that because
Discourse is as much a Species of
Judgment as Man is of Animal.
And herein (though the matter be so
clear that I need it not) yet I happen
to have the Authority of a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Philosopher<note place="margin">Philoso. contract. <hi>p.</hi> 242.</note> on my side, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Derodon,</hi> who in these few
words expresses his Sense full and
home to this purpose; <hi>The third
Operation of the Mind,</hi> says he, <hi>is
commonly call'd Discourse, but is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
the Iudgment of the Consequent,
as inferr'd from the Iudgment of the
Antecedent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. By this it is evident, that
supposing the matter of this Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
never so true, that is, that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Discourse do appertain to
the Understanding, yet the Form of
it is wrong; Discourse, which is
here made a third member of the
Division, being contain'd under Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50055:23"/>
which is the second, as the
Species of it. But neither is the
<hi>matter</hi> of it true. For Judgment
and Discourse, or to speak more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately,
<hi>Iudgment,</hi> whether imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
or mediate, does indeed not
belong to the Understanding, but
(as will by and by appear) to the
Will. There is but one general Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that belongs to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and that is <hi>Perception.</hi> For
as I said before, Truth being the
general Object of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and there being nothing in Truth
but Ideas and their Relations, all that
the Understanding can here have to
do will be only to <hi>perceive</hi> these
Ideas, and the several Relations that
are between them. For when this
is done, then is a thing sufficiently
understood, to understand a thing
being no more than to perceive its
Ideas, and how they stand related
to one another. Here is the whole
compass and full extent of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and all that we can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
conceive by it; and he that
perceives Ideas and their Relations
understands as much of them as is
to be understood. Whereby it is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50055:23"/>
evident, that Perception is the only
operation of the Understanding, and
that it can have no other. 'Tis true
indeed there is variety in this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
it being either Simple or
Complex; Simple of the Ideas them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and Complex of their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
which latter again is either
Immediate or Mediate, (as was said
before of <hi>Iudgment</hi>) but still 'tis all
but <hi>Perception,</hi> though differently
modified; which therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
to be the only Operation that
properly belongs to the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>11. But now if all that of right
belongs to the Understanding be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
then 'tis most certain that
Judgment cannot belong to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and that because Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not Perception. For we are
said to judge as we perceive, and
some are so much in haste that they
will judge <hi>before</hi> they perceive, which
plainly shews them to be two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
things. And that they are so
this one Argument well considered
is a Demonstration, that Judgment
is a Fallible thing, that may be true
or false as it happens; whereas Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50055:24"/>
is always true, it being a
Contradiction that it should be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
For what a Man does not
truly perceive he does not perceive
at all. I conclude therefore that
Judgment is not Perception; and
since Perception is (as has been
shewn) the only opera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion of the
Understanding, I conclude again that
Judgment does not belong to the
Understanding. It must therefore
belong to the Will, which is the
proper seat both of Judgment and
of Errour too. And it is nothing
else but the Will's consenting to and
acquiescing in the Representations
that are made by the Understanding.
Which agrees well with those weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and very fruitful Maxims, <q>That
the Will is the Subject and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of all Errour as well as Sin
(which indeed ought to be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to make it culpable). That
'tis in our Power to avoid Errour
by suspending our Judgment till
the Evidence be clear, though 'tis
not in our Power to avoid Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or Non-Perception of many
things by reason of the limitedness
of our Faculties. That the fault
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50055:24"/>
of those that err is, that their
Wills run before their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
that they judge and
pronounce before they perceive,
or of things whereof they have
really no Perception, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is a great fault, and the cause
of all our disorders. That we are
accountable for our Judgments as
well as for any of our other Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And lastly, That God is not
the Cause of any of our Errours,
which with respect to him are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Negations,</hi> occasioned only by
his not having given us larger Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities;
but with respect to our
selves are <hi>Privations,</hi> proceeding
from the ill use we make of those
Natural Capacities he has indued
us with.</q> All which great and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
Truths are grounded upon
the very Principle now laid down,
(which by this may appear to be
something more than a Curiosity)
That Judgment however commonly
ascribed to the Understanding, does
yet really belong to the Will, and
not to the Understanding, whose
operations are all terminated within
the limits of Perception. So well do
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50055:25"/>
these things cohere together, and so
aptly does one Truth hang and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon another.</p>
            <p>12. But as right as I think this
Account of the matter to be, yet
considering what an innovation it is
from the Scholastic Measures, and
how like a Paradox it looks, I think
a little Countenance from Authority
may do well to counterpoise the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of Singularity. And because
this is a greater Innovation than the
precedent one, I shall back it with
an Authority proportionably greater
than what was used upon the other
occasion.<note place="margin">Recher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che <hi>de la Veritè.</hi> Liv. 1. p. 10.</note> 
               <hi>It may be well concluded
from what has been said</hi> (says a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Writer, and whom I think I
may venture to call a Philosopher)
<hi>that the Vnderstanding never judges,
since it only perceives, or since Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and even Reasonings, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Vnderstanding, are only
pure Perceptions. That 'tis the Will
alone which truly judges in acquiescing
in that which the Vnderstanding repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to it, and in voluntarily reposing
it self therein. And that also 'tis
that alone which leads us into Errour.</hi>
Again; <hi>I say then that there is no
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50055:25"/>
other difference on the part of the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
between a simple Perception,
Iudgment and Discourse, but that the
Vnderstanding perceives a simple thing
without any relation to any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
by a simple Perception. That
it perceives the Relations between two
or more things in Iudgment. And
that in fine, it perceives the Relations
that are between the Relations of things
in Discourse. So that all the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Vnderstanding are no
other than pure Perceptions.</hi> All
which he further explains and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
by an Illustration taken from
Numbers, with some other very
considerable Reflections upon it;
which for brevity's sake I leave the
curious Reader to consult in order to
his better satisfaction.</p>
            <p>13. To this Account of this most
excellent Person I fully agree as to
the substance and matter of it, only
would by his leave make some little
Alteration in the Form of it; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which he had no occasion to
be sollicitous, as not designing a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
and exact division of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Understanding; but
only to shew that they were all no
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50055:26"/>
other than pure Perceptions. And
so far his representation of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is right, and so, I suppose, will
the Form of it be too if it run thus.
The only operation of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is Perception: Which Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is either Simple or Complex.
Simple of the Ideas themselves, and
Complex of their Relations. Which
Complex Perception is again two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
Immediate or Mediate. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
when the Relations of Ideas
are perceiv'd by the perception and
collation of the very Ideas them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
whose Relations they are;
Mediate when those Relations are
perceiv'd by the help or mediation
of some third Idea, made use of as
a common measure of comparing
those Ideas which could not be so
collated together as to have their
Relations perceiv'd by themselves.
And in this, I think, we have a right
Account of the Operations of the
Understanding, both as to Matter
and Form; the knowledge of which,
considering how much <hi>Spirit</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<hi>Body,</hi> though it were only a
piece of Speculation and Curiosity,
I should think of greater worth and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50055:26"/>
consideration than that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of Lines and Figures, or any
of the <hi>Phenomena's</hi> of Nature.</p>
            <p>14. This Complex Perception, or
the Perception of the Relations that
are between Ideas, I take to be the
same with what we commonly call
<hi>Knowledge:</hi> Which is usually defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by an <hi>evident Assent,</hi> but I think
not rightly. For an evident Assent
is the same as an Assent upon Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
that is, an Assent to an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
thing, or to a thing whereof
we have an evident Perception. But
now Perception and Assent are two
things, (the former being the ground
of the latter) and 'tis in the <hi>Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
not in the <hi>Assent,</hi> that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
properly consists. For Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is most certainly an Act of the
Understanding; and it was shewn
before, that the only Operation of
that is <hi>Perception.</hi> As for Assent,
that will be found to belong to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Principle. For Assent is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than an <hi>Affirmative Iudgment;</hi>
(for then a Man is said to assent to
a thing when he judges it to be so
or so, and then to dissent when he
judges it not to be so); and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50055:27"/>
as was shewn before, belongs
to the Will. Nor is it any thing to
the contrary that we necessarily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to whatsoever we clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
This neither proves Assent
and Perception to be one and the
same, nor that Assent does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Will, but only that the
Will necessarily follows, and cannot
possibly resist the clear Light of the
Understanding; which is a great
Truth, but no Objection. Assent
therefore is always <hi>voluntary,</hi> tho'
not always <hi>free;</hi> and whether vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
or free is a plain Act of the
Will imbracing and acquiescing in
what is represented to it by the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
And therefore though
we do always assent to what we
evidently perceive, yet Knowledge
does not consist in the Assent, but in
the Perception, which is the ground
of that Assent.</p>
            <p>15. For, to push the matter a
little further, though Assent neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
follows upon clear Perception,
and cannot be separated from it, yet
sure we may use <hi>Abstraction</hi> here,
and consider Perception without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
Assent, the Idea of the one
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50055:27"/>
not including the Idea of the other.
But now I would fain know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he that clearly perceives the
Relations of things one to another,
may not be truly said to understand
or know those things? Or whether
there be any thing further requisite
to the understanding or knowledge
of a thing after a full and clear per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of it? If not, (as I think no
Man that considers what he speaks
will say that there is) then Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is supposed to be in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and perfect act of being by
Perception alone, and that before
any Assent be given; which Assent
therefore cannot go to the making
up of its Nature, since it was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be compleat without it. To
which I add, That let our Assent be
join'd with never so much Evidence,
still we are said to assent because we
know, and to what we know. So
that our Knowledge is here presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to our Assent, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is in order of Nature at least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, and therefore cannot consist
in it. I conclude therefore that
Knowledge is not <hi>evident Assent,</hi>
but <hi>Perception,</hi> particularly that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50055:28"/>
which I call Complex, the
perception of the Relations that are
between Ideas, whether as to Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Disagreement. Which, I
think, till we can meet with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
may serve for a tolerable Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Knowledge.</p>
            <p>16. But now whereas this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
Perception (as was noted above)
is either Immediate or Mediate;
hence it is that our Knowledge also
admits of the same division, being
either Immediate or Mediate, or if
you please, <hi>Intuitive</hi> or <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
Between which two the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
usually made is, that in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive
Knowledge we have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
and simultaneous view of things,
and see all at once; whereas in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative
Knowledge our pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
opens by degrees and we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
step by step, advancing from
the knowledge of one thing to that
of another. This account indeed is
true, but not explicit enough to
make it clear: For 'tis Characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from the effect only, and does
not explain how our view in Intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Knowledge comes to be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and in Demonstrative so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50055:28"/>
and progressive. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be deduced higher, and
explained by a more distinct Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And I think we shall distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
them more clearly and exactly
by saying, That <hi>Intuitive</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is when we perceive the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement of one Idea
with another immediately and by
themselves, without the mediation
or intervention of any other Idea.
<hi>Demonstrative,</hi> when this agreement
or disagreement is perceiv'd not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
by comparing the Ideas
with themselves, but mediately, by
comparing them with a third; that
is, when we perceive them to agree
or disagree with themselves, as we
find them to do so with some third
Idea, which we are oftentimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to make use of as a common
measure, because we cannot always,
by reason of the narrowness of our
Faculties, so collate and confront our
other Ideas together, as to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they agree or no by their mere
comparison.</p>
            <p>17. This Demonstrative Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is what in the Schools is call'd
<hi>Science,</hi> concerning which great stir
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50055:29"/>
is made, and variety of Definitions
given, but which by the measures
already laid down, appears to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a Mediate Perception,
or the perception of the Relations
of Ideas by the mediation of some
other Idea. This other Idea is what
we usually call a Medium or Proof,
because it is the common measure
whereby our Ideas are compared,
and the Relations between them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.
And 'tis the form and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of the Understanding using this
middle Idea as a measure whereby
to perceive the agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of the others, according
as they agree or disagree with this,
that I would call <hi>Reasoning,</hi> which
is not the very same with Science,
but the way and method to it. For
we are said to <hi>reason</hi> in order to
know, and Science is the effect of
Demonstration, according to that
known saying in Logic, <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
est Syllogismus scientiam pariens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18. If this Account of <hi>Reasoning</hi>
be not clear enough to make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
in it self, or to distinguish
it from <hi>Science,</hi> I would further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
it thus, by saying that Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50055:29"/>
(as I here consider it with respect
to the Understanding) is nothing
else but the successive Perception of
each of the extream Ideas with the
middle one, in order to perceive the
union that is between them by the
union that they have with the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Idea. As for Example: I am
to perceive that Space is Body; and
not being able to perceive this by
the immediate inspection of these
two Ideas, I call in a third to my
assistance, and proceed to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of it thus: Whatever is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
is Body; Space is extended,
therefore Space is Body. Here 'tis
plain that I perceive the union of
the two extream Ideas <hi>Space</hi> and
<hi>Body,</hi> by the successive Perception of
the union that each of them have
with the middle Idea, <hi>extended.</hi> Now
the very Perception it self of the
union of the two extream Ideas,
Space and Body, by the mediation
of the third and middle one, is what
I would call <hi>Science:</hi> For 'tis in the
Formality of this Mediate Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that I am said to <hi>know</hi> that
Space is Body. But the successive
Perception that I have of the union
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50055:30"/>
of each of these two extream Ideas
with the middle Idea in order to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the union they have among
themselves, is what I would call
<hi>Reasoning.</hi> Which certainly cannot
be the very Perception of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
it self (for that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
it with Science) and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et must
be Perception too, (or else it would
not belong to the Understanding)
and therefore can be no other than
this successive Perception that I speak
of. Whereby it may appear that
the Reasoning here specified is not
only distinct from Science, but also
from that Reasoning which consists
in illative Affirmations and Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and so is a Species of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and accordingly belongs to
the Will, not to the Understanding;
as was both remark'd and accounted
for before.</p>
            <p>19. Those things which are known
or perceiv'd by Intuitive Knowledge
we call <hi>Principles,</hi> and those things
which are perceiv'd by Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Knowledge we call <hi>Conclusions:</hi>
Which though equally certain (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Objects of Knowledge)
are yet not so clear as Principles,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50055:30"/>
which serve indeed to the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of other things, but need
none themselves, as being visible by
their own Light, and sometimes are
so evident that they are not so much
as capable of any, but are strictly
indemonstrable, there being nothing
more clear than themselves whereby
they may receive further Evidence.
We say of such Propositions, <hi>That
they are as clear as the Light;</hi> and
there is more aptness in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
than all that use it, I believe,
are aware of. For Light is seen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
and by it self, and not by
the mediation of any thing else;
whereas all other things are seen by
Light. The Light that is thus seen
by it self answers to <hi>Principles,</hi> and
those other things which are seen by
Light answer to <hi>Conclusions.</hi> And
the resemblance holds as well on the
part of the Act as of the Object:
For the first of these ways of seeing
answers to Intuition, and the last
to Demonstration. So surprising is
the agreement between Vision and
Knowledge, and so strange and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
the proportion in this as well
as in some other things between the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50055:31"/>
Sensible and the Intellectual World.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>Intuition</hi> is by far the most
perfect and excellent way of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as being more clear, more
simple, and more intire. More <hi>clear,</hi>
for here we have all Light without
any mixture of Darkness, whereas
in the other there is one dark side.
More <hi>simple,</hi> for here the Mind per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the Truth by one single View,
whereas in the other it is fain to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
its Perception. More <hi>intire,</hi>
for here again we have the prospect
lying altogether before us in its full
and whole extent, whereas in the
other it opens gradually and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
the Light stealing in upon us
more and more as we go further and
further, as it does upon. Men that
travel toward the <hi>East.</hi> To which
may be further added, that Intuitive
Knowledge supposes and proceeds
from perfection of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whose Perceptive Faculty is
hereby argued to be very bright and
clear. For it must be a very clear
Perception to perceive the Relations
of Ideas by the very Ideas them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Whereas Demonstrative
Knowledge, and the necesslty of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50055:31"/>
Reasoning in order to it, is founded
upon the narrowness of our Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Capacities, which not being
able to perceive the Truth or Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of a Proposition by the single
collation of the two Ideas that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it, are fain to make use of a
third as a common measure between
them; and so from the consideration
of something more clear and better
known, to proceed in the search of
what is more obscure and less known.
Accordingly we attribute the way
of Intuition to the most Perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
God and Angels. Though as
to Angels, I make no great doubt
but that in the Consideration of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
compounded Questions, and such
as include a multiplicity of Relations
they are fain to use Reasoning as
well as we (as in the more simple
ones we use Intuition as well as they)
though perhaps after a much more
perfect manner, and by such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
and facilitating Rules as we
know nothing of. And as they may
be supposed when they do reason, to
reason better and more expeditely
than we, so with equal probability
it may be presumed, considering the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50055:32"/>
great disproportion of Natures and
States between us, that they use In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition
in very many things wherein
we are forc'd to have recourse to
Reasoning.</p>
            <p>21. Hereafter indeed when, as the
Scripture tells us, all that is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
about us shall be done away,
and we shall be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not only
like but equal to the Angels, we
shall be able to see ('tis to be hoped)
by Intuition too; and that many
things which we here not only were
ignorant of, but thought impossible;
things that were not only above our
Reason, but, as we thought, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it. We shall not only be
able to reason better than we do
now, but shall in most things not
stand in need of any Reasoning at
all, but shall with one simple View
glance over and through the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Ideas, and so have an intire
prospect of the fair Field of Truth.
But at present we must travel it over,
and that with many a weary step,
there being but very few things that
we know by Intuition, no more than
just to give us a taste of the great
Priviledge of Heaven; and to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50055:32"/>
both our <hi>Desires</hi> and our <hi>Hopes</hi>
of that perfect State, when we shall
be so far from needing any Logic to
direct us in our reasoning, that we
shall have (in comparison) but little
need or use even of Reason it self.
But in this present state of our Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and Infirmity our Necessity of it
is very great. For our Intuition is
so short-sighted, and reaches so very
little a way, that, as, if we knew
no more than what we can by this
Means attain to, the Compass of our
Knowledge would be so very Scanty
that we should not have near light
enough to direct us in our journey
through the World. So if we would
Know more, and see to a further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from us, we must assist our
Feeble Eye by the Advantage of a
Glass. Now Reason is this Glass,
Naturally indeed a very good Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
but which <hi>Logic,</hi> and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Algebra,</hi> has improved into a
Telescope. But yet still 'tis but an
Artificial way of seeing, and all Art
supposes and argues a Defect in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And though it be a great help,
yet we know 'tis no very great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50055:33"/>
to a man's eye-sight to see
with Spectacles.</p>
            <p>22. And why then are we Proud?
And why proud of that which should
rather deject us, and make us Humble,
of our Imperfections and our Defects?
Our Natural Reason is a Mark of
our Limitation as Creatures, and our
Artificial one of our Infirmity as
Men, and both together give us but
little Light, and help us to see but a
very little way off, and that after the
most imperfect and defective Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
such as upbraids our Ignorance
at the very same time that it increases
our Knowledge, our Reason not so
much inlightning, as betraying the
Darkness of our Understandings.
Some few things indeed we know as
Angels do, by <hi>Intuition</hi> (or else we
could not so much as reason like
Men) but still the main Fund of our
Knowledge lies in the Rational and
Demonstrative kind, and we are fain
to use Clues and Chains to Conduct
our Thoughts through the infinite
Mazes and Labyrinths of Truth, to
proceed in a Train from one thing
to another, to walk step by step, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50055:33"/>
feel out our way with wariness and
Caution like Men that go in the
Dark. And such indeed is our state
in this Body and in this World. 'Tis
now a kind of <hi>Night</hi> with us, as
having for the Most part only the
Lesser Light, <hi>Reason,</hi> for our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
As for the Greater, <hi>Int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition,</hi>
we have little more of that
than of the refracted Beams of the
Sun a little before its rising, and after
its setting, enough to make a Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
a Mixture of Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but such a Mixture as is very
unequal, Darkness making the far
greater part of the Composition.
And is not this Consideration suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
(if there were nothing else) to
take down our Pride, and inspire us
with a Sentiment of the profoundest
Humility and Self-dejection. If not,
let us Consider that even this Lesser
Light that is to govern our present
Night and Darkness, does often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fail us, and suffer an Eclipse.
Let us Consider that we have a dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
side yet, and are subject to a
Much lower Dispensation. There
being many things, and those of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50055:34"/>
highest Nature, and greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
wherein our Reason is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at a loss, and cannot help us out,
and with respect to which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of <hi>Sight,</hi> we must be Content
to walk altogether by <hi>Faith.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:50055:34"/>
            <head>CHAP. II. Of Faith.</head>
            <p>1. FAith is a Term of great Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
as well as Reason,
but not to insist upon the several
Acceptations of it as it is used either
in Divine or in Humane Writings,
I shall only define in what sense I
here take it, and then proceed to such
Considerations upon it as may serve
to lay open its Nature so far as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to the Present Design.</p>
            <p>2. I do not take Faith here for
the Object of Faith, but for the Act
or Habit of Faith, and that not <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thically</hi>
consider'd, as it denotes the
Moral Vertues of Veracity, Fidelity,
Honesty and the like, but <hi>Logically,</hi>
as it signifies a certain Assent, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Perswasion of the Mind,
particularly that which is founded
upon Testimony or Authority. So
that the Generical and Common
Part of Faith is <hi>Assent,</hi> wherein it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50055:35"/>
agrees with some other Acts of the
Mind, and the more special and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
part that limits and Contracts
the General, and whereby the whole
is differenc'd and distinguish'd, is the
Motive and ground of this Assent.
'Tis it seems an Assent grounded not
upon the internal Reason and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the thing, but upon the
bare Testimony and Authority of the
Speaker.</p>
            <p>3. For I consider that there are
two general grounds of Assent, <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and <hi>Authority.</hi> That is, we
assent to a thing either because we
have some Perception or Knowledge
of it our selves, or because its Truth
is declared to us by another upon
whose Knowledge and Veracity we
think we may safely depend. If the
Reason or evidence of the thing be
imperfect and incomplete, that is, if
we perceive only in part, then we
yeild a partial and imperfect Assent,
mix'd with some Fear or Suspicion
of the Contrary, which is what we
call <hi>Opinion.</hi> But if the Evidence be
full and perfect, then we yield a firm
and most assured Assent, which is
generally distinguish'd from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50055:35"/>
by the Name of <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
which according to the common
Notion and Definition of it is an
<hi>Evident Assent.</hi> But it was shewn
before that Knowledge does not For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
Consist in the Assent, but in
the Perception which is the Ground
of the Assent. And indeed how is it
possible it should consist in any thing
else? For (to give yet a further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
to what has been already
offer'd upon this Occasion) let Assent
be never so evident, the evidence lies
in the Perception, not in the Assent,
which of it self is a blind dark Act
of the Mind, and can be said no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
to be Evident, than as 'tis
an Assent to an Evident thing, that
is, to what we <hi>perceive.</hi> But now
Perception and Assent are not only
two things, but such as belong also to
two different and distinct Faculties,
and therefore can never joyn together
to make up <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which is an Act
only of one. And indeed to speak the
truth, <hi>Evident Assent</hi> (as 'tis here
applied) seems to me a mere jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Words confusely uniting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in one Idea Operations that
belong to distinct Faculties, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50055:36"/>
to the Will and the other to
the Understanding. And how the
result of this heterogeneous Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
should be <hi>Knowledge,</hi> I must
confess to be indeed a <hi>Mystery</hi> above
my Comprehension. And besides,
after all, an Evident Assent when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
into more words will amount
to the same as an Assent to what we
know, and would it not be a Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Definition of Knowledge, to say,
that it is <hi>an Assent to what we know?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. If then Knowledge be not an
<hi>Evident Assent,</hi> and indeed as to the
Formality of it has nothing of Assent
in it, as consisting purely and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Perception, 'tis plain that this
Assent to an evident thing ought not
to be call'd <hi>Knowledge.</hi> For 'tis necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that the several Species of Assent
should all have the general Nature of
Assent in them, and consequently this
being a certain Species of Assent must
partake of the nature of Assent in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
which it cannot do if it be <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
for that were to pass over into
another Kind, Knowledge not being
Assent, but Perception. 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
most clear and evident that our
Common Systemes have here also
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50055:36"/>
gone upon a wrong ground, and that
Knowledge ought not to be put into
the Number of the Three Assents
(which are usually reckon'd to be
<hi>Faith, Opinion</hi> and <hi>Science</hi>) since the
Assent whose ground is full Evidence,
and which is the only one that may
pretend and is commonly presumed
to be <hi>Knowledge,</hi> is most apparently
not so, as differing from it no less
than in the whole kind.</p>
            <p>5. If then it be demanded by what
Name I would distinguish this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Assent to a thing when the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
is full and complete from the
former wherein the Evidence is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
not to be so perfect, I answer
that indeed (so little have these
things been Consider'd as they ought)
there is no proper Name, that I
know of, for it. When we assent to
a thing of incomplete Evidence we
call it <hi>Opinion,</hi> and when we assent
to a thing whose Evidence is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
this has been usually call'd
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> but certainly with the
utmost impropriety, knowledge, as
appears, being quite another thing.
But by what name to call it, or how
to distinguish it, I pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess I know
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50055:37"/>
not. Not for want of real difference
and distinction in the thing (for my
Thought of it is very distinct) but
merely because we want a word for
it. As we do in like manner for
Assent upon Reason in general to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
it from Assent upon Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in general. For as Assent upon
Authority in general Abstracting
from Humane or Divine is call'd
Faith, so also Assent upon Reason in
general abstracting from complete or
incomplete should be call'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
if one could tell what, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
generical Idea ought to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
by a generical Name. But
since our Language affords not any
one word that will serve to either of
these purposes we must be content
with the <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>initio</hi> instead of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum,</hi>
and express the things at
large, by saying Assent upon Reason
or Evidence, and Assent upon such
Evidence as is full and complete,
which is sufficient to distinguish it
from Assent upon evidence incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete,
though we have no one proper
word for this as we have for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is fitly call'd <hi>Opinion,</hi>
whereby we denote the imperfection
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50055:37"/>
both of the Evidence and of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p>6. But now if the Assent he <hi>not</hi>
grounded upon any internal Reason
or Evidence of the thing at all, but
only upon Testimony or Authority,
then we call it <hi>Faith.</hi> Which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be an Assent of a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Nature from the other two.
For they both agree in the general
Nature of Assent upon Evidence,
and differ only as the Evidence dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
and that is gradually, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
differs from incomplet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. But
Faith differs from them both in the
whole Kind, as having no Evidence
at all, but only Authority for its
Ground. And thus we have here a
Threefold Assent, (though not such
as is taught us in the Schools) the
Account of which in short proceeds
thus. All Assent in general is either
upon Reason or Authority. If the
Reason be incomplete then 'tis <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
If complete, then 'tis another
kind of Assent for which as yet there
wants a Name, as also there does
for Assent upon Reason in General.
But if the Assent be upon Authority
only, then 'tis <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:50055:38"/>7. Now this Authority may be
either of God or of Man. If the
Authority whereupon our Assent is
grounded be of Man, then the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
that is so grounded is <hi>Human</hi>
Faith. If of God, then 'tis <hi>Divine</hi>
Faith. Between which two there
is this in Common, that they both
proceed not upon the internal Light
and Evidence of the thing but upon
Authority, and so agree in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

               </gap>aith.
That is, the former will always be a
Fallible, and the latter an Infallible
Assent.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Human Faith</hi> (though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as actually undeceiv'd as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine)
is yet always liable to Error
and Deception, and so doubtful, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
and uncertain even when
actually true, like a Conclusion drawn
from uncertain Premisses; in which
respect it resembles <hi>Opinion,</hi> and that
so much that some have confounded
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50055:38"/>
it with it, though I think illogically
enough, since though there be a like
uncertainty in both Assents, yet they
differ extremely in their Formal
Motives, one being grounded upon
Reason, and the other upon Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
And the Distinction of these
Assents is not taken from the degree
of Certainty wherein they agree,
but from the Quality of the Motive
wherein they differ. However tho'
this makes a great difference in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it makes None in the Affairs
of Civil Life, and the Faith of him
that believes the Testimony of a
Man will as to all real intents and
purposes go for no more than his <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</hi>
And that because though
different Assents as to the Formality
of their Motives, they are yet Much
at one rate for Certainty, being both
Fallible in their Grounds, and so
subject to Error and Deception.</p>
            <p>9. But the Case is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
as to <hi>Divine Faith</hi> whose Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
stands too sure not only to
be overturn'd, but even so much as
shaken. This Faith is strictly and
Absolutely infallible, not subject to
the least Error, or Possibility of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50055:39"/>
as having the very <hi>Ground and
Pillar of Truth</hi> it self, the Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Veracity of God for its Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
than which there neither
Needs, nor Can be Greater. 'Tis
Most Certain that God is both
Actively and Passively Infallible,
his Omniscience will not suffer him
to be deceiv'd himself, and his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Veracity and Truth will not
suffer him to deceive us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that builds his Faith upon
his Authority, goes upon the Most
sure Grounds, and cannot possibly
Err in his Assent. And as he is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from Error, so he is also from
all just reason of Scruple or Fear,
and leaning upon a firm and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible
Support, may stay and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
himself upon it with full Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescence.
So that there is all the
Certainty that can be in this Faith,
both Objective and Subjective, that
of the Thing, and that of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The thing assented to is most
undoubtedly true in it self, and he
that assents to it may be most firmly
assured and perswaded of the Truth
of it in his own Mind, and among
all Temptations to Doubt and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50055:39"/>
may with great Triumph and
Confidence say with the Apostle,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 12.</note> 
               <hi>I
know whom I have believ'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. It was observ'd a little before
of <hi>Humane Faith</hi> that it resembles
<hi>Opinion,</hi> in as much as they are both
dubious and uncertain Assents, as
proceeding upon grounds of like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
though otherwise of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Natures. Now as this Faith
resembles <hi>Opinion,</hi> so in like manner
it may be observ'd of Divine Faith
that it resembles <hi>Science,</hi> or rather
that Second Assent (for so I am
forc'd to call it for want of a better
Name) which we lately discours'd
of, and plac'd between Opinion and
Faith. The Comparison here bears
the same proportion as to Certainty,
as it did in the other Case as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty.
Divine Faith has all the
Certainty that is possible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be sure as much as Science or
that Second Assent can have. There
is as much Certainty in the thing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to, and there may be as much
Assurance and firmness of Perswasion
in the Assent it self, or in other words
what a man believes upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God is in it self as certain as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50055:40"/>
what he knows, and he may also be as
Certain of it. For he that assents to a
thing upon full evidence can but assent
fully and perfectly without suspense
or hesitation, and so also can he that
assents to a thing upon Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
only. His Ground is every
whit as Firm and Sure as the others,
and why then should the Measure
of his Assurance be less? It cannot
possibly be if he Knows and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
upon what Ground he stands.
So that thus far, both in regard of
the Certainty of the Object, and the
Firmness of the Perswasion, Divine
Faith may be justly placed upon a
level with the Most Evident Assent
whatever.</p>
            <p>11. Nor I suppose will this be
thought an undue Elevation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Faith. On the Contrary I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be Complain'd of for setting
the Dignity of it at too low a Pitch
by those who say that Divine Faith
is Firmer than Science. But 'tis for
want of the Latter that these Men
so excessively ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ol the Former. I
call it excessively, because 'tis what
strictly and exactly speaking cannot
be. For what I Perceive or Know
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50055:40"/>
is even by that very supposition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably
true, (or else I cannot
be said to Know it) and what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
upon the highest Authority can
be no more. To say therefore that
Faith is Firmer than Science, is like
saying that one streight Line is
streighter than another. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
their Meaning only is, that 'tis
safer relying upon the Aut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ority of
God than upon our own Rational
Faculties, which indeed is right,
and I heartily wish all Men were
convinc'd of it. For though what I
do actually and really Know be to
the full as true and certain as what
I Believe, and I can no more be out
in one than in the other, yet it is
More Certain in the general that
God cannot deceive me, than that
my Reason cannot be deceiv'd. Not
that what I assent to by Divine Faith
can have a greater Objective Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
than what I clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
Perceive or Know, but only
that there is a Possibility, not to say
Danger, of my taking that for a
clear and distinct Perception which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndeed is Not so, and so though I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50055:41"/>
cannot be deceiv'd in what I do tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know, yet I may be deceiv'd in
thinking that I know when I do
not. So that Divine Faith though
not more Certain than Knowledge
it self, is yet of greater Certainty
than our <hi>Knowing Faculties,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
speaking the Believer goes
upon surer grounds than the Man of
Reason and Demonstration. Because
his Reason may possibly lead him
into Error, whereas the Other's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
cannot. And when they
are both in the right, yet still there
will be this difference between them,
that his Reason is only <hi>not Deceiv'd,</hi>
whereas the Other's Faith is <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. And thus far we have taken
a view of the more bright and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
side of Divine Faith, I mean
that of its <hi>Firmness</hi> and <hi>Certainty,</hi>
in respect of which it stands upon a
just level with Science. But it has
also a more dark side, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it comes short of it, and must
give it the Precedency. And I think
it may be very properly call'd a
<hi>Dark</hi> side, because it consists in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50055:41"/>
and Obscurity, and which is still
so much the darker, because 'tis so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to Faith, and makes so great
a part of its Character, being the
Main Difference that distinguishes it
from Science, or that Second Assent
before spoken of. For as to Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Certainty, therein they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
For Faith may be Firm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he that believes in God may be
supposed not in the least to hesitate
or doubt of the truth of what he
reveals. And 'tis also certain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it relies upon the most certain
Foundation, the Testimony of God,
who is Infallible himself, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deceive. And hitherto they
run parallel one to the other. But
here begins both the difference
and the disproportion, that there is
Clearness and Evidence on the side
of Science, and that Second Assent,
whereas there is none on the side of
Faith, which walks indeed upon
firm Ground, but altogether in the
<hi>dark.</hi> For he that Believes does not
give his Assent because either by
Sense or Reason he perceives the
Object of his Faith to be thus or
thus, but merely because he has the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50055:42"/>
Word and Authority of God for it.
Which though it be sufficient to
found a Firm and Certain, is yet
however not enough to beget a Clear
and Evident Assent. So that the
great and distinguishing Character
of Science and the Second Assent,
is Light and Evidence, and that of
Faith inevidence and Obscurity,
which accordingly is commonly said
to be an <hi>inevident Assent.</hi> But how
and in what sense it is so seems not
commonly to be so well understood,
and for the Consequence of what
depends upon the right stating of it,
deserves to be explain'd with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
exactness.</p>
            <p>13. In order to which we are
carefully to distinguish between the
thing believ'd, and the Reason or
Motive that induces us, to believe
it; even as in Knowledge we distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
between the thing Known,
and the Argument or Medium by
which it is Known, the <hi>Scitum</hi> and
the <hi>Formalis ratio Sciendi.</hi> The
thing Believ'd I would call the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or the Object of Faith, and the
Motive that induces me to believe
it I would call the Formal Reason
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50055:42"/>
of Faith. <hi>Aquinas</hi> I know calls
them both Objects,<note place="margin">22 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Q. 1. Art. 1.</note> and then after
distinguishes them by calling the
Former the Material Object, and
the latter the Formal Object of Faith.
Accordingly he says that <hi>the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Object of Faith is the First Truth,</hi>
meaning (as he afterward explains
himself) that Faith relies upon the
Truth of God as its Medium, or
Argument. Which Medium I chuse
rather to call (and I think more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly)
the formal Reason, than
the formal Object of Faith. Since the
Term (Object) seems more properly
to design the Matter of Faith, or
the thing Believ'd, and is hardly
applicable to the Motive or Reason
of Believing. However since we
both mean one and the same thing,
there need be no debate upon the
different manner of expressing it,
especially since if any one think his
Term more intelligible and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of the Notion intended by it,
or has any reverence for it upon any
other Consideration, he is at liberty
to substitute it in the room of the
other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:50055:43"/>
14. This necessary Distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
premised, 'tis in the first place
to be well heeded that when Faith
is said to be an obscure and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Assent, this Obscurity or ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
is not to be applied to the
formal Reason or Motive of Faith,
but only to the Matter or Object of
it. I say not to the formal Reason
of it. For as there may be in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
a clear Reason why a Man should
believe an Obscure thing, so 'tis most
Certain that the formal Reason for
which we assent to the things of
Faith is very clear. For this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Reason is no other than the
Authority of God, Or rather, since
this includes the Truth of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer
as well as the Revelation it
self (for otherwise of what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
would be the Revelation:) I
would chuse to say that the <hi>Truth</hi>
and <hi>Revelation</hi> of God do jointly
make up the formal Reason of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Faith, which accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
upon this double Principle,
1. That whatever God reveals is
true, 2. That this or that thing in
particular is reveal'd by God. For
Faith has its Reasons as well as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50055:43"/>
Science (though of another Nature)
and its Reasons are these two, as
will more distinctly, appear by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Process of Faith into a
Syllogistical Form, which will be
this.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Whatever is reveal'd by God is true,</l>
               <l>This is Reveal'd by God,</l>
               <l>Therefore this is true.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Conclusion of this Syllogism
contains both the Matter and the Act
of Faith, as it is an Assent to such a
thing upon such a ground, which is
implied by the Illative Particle,
<hi>Therefore.</hi> The two other Propositions
contain the Ground it self or
the formal Reason of Faith, which
you see consists of the double Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
before-mention'd. Now 'tis
most apparent that these two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are both of them sufficiently
clear, or at least may be so. 'Tis
clear in the first place that whatever
is reveal'd by God is true. This is
either self-evident, or may be proved
from the Idea of God, and so has
either the Light of a Principle, or
of a Conclusion, either an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50055:44"/>
or a Mediate Evidence. And
it may be also clear (and to be sure
is so whenever our Faith is well-grounded)
that such a thing in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
is reveal'd by God. And in
both these respects it is true (what
is commonly said) that <hi>Faith is the
Highest Reason.</hi> For you see it is
perfectly reasonable in its Fund and
Principle, and does at last resolve,
as much as any Mathematical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
into a rational ground of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
Light and Evidence.
With this only difference that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
in Geometry is founded upon
a Ground taken from <hi>within,</hi> from
the intrinsic Nature of the thing,
whereas our Conclusion of Faith
proceeds upon a ground taken from
<hi>without, viz.</hi> from the Authority
of God, but such as however in Light
and Evidence is no way inferiour to
the other.</p>
            <p>15. This by the way may serve
to shew the vanity and impertinence
of those who when they are to prove
that there is nothing in Christianity
above Reason, run out into a Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of Harangue about the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonables
of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50055:44"/>
and its great Accommodation
to Human Nature, crying out with
repeated importunity that Man is a
Reasonable Creature, Christianity a
reasonable Service, and Faith a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Act, nay even the <hi>Highest
Reason,</hi> and the like. As if we were
for a Blind and unaccountable Faith,
and denied the use of Reason in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or that Faith was founded
upon Reason. Or as if because there
is a Reason from <hi>without</hi> for Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
therefore the thing Believ'd
might not from <hi>within,</hi> and as to the
inward Matter of it be above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
so as not to be comprehended
or accounted for by it. But this will
cross my way again in another place,<note place="margin">Chap. 7. Artic. 9.</note>
and therefore I shall not anticipate
here what further Considerations I
may have occasion to bestow upon it
there.</p>
            <p>16. To return therefore, I say
that this Obscurity and inevidence
that is in Faith, and upon whose
account it is commonly said to be
an inevident Assent, does not belong
to its formal Reason (which you see
may be clear enough, as clear as any
Principle of Natural Science) but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50055:45"/>
only to the Matter or Object of it.
That is, in other words the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
does not lie in the Reason of
Believing, but in the Nature of the
thing Believ'd. Not that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Faith again is wholy and all
over without Evidence (for then
there would be no reason to believe
it) but only that it has no evidence
from within, and from the Nature
of the thing it self, as was remarqu'd
before. Not that this again is so to
be understood neither as if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to be believ'd were not so
much as simply intelligible as to the
very litteral sense and direct signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of its Terms. No, we are
no more to believe we Know not
<hi>what,</hi> than to believe we Know not
<hi>why,</hi> and whatever Darkness there
may be in Faith, it is still so much a
Luminous Assent, and an Act of
Reason, as to require that we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the simple Meaning of the
Proposition we are to believe, as well
as the Grounds of Credibility upon
which it Challenges our Assent. For
the general Object of Faith is Truth,
and Truth is the relation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
between Ideas, I say Ideas,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50055:45"/>
for Truth does not lie in Sounds or
Words but in Things. Therefore
to believe such a Thing to be True
is the same as to believe that there is
a Connexion between such Ideas.
But then a Man must know what
those Ideas are, or else how can he
believe they are connected. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he must understand something
more than the Terms themselves, he
must also have the Ideas of those
Terms, which is the same as to under
stand the Meaning and Signification
of them. And indeed he that has
no Idea or Conception of what he
believes, believes he knows not what,
and he that believes he knows not
what cannot be properly said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
any thing. In all Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Proposition Must be simply
intelligible, and though the <hi>Truth</hi> of
it be to be <hi>Believ'd,</hi> yet the <hi>Meaning</hi>
of it must be <hi>understood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. For we are again Carefully
to distinguish between the <hi>Meaning</hi>
of a Proposition, and the <hi>Truth</hi> of a
Proposition. The meaning of a
Proposition is only the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Ideas that are signified by
such Terms; the Truth of it is the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50055:46"/>
Union or Connexion that is between
those Ideas. Now though a Man
does not see the Connexion that is
between the Ideas of that Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he is said to Believe, yet he must
in some measure perceive the Ideas
themselves, because in believing the
Proposition he is supposed to believe
that such Ideas are so related and
Connected together. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis said that the Matter of Faith
is inevident as to the intrinsic Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing, the inevidence
must not be thought to lie in the
Ideas whereof the Proposition to be
Believ'd Consists, but in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of those Ideas, that is, not
in the <hi>Meaning</hi> of the Proposition,
but in the Truth of it, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
the Object of Faith, as the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
themselves are of Perception.
Which again by the way may serve
to discover another Instance of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency
in the Reasoning of those,
who when they are Maintaining
that there can be no Article of
Faith above Reason, divert into
pompous Flourishes and Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about the Intelligibility of the
Objects of Faith, and the utter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50055:46"/>
of Believing what is not
intelligible. As if we denied the
simple intelligibility of the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or would have Men believe
they know not what (which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
would be a strange degree
of Implicit Faith, and more Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensical
than that of the <hi>Collier</hi>) or,
as if that Proposition which is clear
enough as to its simple <hi>Meaning</hi>
might not be inevident, and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Reason, as to its Truth, or in
other words, as if Clearness of Ideas
might not consist with Obscurity of
their Connexion.</p>
            <p>18. But then it must be observ'd
again that when we say that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evidence
that is in the Matter of
Faith respects the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
not the <hi>Meaning</hi> of it, or the
Connexion of the Ideas, and not the
very Ideas themselves, this is not so
to be understood neither as if the
Matter of Faith even thus consider'd,
were Absolutely, and in its self ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
inevident, and such as could
not possibly be known without alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its Nature, and ceasing to be
any longer the Object of Faith. I
know the contrary Supposition has
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50055:47"/>
prevail'd in some Schools, where it
passes almost for <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Maxim</hi>
that Knowledge and Faith are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
Exclusive of each other, that
the same thing cannot be at once the
Object of both, and that therefore if
a thing be believ'd it cannot be
known, and if known that it cannot
be believ'd. St. <hi>Austin</hi> was of this
Opinion, and has in many places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his mind to this purpose, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in his XL Treatise of his
Exposition upon St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel.<note place="margin">Tom. 9. p. 107.</note>
And his Authority has recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it (as it did most other things) to
several of the Schoolmen, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>Aquinas,</hi> whence it has been
transmitted down among many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Writers of the Systematical
way, both Philosophers and Divines.
But we must follow Reason before
Authority, and whoever can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
with to lay the latter quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and to use the other as he ought,
will I believe clearly perceive that
nothing hinders but that the same
Proposition may be at once the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of both Faith and Science, or
that the Same thing may be at the
same time both <hi>Known</hi> and <hi>Believ'd,</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:50055:47"/>
provided it be by different Mediums,
according to the diversity of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Acts.</p>
            <p>19. For, not to enter into the
wrangle and Dust of the Schools up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Occasion, it may be sufficient
to consider that there is no manner
of Opposition between Faith and
Knowledge, or the Most evident
Assent as to the Essence of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
(that being not supposed to
be denied in the one which is Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in the other, or the contrary)
but only as to the Medium of the
Act. And that 'tis not the Absolute
Nature of the thing Believ'd, but
the Quality of the Motive that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies
Faith, and distinguishes it from
other Assents. So that 'tis no matter
what the Absolute Nature of the
thing be in it self, whether it be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
or not evident, Knowable or
not Knowable, provided it be assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to upon the proper Medium and
Motive of Faith, that is upon Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
without any respect had
to the Natural evidence of the thing,
though otherwise never so evident
in its own Absolute Nature, so as to
be the Object of Science (though
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50055:48"/>
upon a different Medium) at the
same time. For as I said before, 'tis
not the Nature of the thing, but the
Quality of the Medium that speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
Faith, and tho' the same thing
cannot have two Natures, or be in
it self at once evident and not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
yet why may it not sustain
two different Relations, or be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
in two different Mediums, so
as to be said to be known when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by its Evidence, and to be
believ'd when assented to upon Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?
Which certainly may be
done as fully, and with as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to its evidence, as if there were
no evidence in the thing at all. So
that the Evidence of the thing does
not hinder the Belief of it, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Belief not to proceed upon
that Evidence, but upon its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Medium, Authority.</p>
            <p>20. But to use a way of Arguing
less Abstract, though it may be with
some more pressing and convincing.
Suppose God should reveal to me a
<hi>Geometrical</hi> Truth, as that two Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles
having the same Base, and
being within the same Parallels, are
equal, and I who at first receiv'd
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50055:48"/>
it upon his bare Authority should
come afterwards to be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
it my self upon the known
Principles of Art, who that well
considers the Natures of these things
would say that my Science evac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my Faith, and that I ceas'd to
be a Believer assoon as I became a
<hi>Mathematician?</hi> For though I am
now supposed to <hi>Know</hi> what before
I only <hi>Believ'd,</hi> yet why should this
Knowledge destroy my Faith, since
I may still have as much regard for
the Authority of God, and as little
to the Evidence of the thing as I
had before the Demonstration, and
would still be ready to assent to it
though there were no evidence to
be produced for it, only upon the
Ground of Divine Authority. And,
to use another Sensible though not
so Artificial way of arguing, I would
fain know whether any one of those
who are of the Contrary Sentiment
would refuse a Demonstrative Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of a Reveal'd Truth, suppose
the Creation of the World, merely
for fear of injuring or destroying his
Faith, which yet he were bound in
Conscience to do, if Knowledge and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50055:49"/>
Faith were so exclusive of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and inevidence and Obscurity
were so absolutely of the Essence of
Faith as some pretend. For then it
would not be lawful to acquire the
Natural Knowledge of any reveal'd
Truth, because 'tis unlawful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
one's Faith, and every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
would have just reason to fear
all further Light and Information
about what he believes, which yet
I think would be acknowledg'd by
all an extravagant Scruple, such as
can hardly enter, much less stay long
in any Considering head; And is
withal Contrary to a plain Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Apostle, who bids us add
to our Faith <hi>Knowledge</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>21. When therefore the Matter
of Faith, as it is taken for the Truth
of the Proposition Believ'd, is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with Obscurity, and Faith it
self upon that account is said (as
it commonly is) to be of inevident
things, the Meaning ought not to
be of an <hi>Absolute,</hi> but of a <hi>Relative</hi>
inevidence. Not that what is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
is so all over dark and obscure
that it cannot (while Believ'd) ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
be known, but only that it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50055:49"/>
cannot under that Formality, and
so far as it is Believ'd, being neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
in that respect inevident, how
bright or clear soever it may be in
other respects. That is in other
words, though the thing Believ'd
absolutely consider'd may be Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
yet it is not so as Believ'd, or
in relation to Faith, because that has
no <hi>regard</hi> to the Evidence how bright
soever it may shine, but proceeds
wholy upon another Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
which and the Evidence of
the thing there is not the least Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
or Communication. The
short is, the Object of Faith simply
and absolutely speaking may admit
of Evidence, but then though it be
never so evident and demonstrable
in it self, yet as Believ'd it is always
Obscure, Faith having no regard to
the proper light and Evidence of the
thing, but only to the Testimony of
the Revealer, whose bare Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is the only Motive that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
her Assent, and the only
Ground upon which she lays the
whole weight of it, though the
Truth of the thing in it self abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
Consider'd, may also stand
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50055:50"/>
upon other Foundations, be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
accounted for by Arguments
from <hi>within,</hi> and so be seen by its
own Light. But let the Light shine
never so bright upon the Object from
other sides, Faith lets in none, nor
has any regard to that which she
finds there, but connives at it, and
walks (as I may say) with her eyes
shut, contenting her self with the
certainty of Revelation, and leaving
to Science (if there be any) the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of the thing. So that the
Object is always dark to her, how
clear and bright soever it may be in
it self, or appear, when absolutely
consider'd, to a Philosophic Eye.
In which respect it falls very short
of the Perfection of Science, though
in respect of Firmness and Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it be equal to it, as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
All which is briefly couch'd
in that excellent Account of Faith
given by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note>
when he says, that it is the <hi>Substance
of things hoped for, and the Argument
of things not seen.</hi> Where by <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
and <hi>Argument</hi> he equals it with
Science in regard of the Firmness
and Certainty of the Assent, but by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50055:50"/>
saying that 'tis <hi>of things not seen</hi> he
makes it vail and stoop to it in point
of Evidence, in which respect indeed
Faith, as Firm and as Certain as it is,
is as much inferiour to Science, as
Darkness is to Light.</p>
            <p>22. To gather up then what has
been here discours'd at large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the inevidence of Faith into
one view. When we say that Faith
is an inevident Assent we are not to
understand this inevidence of the
formal Reason of Faith, but of the
Matter of it. And when we say that
the Matter of it is inevident, we
should not intend by it that it is
wholy and all over without Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
but only that it has none
from <hi>within</hi> or from the intrinsic
Nature of the thing. And when
we say that the Matter of Faith is
inevident from <hi>within,</hi> this again is
not to be intended of the simple
Meaning of the Proposition, but of
the Truth of it. And when we say
that the Truth of it is inevident, this
again lastly is not to be understood,
as if it were always and necessarily
so in its own Absolute Nature, but
only so far forth as it is Believ'd, or
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50055:51"/>
as 'tis consider'd under the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of an Object of Faith. Or in
other words, the inevidence of the
Matter of Faith in respect of the
Truth of the Article is not an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi>
but a <hi>Relative</hi> inevidence. Not
that the Matter of Faith is Never
Absolutely and in the Nature of the
thing inevident (for it may be so
too as will be seen afterwards) but
only that it is not <hi>necessarily</hi> so, there
being no reason from the Nature of
Faith that requires it should, which
may consist with Evidence, though
it proceeds not upon it, and has no
regard to it as a Motive. So then
the formal Reason of Faith is always
Clear, the Matter of it Absolutely
consider'd may be clear or not clear,
as it happens, according as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing is, but as <hi>Believ'd,</hi>
or as Consider'd under the formality
of being the Object of Faith so it is
always inevident and Obscure, as
being not supposed to be assented to
for the sake of its Evidence (even
when it has any) but wholy upon
another Account, already sufficiently
represented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:50055:51"/>
23. And thus having struck some
Light into the Darkness of Faith, by
stating and explaining with what
exactness I could in what Sense it is
an <hi>inevident Assent,</hi> I cannot forbear
Observing by the way (though a
little of the soonest) of what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
this Account may be towards
the grand Question of Believing
things above Reason. For if Faith
be an inevident Assent so far at least
as not to respect the Evidence of its
Object, why may not a thing be
believ'd though it be above Reason?
For what though it be above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
is it therefore above <hi>Faith?</hi> Has
Faith any regard to Evidence? Or
is it determin'd by any Rational Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
I mean that is taken from the
Nature of the Object? Even when
a thing is evident, Faith is not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to assent to it because of its
Evidence, and why then may not a
thing be believ'd though it be not
evident? Some Contend that Faith
and Evidence cannot possibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
together, and according to them
Not only what is inevident may be
believ'd, but whatever is believ'd
must be inevident. But this I look
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50055:52"/>
upon, and have already shewn to
be a Mistake. And 'tis a Mistake
in the Extremity too. For I take
it to be every whit as much an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
to say that the Object of Faith
is always inevident, as to say that
it is always evident. However, it
is always inevident <hi>so far as Believ'd,</hi>
which is the Middle Point between
the two extremes. The Nature of
Faith requires at least this <hi>Relative</hi>
inevidence of the Object, whatever
it be in its own Nature, and we
need no More. For if the Object of
Faith be alwayes inevident so far as
Believ'd, then will it not follow that
it May be believ'd though inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent?
For my part I see nothing
that should hinder this Consequence,
if the Principle it proceeds upon be
right. The Principle is (and a very
moderate one sure, the generality of
Writers straining the Matter a great
deal higher) that the Object of Faith
is inevident as far as Believ'd. The
Consequence is, that therefore a thing
may be believ'd, though inevident.
'Tis true indeed one of these is an
Absolute, and the other only a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
inevidence. But this signifies
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50055:52"/>
Nothing to the Argument. For
why may not a thing really and in
it self inevident be believ'd, when
even that which is Evident is Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
by Faith as inevident? Why,
then 'tis all one (as to Faith) as if it
were so indeed; For what does the
Evidence signify, or what real alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
does it make, if Faith has no
regard to it, nor Consideration of
it? And what should hinder then
but that a thing really inevident may
be believ'd, especially if reveal'd by
God himself, and concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The short is, Faith as <hi>Faith</hi>
has no <hi>regard</hi> to Evidence (I mean
that of the thing) and Faith as <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
has no <hi>need</hi> of it, and therefore
why an inevident thing may not
be believ'd is what I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
and would be glad to Learn.</p>
            <p>24. But to return (for I look upon
this as too much a digression from the
present, and too much a Prevention of
what is to follow to be further pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued)
after having thus discours'd of
the Nature of Faith in General, and
the double Distribution of it into
Humane and Divine, with proper
Considerations upon each of them,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50055:53"/>
it remains that it be now further
consider'd that each of these may be
either <hi>Explicit</hi> or <hi>Implicit.</hi> Then
we are said to believe <hi>Explicitly,</hi>
when we believe determinately such
or such a thing in particular, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
knowing what that Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
thing is. And then <hi>Implicitly,</hi>
when we believe indeterminately
and at large whatever is proposed to
us by such an Authority, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what in particular is proposed,
or what it is we Believe. Which
though it seems to carry the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of an Assent too blind and
hood-winkt to be the act of a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Creature, may yet in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place become him as much as
the other, and indeed is every whit
as rational an Assent in its Ground
and Principle. For all Explicit Faith
is founded upon Implicit, and has
Implicit Faith in it.</p>
            <p>25. To understand both this and
the Nature of Implicit Faith the
better we are to Consider (what has
been already intimated) that Faith
proceeds upon Premisses, as well as
<hi>Science,</hi> and is the Conclusion of a
Syllogism. And I further Note
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50055:53"/>
(what perhaps may not be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the Observation of the Curious)
that the Major Proposition in Faith
Explicit is the Conclusion in Faith
Implicit, as may be seen in the Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism
before set down.
<q>
                  <l>Whatever is reveal'd by God is true,</l>
                  <l>This is Reveal'd by God,</l>
                  <l>Therefore this is true.</l>
               </q>
The Major Proposition here (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is reveal'd by God is true) is
the Conclusion of Implicit Faith,
whose act is as much to believe to
be true whatever God reveals, as
the act of Explicit Faith is to believe
that this or that in particular is so.
So that Explicit Faith proceeds upon
Implicit, borrows from it its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
for its Principle, and begins
where the other leaves off. Just as
in the <hi>Subalternation</hi> of Sciences, that
which is a Conclusion in one is a
Principle in the other, so 'tis here in
the Subalternation of these two
Faiths, whereof that which is Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
may be said to be Subalternated
to that which is Implicit. Let not
any therefore vilify or disparage Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50055:54"/>
Faith as a blind and irrational
Assent, since it lays a ground for
Explicit, which serves it self of it,
using its Conclusion as a Principle,
even as what is a Conclusion in <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry</hi>
is a Principle in <hi>Perspective.</hi>
And as Geometry is therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the Superiour Science, so
ought implicit Faith to be reckon'd
as the Superiour Faith, upon whose
Conclusion the other proceeds, and
which it self proceeds thus,
<q>
                  <l>Whatever is reveal'd by him that is
Infallible is true,</l>
                  <l>God is Infallible,</l>
                  <l>Therefore whatever is reveal'd by
God is true.</l>
               </q>
Here besides that 'tis plain to be seen
that the Conclusion of this last Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism
is the Principle of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
One, and that Explicit Faith
<hi>supposes</hi> what is <hi>proved</hi> in Implicit, it
may be further noted that Implicit
Faith (as being the highest degree
of Faith) is due only to the highest,
that is, to an Infallible Authority,
the reason why whatever is reveal'd
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50055:54"/>
by God is here Concluded to be true,
being, because he is infallible. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
then is the proper ground
of Implicit Faith, and accordingly
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> assuming to
her self the Character of <hi>Infallible,</hi>
does upon that Supposition rightly
require it. I say upon that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
for she is right enough
in her Consequence, supposing
her Principle to be true. But the
truth of it is, that is Most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
and such as carries in it
such matchless Arrogance and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
as befits only him <hi>who as
God sitteth in the temple of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself that he is God.</hi> For God
only is Infallible, and therefore he
only has right to require Implicit
Faith. And to him indeed it is due
from every one of his Creatures in
the highest Measure imaginable, as
is also <hi>Implicit Obedience</hi> upon the
same Ground. Of both which we
have a signal Example in <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 8.</note>
who when he was call'd by God to
go out into a place which he should
after receive for an Inheritance, is
said <hi>by Faith to have Obey'd, and to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50055:55"/>
have gone out, not knowing whither he
went.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>26. But now what can be more
dark and inevident than this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
Faith? Its Formal Reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is sufficiently clear, and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
at last into a Ground highly
Rational, and so may be said in that
respect to be the highest Reason.
For certainly nothing can be more
Reasonable than to believe whatever
God (who is Infallible) reveals.
There is therefore no Darkness on
this Side. Nay even the Light it
self does not shine more Clear. But
as for the <hi>Matter</hi> of it (if I may call
it so where nothing distinctly is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd)
that is sure as dark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
as can well be conceiv'd, so
dark as even to be <hi>Invisible.</hi> For
a Man to believe at large without
any restriction or limitation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
God shall propose to him, let
it be what it will, not Knowing
what that is (like <hi>Abraham</hi>'s going,
<hi>not knowing whither he went</hi>) is such
a dark and obscure act of Faith as
has nothing clear in it but the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Devotion of him who
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50055:55"/>
so believes. This is a Faith Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of God, as well as peculiar to
him, and 'tis the great inevidence
and obscurity of it that makes it so.
For so far is the Matter of it from
having any Evidence in it, that it
is not so much as Evident what the
Matter of it is. Here then is the
very Blackness of Darkness, and
he that has this <hi>infolded</hi> Faith (as
every true Believer has) and can
thus trust God in the Dark, where
he sees nothing but only the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reason of his so doing, is not
likely in any of the more explicit
instances of it to plead the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Article to excuse his
Infidelity, or to deny his Faith to
an otherwise sufficiently clear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
merely because it is above
his shallow Reason.</p>
            <p>27. Upon what has been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
discours'd it will not be difficult
to give in <hi>few</hi> words a Satisfactory
Resolution of a Celebrated Question
which among the Schoolmen has
made a great <hi>many,</hi> and that is,
whether Faith belongs to the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi>
or to the <hi>Will:</hi> It is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50055:56"/>
plain by the Measures already laid
down that it belongs to the Latter.
For Faith (as all acknowledge) is
an Assent, and Assent is a Species
of Judgement, and Judgement (as
has been shewn already) is an act
of the Will, not of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whose only Operation is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and consequently Faith is
an act of the Will consenting to,
imbracing, acquiescing and reposing
it self in what the Understanding
represents as proposed and reveal'd
by God. And indeed unless Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and consequently Faith did
belong to the Will as their proper
and immediate Principle, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to Conceive how a Man
should be blame-worthy for any of
his Opinions, or how he should
stand accountable either for Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
on the one hand, or for Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
and Heresy on the other.
For if Faith be an act of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
then since the only O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of the Understanding is
Perception, the greatest Fault of an
Infidel or a Heretic will be Non-Perception,
which indeed is not
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50055:56"/>
               <hi>Error</hi> but <hi>Ignorance,</hi> whereas Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
and Heresie are always sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to include Error, and to be
also the worst of Errors. And
this Non-perception is only a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and such as resolves into
want of Parts, which is not a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
but a Natural defect, whereas
Infidelity and Heresie (as indeed
all that is Faulty) are understood
to be Privations, and Defects of a
Moral Nature. But then to make
them so they must be voluntary
(nothing being faulty but what is
so) that is again they must be <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
that is, they must be acts of
the Will, and Consequently Faith
which is the Habit whereof those
Sins are Privations, must also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the same Principle, or else
in short there would be neither
Vertue in having it, nor Vice in
being without it. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our Saviour in upbraiding the
<hi>Iews</hi> with Infidelity does all along
not only by Confequence, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly

what I intended, and what
indeed is of greatest Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
upon this Subject of Faith.
In the account of which if I dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from any Authors of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Character that have either
professedly or occasionally writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon it, particularly <hi>Baronius</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Pearson,</hi> 'tis not that I
love to lay aside great Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or affect to be by my self,
but because I follow the best
Light of my Understanding, write
with Freedom and Ingenuity what
I think, and endeavour to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
things as they are, without
having regard to Authority any
further than I think it joyn'd
with Truth and Reason. Which
shall also be my Rule in what
remains of this Treatise. In the
Mean time what has been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
discours'd concerning Reason
and Faith may serve as a good
Preparation in order to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Great Question Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Belief of things above
Reason. But before we enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50055:57"/>
any thing of that Nature, 'tis
fit the Distinction of Above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Contrary to Reason be
Consider'd and rightly Stated,
which is the task allotted for the
next Chapter.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. The Distinction of things Contrary
to Reason, and above Reason,
Consider'd.</head>
            <p>1. THere are some Distinctions
in the World that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Difference, though Difference
be the Ground of all Distinction, and
this by some is pretended to be of
that Number, who will have the
Parts of it to be Coincident, and that
<hi>Contrary to Reason</hi> and <hi>above Reason</hi>
signifie in reality alike, and are but
different Expressions for one and the
same thing. And though they may
be reasonably suspected to do this
to serve the interest of a Cause for
whose advantage it would be to
have this Distinction taken away,
yet they have the Confidence to
Charge the same upon those that
hold it, pretending that it is only a
dextrous Shift and Evasion invented
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50055:58"/>
by Subtile Men as an Expedient to
relieve the Distress of a desperate
Argument, when there is nothing
else to be said for it.</p>
            <p>2. Which of these is the Evasion,
either the denying or the allowing
this Distinction, will best appear by
the Examination of it, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
its Serviceableness to our Clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
proceeding in what we are now
upon, I am the rather induced to
undertake, because (as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>
Observes in a little Treatise upon
this Subject) <hi>there are divers that
employ this Distinction, few that have
attempted to explain it, and none that
has taken care to justifie it.</hi> Indeed
He himself is the only Person that
I know of that has written pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
about it (and I cannot but
wonder that a thing of such Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity
and Importance should be so
little Consider'd) though I think
he has not gone to the Bottom of
the Subject, nor is sufficiently clear
even as far as he goes. However
because he has some Considerable
Observations upon it (as indeed his
Thoughts are generally very good)
and there is no reason why we
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50055:59"/>
should refuse any additional Light
in so dark and untrodden a way,
I shall for the further advantage and
illustration of the Matter first draw
up into a short view what that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Person has Meditated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, with such Occasional
Remarques as I shall think neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
and then proceed to state the
thing according to my own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
hoping that between us
both it will be sufficiently clear'd,
and that nothing of any Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
will be overlook'd that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Consideration of this so
little consider'd, and almost <hi>Virgin</hi>
Subject.</p>
            <p>3. To give you then in the first
place the Sum of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
He proposes in general two
things. 1. To declare in what
sense the Distinction is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
2. To prove that it is not
an Arbitrary or illusory Distinction,
but grounded upon the Nature of
things. As to the first he tells you
that by things <hi>Above Reason</hi> he
Conceives such Notions and Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
as Mere Reason, that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assisted
by Revelation would never
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50055:59"/>
have discover'd to us, whether those
things be to our Finite Capacities
clearly comprehensible or not. And
that by things <hi>Contrary to Reason</hi> he
understands such Conceptions and
Propositions as are not only undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
by mere Reason, but such
as when we do understand them do
evidently appear repugnant to some
Principle, or to some Conclusion of
right Reason.</p>
            <p>4. Now before I go any further I
would here by this great Man's
leave, and with due deference to
his high Character, remarque, that
though things undiscoverable by
mere Reason without Revelation
may in a Certain sense be said to be
<hi>above Reason,</hi> in as much as they
surpass the Natural ability of the
Understanding to make the first
Discovery of them, yet this is not
what Divines mean by <hi>Above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
as they use the Phrase in this
Distinction, opposing it to <hi>Contrary</hi>
to <hi>Reason.</hi> For this Distinction was
intended against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who
generally reject the Mysteries of
Faith as contrary to Sense and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to which we reply that they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50055:60"/>
are not <hi>Contrary</hi> to Reason but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Above</hi> it. They cry out that
this is no Distinction, but a mere
Shift and Evasion, pretending that
the I arts of it fall in together, and
that what is above Reason is also
contrary to it, and therefore not to
be believ'd. Now 'tis most plain
that both they that use this Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and they against whom it is
used do not. Mean by <hi>things Above
Reason</hi> such as are beyond the first
invention or Discovery of it. For
besides that to mean that our My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
are only <hi>undiscoverable</hi> when
we say they are above Reason, would
be too little a thing to oppose to
<hi>Contrary</hi> to <hi>Reason,</hi> it is also too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a thing to intend by Mystery,
since though the undiscoverableness
of them by Reason might be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
ground of their being so call'd
before their Revelation, it can be
none now after they are reveal'd.
And therefore if we say of these My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
now that they are above
Reason, we cannot be presumed to
intend it in respect of their <hi>undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verableness.</hi>
And 'tis as plain that
that our Adversaries do not so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50055:60"/>
us. For they deny that
things above Reason are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
and that because (according
to them) above Reason and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Reason are all one. But now
no <hi>Socinian</hi> that understands his own
Principle would deny the Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of things above Reason, as that
signifies only <hi>undiscoverable</hi> by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
alone, much less would he say
that what is above Reason (in that
Sense) is also contrary to it. No,
without doubt they will in this sense
both allow us the Distinction, and
the Mysteries (if they may be so
call'd) that are built upon it. But
then this plainly shews that they do
not understand it in this Sense, any
more than we.</p>
            <p>5. Instead therefore of saying <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discoverable,</hi>
he should have said <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible</hi>
by Reason. Into which
he slips unawares in the account of
the other part of the Distinction,
<hi>things Contrary to Reason,</hi> by saying
that they are such as when we <hi>do</hi>
understand them do appear repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
&amp;c. which plainly implies that
the former things that were said to
be above Reason are such as we do
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50055:61"/>
               <hi>not</hi> understand, even when disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
and not such as we are not
able only to Discover, since other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
there will be no Antithesis in
the Second part, in which there
is nothing amiss except those words
<hi>as are not only undiscoverable,</hi> which
in my judgment ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pung'd
as the Production of the first
Mistake.</p>
            <p>6. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> proceeds to illustrate
his Explanation of this Distinction
by a Comparison drawn from Sight.
He supposes a Man to be askt by a
Diver what he could see in a deep
Sea. To which the Man is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to reply that he could see into a
Sea-green Liquor to the depth of
some yards and no further. So that
if further ask't if he could see what
lies at the Bottom of the Sea, his
Answer no doubt would be in the
Negative. But then if the Diver
should let himself down to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
and bring up thence and shew
him Oysters or Muscles with Pearls
in them, he would easily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
both that they lay beyond the
reach of his Sight, and that the
Pearls were Genuin and Good. But
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50055:61"/>
if the Diver should further pretend
that each of these Pearls was bigger
than the Shells they were contain'd
in, this would be thought not only
undiscernible by the Eyes, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Informations, and to
admit this would argue the Sight
not only to be imperfect, but false
and delusory, and accordingly 'tis
presum'd that <hi>this</hi> he would not
admit.</p>
            <p>7. Now I not only allow this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
but even admire it for the
singular Aptness and Pertinency of
it to illustrate, even to the Sense, the
difference between things above and
things contrary to Reason, only I
think it seems to proceed upon the
supposition that by things above
Reason are meant such only as are
<hi>incomprehensible</hi> by it, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
would make the Comparison
much more Apposite and Exact.
Whereof he himself appears sensible
at the end of it, where offering to
consider the Matter more distinctly,
he tells you that the things above
Reason are not all of one sort, but
may be distinguish'd into two kinds
sufficiently differing from each other.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50055:62"/>
which he makes to be these, that
there are some things that Reason
by its own Light cannot <hi>Discover.</hi>
And others, that, when proposed
it cannot <hi>Comprehend.</hi> This indeed
is true, but then he should have said
so sooner, and have told us withal
that by things above Reason (as
the Phrase is used in this Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
he meant the Latter Sort only,
the Former not being to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>8. However he proceeds upon
that part First, that is, to shew that
there are divers Truths in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion that Reason left to it
self would never have been able to
find out. Of which he gives seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Instances, which as not being to
the Point, I pass over, and come to
his other Consideration of things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Reason, meaning such as when
proposed do surpass our Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
and that (as he well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves)
upon one or other of these
three Accounts, either as not clearly
<hi>Conceivable</hi> by our understanding,
such as the Infiniteness of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, or as <hi>inexplicable</hi> by us,
such as the Manner how God can
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50055:62"/>
Create a Rational Soul, or how this
being an Immaterial Substance can
act upon a Human Body, or be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon by it, &amp;c. Or else lastly as
<hi>Asymmetrical</hi> or unsociable, that is,
such, as we see not how to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
with other things evidently and
confessedly true, whereof he gives
an instance in the Case of Prescience
and Contingency.</p>
            <p>9. He further observes (and I
think rightly) that there may be
difference of degree in things above
Reason, as to their Abstruseness.
That some things appear to surpass
our understandings immediately, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before attentively lookt into.
And other things only when a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
inspection is made into them,
being intelligible enough in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as imploy'd in common
Discourse. Whereof he gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in <hi>Place, Time,</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi>
And he makes use of this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to solve a Difficulty wherein it
is pretended that we cannot profess
to believe things which we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be above our Reason, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
discovering that we do not well
consider what we say, and that we
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50055:63"/>
then talk like Parrots. To which
the substance of his Answer is, that
we may talk of those things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that Notion of them which
is more Obvious and Superficial,
though not according to that which
is Philosophical and Accurate.</p>
            <p>10. After this Explanation of
what is meant by Above Reason and
contrary to Reason he comes in the
Second place to justify the Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by shewing that it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Nature of things. And
that he does by shewing that there
is no Necessity that things above
Reason should be also Contrary to
Reason. This he shews first of
things above Reason in the first
Sense, <hi>viz.</hi> those that are undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable
by Reason alone, but this
being not the sense of Above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as it is used in this Distinction,
and since things according to this
sense above Reason are not affirm'd
by our Adversaries to be contrary
to it, I pass over all that he says
upon this part, and strike in with
him again where he shews the same
of things above Reason in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
sense. I cannot meet with any
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50055:63"/>
thing directly under that Head, but
only a few Passages here and there
scatter'd up and down. As when
he says of <hi>Galileo,</hi> that when he
first made his Discoveries with the
<hi>Telescope</hi> and said that there were
Planets that mov'd about <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
He said something that other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers
could not discern to be
true, but nothing that they could
prove to be false. And again when
he says that for a thing to be above
Reason is Extrinsecal and Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to its being true or false. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
to be above our Reason is not
an Absolute thing, but a Respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
One, importing a Relation to
the Measure of Knowledge that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to Human understanding.
And therefore it may not be above
Reason in reference to a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
Intellect &amp;c. which indeed
is rightly and very judiciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marqu'd
in it self, and no less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
to the present business. And
again when he says that there are
some things true which yet are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Objections not directly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable,
and so above Reason. He
instances in the Controversie of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50055:64"/>
Divisibility of Quantity, where each
side of the Contradiction is press'd
with unanswerable Objections, and
yet as parts of a Contradiction, one
of them must necessarily be true.
And yet take which you will you
run into invincible Difficulties.
Which indeed well concludes that
a thing that is above Reason may
yet be true, and if true then not
contrary to Reason, it being impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that what is so should be true.
Which one Consideration is indeed
enough to justifie the Distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all exception.</p>
            <p>11. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> has yet a further
Observation concerning this Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
too Considerable to be pass'd
over, and that is, that he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it to be of Importance not only
to the defence of some Mysteries of
the Christian Religion, but even of
some important Articles of Natural
Theology, in which (as he shews
by several Instances) there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Doctrins which must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
to be true, and yet whose <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
is not explainable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:50055:64"/>12. After this he Considers an
Objection wherein it is pretended
that the granting this Distinction
would be of bad Consequence, as
affording shelter to any unintelligible
stuff that a bold Enthusiast may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
under the venerable Title of a
<hi>Mystery,</hi> that is above Reason. To
which he answers very judiciously,
that he does not deny but that the
Distinction is liable to be ill imploy'd,
but that this is no other than what
is common to it with divers other
Distinctions, which are without
Scruple Admitted because useful, and
not rejected because they have not
the Priviledge that they can never
be Misapplied. And that therefore
both in reference to those other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,
and that he had been
treating of, it becomes Men to stand
upon their Guard, and strictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
how far the Doctrine proposed
as a <hi>Mystery,</hi> is intitled to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of this Distinction. Which if it
should be employ'd to justifie any
thing, that, though styl'd a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
is but a pretended one, the
Errour (as he well observes in
the Close of all) will lye, Not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50055:65"/>
in the Groundlesness of the Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but in the Erroneousness of
the Application.</p>
            <p>13. In this you have the Sum and
Substance, as briefly and as clearly
as I could represent it, of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s
Thoughts concerning things above
Reason and contrary to Reason,
which, like all his, are great and
strong, and (allowing only for those
inaccuracies taken Notice of) just
and true. And now though what
this Excellent Person has offer'd may
serve to let in a great deal of Light
into the Distinction, yet since a thing
of such Consequence if true, and so
much Contested whether true or no,
can never be made too Clear, and
sometimes a different, though not
better, Representation of a thing
may contribute to its further Illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
every Reader having his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Point of View,</hi> so as that the
very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame Notion or Truth that
does not Meet with him in one
Posture, may shine full in his Face
and strike him with success in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I shall therefore under the
Shelter of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Authority,
and by the advantage of his Light,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50055:65"/>
venture to set down my own
Thoughts concerning this weighty
Point, applying my self chiefly to
that part of it, wherein I think the
other Account Most defective.</p>
            <p>14. And first though it should be
true that to be above Reason is to be
Incomprehensible, and to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Reason is to appear repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to some Principle or Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Right Reason, yet I do not
think this of it self sufficient either
to Clear or to Justifie the Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
since it may be both again <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
what it is to be incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible,
and what repugnant, and
again <hi>disputed</hi> whether incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and repugnant be not the same,
as well as whether that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Reason be not also Contrary
to it. And then we are but where
we were before. This Account of
the Matter is then too Gross and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
to be rested in, and we must
be therefore more minute and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
in our Explanation of it, if
we would be more Clear.</p>
            <p>15. However since Generals are
to go before, and do also prepare the
way for Particulars, I shall first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50055:66"/>
the general Idea of things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Reason and contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and then particularize upon that
Idea, by opening and unfolding more
distinctly and explicitly what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in it, and by so comparing
and collating together the two parts
of the Notion as to shew the real
Difference that is between them.
So that I shall make but one work
of the <hi>Explanatory</hi> and <hi>Iustificatory</hi>
parts, supposing that there needs no
more to the Justification of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
than only to have the
Members of it well explain'd. For
if the Idea of Above Reason be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the Idea of Contrary to
Reason (as the Explanation of them
will shew that it is) then the Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
proceeds upon a real Difference,
is grounded upon the Nature of
things, and has all that is necessary
to a true and good Distinction.</p>
            <p>16. By things above Reason then
(as the Expression is used in this
Distinction) I conceive to be Meant,
Not such as Reason of it self cannot
Discover, but such as when proposed
it cannot Comprehend. And by
things Contrary to Reason I conceive
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50055:66"/>
such as it can and does actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
and that to be absolutely
Impossible. Or in other words, a
thing is then above Reason when we
do not comprehend how it can be,
and then Contrary to Reason when
we do positively comprehend that it
cannot be. Thus in the General.</p>
            <p>17. But to be a little more Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
we are to Consider upon the
first Part, that when we speak of
things above Reason, the word Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
here (as was shewn in the first
Chapter) signifies the same as <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
and there being but one
only Operation of that, namely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
by <hi>Comprehend</hi> here must be
meant the same as by <hi>Perceive.</hi> So
that when we say of things above
Reason that they are such as Reason
cannot Comprehend, 'tis the same
as to say they are such as the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
cannot Perceive. But then
when we say, <hi>Cannot Perceive,</hi> 'tis
to be carefully noted that this is not
to be understood of the literal and
Grammatical <hi>Meaning</hi> of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
as if the thing said to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Reason</hi> were perfectly unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
but only of the <hi>Truth</hi> of it,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50055:67"/>
as was observ'd before concerning
Faith. And then again when we
say that Above Reason is when we
do not Comprehend or Perceive the
Truth of a thing, this must not be
meant of not Comprehending the
Truth in its whole Latitude and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
so that as many Truths should
be said to be above Reason as we
cannot thus thorougly comprehend
and pursue throughout all their Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
and Relations to other Truths
(for then almost every thing would
be Above Reason) but only of not
comprehending the Union or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of those immediate Ideas of
which the Proposition supposed to
be above Reason consists. And which
is therefore said to be above Reason
not because the simple and direct
Meaning of its Terms is unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or because the Truth of it is not
comprehensible in its remotest and
utmost Extent, but purely because
the Connexion of its Ideas, or the
manner of it, is not discernible, and
that partly for want of sufficient
clearness of the Ideas themselves so
as to be able to perceive their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Intuitively,</hi> and partly for want
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50055:67"/>
of a due and proper Medium where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to compare them, so as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
their Union in the way of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
and <hi>Demonstration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18. 'Tis also to be Observ'd upon
the Second part of the Explanation,
that I chuse rather to say that things
contrary to Reason are such as we
Perceive to be <hi>Impossible,</hi> than such
as <hi>appear contrary to some Principle,
or some Conclusion of Right Reason.</hi>
This being the more General and
Absolute Idea, whereof the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are but Instances and Specifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For then is a thing said to be
Impossible when its Ideas cannot
stand together or be united. Which
may be either because of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Opposition and Inconsistency
of the Ideas themselves with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s
so as Mutually to Exclude each
other (as in a Contradiction) or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their inconsistency with
some other Truth, with which it
cannot Comport. Or in other words,
either because one of the Ideas can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist with the other, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the immediate opposition that
is between them, or because the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of both is inconsistent with some
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50055:68"/>
Truth or other, which therefore
will not suffer them to be United.
Which Truth will be indeed either
a Principle or a Conclusion of right
Reason. And then we are said to
<hi>Perceive</hi> a thing to be Impossible
when we perceive that its Ideas can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stand together, and that either
immediately by the very inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Ideas themselves, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by the Repugnance that they
carry to some other Truth, whether
Principle or Conclusion. Which
<hi>Repugnance</hi> I take to consist in this,
that the supposed Principle or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
cannot stand with the Union
of such Ideas, and that therefore if
such a Principle or such a Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be true (as is supposed) then such
Ideas are not United, and indeed are
as uncapable of Union, that is as
<hi>impossible,</hi> as if there were an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
inconsistency between the Ideas
themselves. So that for a thing to
be Contrary to Reason, is, in short,
for the Understanding to perceive
the Absolute impossibility of it, or
that its Ideas cannot stand together,
which it does either Immediately by
perceiving the direct inconsistency of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50055:68"/>
those Ideas, or Mediately by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
their inconsistency with some
evident and incontestable Truth or
other, whether Principle or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
For the way and method
is the same in knowing a thing to be
False or impossible as in knowing it
to be True, and accordingly as the
Process of the Understanding is either
Immediate or Mediate in the latter,
so is it also in the Former. But
though there are these different ways
of perceiving the impossiblity of
a thing, 'tis in the General Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its Impossibility and not in
the several ways of it that its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
to Reason must be made
Formally to consist; Even as it was
shewn before of Knowledge, which
is made to consist in the Perception
of the Relation of Ideas, and not
in this or that determinate manner
of perceiving it, which indeed serve
afterwards to distinguish Knowledge
into its kinds (as suppose <hi>Intuitive</hi>
and <hi>Demonstrative</hi>) but do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into its First and General Idea.
For which Consideration I think
the Perception of a things impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
does better express its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50055:69"/>
to Reason than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance
it appears to have to some
Principle or Conclusion of it, that
being only (as I said before) an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and specification (and but
one single one too) of its Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>19. So Now we are arrived to a
Clear and Distinct Conception of
things Above Reason and things
Contrary to Reason. A thing is
then above Reason when we do not
Perceive or Comprehend how it can
be. And then Contrary to Reason
when we do Perceive that it Cannot
be, or is Impossible. As to give a
plain and sensible Instance of each
of these. That the sides of an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbola</hi>
should be always approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to each other and yet never meet,
though continued to infinity; is a
Proposition of unquestion'd Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
in Geometry, and yet such as
passes the Reason of a Man to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
how it can be, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may properly be said to be one
of those things that are above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
But now that a Triangle should
have Parallel Sides, is not only above
Reason, but directly Contrary to it.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50055:69"/>
For here the Understanding is not
only at a loss to Comprehend how it
may be, but does positively and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
perceive that it cannot be, it
being utterly impossible that a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of Three Lines should have its
sides Parallel to each other.</p>
            <p>20. Now though by this Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of things above Reason and
contrary to Reason the Difference
between them is already obvious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the eye, and stares a Man in
the very Face, like things of great
inequality whose Disproportion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
at View, without Measuring
them, yet for further Satisfaction's
sake, and to make the matter as plain
as any thing in Nature to all but
those who either have not, or will
not use their Understandings, let us
a little Compare these Ideas toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
thereby the better to illustrate
their Difference.</p>
            <p>21. It is most Evident that the
Idea of things above Reason and the
Idea of things contrary to Reason
are two really distinct Ideas, and
that One is Not the Other. This
immediately appears from the very
direct View of the Ideas themselves.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50055:70"/>
For what can be More plain than
that Not to Comprehend how a
thing may be, and to Comprehend
that it cannot be, are two different
things? And what better way have
we to know the Distinction of things,
but only that the Idea of one is not
the Idea of another? But then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the Ideas of these things are
not only Formally different from
each other, but have also different
Properties and Characters belonging
to them, and such too as are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of each other, and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do manifestly shew the Ideas to
which they belong to be distinct.
For, for a thing to be above Reason
implies only a <hi>Negation,</hi> the Not
Comprehending how a thing can be,
but for a thing to be Contrary to
Reason implies the <hi>Position</hi> of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
act, the Comprehending
that it cannot be. Again, in things
above Reason the Proposition is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
not to be understood, whereas
in things Contrary to Reason, it is
supposed to be well understood, and
that to be false and impossible. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
in things above Reason the
Mind determines nothing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50055:70"/>
the <hi>Object</hi> proposed, whether it
be true or whether it be false, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be Possible, or whether it be
Impossible. All that she determines
is concerning her own <hi>Act,</hi> that she
does not <hi>Comprehend</hi> how it can be.
But whether it be or not, that she
does not affirm, but holds herself in
a perfect Suspence. But now in
things Contrary to Reason the Mind
is every whit as positive and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and does determine as boldly
and freely as in those things that are
most according to it. Whereby it
plainly appears that to be Contrary
to Reason is something more than
to be above it, and that the Mind
proceeds a great deal further in the
former than in the latter, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Soul in things above
Reason being only, <hi>How can these
things be!</hi> But in things Contrary to
Reason she is Positive and Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
roundly pronouncing, <hi>This
cannot be.</hi> So that unless there be no
difference between a Negation and
a Positive Act, between the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or Non-Perception of a thing,
and the knowing it to be False, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Suspension and a peremptory
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50055:71"/>
Determination, between a greater
and a less, 'tis most undeniably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the Parts of this Distinction
are not only really but widely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and that to be above Reason is
one thing, and to be contrary to
Reason is another.</p>
            <p>22. If it be pretended (as some
perhaps may be likely to Object)
that to be Contrary to Reason im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a Negation, as well as to be
above Reason, because it is there
supposed to be Comprehended that
the thing is False and cannot be, and
that therefore they agree in one of
the Main instances of their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
to this the Answer is Clear
and Full. I grant there is a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in one as well as the other, but
then I distinguish of Negation.
There is a Negation of the <hi>Act,</hi> and
a Negation of the <hi>Object.</hi> Contrary
to Reason does indeed imply a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Object, that is, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a Separation and dis-union of
certain Ideas, as inconsistent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible
one with another. But
it does not imply a Negation of the
Act, but the quite Contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the understanding is here
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50055:71"/>
supposed positively to comprehend
the thing, and withal the Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of it, which is not done in
things Above Reason, wherein the
Negation is that of the Act. So
that this first and great difference
between them stands firm and good.</p>
            <p>23. And now having thus far
justified the reality of this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of things Above Reason and
Contrary to Reason both by the
<hi>Explanation</hi> and <hi>Collation</hi> of the
Parts of it, which thereby appear
to consist of Ideas as different as can
well be conceiv'd, I might further
proceed to do the same by producing
some Instances of things confessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Above Reason that are also not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
as confessedly True.
For if any one thing that is Above
Reason be yet found to be true, this
plainly demonstrates the thing in
Question (if there can be yet any
Question about it) most evidently
shewing that what is Above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is not as such Contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
it being impossible that what
is Contrary to Reason should be
true, whatever is Contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
being also as Contrary to Truth.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50055:72"/>
I might also further alledge that to
be Above Reason does equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
from True and False (which
Contrary to Reason does not) and
that not only because, as I observed
before, it determines nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
its Object, but also because
'tis a thing not of an Absolute, but
of a Relative Importance, as being
an extrinsecal Denomination taken
not from the Nature of the Object
as it is in it self, but only as it is to
us, and in relation to our not only
Finite, but very Limited Capacities.
For to be Above Reason is not to be
Above Reason in general or all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
so as to be absolutely incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible,
but only Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
But then that which is Above
the Reason of a Man may not be
Above the Reason of an Angel (as
indeed what is Above the Reason of
one Man may not transcend that of
another) and what is above the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of an Angel may yet be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comprehended by God, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
and Soveraign Reason. So
that to be Above Reason here is of a
respective signification, such as does
not express the quality of the Object
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50055:72"/>
as it is in its own Nature, but only
as it is in reference to such a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Faculty, whereas to be Contrary
to Reason is not a Relative but an
Absolute thing, and whatever is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Reason, is Contrary to all
Reason, and so consequently to
Truth. I say I might further insist
on these and some other Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but being partly prevented
here by Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> (whose Account I
would have used to supply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Mine, as Mine is intended
to supply some of his) and having
so abundantly clear'd the difference
of these things already, I shall not
so far distrust either the Strength of
the Argument, or that of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
Understanding, as to prosecute
this Matter any further than only to
shape an Answer out of what has
been laid down, to an Objection
which I meet with in a Modern
Writer against <hi>Monsieur Iurieu,</hi> and
which, to do it the utmost Justice, I
will set down in his own words.</p>
            <p>24. I have Consider'd <hi>(says he)</hi> the
Distinction which they use between be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Contrary to Reason,<note place="margin">Avis Stir le Table<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </note> and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Reason. 'Tis agreed that 'tis not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50055:73"/>
possible to believe what is Contrary to
Reason. But 'tis said that we can
well believe what is above Reason. This
Distinction seems to me of no use, or
else I do not comprehend it. For if by
being above Reason it be meant that
we do not comprehend a Truth in its
whole Extent, though what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of it be clear and certain, I own
that in this sense one ought to believe
what is above Reason. But if by being
above Reason be meant a Doctrine,
wherein we see nothing Clear, a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which our Reason loses the sight
of on all its sides, I mean that all the
Propositions which may be extracted
from it appear incomprehensible, such a
one as this for example, that the three
Divine Persons make but one God,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> It seems that to be above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in this sense, is the same as to be
intirely inaccessible to Reason, which
differs nothing, but in words, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Contrary to Reason.</p>
            <p>25. I suppose whoever has duely
consider'd and well comprehended
the Tenour of the foregoing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
can neither be insensible of
the Deficiency of this Allegation,
nor be long at a loss what Answer
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50055:73"/>
to return to it. But to spare my
Reader this Trouble, My Reply is,
that this Author's Argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
upon a wrong Supposition.
He supposes here that to be <hi>Above
Reason</hi> must be either the Not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
a thing in its whole La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and extent, or the Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
Nothing at all of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
I have shewn before that 'tis nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them; That we do not mean
by Above Reason what is all over
unintelligible, even as to the very
<hi>Meaning</hi> of the Proposition, nor
what is not to be Comprehended in
its utmost extent, but only what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
to us as to the Truth
of the thing, or the Manner of it.
'Tis true indeed if the Proposition
were perfectly unintelligible, so that
(as he says) <hi>we could see nothing clear
in it,</hi> even as to the very Sense and
Meaning of it, we could no more
believe it than what is Contrary to
Reason, though even then it would
not (as this Author confusely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
pretends) be the same with
it, because what is Contrary to
Reason is supposed to be well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
But 'tis much otherwise
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50055:74"/>
if it be incomprehensible only as to
the Truth or Manner of the thing.
This as I shall shew hereafter may
very well be Beleiv'd, though what
is Contrary to Reason cannot, and
what is utterly unintelligible can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.
And I have sufficiently shewn
already that what is <hi>thus</hi> only <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible</hi>
to Reason differs, a little
more than in words, from being
contrary to it.</p>
            <p>26. And now if Humane Nature
were not a very unaccountable thing,
I should stand greatly amazed at
either the Natural or wilful Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those who are for confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things so vastly different as the
parts of this Distinction, of things
above Reason and contrary to it,
most apparently are. There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
some things which we are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
taught to distinguish, and
yet when strictly examin'd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
will be found to have no real
ground of Distinction in them. And
'tis every whit as great (and almost
as Common) a Fault to distinguish
things that do not differ, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
those that do. And there are
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50055:74"/>
also other things of such near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
and Cognation to each
other that there needs a great deal
of Art, Subtlety and nice Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to discern their Difference.
So Fine and Minute and almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible
are the Lines that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
their Natures, and divide
them from one another. But the
Ideas of these things are as different
as those of a Man and a Tree, a
Triangle and a Square, so that a
Man must wink hard not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, or be very insincere not to
acknowledge it. And I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
why those especially who are
known to serve themselves upon
occasion of Distinctions which have
no other Foundation than the mere
Will and Pleasure (unless you will
say Interest) of those that use them,
should yet reject such a Solid and
well-grounded, as well as well Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized,
one as this, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not for their turn, and, if
admitted, would like a Bomb thrown
into their Garrison, blow up and
lay wast their Main Strength, and
force them to desert and give
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50055:75"/>
up a Cause which they are (now
especially) most Zealously Fond of,
and seem resolv'd even <hi>against Reason</hi>
to Maintain.</p>
            <p>27. For I must further remarqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
(and 'tis an Observation not lightly
to be pass'd over) that if this One
Distinction of things above Reason,
and things contrary to Reason be
once admitted, or shewn to be real,
Solid and well-grounded, the main
part of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Controversie is
immediately, or at least in the very
next Consequence, at an end. For
the Reason why they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
things above Reason is because
(as they pretend) Above Reason
differs nothing in reality from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Reason, and so those things
that are above Reason are also as
much contrary to it as above it, and
what is Contrary to Reason is on
both sides acknowledg'd impossible
to be believ'd. Well, but then if
it be made appear (as I think by
this time is sufficiently done) that
these two are quite different things,
and that to be above Reason is not
the same as to be contrary to it,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50055:75"/>
then even by their own Confession
there can be no pretence why what
is above Reason may not be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd.
Which I take to be the true
inducement that makes these Men
stand out so fiercely and obstinately
against this Distinction (for they
are aware what mischief it will do
'em) as it is also the reason why I
have bestow'd so much care and
pains to clear and justifie it.</p>
            <p>28. And thus having given an
Account of these great and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
things, what Reason is,
what Faith is, and what it is to be
Above, and what Contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
we have now prepared the way
to the more full and direct Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Belief of things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Reason, the true state of which
Question by what has been hitherto
discours'd appears to be this, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we may not Assent upon the
Authority of Divine Revelation to
such things as our Understanding or
Reason cannot perceive or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
as to the Truth or Manner
of them. Or, whether our not being
able thus to Comprehend them, be a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50055:76"/>
sufficient Reason why we should not
believe them. For the Resolution
of which we have already laid the
Grounds, and shall now proceed
more directly to build upon them in
the following Chapter.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. That Human Reason is not the
Measure of Truth.</head>
            <p>1. WE have gain'd a most
wonderful Point in the
foregoing Chapter, by proving the
Distinction between things Above
and things Contrary to Reason, and
such as of it self alone is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Not only immediately to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,
but even forever to Silence the
Controversie between us and our
<hi>Socinian</hi> Adversaries concerning the
Belief of things above Reason. For
the only Objection that is or can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be pretended against the Belief
of things above Reason being the
supposed Contrariety of the same
things to Reason, if it be shewn
that to be above Reason involves
no such Contrariety, then the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against the belief of such
things is fairly and wholly remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50055:77"/>
and consequently there remains
no Reason why they may not be
Believ'd. So that I cannot but look
upon the Substance of my Work as
most effectually done already, and
those of our Adversaries that have
any reasonable Measure of Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
and Sincerity must needs be
sensible of it. And I dare appeal
even to their own Consciences whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are not. However con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the importunity of those I
have to deal with, as well as the
weight of the Cause it self, I shall
endeavour the further establishment
of it upon some other Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereby I shall also give fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Confirmation, and so repay
what I am endebted to the Point
contended for in the preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
since we may as well argue
backwards from the Believableness
of things above Reason to their not
Contrariety, as forwards from their
not Contrariety to their Believable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the Consequence being full as
good, thus, <hi>Above Reason Believa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
therefore not Contrary,</hi> as thus,
<hi>Above Reason not Contrary, therefore
Believable.</hi> Now in order to the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50055:77"/>
fuller Conviction and demonstration
of the Believableness of things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Reason I set out upon this
Ground, that <hi>Humane Reason is not
the Measure of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. 'Tis agreed among the Masters
of Reason that as all Proof ought
to be only of such things as need it,
so there are Propositions so Clear
and Evident of themselves that they
have no need of being demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that there are some again
that are not capable of Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Fulness and immediateness
of their Evidence rendring them
strictly indemonstrable. And it has
been charged by one of the most
Considerable of them as a Fault in
the Method of the <hi>Geometricians</hi> that
they set themselves to prove things
that have no need of Proof,<note place="margin">L' Art de Penser. <hi>p.</hi> 432.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he gives an Instance in <hi>Euclid,</hi>
who goes formally to work to prove
that two sides of a Triangle taken
together are greater than one, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this be most Evident even
from the Notion only of a Right
Line, which is the shortest that can
possibly be between two Points, and
the Natural Measure of Distance
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50055:78"/>
from one Point to another, which it
could not be if it were not also the
shortest of all Lines that can be
drawn from Point to Point.</p>
            <p>3. Now though I cannot say that
the Proposition of this Chapter is
so Evident of it self as not to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Demonstration, yet I must
Confess I cannot but think it of the
Number of those that do not need
any, that is I mean, to those who
will but take the Pains to consider
it with Attention, and are withal
so sincere as to say ingenuously what
they inwardly think. For to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive
or Captious Persons no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is plain (since there is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what some will contradict,
and there are those who profess to
doubt of every thing) and even the
Sun it self can't make a Man see,
if either he want eyes, or will shut
'em. I cannot therefore say that
to such men either this or any other
Proposition is plain, but I would
venture to be tried by any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and indifferent Considerer whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be not indeed a very plain
and certain Proposition, as plain as
most of those which pass for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50055:78"/>
and Maximes in Discourse,
that <hi>Human Reason is not the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Truth.</hi> And accordingly I
should justly fear incurring the same
Censure that is charged upon the
<hi>Geometricians,</hi> of going to prove
what is evident, were there not
something peculiar in the present
Case that makes it very different
from theirs. For they dealing in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of an Abstract and indifferent
Nature, and such wherein the Lusts
and Passions of men are altogether
uninteressed, have no real need to
prove evident things, because for
that very reason their Evidence is
never Contested; whereas the Point
I have now in hand being of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Concernment and such as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
the Partialities and false
Biasses of Humane Nature, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that great and governing
one of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> though it should
be of equal evidence with some of
their Maxims, will yet not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
secure from Opposition, and
pass alike uncontested. And so there
may be need of proving it, if not to
do any necessary Service to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
it self, yet to satisfie the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50055:79"/>
importunity of the Men I argue
with. Which indeed is the present
Case, since (as was intimated in
the Beginning) the Sentiment of
these Men concerning the disbelief
of things above Reason resolves at
last into this Principle, that Human
Reason is the Measure of Truth.
Which therefore both for their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and Refutation must be
shewn to be False.</p>
            <p>4. Now when I say that Human
Reason is not the Measure of Truth,
my meaning is, that it is not that
Common Standard whereby Truth
in the General is to be Measured,
so that of every thing it may be safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Concluded that it is either true or
not true according as it accords with
this Measure, as 'tis comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or not Comprehensible by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Reason. 'Tis true indeed there
is a certain Sense in which Human
Reason sometimes is, and may be
truely said to be the Measure of
Truth, in as much as whatever the
Understanding does clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
Perceive may be concluded
as most certainly true, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that a thing should be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50055:79"/>
than as we clearly perceive it
to be, without supposing our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive
Faculties to be in themselves
Naturally False, and without sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it also necessary that we
should fall into Errour even in the
right use of these Faculties (it being
impossible to conceive a More right
use of them than to Assent only to
what we clearly Perceive) which
are not only in themselves manifest
Absurdities, but such also as would
necessarily infer the Authour of our
Natures to be also the Authour of
our Errours and Deceptions. It
must therefore be admitted by all
what the Philosophers of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesian</hi>
way so earnestly stand and
Contend for, that Clearness of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is the great Rule and <hi>Crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi>
of Truth, so far that whatever
we do clearly and distinctly perceive
to be true is really in it self True.
But then this is only to be a Partial
and inadequate Rule, and in some
certain limited respect only, not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
and in general. For though
I grant that whatever we clearly
perceive is true, yet I deny that it
follows likewise Backwards, that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50055:80"/>
whatever is true we do also clearly
Perceive, and so consequently that
whatever we do not clearly Perceive
is therefore not True. By which it
is plain that this <hi>Cartesian</hi> Maxim
must be very much abused to prove
that Human Reason is the Common
and General Measure of Truth, and
I dare say the Great Authors of it
never intended it to that purpose.</p>
            <p>5. Reason or Understanding in
general may be safely said, and must
necessarily be allow'd to be the
Measure of Truth. For Truth in
general carries a necessary Relation
to understanding in general, as fully
adequate and commensurate to it.
So that all Truth is simply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
intelligible, the greatest and
sublimest Truths as much as the
least and meanest, those which the
Angels study and desire to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
as much as those which employ
the narrow Thoughts of the poorest
Rustic. The Former are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as intelligible as the latter,
and if not actually so well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
'tis not because of any incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in the Objects, but by reason of
the Disproportion of the Faculties
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50055:80"/>
that are Conversant about them.
But this disproportion must not be
Universal, nor extend throughout
the whole Order of Being. For
what is intelligible must be so to
some Understanding (since what no
Understanding can Comprehend is
the same as not to be intelligible)
and consequently there must be an
Understanding that Comprehends
all that is truly intelligible, that is,
all Truth. And accordingly it may
be truly said of this All-Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
Understanding, that it is
the Measure of Truth, so that
whatever this perfect Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
does not understand is not intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
and if not intelligible, then
also not True. Besides that it might
be further Consider'd (were this a
proper place for so Abstract and
Metaphysical a Speculation) that
Truth it Self, as to the real Nature
and Essence of it, is one and the
same with the Divine Ideas as they
are related to one another, and
does therefore exist Originally and
intirely in the Mind of God, who
is Substantial Truth, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
does Comprehend all Truth,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50055:81"/>
and so consequently is the Measure
of it. And because this All-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
Understanding is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
within the Extent of Reason
or Understanding in General, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it may be truly said also of
Reason or Understanding in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
that it is the Measure of Truth,
it being most certain that what is
above all Reason, or what no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whatsoever can Comprehend is
as much above Truth too, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly be true.</p>
            <p>6. But though it be thus neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to allow this of Reason in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
the same cannot be allow'd
of Human Reason. For whatever
is the Measure of Truth must be
fully adequate and Commensurate
to Truth. That's Certain. And
therefore if Human Reason be the
Measure of Truth it must have the
same compass and extent with
Truth, and possess it whole and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
if not Essentially and Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
as God does, yet at least Noe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
and by way of Theory, so
as to be able thoroughly to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and Comprehend all Truth.
But now that this Qualification can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50055:81"/>
possibly agree to Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(though it be somewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
that I should be put to
prove such a Proposition as this) I
hope fully to demonstrate upon a
Double Consideration, one taken
from the Nature of Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the other from the Nature
of Truth.</p>
            <p>7. And first to begin with Truth.
This, as the Most thinking and
Metaphysical Persons Conceive of
it, is supposed to consist in the
Relations of equality or inequality,
or Agreement or Disagreement.
Now we are to Consider that these
Relations may be of Three Sorts,
either such as are between Created
Beings, or such as are between In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
Ideas, or such as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Created Beings and their
Ideas. And we are also to Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that there are two General Sorts
of Truths extremely different one
from another, and therefore care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to be distinguish'd. Those
that regard only the Abstract Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of things, and their immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Essences, independently on their
actual Existence. And others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50055:82"/>
that do regard things that do
actually Exist. The former of these
Constitute that Order of Truths
which we call <hi>Necessary,</hi> the latter
that which we call <hi>Contingent.</hi> And
this double order of Truths results
from that threefold Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd.
From the first and
third Relations arise Contingent
Truths, which are nothing else but
the Relations of agreement of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
that are either between
Created Beings themselves, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Created Beings and their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas.
And these I call Contingent
Truths in opposition to those that
are Necessary and Eternal, partly
because these Relations could not
begin to exist before those Beings
were produced (it being impossible
that there should be Relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
things that are not) and
partly because these Relations might
not have existed, because those Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
might not have been produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
And as Contingent Truths
arise from the first and third, so
from the second and middle Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
result those Truths which are
Necessary, Eternal, and Immutable,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50055:82"/>
and which I understand to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the Relations of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Disagreement that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Ideas.</p>
            <p>8. I go here upon the common
and allow'd Distinction between
Necessary and Contingent Truths,
and upon the as much allow'd Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that there is such an Order
of Truths as are Necessary and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
which therefore I take for
granted as a Principle, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the trouble of proving it, but
because it is a Confess'd as well as
Evident thing, and I care not for
proving any more evident things
than I needs must. And that these
Necessary and Eternal Truths are
in this precisely distinguish'd from
those that are Contingent, <hi>that they
are the Relations that are between I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,</hi>
I think is plain from the very
Notion and Nature of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are supposed to be such
Truths as regard the Abstract Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Essences of things as they
are in Idea, and not as they have
an actual Existence <hi>in rerum Naturâ,</hi>
since then they would not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
but Contingent Truths,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50055:83"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:50055:83"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:50055:84"/>
which would be contrary to the
Supposition. And Because these Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Truths are the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
and principal sort of Truths,
as being the Ground and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Science, and the true and
proper Objects of our Theory and
Contemplation, and because for the
same Reason whenever we speak of
Truth Absolutely and in General
we are presumed to mean necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and immutable Truth, hence it
is that Truth is commonly said by
Metaphysical Writers to consist in
the Relations that are between Ideas,
though indeed this be strictly true
only of <hi>Necessary</hi> Truth. But it is
sufficient to the present purpose that
it is true of this. And so much I
suppose will readily be granted me
at least, that the general Nature and
Reason of Necessary and Eternal
Truths consists in the Relations that
are between Ideas.</p>
            <p>9. I further add that these Ideas
must be the same with the <hi>Divine</hi>
Ideas. 'Tis true indeed that exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speaking all Ideas are Divine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,
even those which we use to
call our own, it being most Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50055:84"/>
(as might easily and with the
greatest Evidence be shewn) that
the immediate Objects of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
are no other than the
Ideas of the Divine Intellect, in
which we see and contemplate all
things. But not to enter into this
sublime Speculation at present, it
will be sufficient to consider that
unless the Ideas whose Relations
Constitute those Truths which are
Necessary and Eternal be the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Ideas, it will be impossible that
Necessary and Eternal Truths should
be what we suppose they are, that
is Necessary and Eternal. For Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and Eternal Truths must be
Necessary and Eternal Relations,
and it being impossible that Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
should be more Necessary or
Eternal than the Subjects from which
they result, unless these Ideas the
Subjects of these Relations be Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and Eternal, how can their
Relations be so? 'Tis plain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that these Ideas must be Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and Eternal. But now I
pray what Ideas are so but the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine?</hi>
What is there in the whole
Compass of Being that is Necessary,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50055:85"/>
Eternal and Immutable but God and
his Divine Perfections? As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we say that these Necessary
and Eternal Truths are Relations
between <hi>Ideas,</hi> and not such as are
between either Created Entities
themselves, or between them and
their Ideas, because then they would
be of the Order of Contingent, not
of Necessary Truths, For the same
reason we must say that they are
the Relations that are between the
<hi>Divine Ideas,</hi> those only being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
steddy and Permanent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to sustain such Stable and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
Relations. And indeed
were it not for those Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Perfections of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which we call <hi>Ideas,</hi> there
would be no Necessary and Eternal
Essences to support these Necessary
and Eternal Relations, and then
there could be no such Relations,
and if no such Relations, then there
could be no Necessary Truths, and
is no Necessary Truths then no
Science Which by the way would
most Convineingly prove to any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
and Attentive Understanding
the absolute Necessity and Certainty
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50055:85"/>
of a God, as the most inmost Ground
and <hi>Central</hi> Support of the whole
Intellectual World.</p>
            <p>10. Well then it can no longer be
doubted but that these Necessary
and Eternal Truths are the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are between the <hi>Divine
Ideas.</hi> But now as these Ideas are
Infinite as being the Essential Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of God, and really identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
with his Divine Nature and
Substance, so it must necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that the Relations that result
from them, and subsist between
them must also be Infinite. And
then since these Truths do essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
Consist in, and in their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Formality are no other than
these Ideal Relations, it no less evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
follows that Truth also must
be Infinite too.</p>
            <p>11. Which also will be necessary
to Conclude upon another Account.
For I confider again that since Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
do not in reality differ as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Entities from their Subjects
and Terms (as the Relations of two
Circles supposed to be equal to each
other do not really differ from the
Circles themselves so related) these
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50055:86"/>
Ideal Relations must in the reality of
the thing be one and the same with
the Divine Ideas themselves, and
consequently with the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with which these Ideas are i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentified.
And accordingly Truth
which is the same with these Ideal
Relations must also as to the real
Essence and Substance of it be one
and the same with the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>12. And that indeed it is so may
be further, and somewhat more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
demonstrated thus. That
God is the Cause of whatever is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
himself, or, that whatever is,
is either God or the Effect of God
is a clear and acknowledg'd Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Necessary Truth then is either
God or the Effect of God. But it
is not the Effect of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it can be no other than God
himself. Now that it is not the
Effect of God, the many gross Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
which that supposition
draws after it I think will oblige him
that Considers them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
For First, if Necessary Truth
be the effect of God either it would
not be necessary, which is against
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50055:86"/>
the Supposition; or if it be, then as
being a necessary Effect it must have
a necessary Cause, that is a Cause
necessarily determin'd to act, and so
God would be a <hi>necessary</hi> Agent,
even <hi>ad extra.</hi> He would also be an
<hi>unintelligent</hi> Agent. The Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is not to be avoided. For if
Truth be the effect of God then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently
to the effecting of it, there
was no Truth, and consequently no
Knowledge, because there could be
nothing known; and so God in the
production of Truth (if indeed he
did produce it) must be supposed to
act altogether in the dark, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Intelligence. Again, if
Truth be the Effect of God, then
the Perfection of the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
must be supposed to depend
upon something that is not God,
nay upon something created by God,
whereas God is the true perfective
Object of all his Creatures, and is
himself completely Happy in the sole
Contemplation of himself. 'T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>will
follow again that God has constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an Order of Realities which he
has not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ower to abolish; that he
has made some things which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50055:87"/>
unmake again. And lastly to
add no more, If Truth be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of God then it cannot be God,
(because God cannot produce what
is Himself) and if it be not God,
then by the Supposition there will
be something Necessary, Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Eternal and Independent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
that is not God. Which last Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
as it contradicts the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and Natural Sentiment of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
so it struck so hard against a
certain very Thoughtful and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical
Head,<note place="margin">Cogit. Rational. de Deo, <hi>p.</hi> 296.</note> that he could not
forbear urging this as One Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the very Being of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Truth; because then (as he
pretends) there would be something
Necessary besides God, not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that this Necessary Truth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
one and the same with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Substance. Which one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
puts by the whole force of
his Argument against the <hi>Being</hi> of
Necessary Truth, though however
it be sufficiently conclusive of the
Point we now contend for, that this
Truth is not the <hi>Effect</hi> of God. For
if it were then his Allegation would
take place; that is, there would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50055:87"/>
be something Necessary besides
God, which though it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from the Supposition of the
<hi>Being</hi> of Necessary Truth, is yet
plainly inseparable from the other
Supposition, that of its being the
Effect of God. For then the very
next Consequence is, that there
would be something Necessary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
God, which no Religious, nor
indeed Rational Ear can bear. 'Tis
plain therefore that Truth is not the
Effect of God; and since it is not,
it remains by vertue of the premised
Disjunction that it can be no other
than the very Substance and Essence
of the Deity.</p>
            <p>13. And to this purpose I further
consider, That the whole Perfection
of the Mind does consist in its union
with God, who is her only true
Good. This seems to me a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of a very shining Evidence.
For the good of the Mind must of
necessity be something <hi>Spiritual,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
it would be of a Nature
inferiour to herself, and so not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being her Perfection. But
neither is that enough Whatever
is the good of the Mind must not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50055:88"/>
be only of a like Nature with the
Mind, that is, of a Spiritual, but
of a <hi>superiour</hi> Nature too. It must
be something above the Mind that
can be its Perfection, and that can
act upon it, and inlighten it, and
affect it with pleasing Sensations,
otherwise how can it be able to add
any thing to its better Being or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?
And in order to all this it
must also be intimately present to it,
and united with it, otherwise how
can it so act upon it? But now God
is the only Spiritual Being whom we
can possibly conceive thus qualified
to be the good or perfective Object
of our Minds. Whence it follows
that he only is so, and that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
become either more Perfect or
more Happy in any Kind or Degree
but by our Union with, and Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of God. And hence it further
follows, that Truth could not be any
Perfection of our Understandings if
it were not the same with the Divine
Essence (since that is our only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
and beatifying Object) and
that therefore since it really is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
of our Understandings, and
that in the very highest measure
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50055:88"/>
(the Understanding being then most
Perfect when it has the clearest and
the largest view of Truth) it can be
no other than the very Essence of
that Infinite Mind who is the only
true Good and Objective Perfection
of all Spirits.</p>
            <p>14. 'Tis true indeed <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
makes all Truth, even that which
is Eternal to have been positively
instituted and establish'd by God, to
depend upon him as the <hi>Summus
Legislator,</hi> to be the effect of his Will
and Pleasure, and by Consequence
to be Absolutely and Originally Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
and Contingent. So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to him 2 and 2 might not
have been 4, or 3 Angles of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
might not have been equal to
2 Right ones if God had pleas'd so
to Order it. But this Notion of this
Great Man does so rudely Shock the
Natural Sense of Mankind that it
cannot find Admission even where
the rest of his Philosophy does, but
is generally exploded notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the eminency of its Author, and
that even by one of his greatest Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche.</note>
and (as I think) by far the
Most Considerable of his Disciples.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50055:89"/>
And truly I think this Opinion is
treated no worse than it deserves,
since besides the Absurdities already
Mention'd, it shakes the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Science, yea and of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
too, by supposing the Natures
not only of Metaphysical and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Truth, but even of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Good and Evil to be of a Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Arbitrary, and Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of a Contingent Ordination. It
is therefore deservedly as well as
generally rejected, but then let those
that reject it have a Care that they
fall not into a worse Absurdity. As
they would not suppose Truth to
be of a Positive and Alterable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and that the Relations of Ideas
might have been otherwise than
they are, so let them have a Care
how they make any thing Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and Immutable that is Not
God. Let them be Consistent with
themselves, and as they justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the Opinion that makes Truth
the Effect of God's Free and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarious
Constitution, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of a Mutable and Variable
Nature, so let them own and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
(as they are Obliged to do) that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50055:89"/>
it is no other than God himself.
For there is no other way of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s Absurdity. For if
Truth be not God then 'tis the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of God, and if the Effect of God
then since the Constitutions of God
are Free and Arbitrary, the Natures
and Relations of things might have
been quite otherwise than they are,
the whole Science of Geometry
might be transposed, a Circle might
have the Properties of a Square, and
a Square the Properties of a Circle,
2 and 2 might not have been 4, or
what else you will instance in. And
so in Morality too (which is of far
worse Consequence) there might
have been the like transposition,
what is Vertue might have been
Vice, and what is Vice might have
been Vertue. These are the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Consequences of Truth's being
the Effect of Divine Constitution,
and they are intolerable ones too,
and therefore the Principle from
which they flow is by the general
Current of Writers well denied.
But then unless they proceed, and
acknowledge Truth to be one with
the Divine Essence they cannot help
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50055:90"/>
relapsing into the same or worse
Absurdities. For whoever says that
Truth is not God must say that it
is the Effect of God, and whoever
says that, must either say that 'tis
Arbitrary and Contingent, or if he
says it is Necessary and Immutable,
he must allow of something Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and Immutable that is not God.
But now it being most Evident that
there is nothing Necessary that is
not God, if Truth be not God then
'tis plain that it cannot be Necessary
(which presently runs us into the
<hi>Cartesian</hi> Absurdity of the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Position of Truth) or if it be
Necessary then 'tis as plain that it
must be God. The short is, Truth
is either God or the Effect of God.
If it be not God, then 'tis the Effect
of God as <hi>Des Cartes</hi> says. But if
not the Effect of God (as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
Absurdities from that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
demonstrate, and as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
granted) then 'tis God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as we say. It must be one or
the other, there is no Medium. To
say that Truth is God, or to say
that 'tis the Effect of God are each
of them Consistent Propositions,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50055:90"/>
though from the gross Absurdities
of the Latter the Former only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be the right, but to deny
that 'tis the effect of God and yet
not to say that it is God, that is to
affirm that 'tis neither the Effect of
God nor yet God, is all over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maintainable
and inconsistent. If
it be not the Effect of God (as is
both generally and justly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd)
then it must of Necessity be
God, since whatever is, is either
God or the Effect of God.</p>
            <p>15. And indeed if Truth be not
God how comes it to be Cloath'd
with the Glorious Ensigns of his
Majesty, to wear the Characters of
his Divinity, and to have so many
of his peculiar and incommunicable
Attributes? How comes it to be
Necessary, Immutable, Eternal,
Self-existent, Increated, Immense,
Omni-present and Independent, and
that not only upon the Conceptions
of any Minds whether Human or
Angelical, but even all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
which might never have
been made, or might now be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated
without any Prejudice to the
being of Truth, which does not
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50055:91"/>
respect the natural and actual Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stencies
but only the Abstract Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences
of things. For were there
no such thing as any real Circle or
Triangle in Nature it would still be
never the less true that their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
Essences would be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and invariable, and that such
and such distinct Properties would
belong to them. Which by the way
plainly Convinces that Truth is
none of the Effects, Works, or
Creatures of God, since it did exist
before them, does not now depend
on them, and would remain the
self-same Immutable thing without
them. But then I demand whence
has it this Self-subsistence and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency
of Being? Whence again
has it its fix'd and unalterable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
such as we can neither add
any thing to, nor diminish ought
from? How is it that it is Present
in all Places, and to all Minds, so
as to be Contemplated by them all
at the same time, and after the same
Manner? How comes it to pass that
we cannot so much as <hi>dis-imagine</hi> it,
or by way of Fiction and Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
remove it out of Being; but
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50055:91"/>
it still returns upon us with a strong
and invincible <hi>Spring,</hi> since even
the very Supposition that there is
no Truth carries a Formal Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in it whose Ideas have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Habitude to each other, and
so Contradicts it self. Besides how
comes it to be a Perfection of the
Divine Understanding? Is any thing
a Perfection to God but himself?
How comes it also to be the Rule
and Measure of his Will, which can
be determin'd by nothing but what
is just Reasonable and True? Can
any thing be a Rule to God that is
not himself? Does he Consult or
Follow any thing but what is One
with his own Divine Nature and
Essence? And yet God consults and
follows Truth, and cannot act but
according to its Immutable Laws
and Measures. It is not therefore
really distinguish'd from him, but
Coeternal and Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
with him, and
so in Consulting Truth
he Consults his own
Essence<note n="*" place="margin">Veritas immortalis est, veritas incommutabilis est, veritas illud verbum est de quo dicitur <hi>in principio erat verbum, &amp; verbum erat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ud Deum &amp; Deus erat verbum.</hi> S. Austin in Psal. 123.</note>, even the

fain know how all these incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
Attributes of God should
agree to Truth if it be any thing
less than a Divine Nature. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
I demand, whence has it
that unshakeable Firmness and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
that invincible Permanency
and Sted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>astness, that Necessity of
Existence, that utter repugnance to
Not Being, but only because it is
really Coessential and Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
with him whose Name is <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi>
and who is Being it self,
to whom it is Essential to Exist, or
rather, whose very Essence is Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence.</p>
            <p>16. But now from this Coessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
and Consubstantiality of Truth
with the Divine Nature (a Noble
and Sublime Theory, but which I
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50055:92"/>
do but lightly touch over, having
not room here to pursue it at large)
it evidently and necessarily follows
again that Truth is <hi>Infinite.</hi> There
cannot be a more immediate, nor a
more necessary, nor a more insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Connexion between any two
things than between this Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and that Principle. And
indeed if Truth were not Infinite
how can the Knowledge of God
be so? Not sure as Concretely and
Objectively Consider'd, for that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
implies the Infinity of its
Object. And what is the Object of
the Divine, or of any other Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
but Truth? And should
Knowledge here be taken for the
Power or Faculty of Knowing, to
what purpose is an Infinite Power
of Knowing unless there be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
to be Known? And would
not such a Power be uneasie and
afflictive, as well as useless, to him
that had it, unless the Object be
supposed to carry due Proportion to
it: For if it be so uneasie a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
to some of us to have such
short and narrow Faculties when
the Compass of Truth has so large
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50055:93"/>
and spatious an extent, to be able
to know so little when there is so
much to be known, how much more
troublesom and painful would it be
to the Supreme Intelligence to have
an Infinite Understanding when all
that is intelligible is but Finite?
Would not that Infinity of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
serve to vex and disquiet him
more than the Narrowness of ours
does us, the difference being as much
as between having a great Stomach
and but little Meat, and a little Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
when there is a great deal of
Meat, whereof which is the greatest
Punishment is Obvious to imagine.
And we may judge of this in some
measure by our selves. We have in us a
Capacity boundless and unlimited. For
tho' our Understandings be Finite,
our Wills know no Measure, and
are in a manner Infinite. As God has
made us capable of enjoying an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Good, so Nothing less than
that can satisfie our Desires. For
we desire Good as Good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
all possible Good. Now
we find this to be a great Pain to
us at present to desire an Infinite
Good when all that we can enjoy
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50055:93"/>
here is Finite. The greatest part
of the Uneasiness, the Melancholy,
the Disconsolateness, the Aridity
that accompanies Human Life will
be found, if traced to the Original,
to proceed from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> from
the little proportion that is between
our Capacities and our Gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
between what is desired and
what is enjoy'd. And this Desire
of an Infinite Good will be a far
greater Punishment to us Hereafter
when the Activity of our Faculties
shall be more invigorated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd,
if we have not then an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Good to enjoy. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Twill be at
least the worst ingredient of Hell
and Damnation, if not all that is to
be understood by it. And yet we are
still to Consider that our Will is
In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nite only <hi>Ex parte Objecti,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it desires an Infinite Good, and
not <hi>Ex parte Actûs</hi> because it desires
it infinitely or with an unlimited
Force and Activity. For 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that a Finite Nature should
have any Power or Force in it
that is strictly infinite, or that any
such Act or Operation should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from it. But then what would
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50055:94"/>
the Affliction be if the Act were
Infinite as well as the Object, and
we were to aspire after an Infinite
Good with an Infinite Desire! What
Conception can Frame a just Idea
of the Misery of such a State! And
can it be much less for an Infinite
Intelligence to have only a Finite
Intelligible for its Object? But there
is Nothing Painful or Afflictive in
the Condition of the Supremely and
Completely Blessed. And therefore
we must Conclude that as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Will of God has a Good fully
Commensurate and Adequate to its
unlimited Activity, whereon it
may Center and Repose its Weight,
so the Infinite Understanding of God
has also an Infinite <hi>Intelligible</hi> for
its Object. And since the Formal
Object of Understanding in General,
and Consequently of the Divine, is
Truth (as that of the Will is Good)
hence it follows again that Truth
must needs be of an Infinite Nature.</p>
            <p>17. And do we not find it so
when we Convert our selves to it
by Study and Meditation? When
we apply our Minds to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of Truth, and set our
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50055:94"/>
selves to muse and think, do we not
find that we launch forth into a
vast intelligible Sea, that has neither
Bottom nor Shore? And the more
we think and the more we Meditate
are we not still more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of this, and do we not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the further we go in our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Progress, that there still lies
more and more beyond us, so that
the more we advance in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Truth the more we inlarge
Our Idea of it, as the greatest Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
think most Magnificently of
the World? Do we not find as in
a Spatious Campaigne, so in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
Field of Truth, that our Eye
wearies, and our Sight loses it self in
the boundless Prospect, and that
besides the clear view which we
have of a few things at a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from us, there lie all round
us vast Tracts unmeasurably diffused,
whereof we have only Confuse and
indistinct Images, like the Faint
Blew of the far distant Hills? Are
not the Relations and Combinations
of things with one another Infinite,
and should but one link in this End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Chain be alter'd would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50055:95"/>
Alterations ensue upon
it? Should but One Proposition that
is False be supposed True, or One
that is True be supposed False, what
Understanding but the Divine could
go on with the Train of New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
that would result from
such a Supposition? I say <hi>New</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
For we are to consider
that besides the <hi>Absolute Systeme</hi> of
Truth which contains the Relations
of Ideas with their settled Coheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Dependencies one upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
according as they really stand
in their Natural Order, there is a
Secondary Systeme of Truth which
I may call <hi>Hypothetical,</hi> that results
from any supposed Change made in
the Absolute Systeme, whence will
still arise new and new Consequences
even to Infinity. But not to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Hypothetical Truth, can the
Bounds of that which is Absolute
be ever fix'd, or its Stock ever Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted?
Does it not after all the
Study that has been employ'd about
it, and the Numberless Number of
Volumns that have been written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it furnish perpetual matter for
our Contemplation, and is it not a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50055:95"/>
Subject for everlasting Thoughts and
Considerations? Has it not been the
great Research of the Thoughtful
and Inquisitive for many Ages, and
yet does not every Age refine upon
its Predecessour, and produce New
Discoveries? Are not the Sciences
continually improved, and yet are
there not still Depths in every Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which no Line of Thought
can ever Fathom? What a vast Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity
is there in some plain simple
Propositions, nay who can number
the Conclusions that may be drawn
from any one Principle! Take the
most simple Figure in Geometry,
and where is the Mathematician
who after a Thousand Years Study
can reckon up all the Properties that
may be affirm'd of it, both as Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
Consider'd, and as it stands
in relation to other Figures? And
what then shall we think of the
whole Science in all its Branches and
Dependencies, Particularly of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebra,</hi>
the Main Ocean of this Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless
Sea? And what shall we
say of Metaphysick's, another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable
Abysse, and what of the
endless Circle of Truth, if not the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50055:96"/>
same which one of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Friends
says of God,<note place="margin">Iob 11. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Canst thou by searching
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind out</hi> Truth, <hi>Canst thou find her
out unto Perfection? It is as high as
Heaven, what canst thou do? deeper
than Hell, what canst thou know? The
Measure thereof is longer than the
Earth, and broader than the Sea.</hi> And
that because they after all are Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
whereas this is truly and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Infinite. Which by the way suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proves a God, and that this
God is Truth, whose Eternal and
Glorious Majesty be Blessed for
Ever.</p>
            <p>18. But then let us Consider, if
Truth be indeed (as you see) of an
Infinite Nature, then to prove that
Human Reason is not fully adequate
to it, does not intirely possess it, nor
all over and wholly comprehend it,
and consequently cannot be the
Measure of it, there will be no need
of laying open the great Weakness
and Deficiency of our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
I need not represent the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of its Light, nor the
Shortness of its Views, nor the Slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of its Attainments, nor the
very Narrow Extent of its Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50055:96"/>
nor the very little Progress it
is able to make in the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Comprehension of Truth;
That there are a great many things
whereof we have no Ideas (for
which we need go no further for an
Instance than our own Souls) and
that even where we have Ideas of
things we cannot always discern the
Relations and Connexions that are
between them, and that either for
want of sufficient Clearness in the
Ideas themselves to have their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
perceived immediately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
comparing them with other
mediate Ideas, or else for want of
such due and proper Mediums
wherewith to compare them, and
that therefore the extent of our
Knowledge is not only vastly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by the Natures of things,
but also very Considerably even by
our own Ideas, there being many
things whereof we have Ideas, and
sometimes very clear ones too, and
yet which we know no more how
to reason upon or discourse of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly,
or with any Certainty, than
we do of those things whereof we
have no Ideas at all, being, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50055:97"/>
no more able to tell what
proportion such a Circle bears to
such a Square though we have clear
Ideas of both, than we are to tell
what proportion there is between
Angels and our own Souls, things
whereof we have no Ideas. A very
remarkable Instance of the Shortness
and Contractedness of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
which it seems are not
only destitute of the Ideas of many
things, and Consequently of the
knowledge of them (it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that the extent of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
should exceed that of our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas)
but are also Blind to those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Ideas which they have, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see even when they have the
advantage of the Light. But I say
I need not present my Reader with a
Night-piece of Human Reason, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
great Blindness and gross
Darkness, how ignorant she is when
she does not adventure to judge,
and how Erroneous when she does,
stumbling and falling (as is usual
in the dark) out of one mistake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another, out of one Errour into
another, either by im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>racing false
Principles, or by drawing wrong
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50055:97"/>
Conclusions from true ones, so that
Ignorance seems her safest Retreat,
and to suspend her best Wisdom;
These I say and such other of our
intellectual Infirmities I need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon or make any advantage of,
it being sufficient to conclude the
Point in hand that Human Reason
in its largest Capacity and Extent
and with all the advantages of both
Nature and Artificial improvement
is after all but a <hi>Finite</hi> thing (and
that to be sure the most Zealous of
its Votaries and Advocates must
confess that it is) since 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that what has Bounds should
be able totally and adequately to
Comprehend what has None, or
that <hi>Finite</hi> should be the Measure of
<hi>Infinite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. I know but of one thing that
can with any Pertinency be replied
to this Argument, and that is, that
though Human Reason (as Finite)
be not able to comprehend all Truth
(as being Infinite) yet however there
may perhaps be no one Truth in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
but what, when presented to it,
may be comprehended by it, and so
Human Reason may be rightly said to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50055:98"/>
be Adequate and Commensurate to
Truth as <hi>Distributively,</hi> though not
as <hi>Collectively</hi> consider'd. But to this
I have several things to return.
First of all I say that such is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
dependence and concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Truth that the want of a
thorough and intire Comprehension
of all Truth in its widest and most
diffused Extent must needs very
much Eclipse the view and darken
the Perception of any one Solitary
Truth in particular, so that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we may have some tolerable
Perception of it, and such as we
may call Clear in Comparison of
some other Truths which we do not
see so clearly, yet it cannot be near
so clear and Distinct a Perception,
as that Infinite Being has of it who
sees not only the Truth it self, but
also the Manifold Relation, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,
and Combination that it has
with all other Truths. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between these two ways of
Perception being of a like Nature
with that which is between seeing
a Proposition as it stands singly by
it self, and seeing the same Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
with all its Relations and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50055:98"/>
Dependencies, and in conjunction
with the whole Context and Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Discourse whereof it is
a Part. I say again Secondly, that
though we may have a competent
Perception of some plain and simple
Truths without pursuing them tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
all the Relations and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies
that they have with other
Truths (since otherwise, as I have
hinted already, we should be able to
understand nothing, and every thing
would be above Reason) yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we do not know but that there
may be some Truths of such a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as not to be understood without
the adequate Comprehension of
those Relations and Dependencies;
which since we have not, we do not
nor can ever know but that there
may be some Truths that are so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
us as to be out of our Reach,
and to lie beyond all possibility of
Comprehension, and consequently
that Human Reason is not adequate
and commensurate to Truth even
<hi>Distributively</hi> consider'd. I say we
do not know, and 'tis impossible we
should ever know but that thus it
may be. For how should we be
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50055:99"/>
able to know it, or upon what shall
we ground this our Knowledge? It
must be either upon the Natural
Force and Penetration of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
or upon our Actual
Views and Perceptions, or upon the
Nature of Truth it self. As for the
Capacity of our Understandings
though we do not know the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and exact Bounds and Limits of
it, yet we know in the general that
it is Finite, and has its fix'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
Measure, which it would
strive in vain to exceed. As for the
Nature of Truth, that we both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
and from the foregoing
Considerations must of necessity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
to be Infinite. And what
Ground of Assurance can we have
from either or both of these, which
are apt rather to lay a Foundation
of Diffidence and Distrust? And
then as for our actual Views and
Perceptions, though we should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them to have been hitherto ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so clear and distinct, never so
numerous and extensive, and never
so fortunate and successful, so that
our Victorious Understandings never
yet met with a Baffle, nor sounded a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50055:99"/>
retreat from a too difficult and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
Theory, suppose in one
word, that we never yet applied
our minds to the consideration of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one
Truth but what we fully
comprehended and were perfect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of (which yet he must be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Presumptuous, or a very little
experienc'd Thinker that shall affirm
of himself) how notwithstanding do
we know, considering the Finiteness
of our Intellect, and the Infiniteness
of Truth, but that there may be O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Truths of a Nature so far above
us, and so disproportionate to us, as
not possibly to be Comprehended by
us. For we cannot argue here from
the past Successes and Atchievements
of our Understandings to the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or because there has been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hitherto proposed to us but
what we Comprehended, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there can be nothing proposed
but what we can Comprehend. If
we conclude thus, we forget the
vast disproportion between Truth
and Human Reason, that the one
is Finite and the other Infinite, the
due and attentive Consideration of
which would convince us that tho'
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50055:100"/>
we have thought never so much,
and never so well, and comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
never so many Truths, yet for
ought we know there may be Truths
which our intellectual Sight though
aided with all the advantages of Art,
that may help the Mind as much as
a <hi>Telescope</hi> does the Eye, can yet
never penetrate, and which (by the
way) it may be Worthy of God to
reveal to us if 'twere only to Check
and Controle the daring Progress of
our Understanding, to make us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
our Measure and remember
that we are but Men, to be sensible
of the defects of that part upon which
we most value our selves and despite
others, and that even the Light that
is in us is but Darkness. Whether
there be any such Truths I do not
now say, but only that upon the
Supposition of the Infinity of Truth
'tis impossible for us to be sure but
that there may be such, which is
enough to hinder Our Reason from
being (at least as to us) the Measure
of Truth, since if it be so 'tis more
than we know, or can possibly be
assured of, which makes it all one
(<hi>to us</hi>) as if it were not. For we
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50055:100"/>
cannot make use of it as a Measure,
or draw any Consequence from it to
the Falsehood, Impossibility, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibility
of things Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
since for ought we know or
can know to the Contrary, there
may be Truths which we cannot
Comprehend.</p>
            <p>20. But then I say further Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Infinite Nature of Truth
will Oblige us to acknowledge that
there actually are and must be such.
For if Truth be Infinite then 'tis
plain that we cannot Comprehend
it in its full and intire Extent, and
so much the very Objection sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
But then I say that as the
want of a perfect Comprehension of
all Truth does very much shade and
darken the perception of any one
single Truth in particular, and that
because of the mutual connexion and
dependence of things one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as was before observ'd) so it
must needs quite Eclipse and totally
Abscond some Truths from our
View. For there are some Truths
so very Complex and Abstruse, and
that lie so deep, and, as I may say,
so far within the Bowels of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50055:101"/>
Systeme, that include such a
Multitude of Relations, depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so many Suppositions, are the
Conclusions of so many Premisses,
presuppose and require the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of so many things (of some of
which it may be we have not so
much as the simple Ideas) have such
a Train of Principles Planted and
Intrench'd as a Guard before 'em,
and draw such an immense Retinue
of Consequences after them, and
are every way so mingled, involv'd
and combined with other Truths
that they cannot possibly be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
without an intire and all-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
view of the whole Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Systeme. Instances of such
Truths abound in every Science.
But there is nothing that may furnish
us with so sensible and palpable an
Illustration of this Matter as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Order and Measure of <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>
We are all fully assured
from the very Notion and Idea of
God as involving all possible Excellency
and Perfection in it, that
he is a Being infinitely Wise, Good,
Just and Holy, and Consequently
that his whole Conduct in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50055:101"/>
of the World must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
carry the Character of all these
Attributes, and that he cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
do any thing contrary or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to any of them any more than
he can deny himself, or depart from
the Essential Perfections of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Nature. And upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
is founded the best Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we have for Submission and
Resignation to the Will of God,
and Acquiescence in his Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Dispensations. Thus far then
we are all satisfied and agreed.
And yet it cannot be denied when
we come to Particulars, but that
there are <hi>Phenomena</hi> in the Moral
as well as in the Natural World
which are utterly insolvible, and
that a great many of these Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
of Providence are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with desperate and invincible
Difficulties, such as have at once
exercised and puzzled the thoughts
of the most inquisitive in all Ages,
and still remain Obstinate and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
Objections not only to the
<hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Libertines,</hi> but even to
the most sober and intelligent of
both Philosophers and Divines, Men
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50055:102"/>
of the greatest Light and Piety,
those who best understand, and do
most reverence and adore the ways
of God. And adore them after all
they must, for so intricate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling
are the Difficulties, or (by
the leave of some) I would say <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi>
of Providence, especially in
those dark Scenes of it that relate
to the Divine Concourse and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation
with the Will of Man,
the Ordination of his Final State,
the Order and Distribution of
Grace, the Permission, Direction
and Nice Conduct of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
the Capacity of our Understanding
will not serve us to give a clear and
unobnoxious account of them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the diligent and curious Wit
of Man has gone a great way in
this as well as in Other Matters,
and several Systemes and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses
have been invented about
these things by Contemplative Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
among whom the two very
particular Authors of the <hi>Treatise</hi> of
<hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and of <hi>L'Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
Divine</hi> have I think gone the
furthest of any. But though some
of these Accounts bid fairer for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50055:102"/>
than others, by striking
some glimmering Light into these
Abstrusities, yet still they all agree
in this, that they leave a great deal
more in the Dark, and labour with
Difficulties even where they do Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain:
So that after all they discover
nothing so much as their own Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Deficiency. In the mean
while we know and are most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in the General, that all is right
and as it should be in the Conduct
of God towards his Creatures, and
that he cannot make one false Step
in the Government of the World.
So much we understand without
Systemes, and truly not much more
with them. For as for the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Scenes of Providence we know
not what to make of them; and
when we have consider'd the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations
of God as much as we
can or dare, we find our selves after
all obliged to confess, that though
<hi>Righteousness and Iudgment are the
Habitation of his Seat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 97. 2.</note> 
               <hi>yet Clouds
and Darkness are round about him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. But now how comes it to be
so Dark and Cloudy? How come
we to be so little able to see the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50055:103"/>
Wisdom, Goodness, Justice
and Holiness of those ways of God,
which in the general we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
to be so Wise, Good, Just
and Holy? Why can we not enter
into the <hi>Detail</hi> of Providence? Why
even because we do not see it
throughout, and have not a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of its Universal Systeme.
For the Passages of Providence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
of such a Relative and Complicated
Nature, there is such a kind of
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>mutual in-being</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling</hi>
in them, (if I may transfer
an Expression hither, commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to a higher Mystery) they are
so interwoven with, and have so
common a dependance upon one
another, that without a Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
View of the whole <hi>Drama,</hi>
we can hardly make any thing of
any one Particular Scene. Indeed
if we could have such a View as
that, a View that went round and
through, and grasp'd the whole
<hi>Area</hi> of that immense Circle, we
should quickly see the Regularity of
the most uneven and odd-figured
Parts, and how wonderfully they
conspired (like the Flats and Sharps
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50055:103"/>
of Musick) to the Order and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of that excellent and surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Beauty that results from them.
But being not able to reach this,
we are not competent Judges of the
rest, (which by the way should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
our forwardness to fit in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon things so far above the
Cognizance of our Court); and
though we know the Measures of
God to be all Wise, Good, Just and
Holy, yet this is only an <hi>implicit</hi>
Knowledge, founded upon an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Evidence only (much after the
same manner as it is in Faith) even
the general Conception we have of
the Divine Perfection, without any
clear and immediate discernment of
the Internal Connexion that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the things themselves. We
believe 'tis all well and right because
the Infinitely Wise God sits at the
Helm; but then again, because he
is so Infinitely Wise we cannot found
the Depths of his Wisdom, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it would be very strange if an
Infinitely Wise Agent should not be
able to do things Wisely, and yet
beyond our Understanding) nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
all his particular proceedings
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50055:104"/>
to the Laws of Reason and Equity;
but the more we study about these
things the more we are at a loss, the
further we wade into this Sea the
deeper we find it, till at last we find
our selves obliged to cry out with
the most inspired Apostle, <hi>O the
Depth of the Riches both of the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Knowledge of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> 
               <hi>how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
are his Iudgments, and his
Ways past finding out!</hi> And all for
want of an Intire and Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
View of them. For if the
Knowledge of some very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
Truths be impossible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Clear Perception of the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Principles upon which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend;
and a Man would to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
beat his Brains about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of <hi>Conical Sections,</hi> till he
has first well possessed himself of
Ordinary Geometry; how much less
then (may we conclude) are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
and very Complicated Events
of Divine Providence to be unravel'd
without a Collected and Simulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Idea of the Universal Systeme
whereof they are parts, to which
they relate, and from their <hi>Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity</hi>
with which they receive all
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50055:104"/>
their Order and Beauty, but which
is in a manner lost to us for want of
Compass enough in our Prospect.
By which single Instance it appears
(among many others that might have
been given) how the Incapacity of
Comprehending Truth in its whole
Extent may disable us from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
many Particular Truths;
and consequently, that the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
of Truth which hinders us
from Comprehending it according
to that Extent, must also hinder us
as much from being able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
every Particular Truth. So
then there will be Particular Truths
which are Incomprehensible by us,
and consequently Human Reason is
not Commensurate to all Truth, not
only as Collectively, but even as
Distributively Consider'd. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not as <hi>Distributively,</hi> because not
as <hi>Collectively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. But then to raise our Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
a little higher, I consider yet
further, that the Infinity of Truth
is not only an Infinity of <hi>Extent,</hi>
but also an Infinity of <hi>Nature,</hi> that
is, that the Compass of Truth is
not only Boundless and illimited, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50055:105"/>
that it has in it an inexhaustible
Spring, which like the Source of
Light, is never to be drawn dry by
the most thirsty draught of the whole
Intellectual World, but also that
there are Particular Truths of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
truely infinite, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
incomprehensible to any
Understanding that is not so. For
we are here to recollect, what has
been already shewn, that Truth is
Consubstantial and Coessential with
God and with the Divine Ideas.
Now though these Ideas are all
equally of the Essence and Nature
of God, and so far equally Divine
(it being impossible that there should
be any thing in God that is not God)
yet there is this general and very
remarkable Difference between them,
that some of these Divine Ideas are
Absolute, and some Relative. That
is, some are of the Essence of God
Simply and Absolutely as He is in
Himself, without any Relation to
any thing out of Himself. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
again are of the Essence of
God consider'd purely in Relation to
things without Him either in Act or
in Possibility, and only so far forth
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50055:105"/>
as the Divine Essence is representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Creatures. Or if you will,
thus: We may consider a twofold
Being in Ideas, <hi>Esse Reale,</hi> and <hi>Esse
Ideale</hi> or <hi>Repraesentativum.</hi> Some
Ideas are Divine, not only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their <hi>Esse Reale</hi> (for so they
are all) but also according to their
<hi>Esse Repraesentativum,</hi> as representing
God to the Mind that Contemplates
them. Others again are Divine only
according to their <hi>Esse Reale,</hi> being
indeed of the Substance of God, but
not representing him, but his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and so are Divine in the same
sense as the Idea of a Body is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
<hi>viz. Essentially</hi> only, not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatively.</hi>
Which Diversity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
resolves into the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are of the Essence of God,
not as it is absolutely in itself, but
only as it is representative of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
according to such a certain
Modality and Limitation of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And accordingly though they
are truly <hi>Divine Ideas</hi> as well as the
other, yet they are not said to be
<hi>Ideas of God,</hi> as not representing
<hi>him,</hi> but his Creatures. The short
is, The Essence of God may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50055:106"/>
either as it is absolutely in it
self according to its Infinite Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
or as it is in relation to, and
representative of things without, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of an Actual, or of a Possible
Existence. And so the Ideas or Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Perfections of God are of two
sorts: Either such as are of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God consider'd in the first
sense, as it is in it self, or else such
as are of the same Divine Essence
only in the second sense, as far forth
as that Essence is representative of
things out of it self; upon which
by the way, I suppose, must be
grounded (if we will resolve things
into their last Principle) the common
distinction of the Attributes of God
into <hi>Communicable</hi> and <hi>Incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
The <hi>Incommunicable</hi> Attributes
of God being those Perfections that
are of the Divine Essence Simply
and Absolutely consider'd as it is in
it self; and the <hi>Communicable</hi> those
that belong to the Divine Essence
Relatively consider'd, and as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
of Creatures, to whom
accordingly they are in their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
truly applicable; whereas the
former are not, but are peculiar to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50055:106"/>
God alone; which sufficiently shews
the difference between this double
order of Divine Ideas. But to make
it yet more intelligible by an Instance.
The Idea of the Divine <hi>Immensity,</hi>
or that <hi>Perfection</hi> in God which we
call his Immensity, is of the Essence
of God according to the first sense,
as it is simply and absolutely in it
self; being no other than the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of God as it is universally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
intirely present in, and filling
all places without being circumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by any, yet without any Local
Extension. But now the Idea of
<hi>Extension,</hi> or that Perfection in God
which vertually, eminently, and
<hi>modo intelligibili,</hi> answers to Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
(and is therefore frequently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Mr. <hi>Malebranch, L' ètendue
intelligibl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>) is of the Substance of
God, not as it is in it self simply and
absolutely, but only as far forth as
it is representative of Matter, or
Body, and imitable or participable
by it, according to those Limitations
and Imperfections which belong to
that kind of Being, and which are
represented by this its Idea. I know
not whether I express my self to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50055:107"/>
the Conception of every Reader, but
I am sufficiently Clear and Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to my self; and whoever is not
much wanting either in <hi>Metaphysics,</hi>
or in <hi>Attention,</hi> cannot I think well
miss my Meaning.</p>
            <p>23 Now the use that I make of
this Speculation to the present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is this: Those Ideas which are
of the Essence of God only as that
Divine Essence, according to some
certain Limitations and inadequate
Considerations of it, is representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Creatures, must be consider'd
by us as of a Finite Nature. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
however truly Divine and of
the Essence of God, yet not as it is
absolutely and simply in it self, but
only as it is in relation to Creatures;
that is, as partially and inadequately
consider'd, according to certain Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
and Limitations of Entity
and Perfection, such as the things
whereof they are Ideas do require.
And accordingly such Ideas are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
said, not to be the Ideas of
God who is Infinite (for they do not
represent <hi>him,</hi> though Essential to
him) but to be the Ideas of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who are Finite. They are
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50055:107"/>
indeed <hi>Divine Ideas,</hi> because Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to God; but they are not <hi>Ideas
of God,</hi> because they are of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Essence only as it relates to
Creatures, and is representative of
<hi>them.</hi> Of Creatures therefore they
are the Ideas, and God in seeing
them is not properly said to see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
(though they are of himself)
but to see <hi>Creatures;</hi> because though
they are of his Divine Essence, yet
'tis only according to such Precisions,
Limitations and Inadequations of it
as to be expressive and representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of their Finite Perfections. As
therefore the Realities which these
Ideas represent are Finite, so these
Ideas must be conceiv'd by us as Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
too; it being impossible that
Infinite consider'd as Infinite, should
be representative of what is Finite.
And as these Ideas are Finite, so are
they also by Consequence so Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate,
and of a Measure so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed
to Finite Understandings, as
to be Intelligible by them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Possibility of their Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension;
which must also in like
manner be concluded of all those
Truths which are Consubstantial to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50055:108"/>
them. And accordingly the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
answers the Theory. We
find that not only contingent Truths
that regard only the Actualities and
Existencies of Things, such as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact, Human Events, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but even a great many of those
which are Ideal and Necessary, and
concern only the Abstract Reasons
and Essences of Things independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on their Actual Existence, are
Comprehensible by us, as in <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physics</hi>
and <hi>Geometry,</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of which Sciences we
meet with a great many things
which we well understand, and
whereof we have Clear Ideas and
Conceptions.</p>
            <p>24. But now it is not thus with
the Ideas of the first Order, nor
with their Truths, Though those
Divine Ideas which appertain to the
Essence of God only as representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Creatures, be both Finite
and Comprehensible by limited Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
(which indeed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
would not be capable of any
Science) yet these <hi>Absolute</hi> Ideas
which I now speak of, are neither
Finite nor Comprehensible. For
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50055:108"/>
these Ideas are of the very Essence
and Substance of God as it is in it
self purely and separately consider'd
according to its simple and absolute
Nature, and not as it is in relation
to Creatures, or as representative
of any Reality out of it self. And
accordingly God in contemplating
these Ideas of his may be truly and
strictly said to contemplate himself;
and we also in the Contemplation of
them do as really contemplate God,
and that because they are of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Essence simply and absolutely
consider'd as it is in it self, and not
as it is in reference to any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
or out of it self. These Ideas
therefore are strictly Infinite (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Divine Essence, as it is in
it self simply and absolutely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
is so) and consequently Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
by any Finite, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
by Human Understanding.
God only can Comprehend these
Ideas, and that because he only can
Comprehend himself. Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
indeed has Light enough to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that there are such Ideas and
Perfections in God, and is withal
able to discern enough of them to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50055:109"/>
raise her greatest Wonder and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to make her despise all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Intelligible Objects in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of these <hi>Infinite Grandeurs;</hi> and
the Angelic Spirits that wait about
the Throne of his Majesty, and
stand in a better Light, are able to
see yet more of them; but neither
the one nor the other can Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
them fully any more than they
can God himself, and that because
they are God. So that though the
other Ideas are Finite and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible,
these are truly Infinite and
Incomprehensible. And of this we
have sufficient Evidence in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
above proposed of each. The
Idea of <hi>Extension</hi> is very Clear and
Intelligible to our Minds, as Finite
and as Narrowly bounded as they
are. We have a very distinct View
of it, we Perceive it, we Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it. Among all Intelligible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
there is none that is more clear,
nor whereof we have a more ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
and exact Notion. And upon
this is founded all that peculiar
Clearness, Evidence and Certainty
that is in the <hi>Geometric</hi> Sciences,
which alone have the happiness to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50055:109"/>
be free from Disputes, and without
Contestation to find that Truth
which the others seek after, and that
for no other Reason but because we
have so clear and distinct a Notion
of its general Subject, <hi>Extension.</hi>

               <hi>Divine Immensity,</hi> so
far are we from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Clear Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that, that no
sooner do we set our
selves to contemplate
this vast Idea, but we
enter into Clouds and
Darkness, or rather into such an
over-shining and insupportable Light
as dazzles and blinds our Eyes, yea
hurts and pains them, till they can
no longer indure to gaze, but are
forc'd to refresh themselves either by
letting down their wearied Lids
(suspense of Thought) or by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their view upon less glorious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
In the Meditation of the other
Idea we are like Men that wade in
a River where we both see and feel
the Bottom, and go on for a pretty
way together smoothly and without
much difficulty, only now and then
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50055:110"/>
meeting with an intangling Weed
that lets and incumbers our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress.
But in the Contemplation of
the Infinite Idea of the Divine <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity</hi>
we are like men that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselves to the Main Sea, at
the very first Plunge out of our
depth, and ready to be overwhelm'd,
swallow'd up and lost in an Abyss
that knows no bottom.</p>
            <p>25. I use a little Figure and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
here the better to impress this
upon the <hi>Imagination</hi> of those who
are not so well habituated to the
Conception of things by <hi>Pure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection,</hi>
but the thing it self needs
none of the advantages of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical
way, being strictly and
severely true. And by these two
Instances it may appear what a vast
difference there is between these two
sorts of the Divine Ideas, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and the Relative, those that
are of the Essence of God as in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and those that are of the same
Divine Essence as it is in relation to
Creatures. The First, Infinite and
Incomprehensible, the Second, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and Comprehensible. For you
see here the Idea of Extension is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50055:110"/>
clear and distinct, and such as we
can fully and adequately Conceive,
but the Idea of the Divine Immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
has nothing clear and distinct
in it, but is all over Darkness and
Obscurity, and such as quite asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
and confounds us with a
Thousand difficulties upon the first
application of our Thoughts to it,
as indeed do all the <hi>Absolute</hi> Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
and Perfections of God, which
are all equally Infinite, and equally
incomprehensible to Finite Spirits,
however they may be able to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that which in the Essence
of God is <hi>representative</hi> of, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
a <hi>Relation</hi> to those Realities
which either actually do, or possibly
may exist out of it. And in this I
say no more (setting aside only the
<hi>Rationale</hi> of the thing) than those
who tell us that the <hi>Incommunicable</hi>
Attributes of God are Infinite and
Incomprehensible. They are so.
But what is it that makes them In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and Incomprehensible? Even
the same that makes them <hi>Incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable,
viz.</hi> their being of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God as it is in it self ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its Absolute Simplicity,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50055:111"/>
and not as it is in Relation to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
For 'tis most evident that
the Essence of God as it is simply
and Absolutely in it self is every
way Infinite and Incomprehensible,
and therefore all those Ideas and
Perfections of his which are in this
Absolute Sense Essential to him
must be also of an alike Infinite and
Incomprehensible Nature. Which
by the way may serve to Silence
the presumptuous Cavils of those
who draw Objections against the
Existence of God from the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibility
of his Attributes, since
if there be a God he must have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
Attributes, which
unless we ascribe to him we do not
think either rightly or worthily of
him.</p>
            <p>26. But to resume our Point, we
see then here what a large Field is
now open'd to our Prospect of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and Incomprehensible Truths,
even of a Compass as large as the
Absolute Ideas and Perfections of
the Divine Essence. For though all
Created things are of a Finite Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and though even the Divine
Ideas that represent them, as far as
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50055:111"/>
representative of them, must fall
under the same limited Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet those Absolute Ideas and
Perfections of God that have no such
external Reference, but are of the
Divine Essence as it is in its pure,
simple, abstracted Self, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
partake of the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity,
and be as unbounded as God
himself. And since Truth (as was
before observ'd) is Coessential and
Consubstantial with the Divine Ideas,
I further Conclude, that though
those Truths which regard the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualities
and Existencies of things,
or if you please, things that do actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
exist, be Finite, because the
things themselves are so, and though
even those that regard the Divine
Ideas themselves are also Finite sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Ideas to be of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Order, such as are of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Essence only as it is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
of, and in relation to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
yet those Truths which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
those Divine Ideas of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Order, that are of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Essence of God as it is in it
self purely and simply Consider'd,
and so are not only <hi>Essentially,</hi> but
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50055:112"/>
even <hi>Representatively</hi> Divine, as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
representing God, and being in
a strict and proper sense <hi>his</hi> Ideas, I
say the Truths of this Order and
Character must necessarily be of a
Nature far exalted above all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
yea above all other Ideal
Truths, even as far as what is of the
Simple and Absolute Essence of God
transcends that which in the same Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is only Relative to things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and can therefore be no less than
Infinite. We have here then an Order
of Infinite Truths, even allthose which
regard the Absolute Ideas and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of God. These Divine Ideas
and Perfections are all Infinite, as that
Glorious Essence whose Ideas they are
and whom they represent, and so also
are the Sublime Truths which result
from them. They are of a Nature
strictly Infinite, and if Infinite then by
Consequence <hi>Incomprehensible,</hi> I mean
to all understandings that are not
so. For as Nothing Finite has
Reality enough to represent Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
so neither can any thing Finite
have Capacity enough to Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it. For as the actual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of any intelligent Being can
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50055:112"/>
never exceed its intellectual Power,
so neither can its Power exceed the
measure of its Essence. A Finite
Being therefore must have a Finite
Understanding, and a Finite Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
must have a Finite Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Since then our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are Finite, 'tis plain that our
Perception of Infinite must also
be Finite. 'Tis true indeed
that <hi>Objective Reality</hi> which we
contemplate when we think upon
Infinite has no Limits, and so we
may be said in some respect to have
an <hi>Infinite Thought,</hi> as far as the
Operation of the Mind may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated
from the quality of the
Object, but yet still we think ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Measure of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and our <hi>Perception</hi> of Infinite
can be no more at the most than
Finite. But now a Finite Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
bears no proportion to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Intelligible, besides that to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
such an Object after a Finite
manner is not to perceive it as it is,
but only Partially and inadequately.
But now a Partial and inadequate
Perception of a thing can never be
said to be a Comprehension of that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50055:113"/>
thing, even though the thing be
Finite, much less then when it
is Infinite. Whereby it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that if there be an Order of
<hi>Infinite</hi> Truths the same will also
be <hi>Incomprehensible</hi> Ones, and since
again as I have shewn there is an
Order of such Truths, even all those
that regard the Absolute Ideas and
Perfections of the Divine Essence, it
clearly follows that there is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Incomprehensible Truths,
and Consequently that Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is not the Measure of Truth,
even <hi>Distributively</hi> consider'd, since
there are Particular Truths which
it cannot Comprehend; which was
the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>27. And of all this we may have
a plain and visible illustration in the
foremention'd Instance of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Immensity.</hi> This is an Idea or
Perfection of God that is truely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinite,
as being of his Divine Essence
as it is Absolutely in it self, and not
as in Order to, or representative of
Creatures; And as Infinite 'tis also
Incomprehensible by any but God
himself. Accordingly the Complex
Truth that regards this Absolute
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50055:113"/>
Idea of God is also Infinite, and as
such Incomprehensible. As appears
in this Proposition, <hi>God is Immense;</hi>
which is an Infinite and Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
Truth. We find it is so a
<hi>Posteriori</hi> by casting the view of our
Understandings upon it. And we
find it must be so <hi>a Priori</hi> by reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Principles already laid
down and establish'd. And to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all vain cavilling in this matter
I further add, that though we could
suppose the Truths that result from
Infinite Ideas not to be Infinite
(which yet we cannot by reason of
their real Identity and Coessentiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with those Ideas) yet however
they must upon another account be
incomprehensible, even upon the
Incomprehensibility of those Ideas.
For if the Ideas whereof a Truth
consists be incomprehensible, as they
must be if they are Infinite, that
alone would be enough to hinder us
from being able to Comprehend such
a Truth, it being impossible we
should thoroughly understand the
Relations or Habitudes between
those Ideas whose Simple Natures
(the Foundation of those Habitudes)
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50055:114"/>
we do not Comprehend. For if in
Finite things the not having a clear
and adequate Idea of a thing makes
us unable to judge of the Truth or
Falshood of many Propositions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that thing (whereof there
are a multitude of Instances in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi>
especially in Questions relating
to the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man, which must for
ever lie undetermin'd merely for
want of our having a clear Idea of
that Noble Essence) much more
then in things Infinite will the not
having a Comprehension of the Ideas
incapacitate us from Comprehending
the Truths that Result from them,
which will therefore be as incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
as if they were (what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are) in themselves Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</p>
            <p>28. I have hitherto shewn the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
of Truth by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Reason, and consequently that
Human Reason, is not the Measure
of Truth, from the joynt Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of each. Only with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
I have consider'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
Truth Absolutely as it is
in it self, according to its own Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and unmeasurable Nature. But
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50055:114"/>
as for Human Reason I have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
that only as <hi>Finite,</hi> as suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that sufficient to my present
Purpose, and that there was no need
of placing it in any other Light.
For after it hath been shewn that
Truth is Infinite, to prove that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Reason cannot be the Measure
of it, it is certainly enough to Consider
it as a Bounded Power, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
how very strait and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
its Bounds are, since whatever
is Finite can never measurer Infinite.
But then it so, what if we add the
other Consideration to it? If the
bare Finiteness of Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
(a defect common to it
with all Created Intelligencies) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it uncapable of Comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Truth, and Consequently of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Measure of it, how much
more then does the littleness and
narrowness of its Bounds contribute
to heighten that incapacity? If the
having <hi>any</hi> limits does so unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it for the adequate Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Truth, how then does the
having so very short and strait ones?
Strait indeed by Natural and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Constitution, but much more
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50055:115"/>
yet retrench'd by Sin, and by all
those Passions, Prejudices, deordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Affections and Evil Customs
which are the Effects and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of Sin, and which have now
so darken'd our Minds, and drawn
such a gross Film over our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Sight that we can hardly
distinguish Day from Night, Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
from Obscurity, Truth from
Falshood, and are able to see but so
very little a way into the Works of
God (much less into the Nature of
God himself) that we need nothing
else to depress and humble our Pride
and Vanity than that very Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of ours which puffs us up.
So very narrow in its Compass and
Extent, so very Shallow and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
in its Depth, so very Confuse
and Obscure in its Light, so very
uncertain and conjectural in its
Ground, and so every way defective
and imprerfect is it. But how then
can we found the Depth of Truth
with so short a Line? A Bottomless
Depth with (I will not say a Finite,
but) so very scanty a Measuer?
And what an extravagant Folly and
Weakness, not to say Pride and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50055:115"/>
Vanity is it to fancy that we can?
It would be a Vain Presumption in
an Angel, but sure the very Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Distraction of Impudence
in Man, who may with less defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to Sence and Reason think to
grasp the Ocean within the hollow
of his hand, than to Comprehend
and Measure Truth, Infinite Bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Truth, not only with Finite,
but so very limited Capacities.</p>
            <p>29. But suppose Truth were not
(what we have shewn it to be) <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,</hi>
but had Bounds as well as
our Reason, yet unless it had the
<hi>Same,</hi> our Reason cannot be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate
to it, or the Measure of
it. But does the supposition of its
having Limits infer that it has the
same? No, For though Finite, its
Bounds may possibly be extended
further than those of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
and how can we be sure
that they are not? We cannot then
even upon this supposition be sure
that our Reason is the Measure of
Truth, and therefore it is all one
as to us (as I said before) as if it
were not so, forasmuch as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
use it as a Measure by drawing
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50055:116"/>
any Consequences from it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Falshood or impossibility of
things upon the account of our ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to Comprehend them, since
for ought we know the Limits of
Truth though we should suppose
it Finite, may yet exceed, and that
very greatly too, those of our Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Faculties. And Considering
both the Natural and the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessory
defects of them it is very
reasonable to think that they do.</p>
            <p>30. Some Essences perhaps there
may be (though even this again is
more than we know) that sit so
high in the Intellectual Form as to
be able to Comprehend all that is
Finite, so that the only reason why
they have not an adequate Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of Truth at large is because
it is indeed Infinite. But there is no
Necessity, nor so much as Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that Human Reason should be
of so rais'd an Order that nothing
but <hi>Infinity</hi> should transcend its
Comprehension. And it must be a
strange Composition of Pride and
Self-love that can make us fancy
that it is; something like that, only
much more extravagant, which
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50055:116"/>
possesses the disturb'd Heads of some
in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and makes them Conceit
themselves Kings and Emperours in
the midst of their <hi>Irons, Rags,</hi> and
<hi>Straw.</hi> What though Truth were
Finite, and some Understandings too
that are so were able to measure it,
why must this needs be concluded
of <hi>Human</hi> Understanding? If a
Finite Being were able to Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
Truth, why must <hi>Man</hi> be that
Being? The Scripture tells us he is
made lower than the Angels, and
how many Orders and Degrees there
may be among <hi>them</hi> we know not,
nor indeed how many Ranks of
Spiritual Beings there may be in the
Universe whose Understandings go
beyond ours. For who can define
the Out-flowings of the Divine Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity,
or Number the Rounds of
the Intellectual Scale? In the mean
while though man knows not how
many Orders of Intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
there are above him, yet 'tis
with great Reason and Consent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
that there are none below
him, so that he is placed even by
his own Confession in the lowest
Form of the Intellectual Order.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50055:117"/>
And why then may not his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
(as much as he values him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon it) be of so Shallow a
Depth, and so low a Size that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Finite</hi> Objects may be dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
to him? Especially since
we find him so often puzzl'd and
gravell'd in Natural things, as also
in those Ideal Truths that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Natural and Ectypal
World, such as Philosophical and
Mathematical Problems. Or if the
Reason of any Creature could be
the Measure of Truth, why should
<hi>he</hi> be that Creature, who is seated
in the very Confines of the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
and Immaterial World, and is
as it were the Common-Point where
Matter ends and Spirit begins, who
brings up the rear of the Intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
kind, and is both the youngest
and the <hi>least indow'd</hi> among the Sons
of God.</p>
            <p>31. These Considerations suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
shew that there is no Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor so much as Probability, that
Human Reason should be the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Truth even upon the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of its being Finite. Which
indeed is enough of it self to carry
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50055:117"/>
the Point Contended for as far as the
Design of the present Argument is
Concern'd. For if it be not necessary
that Human Reason should be the
Measure of Truth, then it is Possible
that it may not be, and if it is Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that it may not, then we can
be never Sure that it is, and if we
cannot be Sure that it is, then we
cannot Use it as a Measure, which
(as I have remarqu'd already and for
the Moment of it do here reincul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate)
makes it the same to all intents
and purposes as if it were not such
at all. But yet to carry our Plea a
little highter I further Contend that
as the foregoing Considerations suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to shew that Human Reason
<hi>may</hi> not, so there is One behind that
very positively Demonstrates that it
<hi>Cannot</hi> be the Measure of Truth,
even tho' we should allow it to be
of a Finite and bounded Nature as
well as our own understandings.</p>
            <p>32. As there are many things

and Obscure, so 'tis most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

now besides the Difficultys and disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
we shall always ly under
in the Comprehension of things from
the Confuseness and Obscurity of our
Ideas, which of it Self will many
times render those things, and also
whatever nearly relates to those

besides that our not having any Ideas
of Certain things, is an invincible
Bar to all Knowledge and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of those things (unless we

Considerable that possibly the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

our Selves to Comprehend, and
whereof we have the Ideas, may
depend upon the truth of another
thing whereof we have no Idea. If
it should be so tho Truth in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
be never so Finite, or the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Truth we would Contemplate
be never so Finite, 'tis plain we
shall be no more able to Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it than if it were Infinite. Now
I say that 'tis not only Possible that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50055:118"/>
this may be the Case (which yet
of it Self as I have again and again
Noted is sufficient to debar us from
using our Reason as the Measure of
Truth) but there are also some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
wherein it appears actually
to be so. We know well enough
what we mean by <hi>Liberty</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency,
and are withal well assured
that we are Free Agents. We have
also a Sufficient Notion of <hi>Prescience,</hi>
and are also no less assured of the
Reality of it, And because both these
are true, and there can be no real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance
between one Truth and
another we are also by Consequence
assured that there is a good Harmony
and Agreement between them,
and that they are Consistent with
each other. But now how to adjust
their apparent Opposition, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
those Instances of seeming
Contradiction and inconsistency
wherewith they press us, this we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Know nor are able with all our
Meditation to Comprehend, and
that because we have not an Idea of
the Human Soul, without which
there is no possibility of Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
how its Free Workings
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50055:119"/>
may be the Objects of Prescience,
tho our Ideas of Prescience and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
were never so Clear. Or if
this Instance shall not be thought so
proper because the Men with whom
our present Concern lies are pleas'd
to disown the Doctrine of Prescience,
let me desire them to Consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be not many other Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
concerning Human Liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that taken from, <hi>Prescience,</hi>
which they are no more able to get
over then they are that. And that
for the very same Reason, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they ahve not an Idea of the
Soul, upon the Knowledge of which
the Solution of those, as well as
some other Difficulties in Morality,
does Necessarily depend. Or if they
please let them take an Instance of
a Physical Nature. We know well
enough what it is to be in a Place,
and we know also as well what it is
to be Coextended to a Place. But
now how Being in a Place may be
without Coextension to a Place, this
is what we cannot Comprehend
(tho as to the thing it Self, upon
other Considerations constrain'd to
grant it) and that because we are
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50055:119"/>
ignorant of the general Nature of
<hi>Spirit,</hi> upon the clear Conception of
which the Comprehension of the
other does so depend that it cannot
be had without it. And indeed we
may concluded in general that when
ever we have clear Ideas of things, and
yet are not able to Comprehend the
Truth of them, 'tis because the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of those things depends upon
the Truth of something else where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have either no Idea, or not
such as is sufficiently Clear. Which
must be the true Reason of the hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
presumed impossibility of finding
out the exact Proportion between a
<hi>Circle</hi> and a <hi>Square.</hi> Why, Circle
and Square are very Intelligible
things, and how come we then not to
be able to determin the precise and
just Proportion that is between
them: It cannot be from any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity
in the things themselves,
much less from our want of having
Ideas of them, for we have as clear
and exact Ideas of these Figures as
we can have of any thing in the
World. It must be therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Knowledge of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
depends upon the Knowledge
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50055:120"/>
of some other thing whereof the
Idea fails us, which till we are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses'd
of we shall in vain endeavour
to discover the other. Whereby it
plainly appears that we are not only
uncapable of Comprehending those
Truths that relate to things whereof
we have no Ideas, but that even
where we have Ideas, and those very
Clear ones too we may be as far from
Comprehending a Truth as if we
had none merely upon the account
of the Dependence which that Truth
has upon some other thing whereof
we have not, at least a just, Idea.
Which single Consideration is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for ever to spoil <hi>Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
for setting up for the <hi>Measure</hi> of
<hi>Truth,</hi> even upon the Supposition of
its being Finit. So very False is that
arrogant Assertion of a Modern
Philosopher,<note place="margin">

               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:50055:120"/>
There is but one only thing that far
exceeds the Force and reach of our
Mind, and that cannot of its own
very Nature be known by it as it is
in it self, namely <hi>Infinite.</hi> What
but One thing excepted from the
Verge, and placed beyond the reach
of Human Knowledge? 'Tis well
that One thing is a pretty large one,
but sure the Authour was ignorant
of something else, that is <hi>Himself,</hi>
or else he could never have advanc'd
such a Crude and ill-consider'd a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
            <p>33. And thus I have shewn at
large in a rational way by arguing
<hi>a Priori,</hi> and from the Nature of
things, that Human Reason is not
the Measure of Truth, and that
even upon the most Liberal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of its being Finite; And
if it be not so supposing Truth to be
Finite, much less is it supposing it
(what it has been prov'd to be) of
an Infinite Nature. If upon the
Former Supposition it exceeds the
Proportion of our Reason, certainly
upon the latter there will be no
Proportion between them. But
whether our Reason bears no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50055:121"/>
to Truth, or whether it be
only Disproportionate to it, either
way it follows that it cannot be the
Measure of it, which I cannot but
now look upon as a Proposition
sufficiently demonstrated. And in
all this I contend for no more
than what is implied in that
Common and universally approv'd
Maxim even among those of the
<hi>Rational way,</hi> that we ought not
to deny what is Evident for the
sake of what is Obscure, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from a Truth which we see
a Necessity to admit because of
some Difficulties attending it which
we cannot solve; which they say
is an Argument only of our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and not of the Falshood of
the thing. This indeed is a true
Rule, and such as must be allow'd
to hold good in all our Reasonings,
let the Matter of them be what it
will. Only I wish that the Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Rule were as much
minded, as the Rule it self is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
receiv'd. For it plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that there are some things
which though plain and certain as
to their <hi>Existence,</hi> are yet incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50055:121"/>
and inexplicable as to
their <hi>Manner.</hi> But then as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
of the Manner
should not make us reject the Truth
of the thing when otherwise Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
so neither should the Evidence
we have of the Truth of the thing
make us disown the Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of the Manner, since it is so
far from being against the Nature
of Truth that it should be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible,
that you see we have
discover'd even from the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of its Nature that there are
incomprehensible Truths. Of which
I might now subjoyn some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Examples, but that I should
fall very deep into a <hi>Common Place,</hi>
being herein prevented by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Writers, particularly by the
admirable one of <hi>L' Art de Penser,</hi>
to the First Chapter of whose Fourth
Book I refer my Reader; where he
shews by several, and some of them
uncommon Instances that there are
things which the Mind of Man is
not capable of Comprehending. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which he Concludes with a very
grave and useful Reflection, which
for the great advantage and Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50055:122"/>
of it to the present Affair,
though I refer my Reader to the
rest of the Chapter, I shall here set
down. <hi>The Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it</hi> (says he) <hi>that
one may draw from these Speculations is
not barely to acquire the knowledge of
them, which of it self is barren enough,
but it is to learn to know the Bounds of
our understanding, and to force it to
confess that there are things which it
cannot Comprehend. And therefore it
is good to fatigue the mind with these
kind of Subtilties, the better to tame
its Presumption, and abate its confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and daringness in opposing its
Feeble Lights against the Mysteries of
Religion, under the Pretence that it
cannot comprehend them. For since
all the Force of Human Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is constrain'd to yield to the least
Atom of Matter, and to own that it
sees Clearly that it is infinitely divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
without being able to Comprehend
how this may be. Is it not apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to transgress against Reason to refuse
to believe the wonderful effects of the
Divine Onnipotence, Merely for this
Reason, that our Vnderstanding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Comprehend them?</hi> Yes without
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50055:122"/>
doubt it is, as will better appear in
the sequel of this Discourse. In the
mean while before I take leave of
the Subject of this Chapter, I have
a double Remarque to make upon it.</p>
            <p>34. The First is, that since Truth
in its full extent is Incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
we should not vainly go about
to Comprehend it, but be contented
to be ignorant in many things.
And since there are some special
Truths in particular that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
we should not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
our Thoughts to the Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of all things at a Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as some who are for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
every thing, but sit
down first and Consider whether
they are proportionate to our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
or No, and, as far as
we can learn to distinguish what
Truths may, and what may not
be Comprehended by us, that so
we may not lose that Time and
Pains in the Contemplation of
them, which might be profitably
imploy'd in the Consideration of
other things, better suted to our
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50055:123"/>
Capacity. As a great many do,
who busie themselves all their
Lives long about such things
which if they should study to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
they would not Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
and that indeed because they
require an Infinite Capacity to
Comprehend them. Whereas the
shortest Compendium of Study,
and the best way to abridge the
Sciences is to study only what we
can Master, and what is within
the Sphere of our Faculties, and
never so much as to apply our
selves to what we can never Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
            <p>35. The other Remarque is that
the Conclusion prov'd in this
Chapter does very much Fortifie
and Confirm that which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to be made out in the
last Concerning the Distinction of
Things Above, and Things Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Reason. For if there are
Truths which we cannot Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
then it seems what is above
our Comprehension may yet be
True, and if True then to be
sure not Contrary to Reason,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50055:123"/>
since whatever is Contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is no less Contrary to Truth,
which though sometimes above
Reason is yet never Contrary to
it.</p>

         <div n="5" type="chapter">

            <head>CHAP. V. That therefore a things being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
by Reason is of
it self no Concluding Argument
of its not being True.</head>
            <p>1. AS there is nothing <hi>in</hi> Man
that deserves his Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
so <hi>Much,</hi> and Few things
<hi>without</hi> him that deserve it <hi>More</hi>
than that part of him wherein he
resembles his Maker, so there is
Nothing more worthy of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
in that part, or that is at
least more necessary to be Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
by him, than the <hi>Defects</hi> of
it, without a due regard to which it
would not be very safe for him to
dwell much upon the Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the other, as being apt to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ride and Vanity,
to blow him up with Self-Conceit,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50055:124"/>
and so by an imaginary Greatness
to spoil and corrupt that which is
Genuine and Natural.</p>
            <p>2. Now the Defects of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
part Consider'd in their
general Heads are I suppose <hi>Sin,
Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Errour.</hi> And though
Sin in it self must be allow'd to be
of a worse Nature and Consequence
than either Ignorance or Errour
(however some may fancy it a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Reproach to 'em to have their
Intellectuals question'd than their
Morals) and so upon that score may
require more of our Consideration,
yet upon another account the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the Understanding seem to
need it more than those of the Will,
since we are not only apt to be
more proud of our Intellectuals
than of our Morals, but also to
Conceit our selves more Free and
Secure from Errour than we are
from Sin, though Sin in the very
Nature and Principle of it implies
and supposes Errour.</p>
            <p>3. Pride the presumed Sin of the
Angels is also the most Natural and
Hereditary one of Man, his dominant
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50055:125"/>
and most cleaving Corruption, the
Vice as I may call it of his Planet
and Complexion. And that which
we are most apt to be proud of is
our <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> the only Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in us whose limits we forget. In
other things we are Sensible not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the general Bounds of our
Nature, but also of the particular
narrowness of them, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do not attempt any thing very
much beyond our Measure, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
our Selves pretty reasonably
within Our Line, at least are not
such Fools as to apply our Strength
to Move the Earth out of its place,
or to set our Mouths to drink up the
Sea, or to try with our Eyes to look
into the Regions beyond the Stars.
But there is hardly any Distance
but to which we fancy our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Sight will reach, scarce any
Object too bright, too large, or too
far remov'd for it. Strange that
when we Consider that in us which
makes us Men, we should forget
that we are so. And yet thus it is;
when we look upon our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
'tis with such a Magnifying Glass
that it appears in a manner bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50055:125"/>
and unlimited to us, and we are
dazzled with our own Light.</p>
            <p>4. Not that it is to be presumed
that there are any who upon a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Consideration of the Matter have
this Form'd and express Thought
that their Understandings are <hi>Infinite</hi>
Human Nature seems hardly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of such Excess. But only as
the Psalmist says in another Case of
some Worldly Men, that their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Thought is that their houses shall
continue for ever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 4.</note> Not meaning that
any could be so grossely absurd as
positively and explicitly to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that their Houses any more
than their own Bodies, should last
always, and never decay, but only
that they had such a kind of a
wandring and Confuse Imagination
secretly lurking in their Minds, and
loosely hovering about them; so in
like manner there are a sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who are Parturient and teeming
with a kind of Confuse and unform'd
Imagination tho' perhaps they never
bring it to an express and distinct
Thought, that their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
have no bounds or limits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them,
tho' they cannot
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50055:126"/>
deny but that they have, if directly
put to the Question.</p>
            <p>5. Accordingly you shall find those
whose Conduct betrays this <hi>inward</hi>
Sentiment, who venture at all in
their Studies, stick at nothing, but
will undertake to give a Reason for
every thing, and positively decide
whatever Comes in their way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Suspense or Reserve, imagining
(confusely at least) they have a
Comprehension of all things, and that
there is nothing too hard or knotty
for them, nothing but what they
either actually do, or are capable of
Comprehending, if they once set
themselves to it. And from hence
they roundly Conclude that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are not able to Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
is not true, and accordingly
deny their Belief to whatever trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends
their Comprehension.</p>
            <p>6. Now I confess there is no
fault to be found with the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of these Men, nor with their
Practice as it relates to that Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
which are both (as far as I
can see) exceeding right if their
Principle be once admitted: For if
indeed it be really so that Human
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50055:126"/>
Reason is adequate and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surate
to Truth, so that there is
no Truth but what it is able to
Comprehend, then it will certainly
follow that whatever it cannot
Comprehend is not True, and there
will need no other, nor better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the falshood of any thing
than the Incomprehensibility of it.
For their Reasoning resolves into this
Form.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Whatever is true we can Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</l>
               <l>This we do not Comprehend,</l>
               <l>Therefore this is not true.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Or thus,
<q>
                  <l>If whatever is true we can Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
then what we cannot Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
is not true,</l>
                  <l>But whatever is true we can Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
<hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
Where 'tis plain that if the Major
of the First, or the Minor of the
Second Syllogisin (wherein the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of these Men is Contain'd) be
allow'd, there will be no avoiding
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50055:127"/>
the Conclusions of them. So that
if we admit that Human Reason is
Comprehensive of all Truth we are
not Consistent with our Selves if we
do not also grant that the Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
of a thing is a just War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to Conclude it not True.</p>
            <p>7. But then on the other side if
this Mighty Principle upon which
such a Weight is laid, and such great
things built be false, if Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be not the Measure of Truth
(as I think is with great Evidence
Demonstrated in the last Chapter)
then is not the Consequence as good
this way, that therefore a thing's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Incomprehensible by Reason is
no Concluding Argument of it's not
being True? For how are we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with our Selves, if grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Human Reason to be Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surate
to Truth we deny that the
Incomprehensibility of a thing argues
it not to be True, but only because
in denying that we Contradict our
Principle; or, which is all one, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Contradictory Proposition
to it to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that Human
Reason is <hi>not</hi> Commensurate to
Truth. But now if in saying that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50055:127"/>
the Incomprehensibility of a thing
does not argue it not to be true we
in the Consequence of what we
affirm Suppose that Human Reason
is not the Measure of Truth, then
'tis as plain that the Supposition of
Reason's not being the Measure of
Truth will also Oblige us to say
that the Incomprehensibility of a
thing is no Argument of it's not
being True. Whereby it is plain that
the Consequence is every whit as
good thus, <hi>Human Reason is not the
Measure of Truth, therefore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
of a thing is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that it is not True; as thus,
Human Reason is the Measure of
Truth, therefore the Incomprehensibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a thing is an Argument that it
is not True.</hi> The only Reason why
he that denies this latter Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
upon the Supposition or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of this latter Principle is
inconsistent with himself, being this,
because in denying the latter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
he Supposes the Former
Principle, which Principle therefore
must as much inter the Consequence
that Supposed it, <hi>viz.</hi> That a things
being Incomprehensible by Reason
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50055:128"/>
is no Warrant to Conclude that it
is not true.</p>
            <p>8. And because this Principle that
Human Reason is not the Measure
of Truth has been already proved
at large, I look upon the grounds
of this Consequence as already laid,
and therefore to shew the Connexion
that is between the one and the
other (besides what I have even
now said to that purpose) need only
add this further Remarque. That
since Human Reason is not the
Measure of Truth, or since
there are Incomprehensible Truths,
then it seems the Incomprehensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a thing and the Truth of a
thing may Consist together; or in
other words, the same thing may be
at once <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Incomprehensible.</hi>
But now there cannot be in the
whole Compass of Reasoning a
more certain, or more evident Maxim
than this, That that which is when
a thing is, or would be supposing it
were, is no Argument that it is
not. As for Instance, Suppose it
should be Objected against the <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican</hi>
Hypothesis of the Motion of
the Earth that it is repugnant to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50055:128"/>
Sense, since we see the Sun and the
Stars Rise and Set, and Move round
about us. It is thought a sufficient
Answer to this to say, That sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Earth and not the Sun
did really Move these Appearances
would yet be the same as they are
now, since Sailing,<note place="margin">Le Clerks <hi>Physics.</hi> Pag. 14.</note> as we do, between
the Sun and the Stars (as a late
Writer expresses it) not the Ship
in which we are, but the Bodies
which surround us would seem to
Move. And 'tis most Certain that
if supposing the Earth did) really
Move the Motion would yet seem
to be in the Sun and Stars; then the
seeming Motion of those Bodies is
no Argument that the Earth does not
Move.</p>
            <p>9. Why just so it is in the present
Case, when 'tis Objected against the
Truth of a thing that 'tis Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
by Human Reason, 'tis
a sufficient Answer to say that this
argues nothing, since if the thing
were true it might yet be Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible.
And 'tis most certain
that if supposing a thing to be True
it might yet be Incomprehensible,
then the Incomprehensibility of a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50055:129"/>
thing is no good Objection against
the Truth of it. And therefore since
we have proved that there are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
Truths, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that the Truth of a
thing and the Incomprehensibility
of the same thing may Consist to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
we may now with all Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
assurance Conclude that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
of a thing is no
Argument that it is not True, any
more than the seeming Motion of
the Sun is an Argument against the
real one of the Earth, since the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
would be even Supposing the
Truth of the Latter. And both by
Vertue of this most Evident and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contestable
Principle, That what may
Consist with the Truth of any thing,
can be no good Argument that it is
not True.</p>
            <p>10. And indeed when it shall be
Consider'd how many things sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
our Conception when we are
Children which yet we are able
well to Comprehend when we are
Men, how many things again are
beyond the Ken of Ignorant and
Illiterate Men which yet are very
Intelligible and Shine forth with full
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50055:129"/>
Light to the Men of Art and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and how many things again
even among the Learned are now
discover'd and well understood by
the help of <hi>Algebra</hi> which were
<hi>Mysteries</hi> to former Ages, and are
still beyond even the Imagination of
those who have not that Noble and
Wonderful <hi>Key of Knowledge.</hi> When
again it shall be further Consider'd
how many of those things which
we cannot even with the Assistance
of that Commanding Key unlock
in this state of Mortality, we may
yet have a clear view of in that
of Separation, when deliver'd from
the Burthen of our Flesh, and that
many of those things which are too
high for us then may yet be of a
level with the Understanding of
Angels, and that what is above
their Capacity may yet be most
clearly and distinctly perceiv'd by
the Infinitely penetrating and All-Comprehensive
Intellect of God, I
say he that shall but seriously enter
into this single Reflection must needs
discover himself much wanting in
that Stock of Sense and Reason he
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50055:130"/>
pretends to, if he still continue to
Measure the Possibilities of things by
their Proportionableness to his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
or Conclude any thing
False or Impossible, when he has
no better Reason for it but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he cannot Comprehend it.</p>

thing were an Argument of its

            <p>1. AS there is Nothing more
Common than for people
to hold Certain Principles that have
an inseparable Connexion with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bad Consequences, and yet not
professedly to hold those Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
because either they do not
attend to them, or are not sensible
that they do indeed follow from
such Principles, whereof we have
two very pregnant Instances in the
Maintainers of the <hi>Predestinarian</hi>
and <hi>Soli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idian</hi> Systemes, so on the
other hand, and for the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
there are those who take up,
and with great Fixedness adhere to
certain Consequences without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50055:131"/>
holding those Principles from
which they truly flow, and to which
(if traced to the Head) they will
infallibly lead them.</p>
            <p>2. Of this we have a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Instance (where I confess
one would not expect to find it)
in those of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Perswasion.
The Reason these Men of Reason
give why they will not believe the
Mysteries of the Christian Faith, is
because they are above their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
they cannot Comprehend them.
Whereby they plainly imply, that
they will believe Nothing but what
they can Comprehend, or that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is to be believ'd that is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible,
which is also a
common Maxim among them, who
accordingly make Above Reason
and Contrary to Reason to be one
and the same thing. And whereas
'tis only the untruth of a thing that
can make it unfit to be the Object
of Faith, in saying they will not
believe what they cannot Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
they do as good as say that
what they cannot Comprehend is
not True, and so that the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibility
of a thing is a just
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50055:131"/>
warrant to conclude it False. And
all this they own and expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
if not in these very terms,
yet at least in such as are equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to them as is too Notorious
and well known to need any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
for the proof of it. But
now though they do thus profess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
own that the Incomprehensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a thing by Reason is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of its not being true, yet
that Human Reason is the Measure
of Truth, or that all Truth is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
by it, are (as I take it)
Propositions which they do not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
and professedly avow. For
as I noted in the Introduction 'tis
such an Odious and Arrogant Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that they cannot with any Face
of Modesty or common Decency
make a plain and direct Profession
of it, though at the same time 'tis
most Certain, that this is the true
Principle of that Consequence which
they do professedly hold, viz. <hi>that
the Incomprehensibility of a thing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
it not to be true,</hi> and that this
Consequence does as necessarily lead
back to that Principle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:50055:132"/>
3. For as if Human Reason be
the Measure of Truth it follows in
the descendintg line as a direct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
that the Incomprehensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a thing argues it not to be
true, so it follows as well Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>&amp; per viam ascensûs,</hi> that if
the Incomprehensibility of a thing
argues it not to be True, then Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Reason is the Measure of Truth.
Since if it were not, the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibility
of a thing (as is shewn
in the Preceding Chapter) would
then not argue it not to be True. If
therefore it does, 'tis plain that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Reason is the Measure of Truth.
Which Principle whoever disowns
ought also to renounce the other
Proposition, viz. <hi>That the Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
of a thing is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of its untruth,</hi> which if yet he
will imbrace notwithstanding, 'tis
plain he holds the Consequence
without its Principle, and has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no Reason for what he Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms.</p>
            <p>4. For as he who granting Human
Reason to be the Measure of Truth,
denies yet that the Incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of a thing is an Argument of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50055:132"/>
its not being true is therefore incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with himself, because in so
doing he supposes the Contradictory
to what he had before granted, <hi>viz.</hi>
that Human Reason is not the
Measure of Truth. So he that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
that the Incomprehensibility
of a thing <hi>is</hi> an Argument of its not
being True, and yet denies that
Human Reason is the Measure of
Truth, is also as inconsistent with
himself, because in so doing the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the Contradictory to his own
Assertion, and does in effect say
that the Incomprehensibility of a
thing is not an Argument of its
not being True, as most Certainly
it would not be in case Human
Reason be not the Measure of
Truth, as the foregoing Chapter
has sufficiently shewn. The short
is, if the Not being of <hi>A</hi> proves
that <hi>C</hi> is not, then the being of <hi>C</hi>
proves that <hi>A</hi> is, since if it were
not, according to the First Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<hi>C</hi> could not be. And so here
if Reason's not being the Measure
of Truth proves that the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibility
of a thing is not an
Argument of its not being True,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50055:133"/>
then if the Incomprehensibility of a
thing be an Argument of it's not
being True 'tis plain that Reason is
the Measure of Truth, since if it
were not then according to the first
Supposition the Incomprehensibility
of a thing would not be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of its not being True.</p>
            <p>5. For how I pray comes the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
of a thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the untruth of it? I cannot
Comprehend such a thing, therefore
it is not True, where's the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence?
By what Logic does this
Latter Proposition follow from the
Former? why we have here the
Minor Proposition and the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to make a Complete Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it we must add another,
thus; If it were true I should Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it, but I do not Comprehend
it, therefore it is not true. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it appears to the eye that my not
being able to Comprehend a thing
is no otherwise an Argument of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>truth of it, than as it is first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>pposed
that if it were true I should
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble to Comprehend it. Which
again resolving into this Absolute
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>osition, that I am able to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50055:133"/>
all Truth, it plainly follows
that if my inability to Comprehend
a thing be an Argument that it is
not true, then I am able to Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
all Truth, and that my Reason
is the Measure and Final Standard
of it.</p>
            <p>6. I Conclude therefore that if the
Incomprehensibility of a thing were
an Argument of it's not being true
then Human Reason will be the
Measure of Truth, and that they
that hold the Former ought also if
they will be Consistent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to admit the Latter. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this is a False Principle, that
Human Reason is the Measure of
Truth, therefore, I Conclude again
that the Consequence that Resolves
into this Principle is also False, since
we may as well Conclude a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to be False because it
leads back to a False Principle,
as a Principle to be False because
it is productive of a bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.
Which still further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
and Establishes the Conclusion
of the last Chapter, <hi>viz. That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
of a thing is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of its untruth,</hi> which you
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50055:134"/>
see is now proved both Backwards
and Forwards, and so made impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
on all sides. We have proved
it Forwards by shewing the False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that Principle that Human
Reason is the Measure of Truth,
and by thence arguing the said Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;
and we have also proved it
Backwards by shewing that the
Contrary Supposition Resolves into
that False and already Confused
Principle. And I do not see how
any Conclusion can be better prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

of a thing is no just Objection
against the Belief of it. With
an Account of the Cartesian
Maxim, that we are to Assent

            <p>1. TIs a Wonderful thing to
Consider the <hi>Caprice</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature, by what unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Springs it's Movements are
ordered, and how odly and unsted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Men act and manage themselves
even in the same Circumstances,
and in Relation to the same Objects.
Sometimes the Obscurity and Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness
of a thing shall be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Credibility, and recommend
it the rather to their Belief. Thus
you shall have a great many reject
that Philosophy as idle and Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
which undertakes to explain
the Effects of Nature by insensible
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50055:135"/>
Particles, their different Bigness,
Figure, Contexture, Local Motion,
Rest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Merely because this is a
plain Simple and Intelligible Account,
such as they can easily and well Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
The very easiness and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
wherewith they Conceive
these Principles is Made an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against them (though indeed
it be a good Presumption for them)
and for that very Reason they will
not believe them to be the true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Nature, whose Effects they
fancy must be Resovled into Causes
more hidden and Abstruse. And
accordingly they find in themselves
a greater inclination to lend attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to those that shall undertake the
Solution of them by the real Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meras
of Substantial Forms, Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Sympathys, Antipathys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or
that shall go to account for them by
the yet more Obscure Principles of
the Chymists, striking and filling
their Ears with those great but emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Sounds, <hi>Archeus, Seminal Spirit, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stral
Beings, Gas, Blas,</hi> &amp;c. which they
receive with great satisfaction not
for their Scientific Light (for they
are dark as may be, mere Philosophic
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50055:135"/>
Cant) but only because they are
Mysterious and Abstruse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they fancy there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more than Ordinary in them,
tho they know not, nor, it may be,
never Consider'd, what. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as in some other Instances, <hi>Men
love Darkness better than Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But then at another time you
shall have them inquiring after
Truth as <hi>Diogenes</hi> did after an Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Man, with a Candle in their
hands, and not caring to go a step
any further than they can see their
way. Now upon a sudden they are
all for Clear and distinct Ideas, Full
and adequate Perceptions, Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
Proofs and Arguments, and
nothing will serve or Content them
but Light and Evidence, and they
will believe nothing but what they
can Comprehend. Strange diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conduct! Who would think
two such vastly distant extreams
should meet together, I will not say
in the same Man, but in the same
Human Nature, and that the very
same Creature (and such a One as
Stiles it self Rational too) should
proceed by such uncertain Measures,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50055:136"/>
and act so inconsistently with it
Self; sometimes embracing a thing for
the sake of it's Obscurity, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
again in another Fit making
that alone an Invincible Objection
against the Belief of it.</p>
            <p>3. But it is plain by the foregoing
Measures that it is not. For since
Truth is the general Object of Faith,
'tis evident that nothing can argue a
thing to be absolutely incredible,
or not reasonable to be beleiv'd, but
that which at the same time argues
it not to be True. For if true, then
'tis still within the Compass of the
general Object of Faith. But now
we have shewn already that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
of a thing is no
Argument of it's not being true,
whence it clearly and closely follows
that 'tis no Argument neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it's Credibility. And if so,
then we may believe it Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it's Incomprehensibility,
because we may believe whatever
is not Absolutely incredible. So that
there is no Necessity that we should
discard every thing we cannot
Conceive as unworthy of a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Belief, or that what is Above
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50055:136"/>
our Reason should be therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
our Faith too.</p>
            <p>4. It is true indeed that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
of a thing is in it
Self no proper and direct Argument
why it should be believ'd, and he
would be thought to give but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
account of his Faith, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d why he believ'd, such an
Incomprehensible thing, should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<hi>because it is Incomprehensible.</hi>
which at best could pass only
for a Religious Flourish, much such
another as, <hi>Credo quia impossibile.</hi>
And that because the Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of a thing is not directly and
<hi>per se</hi> a Criterion of Truth (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it may be <hi>per Accidens,</hi> may be
Consider'd afterwards) whose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and genuin Character is not
Obsecurity, but Light and Evidence.
Not that nothing is True but what
has this Character (for we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shewn the Contrary in prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Incomprehensible Truths) but
that as whatever we clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
is True, so our Clear perceiving
of a thing is the only sign from the
Intrinsic Nature of the thing it Self
of the Truth of it. Incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50055:137"/>
therefore is none, but as such
abstracts from true and not true,
and is equally Common to both.
But now that which may Consist
with a thing supposing it false, can
no more prove it True, than that
which may Consist with a thing sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it True, can prove it false,
according to the Tenour of the
Fifth Chapter. The Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
therefore of a thing is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Argument of the Truth of it,
and Consequently no Reason of it
Self, why it should be believ'd,
and that because it abstracts as
such from True and False, and is
too Common to Both to prove
either.</p>
            <p>5. And because it is so, it is also
further granted that the Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
of a thing is not only in it
Self no proper Reason why it should
be believ'd, but has also so far the
Nature of a <hi>Disswasive</hi> from believing,
as to be a Caution against a too hasty
Belief, till there appear some other
Motive from without either from
Reason or Authority that shall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
the Assent. In the mean while
it advises to <hi>Suspend.</hi> For the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50055:137"/>
Incomprehensibility of a thing being
as such No Reason why a Man
should believe it, 'tis plain that if he
did believe it Consider'd only as in
that State he would believe it. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reason. That therefore is a
Reason why he should suspend, a
Negation of Reason being enough
to with-hold ones Assent, though to
give it one had need have a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Reason. When therefore a
thing appears Incomprehensible, that
indeed is sufficient Reason to suspend
our Belief, till some prevailing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
from without shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
that Suspension, by requiring
our Assent. But when it does so,
then the Incomprehensibility ought
to be No Argument to the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and it would be every whit as
absurd to reject a thing now because
of its Incomprehensibility, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it before for that Reason. And
that because as the Incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of a thing is no reason for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
it, so it is no Absolute Reason
against it.</p>
            <p>6. If it were so it would be in
<hi>Natural</hi> things, the objects of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and Philosophic Science, such as
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50055:138"/>
belong properly and immediately to
the Province and Jurisdiction of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Here, if any where, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
of a thing would
forbid all Assent to it. And so it is
supposed to do by some who though
far from denying the Belief of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
things in <hi>Religion,</hi>
will yet tell you that in <hi>Physical</hi>
Contemplations, Clearness and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is to lead the way, and we
are to proceed with our Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, assenting to nothing but
what we well Comprehend. In
Matters of Faith indeed they will
allow that Reason is to be submitted
to Revelation, and that we are to
believe many things which pass our
Comprehension; but in Matters of
pure Reason they will have us go no
further than Reason can carry us.
Which indeed is right enough it their
Meaning be that we are to Assent to
Nothing but what upon the whole
Matter all things Consider'd from
without as well as from within, we
have reason to believe true, and that
we are never to proceed to judge or
determin without some Evidence or
other, but then this will equally hold
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50055:138"/>
in Matters of Faith too, which is too
rational an Assent to be given at a
Venture, and we know not why,
and whose <hi>Formal Reason</hi> (as has
been already discours'd) is always
Clear. But if their Meaning be that
in Matters of Reason we must As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to nothing but what has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Evidence, and what in its self,
and by its own Lights is Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
by us (as they seem to mean, or
else their distinction of the Case of
Reason and the Case of Revelation
is here impertinent) then I conceive
that they set too narrow limits to our
Assent in Matters of Reason when
they allow it to be given only to
things which in this sense are Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to us. For 'tis plain that there
are many things in Nature which we
fee are True, and must be True, and
so not only may, but cannot help
Assenting to them, though at the
same time we are not able to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
how they are, or can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be.</p>
            <p>7. Not that our Assent is then
<hi>Blind</hi> and wholly without Evidence,
(for then we might as well Assent to
the contrary as to what we do, and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50055:139"/>
would do better not to Assent at all)
but only that it has none from <hi>within,</hi>
and from the intrinsic Nature of the
Object, but only from some Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Consideration, much after the
same manner as it is in <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atch.</hi> In
both which there may be a Clear
Reason, why we should Assent to
an Obscure thing. But then as the
internal Obscurity does not destroy
the External Evidence, so neither
does the External Evidence strike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Light into the internal Obscurity;
or in other words, as the Reason for
Assenting is never the less Clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Matter assented to is Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
so neither is the Matter as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to ever the less Obscure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Reason for assen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing to
it is Clear. And yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this internal Obscurity of the
Matter we assent to it because of the
prevailing Light of the External E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
And this we do, not only
in Matters of Faith (according to
the Restriction of some) but in
the things of Nature and Reason too,
where we are oftentimes forced by
the pressing urgency of certain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and Collateral Considerations
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50055:139"/>
to assent to things internally obscure
and whose very possibility we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Comprehend, as is plain in the
great Question of the <hi>Divisibility</hi> of
<hi>Quantity,</hi> and other Instances,
whereof every Thinking Man's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ation
cannot but have already
furnish'd him with variety. The
Incomprehensibility then of a thing
is non just Objection against our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to it even in Matters of a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>
Nature, much less then is it
in Matters of <hi>Faith</hi> For if not in
Matters that belong to the Court of
Reason, and where she sits as Judge,
then much less in things that are not
of her proper Jurisdiction, and if
notwithstanding the internal inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of an Object we think fit to
assent to it upon <hi>Rational</hi> Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
much more may we, and
ought we upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of the
Infallible God.</p>
            <p>8. Indeed if whatsoever is Above
our Reason were also (as some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend)
as Contrary to it, and there
were nothing true but what was
also Comprehensible, and so the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
of a thing were an
Argument of its not being true,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:50055:140"/>
then I con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess we could not as Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Creatures assent to an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
Proposition upon any
Consideration whatsoever, No not
even that of Divine Authority. 'Tis
true indeed there could then be no
such Authority for Incomprehensible
things. But if there were, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
we should regard it, because
we could not have greater assurance
either of the Existence or of the
Truth of it, than we have already
(upon this Supposition) that the
things reveal'd are not true. But
now if this Supposition be no more
than a Supposition, if to be above
Reason does not involve any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
to it, if there are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
Truths, and Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Incomprehensibility of a thing
is no Argument o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> its not being true
(all which has been already proved)
then 'tis plain that what is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
may yet be a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievable
Object (because within the
Possibility of Truth) and then to
render it actually believ'd there needs
only some External Evidence either
from Reason or Authority. For
what should hinder our Assent to an
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50055:140"/>
Incomprehensible thing when we
have plain Evidence from without
for it, and its own internal Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is no Argument against it! 'Tis
plain therefore that we ought to
give our Assent. And since we do
so oftentimes upon a Ground of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
much more ought we upon
that more Firm and Immoveable
ground of Revelation. The short
is, whatever is no Objection against
the Truth of a thing is none against
the Credibility of it, since Truth
is the General Object of Faith (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you will say that a thing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to be believ'd upon any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
besides want of Truth) and
therefore since we have already
shewn that the Incomprehensibility
of a thing is no Argument against
the Truth of it, it visibly follows
that it is no Argument against the
Belief of it neither. Therefore an
Incomprehensible thing may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
and accordingly he that
refuses to believe any thing is
bound to give a better Reason for
it than because it is <hi>Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:50055:141"/>9. If it be said that this is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
enough, because Faith is a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Act, and therefore what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Comprehension of Reason
is as much above a Rational Belief,
to this, besides what I have already
remarqu'd upon this Occasion in the
Chapter of Faith,<note place="margin">

               </note> I here further
reply, that it is true indeed and on
both sides agreed that Faith is a
Rational Act, but in what Sense is
the Question. There are two very
different Senses according to which
it may be said to be so either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Clearness of its Formal
Reason, or in regard of the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of its Object. Either because it
is founded upon an External Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or Argument for believing,
or because it proceeds upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Evidence, that appears in
the very Nature of the thing Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd.

               </gap> Faith be said to be a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Act in the latter Sense, the
Assertion is then False, for so (that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in respect of the Object) we have

               </gap>wn it to be an inevident Assent.
But i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

               </gap> be said to be a Rational Act
in the former Sense, then indeed it
is true, but nothing to the purpose,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50055:141"/>
since nothing hinders but that this
External Evidence may well consist
with an Internal Inevidence, or in
other words, that the Clearness of
the Reason for Believing may stand
with the Obscurity of the Object
Believ'd. And therefore though
Faith be a Rational Act yet it does
not hence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ollow that what is Above
Reason is also above Faith and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rationally be believ'd, because the
Act of Faith is said to be Rational,
Not in respect of the Evidence of
the Object, but only that of its For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Reason or Motive. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though there be no Evidence in
the Object, yet it is not thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
uncapable of being the Matter
of Faith, because the Evidence which
Faith as a Rational Act supposes, is
wholly of another kind. There
seems indeed a kind of opposition
as to the Sound between Faith's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Act of Reason, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
what is Above Reason. And
this it may be is that which imposes
upon the Minds, or the Ears shall
I say, of them that urge it as an
Objection. I cannot imagine what
else should, for I'm sure there is no
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50055:142"/>
Contradiction in the Sense. 'Tis
true indeed Evidence in the Act and
not Evidence in the Act are Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories,
because <hi>ad Idem,</hi> and so
are Not Evidence in the Object and
Evidence in the Object, for the
same reason. But there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
between Evidence in the
Act and No Evidence in the Object,
and therefore these may stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though the other cannot</p>
            <p>10. But to lay open the Fallacy of
this great and very popular Objection
yet a little more to the Eye (though
it must be a very blind one that
does not see it already) I will put
it into Form, and give it a Formal
Answer.
<q>
                  <l>If Faith be a Rational Act, then
what is Above Reason cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
be Believ'd.</l>
                  <l>But Faith is a Rational Act, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
For Answer to this I distinguish. If
by Rational Act be meant an Act
founded upon Internal Evidence,
or the Evidence of the Object, then
I deny the Minor, Faith is not so a
Rational Act. But if by Rational
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50055:142"/>
Act be meant an Act founded upon
External Evidence or the Evidence
of its Formal Reason or Motive,
then indeed I grant the Minor, but
deny the Consequence, which is
none at all, for it does not at all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
because Faith is a Rational Act,
meaning by it that it proceeds upon
External Evidence, and that there is
a clear Reason for Believing, that
therefore the thing Believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d may not
from within and in its own Nature
be altogether inevident and so above
the Comprehension of Reason. For
though Evidence be Contradictory
to Not Evidence in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame, yet
Evidence in the Act is no way Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to inevidence in the
Object, and Consequently does not
at all exclude it. They may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both stand together, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
what is above Reason
may be believ'd for any thing that
this Celebrated Objection from
Faith's being a Rational Act makes
to the Contrary; which truly is so
gross and palpable a Sophism, that
I cannot but wonder how it could
ever impose upon so many Learned
Men as it has done, and some of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50055:143"/>
them very acute and nice Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of things. But I hope the Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness
of it is by this so plainly and
fully detected, that I shall not think
those Heads worth much inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that shall be further imposed on
by it.</p>
            <p>11. But what then shall we say to
that Great and Fundamental Maxim
so pressingly inculcated by <hi>Des Castes</hi>
and his Followers, and not disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
of by others, that <hi>we are to
assent to not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing but what is Clear and
Evident?</hi> If to nothing but what is
Clear and Evident, how then to
what is Obscure and Inevident? Or
if to what is Obscure and Inevident,
how then to nothing but what is
Clear and Evident? Do not these
seem flat Contradictions one to the
other, and how then shall we adjust
the Matter between them? It must
be either by denying that <hi>Cartesian</hi>
Maxim to be true, or by shewing
that though it be true it does not
Contradict the Assertion here main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
but is Consistent with it.
The First way I shall not take. I
allow the Maxim to be true, and not
only so, but to be withal of the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:50055:143"/>
greatest importance of any that can
be given for the direction of the
Mind of Man in order to the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Errour. The only Remedy
and Caution against which is never
to let our Judgments prevent our
Conceptions, or to Assent to any
thing that we have only a Confuse
Notion of, and where we see only
by halves and with an imperfect
Light, or perhaps do not see at all,
but to have a Clear Understanding
of the Matter before we adventure
to judge of it, and to Maintain an
Evidence in all our Reasonings.
Which accordingly is made by M.
<hi>Malebranche</hi> the First of those Rules
which in his Treatise of Method
he lays down to be observ'd in the
inquiry after Truth. And indeed to
do otherwise is to make a wrong use
of our Intellectual Powers, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of that <hi>Liberty</hi> we have to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
Judgment till the fulness of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
requires it, and the want
of Observing this Rule is also the
Occasion of most of our Errours
and Wrong Assents,<note place="margin">Recherche de la Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rité. <hi>Tom. 2. p.</hi> 165.</note> as the same
Excellent Person shews it to have
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50055:144"/>
been in particular to the Authors of
the <hi>Scholastic</hi> Philosophy.</p>
            <p>12. I shall not therefore go about
to salve my own Assertion by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s Maxim, but rather
by shewing that according to the
true Sense and intendment of it, it
does not Contradict it. But first
we must see what the true Sense of
it is, or rather in what Sense it is
true, though this may be without
much difficulty Collected by any
attentive Reader from what has been
already said in several places of this
Chapter, wherein I have in great
Measure prevented this Objection.
But to Consider it more directly;
To verifie this Maxim that we are to
Assent to nothing but what is Clear
and Evident, the usual way has been
to distinguish between <hi>Matters</hi> of
<hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Reason.</hi> In
Matters of Faith, say they, we are
to believe many things which we
cannot Comprehend. And here then
it seems this Rule must be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.
But in Matters of Reason we
must Assent to nothing but what
is Clear and Evident. And here then
it seems it holds. Accordingly when
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50055:144"/>
'tis Objected against certain Articles
of Faith that they are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by Reason, 'tis usual to
reply that these things do not belong
to Reason <hi>&amp;c.</hi> implying that if they
did, then indeed the Objection would
be good, and the incomprehensibility
of such things would be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against assenting to them,
which implies again that in Matters
of Reason we must not Assent to
any thing but what is Clear and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
though in Matters of Faith
we may. But we have remarqu'd
already that even in Matters of Pure
Reason we are forc'd to Assent to
many things which we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
and that even in Matters
of Faith we do in a Certain Sense
Assent upon Clear Evidence. This
Distinction therefore will not do.</p>
            <p>13. In stead therefore of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
between Matters of Faith
and Matters of Reason, I think it
will be better to distinguish of <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
We are to Assent to Nothing
save what is Clear and Evident,
says our Maxim. Very Good. Now
if by Evidence here be meant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Evidence, and the Sense be that
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50055:145"/>
are to assent to nothing but what in
its own Nature, and by a Light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsic
to it, is Evident, then the
Maxim is False; and that not only
in Matters of Faith, but also in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Reason too, wherein we find
our selves often Constrain'd to assent
to things that have not this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Evidence, but are (as to what
respects the Nature of the things
themselves) altogether Obscure and
Incomprehensible. But if by Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
here be Meant Evidence at
large, abstracting from Internal or
External, and the Sense be that we
are to assent to nothing but what has
some Evidence or other, either In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
or External, or what is some
way or other evident to us, and
what we see plainly to be true by a
Light shining from within or from
without, in short, what we have
one way or other sufficient ground or
Reason to assent to, then the Maxim
is undoubtedly true, and will hold
Universally, not only in Matters of
Reason, but also in Matters of Faith
too, which (as was shewn in the
Chapter of Faith) is the Conclusion
of a Syllogism, and so a Rational
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50055:145"/>
Act, and proceedt upon as <hi>Much,</hi>
though not the <hi>Same</hi> kind of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as any other Conclusion does,
And that even in the Belief of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
things, which it
would be absurd, nay impossible to
believe, if there were no Reason to
believe things above Reason. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a saying, as I take it of
St. <hi>Austin,</hi> in one of his Letters to
this purpose, <hi>That we could not bring
our selves to believe what is Above our
Reason, if Reason it self did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us that there are things which
we should do well to believe, although
we are not capable of Comprehending
them.</hi> So then in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hort, if this
Maxim that we are to assent to
nothing but what is Evident, be
understood of Internal Evidence,
then 'tis False, not only in Matters
of Faith but also in Matters of
Reason, wherein things intrinsecally
inevident are assented to. But if it
be understood of Evidence at large
then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tis true, not only in Matters
of Reason, but also in Matters of
Faith, which (as has been often
noted) is reasonable in its Fund
and Principle, and whose Evidence
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50055:146"/>
must be Clear, though its Object may
be Obscure.</p>
            <p>14. In this large therefore and
indefinite Sense of the Word <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
the Maxim is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
We are to assent to nothing
but what is Clear and Evident,
that is, we ought to make use of
our liberty of Suspension so far as
not to give our Assent to any thing
but what all things Consider'd and
upon the whole appears Evident to
us, what by some Light or other
we see and plainly perceive to be
true, and what in one word we find
sufficient Reason either from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
or from without to Assent to.
According to that well known Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
wherewith <hi>Des Cartes</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
his wonderful System, <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil<expan>
                     <am>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>
ab ullo Credi velim, nisi quod
ipsi Evidens &amp; invicta ratio persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debit.</hi>
I would have nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
by any one but what by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and irresistible reason he shall
be Convinc'd of. And certainly he
would be very unreasonable that
should desire more. For to assent
without Evidence of one sort or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that the thing assented to is
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50055:146"/>
true, is to assent without a <hi>why</hi> or
<hi>wherefore,</hi> and to assent so is to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
without Reason, which again
is to assent not as a Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and as Man ought not, so to
be sure God cannot require such an
Assent. To assent therefore to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what upon some Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
or other is Clear and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to us, and what we have good
reason to imbrace, as true, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a Maxim of unquestionable
Truth, and of universal Extent,
that holds in all Matters whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
whether of Reason or of
Faith, in the former of which an
Assent without Evidence would be
the <hi>Act,</hi> and in the latter the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
of a <hi>Fool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15. And that this is the true Sense
wherein <hi>Des Cartes</hi> intended his
Maxim, as well as the true Sense of
the Maxim it self, is plain from the
Occasion of it which as all know
who are not utter Strangers to, or
very Negligent Readers of his Books,
was the bringing in and obtruding
so many things in the Vulgar Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
whereof the Introducers of
them had such Confuse Notions
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50055:147"/>
and of whose reality and Existence
they had no Firm and Solid Reasons
to assure them, such as Substantial
Forms, really inhering Accidents
and Qualities and the like, which
served rather to darken than clear
up the Science of Nature, and were
the Occasions of a thousand Errours
in the Superstructures that were
rais'd upon those Imaginary and
Chimerical Principles. In Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to, and as a Remedy for which,
he lays down this Fundamental
Maxim, to be Carefully observ'd by
all the Disciples of Truth in their
whole Intellectual Progress, never
to assent to any thing but what is
Clear and Evident, that is, to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but of Whose Truth and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
they are fully assured, and have
sufficient Reason to assent to. This
is the true Sense of the Maxim, this
is the Sense of its Author, and in
this Sense it is undeniably true. And
that without any prejudice to our
present Conclusion, with which (as
thus explain'd) it is very Consistent.
For 'tis now very easie to discern
that we may believe an Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
thing, and yet at the same
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50055:147"/>
time according to this <hi>Cartesian</hi>
Maxim assent to nothing but what
is Clear and Evident, because the
Evidence of Faith is External, and
that there may be an External Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to assent to a thing Internally
Inevident is no Contradiction.</p>
            <p>16. Which by the way may serve
to discover as well the Injustice as
the Impertinence, 1. Of those who
make use of this Maxim as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against the Belief of things
above Reason. 2. Of those who
take occasion from hence to traduce
the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy as favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to, and looking with a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious
Aspect upon <hi>Sociniani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and
indeed as little better than an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to it, only because it talks so
much of clear and distinct Ideas and
Conceptions, and of assenting to
nothing but what is Clear and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
But Most of all 3dly. Of
those who proceed even to traduce
the Author himself as a secret Friend
to the Cause, and no better than a
<hi>Socinian</hi> in Disguise. It would have
been indeed a Considerable Glory
and Advantage to that, (or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Interest) to have had so great
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50055:148"/>
a Master of Reason a Friend to it.
But he Certainly was not, if with
his Words he has transmitted to us
his real Thoughts, which would be
great uncharity to question, and,
with a witness, to <hi>Assent to what is
not Evident.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. He was indeed a great Master
in the Rational way, but no Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifier
or Exalter of Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
So far from that, that he seems
to have had the most inward and
feeling Sense of its Infirmities and
Defects, and the best to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
what a poor little thing 'tis to
be a Man, of any one in the World.
As may be abundantly Collected
from several passages in his Writings
(besides that the whole vein of them
runs that way) particularly those
two final Sentences wherewith he
shuts up his <hi>Principles</hi> and his <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physics,
At Nihilominus memor meae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuitatis,
nihil affirmo</hi> &amp;c. and,
<hi>Naturae nostrae infirmitas est agnoscenda.</hi>
Which plainly shew what a low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing
Sense he had both of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and of Human Nature in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tis Natural for every man
to have more and more, the wiser
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50055:148"/>
he grows, and the further he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
in Knowledge, which when
all's done (provided you take a good
Dose of it) is the best Cure of Pride
and Vanity.</p>
            <p>18. And as he had thus slender
an Opinion both of Human Reason
and his Own, so he appears to have
had also at the same such an high-raised
and elevated Sense of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
Grandeur of God, and of the
Magnificence of his Works, and
how inscrutable the Profundities
of both are to such Finite and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
Minds as ours, as can scarce
any where be parallel'd. Two
Characters certainly of Spirit, that
are none of the aptest to dispose a
Man to <hi>Socinianism.</hi> But not to
dwell any longer upon Rational
Presumptions, there is a certain
plain and deciding place in the
Writings of this Great Man (which
one would think had escaped the
Eyes of some) that is enough for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to silence the Calumny of his
being even in the least <hi>Socinianiz'd,</hi>
and to shame those that have so
little Conscience or Judgment as to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50055:149"/>
stain his Memory with it. For
who can suspect him in the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

which is now become so Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular

Use of Reason in Believing.</head>
            <p>1. REason being the great Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
and Principle of Man,
that makes him like to the Angels
above him, and distinguishes him
from the Beasts that are below him,
and which therefore only are below
him for want of the Rational Power
(being many of them in regard of
their Bodily Endowments upon a
level with him, and some beyond
him) 'tis but Just and Natural it
should appear in all that he does,
and pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide and govern in all his
Actions. For as the Conduct of the
Infinitely Wise and All-knowing
God does always carry in it the
Characters of his Essential and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial
Reason, even of him who
is the Wisdom of the Father, the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50055:150"/>
true intelligible Light, so should
also the Conduct of Man express in
Proportion the Signatures of <hi>his</hi>
Reason, and though he cannot act
by such exact and unerring Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
as his Glorious Maker, nor
yet with all that Perfection of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that even some Created In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences
express, yet at least he
should act like Himself, and not by
doing any thing absurd or unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
deny his Reasonable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>2. This has serv'd for a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to some Scholastic and Moral
Writers whereon to build a very
high, and (as some think) very
Severe Conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> that there
is no individual Action of Man pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>indifferent.</hi> Which I suppose
may be true enough of those Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his which are properly <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
I mean that are done delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
with fore-thought and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
every one of which must,
as far as I can see, be either good
or Bad according to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
wherewith they are Cloath'd,
however specifically Consider'd in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50055:151"/>
relation to their Objects only, and
as abstracted from those Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
some of them may be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.
And certainly we cannot
suppose any Action of a more Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
and adiaphorous Nature than
an <hi>unprofitable Word,</hi> and yet of such
He that is to be our Judge tells us
we shall render an Account in the
Day of Judgment. Which plainly
shews that there is no such thing as
Indifferency in the Actions of Man
as Individually and Concretely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,
but that all of them are
either good or bad according as the
Principle, Manner, End, and other
Circumstances are that attend the
doing of them. And that because
Man being a Rational Creature the
Order of Reason is due at least to
all his deliberate Actions, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
ought to carry the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of a Rational Nature in
them, the want of which will be
enough to render any of them evil
and imperfect.</p>
            <p>3. But then if Reason ought to
pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide and direct in all the deliberate
Actions of Man much more ought
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50055:151"/>
it in things of the greatest Moment
and Consequence, wherein his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and Welfare is more nearly
Concern'd, and which accordingly
require his greatest Consideration,
and the use of the best Light that
he has. And because there cannot
be a thing of greater Consequence
and Concernment to him than <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
upon which both his Present
and his Future, his Temporal and
his Eternal Happiness does intirely
depend, hence it follows that the
Principal Use he ought to make of
his Rational Faculty is in Religion,
that here if any where he ought to
Think, Consider, Advise, Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
Reason and Argue, Consult
both his own Light and that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
neglect no advantage that
may be had from Nature or Art,
from Books or Men, from the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or the Dead, but imploy all
possible Means for his direction and
Information,<note place="margin">Psal. 32. 10.</note> and not be as the <hi>Horse
and Mule which have no Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
For 'twas for this great End
and Purpose that his Reason was
given him, and this is the best Use
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50055:152"/>
he can make of it. As for the Study
of Nature, that turns to too little
an Account, and as for the Affairs
of Civil Life they in themselves and
without relation to another World,
are too little and inconsiderable for
us to suppose that our Reason was
given us for the Management of
<hi>them.</hi> Religion only bears propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to so Noble a Faculty, is most
worthy of its Application, and can
also best reward the due Exercise and
Use of it, and accordingly 'tis up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Religion that it will be best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd.</p>
            <p>4. Nor is there any thing in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that may justly fear to be
brought before the Bar of Human
Reason, or to undergo the Test of
its severest Discussion. The <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
Religion indeed Might, for
which Cause those that drew its
Picture cast a Shade upon a great
part of it, and would not Venture
to expose it to Common View.
And the too much <hi>Heathenized</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of some <hi>Christians</hi> may also
very deservedly retire behind the
Curtain, and decline coming to the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50055:152"/>
Light, for fear the Absurdities and
Monstrous Inconsistencies of it should
be laid open. But certainly there is
not any thing, neither <hi>Doctrine</hi> nor
<hi>Precept</hi> in that true Religion that is
reveal'd by God, in Evangelical
Christianity, that need fly the Light
of Reason, or refuse to be tried by
it. Christian Religion is all over a
<hi>Reasonable Service,</hi> and the Author
of it is too reasonable a Master to
impose any other, or to require (as
his Vicar does) that Men should
follow him blindfold, and pull out
their eyes to become his Disciples.
No, he that Miraculously gave Sight
to so many has no need of, nor
pleasure in the <hi>Blind,</hi> nor has his
Divine Religion any occasion for such
Judges or Professors. For it is the
Religion of the Eternal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
Wisdom, the Divine <hi>Word,</hi>
the true Light of the World, and
the Universal Reason of all Spirits,
and 'tis impossible that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
any thing that Contradicts the
Measures of sound Discourse, or the
immutable Laws of Truth, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is that any Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50055:153"/>
should be truly Opposite to
Right Reason (hower it may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be <hi>Above</hi> it) or that any thing
should be <hi>Theologically</hi> true, which
is <hi>Philosophically</hi> False, as some with
great profoundness are pleas'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish.
For the Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is as truly from God as the
Light of Revelation is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though the latter of these Lights
may exceed and out-shine the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
it can never be Contrary to
it. God as the Soveraign Truth
cannot reveal any thing against Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and as the Soveraign Goodness
he cannot require us to believe any
such thing. Nay to descend some
degrees below this, he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
us to believe, not only what
is <hi>against</hi> Reason, but even what
is <hi>without</hi> it. For to believe any
thing without Reason is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
Act, and 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that God should ever require
an unreasonable act, especially from
a Reasonable Creature.</p>
            <p>5. We therefore not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the use of Reason in
Religion, but also that 'tis in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50055:153"/>
that 'tis chiefly to be used;
so far are we from denying the
Use of it there. And it is a little
unfairly done of our Adversaries so
much to insinuate the Contrary as
they do. For I cannot take it for less
than such an Insinuation, when they
are arguing with us against the
Belief of the Christian Mysteries
to run out as they usually do into
Harangues and Flourishes (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
by the way, I know none more
guilty than the Author of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
not Mysterious</hi>) about the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the Rational Nature of
Faith, what a Reasonable Act the
One is, and what a Reasonable
Service the Other is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if
we were against the Use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in Religion, or were for a
Blind, Groundless, and Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Faith, or if because we
hold the Belief of things above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
therefore we are for having
no Reason for our Belief. This I
say is an unfair Insinuation, and
such as argues some want either
of Judgment or Sincerity (I don't
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:50055:154"/>
know which) in those that sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
it. For they seem plainly by
running so much upon this Vein
to imply as if it were part of
the Question between us, whether
there be any Use of Reason in
Religion, or whether Faith is to
be Founded upon Reason or No.
But Now this is no part of the
Controversie that lies between us,
we acknowledge the Use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in Religion as well as they,
and are as little for a Senseless and
Irrational Faith as they can be.
This therefore being Common to
us both is no part of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and they do ill to insinuate
that it is by so many Popular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamatory
Strains upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Religion, and in
particular of Faith, whereas they
do, or should know, that the
thing in Question between us is
not whether there be any Use of
Reason to be made in Believing,
but only what it is, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the true Use of it does Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:50055:154"/>6. Now this we may determine
in a few words, having already
laid the grounds of it. For since
the Incomprehensibility of a thing
is no Concluding Argument against
the Truth of it, nor Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against the Belief of it (as is
shewn in the three foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
it is plain that the proper
Office and Business of a Believers
Reason is to Examin and Inquire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Not whether the thing proposed be
Comprehensible or not, but only
whether it be Reveal'd by God
or No, since if it be, the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibleness
of it will be no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against it. That therefore
ought to be no part of its Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
or Deliberation, because in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is not to the purpose to
Consider whether such a thing be,
when if it were it would be no
just Objection. The only Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
thing then here is whether
such a Proposition be indeed from
God, and has him for its Author
or no. And here Reason is to clear
her Eyes, put the Matter in the
best Light, call in all the Assistance
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:50055:155"/>
that may be had both from the
Heart and the Head, and determine
of the thing with all the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and all the Sincerity that
she can. But as to the Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
or Incomprehensibility of
the Article, this is quite besides the
Question, and ought therefore to be
no part of her scruting or debate,
since if it were never so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
her Comprehension it would
be never the less proper Object for
her Belief.</p>
            <p>7. The Sum is, the Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
of a thing is no Argument
against the Belief of it, therefore in
the believing of a thing, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
work of my Reason is not to
Consider whether it be incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible.
But when a thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to me as from God, all that
my Reason has to do in this Case
is Seriously, Soberly, Diligently,
Impartially, and (I add) <hi>Humbly</hi>
to Examine whether it comes with
the true <hi>Credentials</hi> of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and has him for its real Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
or no. This is all that Reason
has to do in this Matter, and when
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:50055:155"/>
she has done this, she is to rise from
the Seat of Judgement, and resign
it to Faith, which either gives or
refuses her Assent, Not as the thing
proposed is <hi>Comprehensible</hi> or not
<hi>Comprehensible,</hi> but as 'tis either <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Reason in Believing
be to Consider, not the Internal
Evidence of the thing, whether the
Article be Comprehensible or no,
but whether it be truly reveal'd by
God, I say if these things are so, as
we have abundantly prov'd them
to be, then from these Premises the
Clear and undeniable Consequence
is that the Incomprehensibility of

may be improved into a Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Argument for them, and such
as may serve to recommend them
to our Faith, inasmuch as it is a
very strong Presumption that they
are of no Human Origin, but have
God for their Authour, it being
reasonable to suppose that what does
so very much transcend the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:50055:157"/>
of Man to Comprehend, does
no less exceed his Ability to invent.
And accordingly the Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of our Mysteries for which
some will have them to be false, is
made use of by a very Rational
Authour as an Argument of their
Truth. And it may be worth
while to let the Reader see how he
Manages it in relation to One of the
Most Sublime of them.</hi>

may establish themselves
in time. But that a Truth so Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,
so far removed from Sense, so
Cross to Human Reason, so Contrary
in short to all Nature as is this great
Mystery of our Faith, that a Truth
I say of this Character should spread
it self Vniversally, and Triumph over
all Nations where the Apostles had
Preach'd the Gospel, supposing that
these First Preachers of our Faith
had neither known any thing, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid
any thing of this Mystery, this Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is what cannot be Conceiv'd by
any one that has never so little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Human Nature. That there
should be Heretics that should oppose a
Doctrine so Sublime is nothing strange,
nor am I surprized at it. On the
Contrary I should be very much if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any body had opposed it. This
Truth wanted but little of being quite
oppress'd. 'Tis very possible. For
'twill be always reckon'd a Commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Vndertaking to attaque that which
seems to Clash with Reason. But that
at length the Mystery of the Trinity
should prevail, and should establish it
self Vniversally wherever the Religion
of Iesus Christ was receiv'd, without
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50055:158"/>
its being known and taught by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
without an Authority and a
Force Divine, there needs methinks
but an Ordinary Measure of good Sense
to acknowledge that nothing in the
World is less Probable. For it is not
in the least likely that a Doctrine so
Divine, so above Reason, so remov'd
from whatever may strike the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and the Senses, should Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
Come into the Thought of
Man.</p>
            <p>3. You see here how this Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Person strikes Light out of
Darkness, by improving even the
Incomprehensibility of the Christian
Mysteries into an Argument for the
Truth and Credibility of them, and
so turning the Artillery of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
against themselves. This
indeed is a bold Atchievement, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
as Fortunate a one too, for I think
there is a great deal of Force and
Weight in his Reasoning. But I
need not push the Matter so far,
nor follow so home into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Camp, as to plant their own
Cannon against them. 'Tis suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to the design of the present
undertaking, and as much as I am
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50055:159"/>
led to by the Principles before E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish'd,
to Conclude that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
of the Christian
Mysteries is no Argument against
them. This therefore I insist upon,
and (if my Reason mightily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me not) dare ingage finally
to stand to. For if (as it has been
shewn) the Incomprehensibility of a
thing in general be no Conclusive
Argument against either the Truth
or the Credibility of it, then since
Negative Propositions do separate
the Attribut from the Subject ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to all the Extent which the
Subject has in the Proposition, what
Consequence can be more Clear
than that the Incomprehensibility of
our Mysteries is no Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Belief of them? I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
therefore that it is None, and
that they ought never the less to be
believ'd for their being Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible,
supposing them otherwise
sufficiently Reveal'd.</p>
            <p>4. Whether they are so or no is
besides my Undertaking at present
to examin, nor need I ingage my
Pen in this Question, since the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative
side of it is so Obvious
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50055:159"/>
to every Eye that can but read the
Bible, and has been withal so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
and convincingly made good
by those abler hands which have
gone into the Detail of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
and undertaken the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
defence of the Christian Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
This part of the Argument
therefore being so well discharged
already, I shall Concern my self no
further with it than only in Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and Pursuance of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Principles to bestow upon it
this one single Necessary Remarque,
<hi>viz.</hi> That as the Incomprehensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Christian Mysteries is no
just Objection against the Belief of
them supposing them otherwise suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
Reveal'd, so neither is it a
just Objection against their being so
Reveal'd, supposing the plain, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
and literal Construction of the
Words does naturally and directly
lead to such a Sense. And that it
does so is not I think offer'd to be
denied, and the thing it self is plain
enough to extort an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but then 'tis pretended that
there is a Necessity of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to a different Construction,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50055:160"/>
and to understand the words in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sense, because of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivableness
and incomprehensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that which their proper and
Grammatical Scheme does Exhibit.
But by the Tenour of this whole
Discourse it evidently appears that
there is no such Necessity, since to
admit an incomprehensible Sense has
nothing absurd or inconvenient in it,
and that because the Incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of a thing is no Argument of
the Untruth of it. From whence it
plainly follows that 'tis no more an
Objection against its being Reveal'd
than 'tis an Objection against the
Belief of it supposing it were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd,
there being nothing but the
untruth of a thing that can be a
reasonable Obstruction against ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>5. We are therefore to take the
Words of Scripture according to
their proper and most Natural Sense,
and not seek out for Forc'd and
Strain'd Interpretations upon the
account of the Incomprehensibility
of that which is apparently Genuin
and Natural. And if the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be otherwise plain, and such as
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:50055:160"/>
we would accept of in another Case,
and about matters which we can
well Comprehend, we ought not to
think it the less so because the Sense
of it so understood is such as we
cannot reconcile to our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Conceptions of things.
For notwithstanding that it may be
true, since by this time we may be
sufficiently satisfied that there are
many Incomprehensible Truths.
The Incomprehensibility of a thing
is therefore no Argument against its
being Reveal'd, any more than 'tis
against the Belief of it supposing it
were. Which opens an immediate
Entrance to the Christians Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which I doubt not would be
thought sufficiently Reveal'd were
it not for the incomprehensibility of
them, the only Objection that can
be pretended against their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>6. I have hitherto argued upon
the Supposition that the Mysteries
of Christianity (those Doctrines I
mean that are so call'd) are above
Reason, and such as do transcend
our Comprehension, and have shewn
that even upon that Supposition
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50055:161"/>
there is no reasonable Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Belief of them, that they
are never the less Believable for their
being Incomprehensible. But what
if I should recall this Concession,
and put our Adversaries to the proof
that they are indeed above Human
Reason and Comprehension. They
cannot be ignorant that there are
those that Contend they are not,
and with great shew of reason offer
to prove it, by endeavouring to
render a Conceivable and Intelligible
Account of them. If these Men
should be in the right (which I do
not think necessary at present to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into) it would be a further
Advantage to our Cause, and such
as though I do not now insist upon
it, I need not lose the Benefit of.
But if it should prove that they are
not in the right, the Cause of our
Christian Mysteries is not much
Concern'd in the loss of that Pillar,
but can support it self well enough
without it, as having another that
is sufficient to bear its weight, since
though we should suppose these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Doctrines to be never so Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
to our <hi>Reason,</hi> it does
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50055:161"/>
by no Consequence follow (as from
the Argument of this whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is apparent) that therefore
they may not be due Objects of our
<hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Should any one now be so fond
of Objection as to draw one against
the Mysteries of Christianity from
the use of the Word Mystery in
Scripture, which knows no other
Mysteries but such as before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of them were undiscover'd,
not Considering whether they were
in themselves Conceivable or no, I
must tell him that I do not know
that ever I met in any Controversie
with a less pertinent Objection, as
much as it is made of by a late Bold
Writer,<note place="margin">Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity not My<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 90.</note> who heaps together a great
many Texts to shew the signification
of the Word Mystery in the New
Testament, that it signifies not
things in themselves inconceivable,
but only such as were not known
before they were Reveal'd. Well,
be it so as this Gentleman pretends
(though I believe upon Examination
it would appear otherwise) yet what
is this to the purpose? For do we
Dispute about <hi>Names</hi> or <hi>Things?</hi>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:50055:162"/>
The Question is not whether the
Scripture expresses inconceivable
things by the Name of Mysteries,
but whether there be not things in
Scripture above our Conception (call
them by what Name you will) and
if there be, whether their being so
above our Conception be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
why they should not be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd.
Now to these inconceivable
things it has been the Common Use
of Church-Writers to apply the
Name of <hi>Mysteries,</hi> which, if the
thing be granted, he must be a great
Lover of Cavil and Wrangle that
will Contend about it. But the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> has already
prevented me in the Consideration
of this Objection,<note place="margin">Serm. of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith.</note> for which reason,
together with the Frivolousness of
it, I shall pursue it no further.</p>

            <p>1. AND thus I have led my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
through a long Course
of Various Reasoning, and perhaps
as far as he is willing to follow me,
though I hope his Journey has not
been without some <hi>Pleasure</hi> that may
<hi>deceive,</hi> and some <hi>Profit</hi> that may
in part <hi>reward</hi> the Labour of it. I
have shewn him what <hi>Reason</hi> is, and
what <hi>Faith</hi> is, that so he may see
from the Absolute Natures of each
what Habitude and Relation they
have to one another, and how the
Darkness and Obscurity of the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may Consist with the Light and
Evidence of the Former. I have also
Consider'd the Distinction of things
Above Reason and things Contrary
to Reason, and shewn it to be real
and well-grounded, and to have all
that is requisite to a good Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50055:163"/>
And for the further Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of it, I have also shewn that
Human Reason is not the Measure
of Truth. From which Great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
(which I was the more willing
to discourse at large and thoroughly
to settle and establish because of its
Moment and Consequence to the
Concern in hand) I have deduced
that weighty Inference, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Incomprehensibility of a
thing is no Concluding Argument of
its not being true, which Consequence
for the greater Security of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is so Considerable in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Controversie, I have also prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Backwards,</hi> by shewing that if the
Incomprehensibility of a thing were
an Argument of its not being true,
then Human Reason (contrary to
what was before demonstrated)
would be the Measure of Truth.
Whence I infer again <hi>ex Absurdo,</hi>
that therefore the Incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of a thing is no Argument of
its not being true. From this last
Consequence I infer another of no
less Moment and Consideration, <hi>viz.</hi>
That therefore the Incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of a thing is no Argument
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50055:163"/>
against the Belief of it neither,
where also I Consider that seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Opposite Maxim of <hi>Des Cartes,</hi>
that we are to Assent to nothing but
what is Clear and Evident, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
it to the other Position.
Whence my next step was to state
the true use of Reason in Believing,
which I shew'd to Consist not in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
the Credibility of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
but in taking account of the
Certainty of the Revelation, which
when once resolv'd of we are no
longer to Dispute, but Believe. In
fine, I have made an Application of
these Considerations to the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Christian Faith, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they are never the less to be
Believ'd for being Mysteries, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
them otherwise sufficiently
Reveal'd, against which also I have
shewn their Incomprehensibility to
be no Objection. So that every way
the Great Argument against the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of the Christian Faith taken
from the Incomprehensibility of
them vanishes and sinks into nothing.
In all which I think I have effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
overthrown the General and
Fundamental Ground of <hi>Socinianism,</hi>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:50055:164"/>
and truely in great Measure that of
<hi>Deism</hi> too, whose best Argument
against Reveal'd Religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
is, because the <hi>Christian,</hi> upon
all Accounts the most preferable of
those that pretend to be Reveal'd,
Contains so many things in it which
transcend the Comprehension of
Human Understanding. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Best Argument be really a
good one or no, the whole Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
of this Discourse may suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
shew, and whoever knows
how to distinguish Sophistry from
good Reasoning, may easily judge.</p>
            <p>2. And now you <hi>Gentlemen</hi> for
whose sakes I have been at the pains
to write this Treatise, give me leave
in a few words to Address my self a
little more particularly to you, and
to Expostulate with you. Whether
it be the good opinion you have of
your Cause, or the present Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
you have to appear in
the behalf of it that invites you
so freely to Come abroad as you have
done of late, you have certainly (to
give your Courage its due) taken a
very rational and Polite Age for it,
and I hope the Wise Conduct of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:50055:164"/>
Providence may turn this juncture
to the Advantage of the Truth, and
that the Light to which you have
adventur'd to expose your Novel
Opinions may serve to make you see
their Absurdities, if you do not too
Obstinately shut your Eyes against
it. Some of you are Considerable
Masters of Reason (otherwise truly
I should not think it worth while
to argue with you) and you all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
great <hi>Devotion</hi> to it (I wish
you do not make it an <hi>Idol</hi>) and to
be very Zealous and Affectionate
Disciples of it. Reason is the great
Measure by which you pretend to
go, and the Judge to whom in all
things you appeal. Now I accept
of your Measure, and do not refuse
to be tried in the Court of your own
Chusing. Accordingly you see I
have dealt with you all along upon
the Ground of Logic, and in a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
way, being very Confident
that Reason alone will discover to
you your undue Elevations of it,
and the Errours you have been mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into by that Occasion, if you do
but Consult even this Oracle of yours
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:50055:165"/>
as you ought, and make a right use
of its Sacred Light.</p>
            <p>3. But I am afraid you do not.
Instead of imploying your Reason
in the first place to examin the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> whether
such a thing be truly Reveal'd, and
if so, to believe it notwithstanding
its being incomprehensible, your
Method is to begin with the <hi>Quality</hi>
of the <hi>Object,</hi> to Consider whether
it be Comprehensible or no, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
to proceed in your Belief
or Disbelief of its being Reveal'd.
'Tis true indeed you are not so gross
as to argue thus, this is Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
therefore 'tis Reveal'd. But
you cannot deny but that you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
thus, this is Incomprehensible,
therefore 'tis not Reveal'd, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon this general Principle that
though whatever is Comprehensible
is not therefore presently Reveal'd,
yet whatever is Reveal'd must be
Comprehensible. But now judge
you whether this be not to make
your Reason the Rule and Measure
of Divine Revelation, that is, that
God can reveal nothing to you but
what you can Comprehend, or, that
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:50055:165"/>
you are able to Comprehend all that
God can possibly Reveal (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
how is your not being able to
Comprehend any thing an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of its not being Reveal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d) I
say Consider whether this be not to
set up your Reason as the Rule of
Revelation, and Consider again whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this does not resolve either into
a very low Opinion you have of God
and his Infinite Perfections, or an
extravagantly high one you have of
your selves and your own Rational
indowments.</p>
            <p>4. And yet as if this were not
Presumption enough, do you not
also make your Reason the Rule of
<hi>Faith,</hi> as well as of <hi>Revelation?</hi>
To be the Rule of Faith is a very
Great thing, and yet so far 'tis plain
that you make your Reason the Rule
of Faith that you will allow nothing
to be believ'd but whose Bottom
you can Sound by that Line, this
being an avow'd Principle with you
that you are to believe nothing but
what you can Comprehend. But
hold a little, before your Reason can
be the Measure of <hi>Faith,</hi> must it not
be the Measure of <hi>Truth?</hi> And I
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:50055:166"/>
pray Consider seriously, and tell me
truly, do you verily think in your
Consciences that your Reason is the
Measure of Truth? Do you think
your Rational Faculties proportion'd
to every intelligible Object, and that
you are able to Comprehend all the
things that are, and that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the whole extent of Science
too high, too difficult, or too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse
for you, no one part of this
vast Intellectual Sea but what you
can wade through? If you say yes,
besides the Blasphemous Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and <hi>Luciferian</hi> Arrogance of
the Assertion, and how little it falls
on this side of <hi>Similis ero Altissimo,</hi>
which banish'd the vain-glorious
Angel from the Court of Heaven,
because nothing less would Content
his Aspiring Ambition than to be as
God there (though by the way there
is more Sense and Congruity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in pretending to be a God in
Heaven, than to be a God upon
Earth) I say besides this, I would
put it to your more sober thought
to Consider whether it be not every
whit as great an Extremity in the
way of Rational Speculation to Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50055:166"/>
so far as to pretend to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
every thing, as to say with
the <hi>Sceptics</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> that we
know nothing: The latter of which
however in regard of its Moral
Consequences may be more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
and safely affirm'd than the
Former, since in that we only hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
degrade our selves, and are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to sink down into the Level of
Brutes, whereas in this we aspire to
what is infinitely above us, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
our selves into the Seat of God.
And you know an Excess of Self-dejection
is of the two the more
tolerable Extreme. But if you say
that your Reason is not the Measure
of Truth (as upon this, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Considerations there lies a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
upon you to Confess) how
then I pray comes it to be the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of your <hi>Faith,</hi> and how come
you to lay down this for a Maxim
that you will believe Nothing but
what you can Comprehend? Why,
if your Reason be not the Measure
of Truth (and you your selves Care
not, and I believe are asham'd in
terms to say that it is) then do you
not evidently discern that there is
no Consequence from the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibility
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50055:167"/>
of a thing to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibility
of it, and that you have
no reason to deny your Belief to a
thing as true merely upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of its incomprehensibility.
And do you not then plainly see
that your great Maxim falls to the
ground, that you are to believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what you can Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend?
But if yet notwithstanding
this you will still adhere to your
beloved Maxim, and resolve to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Nothing but what you can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
and clear up to your Reason,
then I pray Consider whether this
will not necessarily lead you back to
that Absurd, and withal Odious and
Invidious Principle, and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you your selves care not to own,
viz. <hi>That your Reason is the Measure of
Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. But why do you not care to
own it? Do you not see at the
first cast of your Eye that you are
unavoidably driven upon it by your
profess'd Maxim? Or if you do not
think fit to own it (as indeed it is a
good handsom Morsel to swallow)
why do you not then renounce that
Maxim of yours which is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:50055:167"/>
Consequence of it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
resolves into it? Why will
you whose Pretensions are so high to
Reason act so directly against the
Laws of it, as to own that implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and by Consequence which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your Head nor your Heart will
serve you to acknowledge in broad
and express Terms? Be a little
more Consistent with your own
Sentiments at least, if not with
Truth, and be not your selves a
<hi>Mystery,</hi> while you pretend not to
believe any. If you do not care to
own the Principle, then deny the
Consequence, or if you will not let go
the Consequence, then stand by and
own the Principle. Either speak out
boldly and roundly that your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is the Measure of Truth, or if
you think that too gross a defiance
to Sense, Experience, Religion and
Reason too to be professedly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
then be so ingenuous to us,
and so Consistent with your selves as
to renounce your Maxim of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nothing but what you can Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
since you cannot hold it but
with that Absurd Principle; And
which is therefore a Certain Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50055:168"/>
that you ought not to hold
it.</p>
            <p>6. And are you sure that you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
do, I mean so as to act by it,
that you hold it <hi>in Hypothesi</hi> as well
as <hi>in Thesi?</hi> Do you never assent
to any thing but what you can Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend?
Are there not many things
in the <hi>Sciences</hi> which you find a
pressing Necessity to Subscribe to,
though at the same time you cannot
conceive their <hi>Modus,</hi> or account for
their Possibility? But you'l say per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
these are things of a Physical
and Philosophical Consideration, and
such as have no relation to Religion.
True, they are so, but then besides
that this visibly betrays the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your ground, since if the
incomprehensibility of a thing were
a good Argument against assenting
to the Truth of it, it would be so
throughout, in the things of Nature,
as well as in the things of Religion,
I would here further demand of you
why you are so particularly shy of
admitting incomprehensible things in
Religion, why is it there only that
you seem so stiffly and zealously to
adhere to your Maxim of Believing
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:50055:168"/>
nothing but what you can Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend?
Since there are so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
things, or if you please,
<hi>Mysteries,</hi> in the Works of Nature
and of Providence, why not in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
Nay where should one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to find Mysteries if not there,
where all the things that are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
are Reveal'd by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and many of them concerning Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and his own Infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
And what deference do we
pay to God more than Man, if either
we suppose that he cannot reveal
Truths to us which we cannot
Comprehend, or if we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them if he does? Nay may
it not be rather said that we do not
pay him so much, since we think it
adviseable to receive many things
from our Tutours and Masters upon
their Authority only though we do
not Comprehend them our selves,
and justifie our doing so by that well
known and in many Cases very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Maxim, <hi>Discentem oportet
Credere.</hi> But as there is no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
like the Divine, so if that <hi>Motto</hi>
become any School, 'tis that of
Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:50055:169"/>7. Now 'tis in this School that
you profess to be Scholars, and why
then will you be such Opiniative
and uncompliant Disciples as to
refuse to receive the Sublime Lectures
read to you by your Divine and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Master, merely because they
are too high for you, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Conceive them, when at the
same time any one of your that is
not a Mathematician (pardon the
Supposition) would I doubt not take
it upon the word of him that is so
that <hi>the Diameter of a Square is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commensurable
to the Side,</hi> though he
did not know how to demonstrate,
or so much as Conceive it himself.
Since then you would express such
implicit regard to the Authority of
a fallible, though Learned, Man,
shall not the Divine weigh infinitely
heavier with you, and since you
would not stick to assent to things
above your Conception in Human
and Natural Sciences, why are you
so violently set against Mysteries in
Religion, whereof God is not only
the <hi>Authour,</hi> but in great Measure
the <hi>Object</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:50055:169"/>8. You know very well that in
the great Problem of the Divisibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Quantity there are Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibilities
on both sides, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inconceivable that Quantity
should, and it being also inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
that it should not be divided
infinitely. And yet you know again
that as being parts of a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
one of them must necessarily
be true. Possibly you may not be
able with the utmost Certainty and
without all hesitation to determine
which that is, but however you
know in the general that One of
them, indeterminately, must be true
(which by the way is enough to
Convince you that the Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of a thing is no Argument
against the truth of it) and you
must also further grant that God
whose Understanding is infinite does
precisely and determinately know
which of them is so. Now suppose
God should Reveal this, and make
it an Article of Faith. 'Tis not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
likely that he will, it being so
much beneath the Majesty, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the End and Intention of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
whose great Design is the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:50055:170"/>
direction of our Life and Manners,
and not the improvement of our
Speculation. But suppose I say he
should, would you not believe it?
If not, then you must suppose either
that there is no Necessity that either
of the two parts (which yet are
Contradictory) should be true, or
that though one of them be true yet
that God does not known which
is so, or that though he does
know which is so, yet he does not
deal faithfully in revealing that
which is the Right, all which are
extravagant Suppositions, and such
as Men of your Sense and Reason
can never allow. But then if you
say (as you must) that you would
believe it, then I pray what becomes
of your Maxim of believing nothing
but what you can Comprehend, and
why do you so stiffly plead the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
of an Article of
Faith against the Belief of it, and
why must there be no Mysteries in
Religion? I say in Religion, where
if any where our Reason might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to find things above its Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
unreachable Heights, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable
Depths, and where God
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:50055:170"/>
is not only the <hi>Revealer</hi> (as in the
Case now supposed) but also the
<hi>Object Reveal'd.</hi> For is it not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to suppose that there are
things more incomprehensible in
God than in Nature, and if you
would receive an Incomprehensible
Revelation of his concerning his
<hi>Works,</hi> how much rather ought
you to admit the same concerning
<hi>Himself?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. And this gives me occasion to
say something to you concerning
the Doctrine of the <hi>Holy Trinity.</hi>
This great Article of the Christian
Faith you have a particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
against and will not believe,
and that because it so utterly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
the Force of Reason to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how the same undivided and
Numerically One Simple Essence of
God should be Communicated to
Three really distinct Persons, so as
that there should be both a Unity
in Trinity, and a Trinity in Unity.
This however, as inconceivable as it
seems, some will not yield to be so
far Above Reason but that a Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
and Intelligible Account may
be given of it, which accordingly
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:50055:171"/>
they have essay'd to do by several
<hi>Hypotheses.</hi> But I decline at present
all advantage that may be had from
them, or any other that may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
to render this an intelligible
Article. You know I Reason all
along upon the Contrary Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that those Articles of the
Christian Faith which we call My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
are really incomprehensible,
and only go to invalidate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
that is drawn from thence
in prejudice of their Belief. Well
then for once we will give you what
you stand for, that the Doctrine of
the <hi>Trinity</hi> is indeed utterly above
Reason. You have our leave to
suppose it as incomprehensible as
you please. But then you are to
Consider (besides what has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
been discours'd concerning the
Nullity of the Consequence from
the incomprehensibility of a thing
to its incredibility) that this is a
Revelation of God concerning <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
and do you pretend to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the Nature and Essence of
God? If you do, then your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is as infinite as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.
But if you do not, then the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:50055:171"/>
incomprehensibility of this Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Article ought to be no Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with you against the Belief of it,
since if it be, you must be driven to
say that you Comprehend the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, which I hope you have
too much Religion as well as Reason
to affirm.</p>
            <p>10. And indeed if we meet with
so many insuperable Difficulties in
the Search of Nature, much more
may we in the Contemplation of
its Author, if the Works of God
do so puzzle and baffle our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
much more may they
Confess their Deficiency when God
himself is their Object, and if we
are not able to explain <hi>Creation,</hi> or
give an Account how the Material
World issued in time from the great
Fountain of Being, much less may
we be supposed able to explain the
Eternal and ineffable <hi>Generation</hi>
of his Divine and Consubstantial
World. But what then, shall we
not Believe it? Or rather shall
we not say upon this Occasion
with the Pious and Ingenious Mr.
<hi>Wesley,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Life of Christ, <hi>p.</hi> 184.</note>
               <q>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:50055:172"/>
                  <l>Ineffable the way, for who
Th' Almighty to perfection ever
knew?</l>
                  <l>But He himself has said it, and it
must be true.</l>
               </q>
Nay to go lower yet, if there be
so many things relating to Extension,
Motion and Figure (of all which
we have Clear Ideas) which we
cannot Comprehend, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
from them Propositions which
we know not what to make of,
with how much greater reason may
we expect to find what we cannot
Understand in the Nature of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Being, whereof we have no
adequate Idea. And indeed we
meet with so many Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibles
in the School of Nature that
one would think we should be too
much familiarized to 'em to think
them strange in that of Religion,
and God seems on purpose to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
and discipline our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with what is above them in
Natural things, that so we might
be the less surprized to find what
passes our Conception in his own
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:50055:172"/>
Infinite Essence. Here then at least
you may Confess your Ignorance,
and that without any reproach to
your Understandings, which were
indeed intended for the <hi>Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
but not for the <hi>Comprehension</hi>
of an Infinite Object. You need
not therefore here be backward to
own that you meet with what you
cannot Comprehend (it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
be a Mistery if you should not)
nor think it any disgrace to have
your Eyes dazzl'd with that Light
at the insupportable Glory of which
even the <hi>Seraphin</hi> Veil and Cover
theirs.</p>
            <p>11. You may perceive by this that
your Denial of the Doctrine of the
Trinity because of the Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
of it proceeds upon no
<hi>good</hi> Consequence, but you are also
further desired to Consider the very
<hi>Bad</hi> one that it Naturally leads to.
You refuse to receive this Article
because you cannot Comprehend it,
but besides that your Reason for
this your refusal is not good unless
you could be supposed to Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
every thing, even <hi>the Deep
things of God.</hi> Pray Consider what
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:50055:173"/>
the Consequence will be if you
pursue your Principle to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
and Conduct your selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
by its Measures. Will it not
inevitably lead you to the denial of
all Religion? This perhaps may
startle you, but think again. Will
not this necessarily lead you to the
denial of God the Foundation of all
Religion? For if you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Trinal Distinction of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the Divine Essence because
you cannot conceive how such a
thing can be, then may you not for
the same reason refuse as well to
believe the Divine Essence it self,
some of whose incommunicable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
such as his <hi>Self Existence,
Eternity, Immensity,</hi> &amp;c. are as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
as any thing in the
Notion of the Trinity can be. So
that if you will but follow your
Measure from the denial of <hi>Three</hi>
you may be quickly brought to deny
even <hi>One.</hi> So directly does your
Principle of Believing nothing but
what you can Comprehend lead to
<hi>Atheism,</hi> and that with such swift
and wide strides, that were it not
for the assistance of the same expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:50055:173"/>
your Friends the <hi>Deists</hi> would
hardly be able to follow you.</p>
            <p>12. And now Sirs what do you
think of your Principle? Is it not a
goodly one, and richly worth all
the Passion and Zeal you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
for it? You know very well
that <hi>M. Abbadie</hi> in his Excellent
Treatise of the Divinity of Christ
has shewn you that upon one of
your grounds (<hi>viz.</hi> the denial of
that Article) the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is preferable to the Christian,
and indeed that you are Obliged by
it to renounce Christianity and turn
<hi>Mahumetans.</hi> This truly was a
home-thrust. But yet you see the
Consequence of your general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
reaches further, as leading your
not only out of Christianity, but
out of all Religion whether Natural
or Reveal'd, even beyond Deism,
even into Atheism it self. If it does
not actually lead you thither the
fault is not in the Principle, whose
Connexion with that Consequence
is natural enough, but 'tis because
you are not so Consistent with your
selves as to follow it. And indeed
'tis a great Happiness that you do
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:50055:174"/>
not, (since if you were here better
Logicians you would be worse Men)
though it would be a much greater,
if for the danger of being more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with it you would be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to lay it down.</p>
            <p>13. And that you may be so be
pleased further to Consider, that
though this Principle of yours does
not eventually carry you as far as
<hi>Atheism,</hi> because perhaps the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridness
of the Conclusion may be a
Counterweight against the Force of
the Premises (though you see it
Naturally tends that way) yet there
is very great danger of its leading
you Effectually into <hi>Deism,</hi> that not
being not accounted now-a-days
such a very frightful thing. For as
long as you hold that what is above
Human Reason is not to be Believ'd,
and upon that Account reject the
Christian Mysteries, because they
are above Reason, you lie at the
Mercy of that Argument that shall
prove to you that these Mysteries are
indeed Reveal'd, and that the Genuin
and Natural Sense of the Sacred
Text declares for them. For if you
once come to be convinc'd of that,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:50055:174"/>
you will then be Obliged in Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of your Principle to renounce
that Religion which reveals such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
things, that is the <hi>Christian,</hi>
which will be a shrew'd (indeed an
invincible) Temptation to you to
throw up all Reveal'd Religion, and
so to turn perfect <hi>Deists.</hi> And I pray
God it may not have that Effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you.</p>
            <p>14. But as to the parting with
Christianity that you will be further
tempted to do upon another account.
For when you have by your Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
stript it, or I may say rather <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowell'd</hi>
it of its great and adorable
Mysteries, it will appear such a poor,
lank, slender thing to you that you
will hardly think it Considerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be reveal'd as a New and
more perfect, Institution by God, or
to be receiv'd as such by thinking
and Considering Men. For what
will such find so considerable in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
(especially as a new Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
what so visibly peculiar and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
distinguishing, what that may
infallibly set it above an Humane
Institution, if it be once robb'd of its
Mysteries? They may indeed think
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:50055:175"/>
it a good plain piece of Morals, and
such as exceeds any other of a
known Humane Composure, but
how are they sure but that the
Invention of Man may be able to
rise so high, as to Compose such a
System as this, if you set aside its
Mysteries? Which therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but look upon of all the things
that are intrinsic to it (for I do not
here Consider <hi>Miracles</hi>) as the
greatest Characters of its Divinity.
And some perhaps would be apt to
think them such as without which
it would hardly be thought worthy
of reception (especially as a New
Institution) even with the help of
Miracles, which Men are always
ready, and not without reason, to
suspect, when the Matters for whose
sake they are wrought bear not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Proportion to them. Which
they would also perhaps be inclined
to think to be the present Case. For
what (would they say) is there
in the Christian Religion that
deserves so great ado, what that
should ingage an Omnipotent Arm
to introduce it into the World,
by such mighty Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:50055:175"/>
if there be indeed nothing <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi>
in it, that is, if you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
its Mysteries. What cannot a
good System of Morality (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if only a Second, and a little
more Correct Edition of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
be Communicated to the
World without Alarming Heaven
and Earth, and giving disturbance
to the Course of Nature? And
if Christianity be no More, what
Proportion (say they) will it bear
to its Miraculous Introduction?
And what will it be found to have
so very Considerable as either to
deserve or justifie such an <hi>Appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus?</hi>
It must indeed be allow'd
by all to be a good wholsom In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
for the Direction of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
but what is there so very Great
and Admirable in it, what that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deserves or answers to so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Types and Figures and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Predictions, what that so Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously
sets forth the Manifold Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, and the Glory of his
Attributes, and the Nothingness of
the Creature, and where are those
<hi>Deep things of God,</hi> that Eye hath
not seen nor Ear heard, nor have
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:50055:176"/>
enter'd into the Heart of Man (a
place which the Apostle applies out
of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> to the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of the Gospel) where I say
are those profound things which
the Spirit of God only that <hi>Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
all things</hi> could reveal,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9, 10.</note> and
which even now they are Reveal'd
<hi>the Angels desire to look into.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 12.</note> You'l
hardly find any thing of so rais'd
a Character in Christianity if you
devest it of its Mysteries, which
therefore may justly be reckon'd as
the Main Pillars of it, without
which it will have much ado to
support it self. So that in short
<hi>Christianity Not Mysterious</hi> (how
fond soever a Certain Author is
of such a Religion) will make
but a very little Figure in
Proportion to its Pomp and
External Splendor, and indeed
will almost dwindle down into
Nothing.</p>
            <p>15. It may indeed even without
the Mysteries make a shift to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
as a mere System of Precepts,
and Rule of Life, though even thus
Consider'd it will be greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
and suffer much disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:50055:176"/>
(as wanting those Convincing
Demonstrations of God's hatred of
Sin, and of his Love towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and withal those indearing
and perswasive Arguments for their
returns of Love, Gratitude and
Obedience towards him, which
can only be deriv'd from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of the World by the Death
and Satisfaction of its Divine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker)
but as a Covenant of
Grace establish'd betwixt God and
his Offending and Estranged Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it cannot possibly stand, but
must fall to the ground. So that
though the Moral or <hi>Legal</hi> part (as
I may call it) of Christianity may
at a hard rate Continue after the
downfall of its Mysteries, yet its
<hi>Federal</hi> part, and all that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>Gospel</hi> in it must needs be
involv'd in the Ruin and Fall with
them, that being all built upon the
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ, as that again
upon his <hi>Divinity,</hi> which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the very Foundation of the
Christian Religion, as <hi>M. Abbadie</hi>
has by Variety of Demonstration
proved it to be. If then you would
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:50055:177"/>
have that Divine Institution stand,
and if you would stand fast in it
(both which I am willing to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
have a care how you remove
its Mysteries, Considering how Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
they are to the Building,
and how great a share of its Sacred
Weight rests upon them. But en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
rather to remove your own
Prejudices, to Mortifie your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
to study Humility, and
to restrain the too free Sallies of
your too curious and over venturous
Reason by still and silent Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon God's Infinite Greatness,
and your own almost as great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
by which one Thought
well pursued you will (by the
Grace of God) come to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Understanding of your selves
than to reject any of his plain
Revelations merely because you
cannot Conceive them, and so
leaving Light and Vision to the
other Life, will be Content with
other good Christians humbly to
<hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Adore</hi> in this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:50055:177"/>16. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I beseech you se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to Consider what with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Charity and all due Civil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
I have here laid before you,
and if upon Consideration of it you
find any weight in it, to let it have
its full Force and Effect upon you.
Which if you do I hope it may
serve by the Blessing of God (to
whom for that end I humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
this Labour) to Convince you,
or at least to put you upon such
better Considerations of your own
as May. For I pretend not here
to have said all, but to have left
many things to the inlargement and
improvement of your own Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
Considering the impropriety
of doing otherwise to Persons of
your Parts and Learning, which I
pray God to Sanctifie and Increase
to you. Whereby you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that I am not against your
making use of your Reason. No,
I would only have you reason right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and that you may do so would
have you by all Human Methods to
improve and Cultivate your Reason
as much as you can, being well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that as a half-view of things
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:50055:178"/>
makes men Opiniative, Disputatious
and Dogmatical, so a Clear and
thorough Light makes them Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and distrustful of themselves,
and that the more Cultivated and
Improved any Man's Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, the easier it will be for him
to Captivate it to the <hi>Obedience of
Faith.</hi>

            <p>SInce the Committing of these
Papers to the Press I have had
the pleasure to peruse Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi>'s
New Theory of the Earth, for
which extraordinary and truly great
Performance I return him all due
Thanks, and am very glad to see
so great a Master of Reason and
Philosophy express so awful and
reverential a regard to Religion in
general, and in particular to the
Sacred <hi>Mysteries</hi> of it, against which
both Human Reason and Natural
Philosophy have been of late so
abusively and profanely imploy'd.
How far this Ingenious and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Author makes good his great
undertaking, or whether this or the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:50055:179"/>
Former <hi>Theorist</hi> be most likely to
be in the right. I shall not take
upon me to examin. I only make
this Observation from both their
wonderful Attempts that whether
they are in the right or no, as to
their respective Accounts of things,
yet they have at least gone so far
and offer'd so fairly towards a true
Explanation of them, as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
any Competent and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Reader that the <hi>Mosaiek</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
concerning the greater <hi>Pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
of Creation and Providence
are not really of so desperate a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as they were once presumed to
be, but are in themselves Capable
of, and may perhaps in time actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
have (if they have not already)
a true natural Solution. As for
Instance, a Universal Flood without
a Miracle, or that the World should
be wholly Drown'd in a Natural
way, or according to the Laws of
Motion already settled, and by a
Train of Causes already laid in
Nature, has been hitherto thought
an Incomprehensible, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
an Impossible thing. But
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:50055:179"/>
now if these two Mighty <hi>Genius</hi>'s
who have undertaken to give a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Account of this stupendous
Revolution have neither of them
pitch'd upon the very precise way
and Manner whereby it was brought
to pass, yet I think it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
but that they have said enough
between them to Convince that the
thing was naturally Possible, and
that a true Natural Account may be
given of it, though they should be
supposed not to have hit directly
upon that which is so. That is, I
mean, they have represented it at
least as a Conceivable thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they themselves have had the
good fortune to Conceive of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
as it was or no. Upon which
it is very Natural and no less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to the Concern in hand to
make this further Reflexion, that
we should not be Overhasty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
any thing (even of a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical,</hi>
much less of a <hi>Religious</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
to be Impossible, only because
it appears to us to be Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
For besides that the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibility
of a thing is (as this
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:50055:180"/>
whole Discourse shews) no certain
Argument of its Impossibility, and
that what appears incomprehensible
to <hi>our</hi> Understandings may at the
same time be well Comprehended by
those of Angels, not to say of wiser
Men, perhaps that which appears
to us at present to be above all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
may in process of time
and upon further Reflexion and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
so brighten and clear up to
our Minds, as to be Comprehended,
or at least to be thought of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
and Possible Nature even
by our more improved selves. For
the Incomprehensibility of a thing
as such being no Absolute Affection
or Intrinsic Denomination of the
thing it self from its own Nature,
but only such as affects it from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
and in relation to the present
Capacity of our Understandings,
there needs no alteration in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing to make that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible,
which was before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible,
a Change in our
Understandings is sufficient, upon
whose greater improvement alone
an incomprehensible may become a
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:50055:180"/>
Comprehensible Object. So that
besides the Nullity of the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
from the Incomprehensibility
of a thing to its Impossibility, even
the Principle it self from which that
Consequence is pretended to be drawn
may be remov'd, by the present
Comprehension of what pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with us for an incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Proposition. Upon both which
Considerations we are admonish'd
to be very Cautious how we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any thing in Nature, much
more in Scripture, to be impossible,
because to us incomprehensible.
And 'tis the very use Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi>
himself makes of the latter of them
in the Conclusion of his excellent
Work, from which I think it worth
while to transcribe a Passage both for
the Advantage of the present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and the greater Conviction
of the Reader, to whom, as well as
to my self, it must be no little Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to see the Sentiments of
so great an Author concur with
mine.</p>
            <p>The Measure of our present know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
(<hi>says he</hi>)<note place="margin">p. 379.</note> ought not to be esteem'd
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:50055:181"/>
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Test of Truth (<hi>the very
Proposition almost in Terms of my
Fourth Chapter</hi>) or to be opposed
to the Accounts receiv'd from profane
Antiquity, much less to the inspired
writings. For notwithstanding that
several particulars relating to the eldest
Condition of the VVorld and its great
Catastrophe's, examine'd and compared
with so much Philosophy as was till
lately known, were plainly unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and, naturally speaking, impossible;
yet we see now Nature is more fully,
more certainly, and more substantially
understood, that the same things approve
themselves to be plain, easie, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.
'Tis therefore Folly in the
highest degree to reject the Truth or
Divine Authority of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
because we cannot give our Minds
particular satisfaction as to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
may or even possibility of some
things therein asserted. Since we have
seen so many of those things, which
seem'd the most incredible in the whole
Bible, and gave the greatest Scruple
and Scandal to Philosophic Minds, so
fully and particularly attested, and next
to demonstrated from Certain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:50055:181"/>
of Astronomy and natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
'tis but reasonable to expect in
due time a like Solution of the other
Difficulties. 'Tis but just sure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Veracity of those Holy
VVriters in other Assertions, whose
Fidelity is so intirely establish'd in these
hitherto equally unaccountable ones. The
obvious, plain, or literal Sense of the
Sacred Scriptures ought not without
great reason to be eluded or laid aside:
Several of those very places which
seem'd very much to require the same
hitherto, appearing now to the Minutest
Circumstances, true and rational, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the strictest and most literal
Interpretation of them. VVe may be
under an Obligation to believe such
things on the Authority of the Holy
Scriptures as are properly Mysteries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that is, though not really Contradictory,
yet plainly unaccountable to our (present
degree of) Knowledge and Reason. Thus
the Sacred Histories of the Original
Constitution, and great Catastrophe's of
the VVorld have been in the past Ages
the Objects of the Faith of Iews and
Christians, though the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
had not afforded so much light as
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:50055:182"/>
that they could otherwise Satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Credibility of them, till
the new improvements in Philosophy.
And this is but just and Reasonable.
For sure the Ignorance or Incapacity
of the Creature does by no Means afford
sufficient ground for Incredulity, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
Men in their rejecting Divine
Revelation, and impeaching the Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
or Providence of the Creator. <hi>With
which weighty, and to the present
purpose very pertinent words of this
worthy Author I Seal up my own,
