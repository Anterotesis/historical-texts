            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Many aggravations there are in the sins of Gods people, which may greatly tend to their humbling, and abasement. They are committed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Against more glorious <hi>light,</hi> and more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual convictions, <hi>after they have known God, and are

The more the beauties of holiness are discovered to the soul, the greater is the unkindness and disingenuity of that soul, in giving entertainment to any sinful lust again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Against speciall and more tender <hi>love,</hi> which love of Christ <hi>passeth knowledge,</hi> and therefore should <hi>constrain us</hi> to love him, that loved us, &amp; died for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>David</hi> had been highly honoured by God, <hi>Solomon</hi> was the <hi>beloved of God,</hi> and this made their sins both more strange, and more atrocious, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.26. <hi>you only have I known of all the Families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for your iniquities, Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.21, 22.</p>

And by how much the greater ingratitude it is to be honoured by God as his servants are, and yet to dishonour him, by so much the more hainous are those sinnes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we neither sanctifie God in our own hearts, and open the mouths of others to poure contempt upon him.</p>

So when a converted person relapseth into any sinne, it must needs sadden and offend the souls of all who rejoyced in his standing, and possibly become a stumbling block, and an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of falling unto them, as the Apostle shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15-21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10-13.</p>

Therefore of all people, they who are called by Gods name, and have him for their God, should in special manner humble themselves before him for their sinnes, as sins whereby he is in special manner grieved and dishonoured, should above all others take heed of playing the wantons with divine grace; for though God be a tender and a loving Father: yet he may be an angry Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and who <hi>knoweth the power of his anger?

            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5.

            <p>Lastly, the Lord hath promised his holy Spirit of Fear, Love, Grace, Adoption unto his people, by the help of which they are preserved from the dangers whereunto of themselves they are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>Isai.</hi> 59.21. upon these and such like grounds it appeareth; That because God is <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>faithfull</hi> in his Covenant, therefore we <hi>remain escaped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if it be here objected that the Promises are usually set forth as conditionall, <hi>The Lord is with you while ye be with him,</hi> and <hi>if ye seek him he will be found of you, but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the Land, Isai.</hi> 1.19. <hi>He that believeth shall be saved, Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>except ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye shall perish, Luke</hi> 13.3.</p>
            <p>We answer, 1. Promises are in some places made <hi>absolutely,</hi> which in others are <hi>conditionally</hi> expressed; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>I will not leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake thee, Ier.</hi> 32.39. <hi>I will give them one heart and one way,</hi> that they may fear me for ever, <hi>I will give them an heart to know me, they shall be my people, I will be their God, they shall return unto me with their whole heart, Ier.</hi> 24.7. If ye will obey my voice and keep my Covenant, is a <hi>Condition</hi> in one place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. a <hi>free promise</hi> in another, <hi>ye shall keep my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and doe them, Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>The mercy of the Lord is towards them that fear him, Psal.</hi> 103.11. There
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64478:15"/>
the fear of God is a condition. I will give them one heart and one way <hi>that they may fear me, Ier.</hi> 32.39. there it is <hi>a free promise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord doth not only give us good things under a condition, but doth <hi>give the condition</hi> it self to his people, compare <hi>Isai.</hi> 1.19. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Precepts and Conditions are used as the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicula</hi> of the grace promised. Of our selves we can do nothing of those duties unto which <hi>Promises</hi> are annexed, for <hi>all our sufficiency is of God,</hi> who <hi>worketh all our works for us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. But the Precepts of the Word are the usual Instruments, by which he worketh those things in us, which he requireth of us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Conditionall Propositions do not imply that our performances work upon God to do what he had said, as if the performance of <hi>duty</hi> were only ours, and then the performance of <hi>promise</hi> alone his: But they intimate <hi>the order</hi> and <hi>connexion</hi> which the Lord hath set amongst his own gifts, some whereof he hath appointed to be <hi>antecedent dispositions</hi> and preparations towards others conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon them: <hi>He that believeth shall be saved,</hi> this is a <hi>conditional promise,</hi> Faith the condition, Salvation the Promise; But we may not so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it as if Faith were only ours, and Salvation alone his. But <hi>Faith</hi> is one Gift of God, Antecedent to <hi>Salvation</hi> which is another Gift of God.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64478:15"/>
we must for ever lay our Hand on our Mouth, and put our Mouthes in the Dust, and beware of Murmuring and Repining against him, as if his wayes were not equall towards us: Behold <hi>he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, what dost thou? Iob</hi> 9.12. we may in our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>plead</hi> with God about his Judgements as Holy men have, Jer. 12.1. <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.2-4-13. But we may not <hi>quarrell</hi> at them nor <hi>murmure</hi> against them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the Lord doth strangely vary his Providences towards a people, and worketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usuall changes and alterations among them: stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up some helpes, and then layeth them by, calleth forth others and quickly revokerh them, fitteth men for great actions, and in the midst of those actions cutteth them off; Our work here is not to censure either the Agent, or the Instruments, to charge the dealings of God either as unrighteous or as unreasonable; but to reflect upon our selves, and learn our <hi>unstedfastnesse</hi> in Gods Covenant, by his <hi>diversifying of Providences</hi> towards us: 1. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we over dote upon Instruments, and deifie them, as if God had no way to help us but one. And then God breaks that Staffe when we lean too hard upon it, to force us to <hi>leane upon his Name</hi> again. 2. Sometimes we undervalue them, and will not understand that God is doing us good by them, (as it is said of <hi>Moses, Acts</hi> 7.25.) and then God suspendeth his work which he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to doe. 3. Sometimes the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are unprepared for mercies, and then God
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64478:16"/>
doth not honour his Instruments with setling them. <hi>Iehoshapbat</hi> was a good King, yet he did not work a perfect Reformation, the high places were not taken away, and this the reason, <hi>the people had not as yet prepared their hearts unto the God of their Fathers,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20, 32, 33. 4. Sometimes the guilt of old sinnes do remain uncleansed away, as it is said of the iniquity of <hi>Baal-Peor, Iosh,</hi> 22.17. and in this case Instruments are too weak to divert wrath, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 23.25, 26. Never such a Reformation as <hi>Iosiah</hi> made about the eighteenth year of his reign, and yet because the people returned <hi>but fainedly, Ier.</hi> 3.10. within a few years after they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into Captivity. Our Saviour was very near his <hi>Sufferings</hi> when they cryed <hi>Hosanna</hi> before him. The Sun often shews biggest, and shines brightest, when it is ready to set; The Candle blazeth most when it is in the Socket; Many times dying men, and it may be so with dying Churches, have a lightning before death.</p>
            <p>I speak not this to bode ill unto the Land of my nativity. If any say it shal not be so, but we shall still have Peace, and Truth, and Holiness flourish, I will chearfully say as the Prophet did, <hi>Ier.</hi> 28.6. Amen: the Lord do so for this Land: But withall, happy is the man that feareth always, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. The sins of the people may weaken the hands of the best Instruments, and make them unable to help us. It is noted as a cause of wickedness that men have <hi>no changes, Psal.</hi> 55.19. <hi>Ier.</hi> 48.11. But to be tossed and emptied, and exercised with frequent alterations, and our sent to abide in us still, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64478:16"/>
under Mercies, sullen under Judgements, after all our Phisick to relapse, after all that is come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, <hi>again to break the Commandements,</hi> this is a sad Symptome, a great aggravation of our sin, and justification of Gods Righteousness in all his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with us.</p>
            <p>Again, since the Lord is the God of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and righteous to them in a way of mercy and fidelity, We learn to acknowledge it a great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to glorifie God for it, that we <hi>Remaine yet escaped:</hi> that we may set up an <hi>Eben-Ezer,</hi> and say thus far hath the Lord holpen us.</p>
            <p>Many Considerations may set on the sense of this Mercy upon our hearts. 1. The many sinnes which remain amongst us, even in the Israel of God: sad divisions, sharp animosities, perverse Opinions, vanity, luxury; severe censurings, loose walking, worldly mindedness, &amp;c. 2. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>shakings,</hi> and universal sufferings, whereby the Lord hath made it appear that his quarrel was against all orders of men, that the disease was all over, <hi>Isai.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.1-5. so that none can blame others, but every one acknowledge <hi>the plague of his own heart,</hi> and say as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>I confess my sinne, and the sin of my people, Dan.</hi> 9.20. Now various shakings and concussions in a Nation use to be sore presages of greater Judgements, as we may see in Gods dealing with the ten Tribes before their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. What shakings have been amongst us, we need not <hi>recount,</hi> by changes at home, by differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces abroad, shakings on the Land, and shakings on the Sea, shakings at hand, and shaking afar off,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64478:17"/>
shakings by War, and shakings by sicknesses, shakings in our mindes by divided Opinions, shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in our hearts by divided affections, shaking in our estates by divided interests. And whether these shakings have a tendency to dissolution we know not, (we are not ignorant of the rage which hath been upon many of our Protestant Brethren in other parts of Christendom) But surely this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration may lead us both to glorifie God that we <hi>Remain yet escaped,</hi> and to humble our selves under the feare of his further wrath.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The powerful <hi>Preaching</hi> which hath been in the Land which where it doth not kindly work, where it is not honourably entertained, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ripen Judgements, and make white for the sickle. It is compared to the shining of the Sun, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. and to showers of rain, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. which are intended for the bringing forth of Salvation, and springing up of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, <hi>Isai.</hi> 45.8. But if they fall upon sins, doe hasten their maturity, and make them <hi>nigh unto cursing, Heb.</hi> 6.7, 8. the sins of the <hi>Church</hi> are <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Fruits,</hi> they ripen faster then the sinnes of the <hi>World,</hi> the sins of the <hi>Amorites</hi> were four hundred years a ripening, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. the sins of Israel in the Wilderness fourty years, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.10. Gods pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience towards the ten Tribes after their revolt was but two hundred and sixty years; from the sins of <hi>Manasseh</hi> to the Captivity brought upon Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah for those sins, little more then one hundred years<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> As at Jerico the sounding of the Trumpet seven times did lead in the falling of the wall, so
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64478:17"/>
the long sounding of the Word in the ears of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient people, is a shrewd presage of ensuing ruine.</p>
            <p>These considerations laid together, as should they justly awaken us to Humiliation, so are they Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods goodness towards us, in that such a people <hi>Remain yet escaped.</hi> Escaped from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Popery, from the flames of persecution, from the <hi>Spanish Armado,</hi> from the vault of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, from rigour in the Church, from troubles in the State, from the terrour of a bloudy War, from renewed attempts of trouble and danger, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped from a Vote, extinguishing and abolishing the whole maintenance of the Ministery, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences whereof could not but have been unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably miserable. Any one of these evils God might have sharpned into a destruction. And yet after all this, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, for we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main yet escaped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It reproueth our unbelief, in consulting with flesh and blood, betaking our selves to carnall shifts in time of danger, having a <hi>faithfull Covenant,</hi> and a <hi>righteous God</hi> to lay hold upon, whose alone fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is the ground of his peoples safety, <hi>who knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. this was the sin of <hi>Ahaz</hi> in sending to the Assyrian to help him, when God offered him a sign to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his trust in him, <hi>Isai.</hi> 7.11, 12. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.19. The Christians in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> being afraid to displease their Heathen friends, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger themselves, would sit with them at the Idols Table, and eat at their Tables meat offered
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64478:18"/>
to Idols: The Apostle diswadeth them from using this Carnal shift to decline danger, bids them <hi>flee from Idolatry,</hi> lest that which they in carnal wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom might judge the means of their standing, should prove the occasion of their fall, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to trust for safety in a faithfull God, who would not suffer them to be tempted above that they were able, but would with the temptation make a way to escape, that they might be able to bear it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13, 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In fears therefore and dangers we should be incouraged by these two Arguments; 1. The <hi>Righteousness of God.</hi> 2. Our own present <hi>remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing escaped, Faith</hi> in, and <hi>experience</hi> of the fidelity of God to help us, to trust in him at all times: not to fear the wrath of man, but to secure the love of God, he sometimes purposely bringeth his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to difficulties, that they may make tryal of such a friend, who in six and seven troubles is at hand to deliver them. Faith is a <hi>venturous</hi> grace, it honours God and laies hold on his strength, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Isai.</hi> 27.5. It is a <hi>victorious</hi> grace, and rises up above difficulties, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4. all things are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to it: Therefore in times of danger let us plead Gods Covenant, and our own experience, Lord wilt thou now destroy us seeing we <hi>remain, yet escaped,</hi> and are Monuments of thy Mercy? hast thou wrought so great deliverances, and done so many wonders, and snatcht us as brands out of the fire, to destroy us at the last? thou hast deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and dost deliver, wilt thou not give us leave to trust in thee for deliverance still? Though the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64478:18"/>
Lord had broken us in the place of Dragons, and had cast us off and put us to shame; yet even so we may lean upon his Name, and plead his Covenant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.17, 19. <hi>Psal.</hi> 74.1-20. <hi>Isai.</hi> 64.8-12. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. How much more comfortably may we plead it, when by the alone mercy thereof, <hi>we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main escaped</hi>? When we may say as the people of <hi>Ioseph</hi> did, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 17.14. we are a great people, and the <hi>Lord hath hitherto blessed us</hi>? and may set up a Monument as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.12. and say, <hi>thus far hath the Lord holpen us</hi>? This is one chief Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which Gods servants use in Prayer, to mind him of his Word and Covenant, wherein he had caused them to hope, so <hi>Iacob,</hi> I am not worthy of the least mercy, <hi>but thou saidst, I will doe thee good, Gen.</hi> 32.9-12. so <hi>Moses,</hi> we remain yet escaped out of the Land of <hi>Egypt, thou hast brought us out thence, turn from thy fierce wrath; Remember Abraham, Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac, and Israel thy servants,</hi> to whom thou sware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.11-13. and again, let the power of my Lord be great, <hi>according as thou hast spoken,</hi> pardon the iniquity of thy people, as thou hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them from <hi>Egypt</hi> untill now; As they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main yet escaped, so save them still; the same Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Power can do it now which did it before, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.17, 19. so <hi>David, Thou hast spoken of thy servants house, for thy words sake</hi> hast thou done these great things: and <hi>now O Lord establish thy Word, do as thou hast said,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.19, 21, 25, 27, 29. So <hi>Solomon, Let thy word be verified</hi> which thou spakest unto thy servant <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8.26. So <hi>Asa,</hi> O Lord we rest in thee, <hi>thou art our God,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. so <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64478:19"/>
Thou art God</hi>â€”our eyes are upon thee, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 20.6-12. no such plea in Prayer as the free grace, the Word, the Truth, the Fidelity, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This may comfort us against all the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of our own wills,<note place="margin">

            <p n="5">5. This Caution notwithstanding we must take in, That we beware of playing the wantons with the grace of Gods Covenant, because thereby we remain escaped; for the Lord will not pass by the petulancy and lasciviency of any of his Children, though he doth not totally cast them off, yet he hath sharp rods wherewith he can chastise them. If they fly from his service, he can send a Whale to swallow them, and can bring all his Waves and Billows upon them; if they keep not to his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he can send a Lion to tear them, he can make them feel the weight of his <hi>Frown,</hi> though they do not of his <hi>Fury,</hi> and it may be, cause them to walk in darkness, drooping, and disconsolate all their days, complaining of <hi>broken Bones,</hi> and of a <hi>wounded Spirit,</hi> with strong cryes, imploring the comforts of that Spirit, which they had so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly greived and resisted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As it is this day</hi>] escaped, escaped <hi>this day</hi> in which we lie under so sore and heavy a guilt. This is a marvellous heightning of Gods <hi>Mercy,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:64478:19"/>
That we may remain escaped in <hi>this day,</hi> a day of so great sin: and also a marvellous aggravation of the sin, that it hath been committed in <hi>this day,</hi> a day of so great Mercy, wherein we <hi>remain yet es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped. Sinne</hi> committed <hi>in a day of mercy,</hi> is the more exceeding <hi>hainous: mercy</hi> extended <hi>in a day of sin,</hi> is the more exceeding <hi>glorious.</hi> That we should so greatly provoke the Lord, <hi>this day,</hi> wherein we <hi>remain escaped:</hi> O how prodigious and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the wickedness? That we should remain es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped <hi>this day,</hi> wherein we have so greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord, O how admirable and unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the goodness?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sinne in a day of great <hi>Mercy</hi> is exceedingly the more hainous. It is a great aggravation of sinne, when it withstandeth <hi>Iudgements,</hi> when the Lord changeth the corrections, and men still hold fast their sins, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6-12. and <hi>turn not unto him that smiteth them, Isai.</hi> 9.13. It is a brand upon <hi>Ahaz</hi> that <hi>in the day of his distresse he sinned more,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22. How much more hainous is it to abuse <hi>Mercy</hi> and Loving kindness? It is the character of a wicked man, that <hi>though favour be shewed him, yet he will not learn righteousness, Isai.</hi> 26.10. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell spared <hi>Balaam,</hi> and yet he ran greedily after the <hi>wages of iniquity, Numb.</hi> 22.35. This is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness the Lord often upbraideth his people with, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.13-15Â· <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Amos</hi> 2.9-13. This made <hi>Solomons</hi> sin the greater, that he turned from the God of Israel, who <hi>had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him twice,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.9. This adds disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, unthankfulness, unkindness unto disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64478:20"/>
when men neither fear, nor love the Lord for his goodness: No surfets more dangerous then those which are upon sweet things: no diseases more desperate, then those which reject Cordials; no Fruits ripen faster; then those on which the Sun continually shineth: as the Apostle saith of grace, where sin abounded, grace did much more abound, so we may by an inversion say of sin, where grace aboundeth, there the guilt of sin is the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Mercy</hi> extended <hi>in a day of sinne,</hi> is the more exceeding glorious, when the Lord is pleased to proclaim mercy to a divorced people, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.12-15. in the midst of provoked <hi>wrath to remember mercy, Hab.</hi> 3.2. and when men <hi>go on frowardly</hi> in their own ways, then <hi>to heal them,</hi> to restore comfort to them, to create peace, <hi>Isai.</hi> 57.17-19. <hi>to heal a backsliding people,</hi> and to love them freely, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.14. To look back upon a denying <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 22.61. To send a pardon to an adulterous <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. To call from Heaven to a persecuting <hi>Saul, Acts</hi> 9.4. This is that which maketh Mercy the more radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, which magnifieth the freeness, fulness, and superabundance of it, that it rejoyceth against judgment, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.13.</p>
            <p>These considerations tend much to <hi>humble a people</hi> which <hi>remain yet escaped,</hi> as we do this day.</p>
            <p>The sad conjunctions of our sins with the Lords goodness, when the Lord saith, <hi>I will remember my Covenant,</hi> and <hi>thou shalt remember thy wayes,</hi> Then he saith, <hi>thou shalt be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I am pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64478:20"/>
towards thee, Ezek.</hi> 16.60-63. When we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Mercy with our corrupt doings, then is a time to loath our selves in our own sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>t, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.42-44. 36.25-32. Sin <hi>punished,</hi> doth many times harden a sinner in pride, as we see in <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh.</hi> But sin <hi>pardoned,</hi> and subdued with Mercy, should melt the soul into a godly sorrow, holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and self displicency for it: They shall <hi>shall fear the Lord and his goodness</hi> in the latter dayes.</p>
            <p>O let us learn to bewail our wickedness, in that we have ventured on it in a day of Mercy, as if we had been delivered to commit abominations, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.10. as if priviledges were a protection to profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Certainly if mercies be aggravations of sin, no Nation in the world is less excusable then we. What Nation in the Earth hath God so honoured with a long possession of his Oracles, and glorious light of his Word? In so much that other Nations study the <hi>English</hi> Tongue to read our Books; What Nation hath ever had such manifold, such mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous deliverances? What Nation hath the Lord Crowned with a greater abundance of all good things? What means could be used to work upon a people which the Lord hath not made use of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us? If teaching would work upon us, we have had his <hi>Word</hi>; If Chastisements would amend us, we have had his <hi>Sword.</hi> If <hi>bounty</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us, we have been fed, and cloathed, and healed, and crowned, and compassed with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies more then we can recount. If strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld <hi>Providences</hi> would awaken us, this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath never had for many hundred years such a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64478:21"/>
prospects of Gods works, such interwoven mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Mercies, of Judgements, of Wonders, of Terrors. Great Instruments raised up, and taken away again, Wars raging, and again ceasing, Seas roaring, and again calmed. And certainly the Works of the Lord should be sought out of his people, <hi>Psal,</hi> 111.2. and improved to their own accompt. Felt Judgements should mak them out of love with sin: Renewed mercies should make them in love with God. That which humbleth should heal them, that which comforts should cure them, that which amazeth, should amend them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is a strong Argument in Prayer for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinners to use, that God hath mercy in store even in a day of sin for his people: that though we have trespassed against God, yet <hi>there is hope in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael concerning this thing, Ezra</hi> 10.2. That though sin do ever <hi>forfeit</hi> mercy, yet it doth not ever <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi> it; though it do always <hi>provoke</hi> wrath, yet it doth not always <hi>procure</hi> it; how will mercy triumph in a day of repentance, when so great provocations have not hitherto extinguished it? how will fire break forth in dry wood, when it hath prevailed against the green? needs must that Jewel be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Sun, which glisters in the Night. This should exceedingly encourage us unto Repentance. Doth the Lorld invite backsliding Israel, doth he wait to be gracious to a secure people, doth he pitty us in our blood, and are his bowels kindled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, when we compass him about with lies and deceit? doth he look back with pitty upon a a denying <hi>Peter?</hi> doth he speak pardon from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64478:21"/>
unto a persecuting <hi>Paul</hi>? doth he shew mercy on a <hi>Manasseh,</hi> filling <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with blood and Idols? doth he appear first unto <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom he he had cast seven Devils? O who would not be encouraged by such examples, to fly for sanctuary from the wrath to come, unto that mercy which hath snatched these as brands out of the fire? The Lord keeps as open house for us as for them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. his mercy as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant for any other penitents as for them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.6, 7, 8. his call and invitation the same to us as to them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.37, 38. The blood of Christ as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall for us as for them, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2. They were set forth <hi>as examples to all that should after believe in him unto eternal life,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16.</p>
            <p>Only let us beware of profaning this comfort by persisting in our sins: But follow the example of these penitents here, though their sin had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved Gods mercy, yet Gods mercy did remove their sin. They entred into a <hi>Covenant, sware</hi> to the Lord, gave their <hi>hands</hi> that they would <hi>put away their strange wives,</hi> and <hi>separate themselves from the people of the Land, Ezra</hi> 10.3, 11, 12, 19. This is a Genuine work of true <hi>hope</hi> in mercy, when it makes us <hi>purifie our selves</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3. no man can hope for glory, who is an enemy to Grace, for glory is grace perfected, and we can hope for nothing which we hate, he that hates Grace, doth not love Glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We note that in solemn Humiliations there is a great Emphasis in these words, <hi>As it is this day,</hi> It is a circumstance greatly considerable, The <hi>time</hi> wherein we have sinned and escaped, <hi>Time</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:64478:22"/>
greatly aggravates <hi>sin, Exod.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42. <hi>Time</hi> greatly commends <hi>Mercy,</hi> that God kept touch with his people to a very day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41, 42. Therefore we should learn wisdome to improve <hi>time</hi> unto duty, as it is said of the Children of <hi>Issachar,</hi> that <hi>they had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.32. Who knoweth said <hi>Mordecai</hi> to <hi>Ester,</hi> whether thou be come to the Kingdom <hi>for such a time as this, Ester</hi> 4.14. Let us therefore wisely consider the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the times which God hath brought upon us. Times of great and universal sickness and infirmity, after he had not many moneths since upon Prayer, removed such distempers in good part: surely his anger is not turned away, his hand is stretched out still, because we have not unfeignedly turned unto him that smiteth us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Times of wonderfull changes and unsetled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, many preparations and attempts to heal the breaches amongst us, and many abortions and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages in those attempts, Honourable persons raised up by God to serve the Interests of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by his Providence laid down again. And when the Lord had by his providence raised up this eminent Instrument, now gone to him, by whose great Wisdom, accurate intelligence, indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable vigilancy, and special care, we might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have supposed that by degrees things would have wrought unto a composedness, and settlement in the midst of great Actions and great Successes, he likewise is suddenly taken away. It is good to study the meaning of God in these things. 1. That

we should bewail our <hi>carnall confidence,</hi> and learn to look up and to trust more in Him, and less in man. 2. To labour for <hi>hearts established by his grace,</hi> that we may the more comfortably look for an outward establishment in order and peace, for our settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must begin in our hearts, so long as our hearts are unsteadfast with God, his dealings may be still in fluctuation and uncertainty towards us. 3. To acknowledge notwithstanding these sad changes and concussions, this great Mercy, <hi>That we remain yet escaped,</hi> that the Lord hath not yet said unto us that he would cast us off, hath not exposed us to those flames and commotions which our sins have deserved, but that yet we sit under our Vines and Fig-trees, and none make us afraid.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to cast Anchor on the Rock of Ages, and keep close to the Throne of Gace, to secure his love and care of us, his presence and Throne amongst us, who never dies, in whom there is <hi>everlasting strength,</hi> to get firm holdfast of those Comforts which have nothing of Mortality, nothing of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricity in them, which will stay with us while we remain here to sweeten all the passages of our Pilgrimage, and accompany us unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord, in whose presence is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Joy, and at whose Right Hand there are pleasures for ever more.</p>
