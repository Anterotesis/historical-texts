            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is weight so unconceivable,
that dependeth on the
soundness of our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Sanctification, that
our care and diligence cannot be too
great to make it sure. As the professed
Atheist, Heathens, and Infidels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
so the self-deceiving Hypocrites
within the Church, do wilfully cast away
themselves for ever, by neglecting such
a business of everlasting consequence;
when they have time, and warnings, and
assistance to dispatch it. Multitudes live
like bruits or Atheists, forgetting that
they are born in sinne and misery, and
setled in it by wilfull custom, and must
be Converted or Condemned. These
know not (many of them) what need
they have of a Conversion, nor what
<pb facs="tcp:63001:3"/>
Conversion or Sanctification is. And
some that have been Preachers of the
Gospel, have been so lamentably igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in so great a matter, that they have
perswaded the poor deluded people, that
it is only the gross and haynous sinners,
that need Conversion; branding them
with the name of Puritans, that will not
take a dead Profession joyned with Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
for true Sanctification; and promise
Salvation to those, that Christ hath with
many asseverations professed, shall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Kingdom of God. Others
that confess that a through Sanctification
is a necessary thing, do delude their souls
with something that is like it. Hence is
the misery and dishonour of the Church.
Holiness it self is disgraced, by the sins
of them that are unholy, because they
pretend to that which they have not.
Hence it is, that we have thousands, that
call themselves Christians, that live a
worldly, fleshly life, and some of them
hating the way of Godliness, and yet
think they are Converted, because they
<pb facs="tcp:63001:3"/>
are sorry when they have sinned, and
wish when it is past that they had not
done it, and cry God mercy for it, and
confess that they are sinners; and this
they take for true Repentance: When
sinne was never mortified in their souls,
nor their hearts ever brought to hate it,
and forsake it: But when they have had
the profit and pleasure of sinne, they are
sorry for the danger, but never regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and made New Creatures, by the
Spirit of Christ. Hence also it is, that we
have such abundance of meer Opinion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists,
that take themselves for Religious
people. Because they have changed their
Opinions, and their parties, and can prate
contentiously against those that are not
of their mind, and joyn themselves with
those that seem to be the strictest, they
take themselves to be truly Sanctified!
And this makes such gadding from one
opinion to another, and such censuring,
reviling, and divisions upon that account,
because their Religion is most in their
Opinions, and hath not mortified their
<pb facs="tcp:63001:4"/>
carnal, selfish inclinations and Passions,
nor brought them to a holy, heavenly
mind. Hence also it is that we have so
many sensual, scandalous Professours,
that seem to be Religious, but bridle not
their tongues, their appetites, or their
lusts, but are railers, or backbiters, or
tipplers, or gluttons, or filthy and lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or some way scandalous to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Profession; because they are strangers
to a through-Conversion, but take up
with the counterfeit of a superficial
change. Hence also we have so many
worldlings, that think themselves Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
men; that make Christ but a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to their worldly interest, and seek
Heaven but for a reserve, when Earth
forsakes them, and have something in
this world that is so dear to them, that
they cannot forsake it for the hopes of
Glory; but give up themselves to Christ,
with secret exceptions and reserves, for
their prosperity in the world: And all,
because they never knew a sound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
which should have rooted out of
<pb facs="tcp:63001:4"/>
their Hearts this worldly interest, and
delivered them up entirely, and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Christ. Hence also it is that we have
so few Professours, that can lay by their
Pride, and bear disesteem or injury, and
love their enemies, and bless them that
curse them, yea, or love their godly
friends that cross them, or dishonour
them. And so few that can deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in their honour, or any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
thing, for the sake of Christ, and
in obedience, and conformity to his will.
And all because they never had that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
change, that takes down <hi>Self,</hi> and
sets up Christ, as Soveraigne in the soul.
And hence also it is that we have in this
age so many dreadful instances of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie:
So many reproaching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that once they thought had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
them, and the way of Holiness,
that once they did profess; and denying
the Lord himself that bought them; and
all because they formerly took up, with
a superficial counterfeit Conversion. O
how commonly, and how lamentably
<pb facs="tcp:63001:5"/>
doth this misery appear among Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
in their unsavoury discourse, their
strife and envy, on Religious pretenses,
their dead formality, their passionate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
or their selfish, Proud, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
minds! A through Conversion would
have cured all this, at least as to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having therefore in my call to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted,
endeavoured to awaken
careless souls, and perswade the obstinate
to Turn and Live, I have here spoken
to them that seem to be about the work,
and given them some</hi> Directions <hi>and</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
<hi>to prevent their perishing in
the birth, and so to prevent that Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
which else they are like to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
into, and the deceit of their hearts,
the Errour of their Lives, and the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
at their Death, which is like to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
That they live not as those that</hi>
flatter God with their mouth, and lie unto
him with their tongues, because their heart
is not right with him, neither are they
stedfast in his Covenant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 36, 37
<pb facs="tcp:63001:5"/>
Lest denying deep entertainment, and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the seed of Life, or choaking it by the
radicated predominant Love, and cares of
the world, they wither when the heat of
persecution shall break forth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.
20, 21, 22. And lest building on the sands,
they fall when the winds and storms arise,
and their fall be great, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 26, 27.
And so they go out from us, that they may
be made manifest that they were not of us:
For if they had been of us, they would no
doubt have continued with us, 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 19.
Look therefore to this great important
business,</hi> and give all diligence to make
your calling and election sure, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 10.
And trust not your hearts too easily, or
too confidently.</hi> But turn to the Lord with
all your hearts, <hi>(Joel 2. 12.)</hi> Cleave to
him Resolvedly, or with Purpose of heart,
<hi>(Acts 11. 23.)</hi> And see that you sell all,
and buy the Pearl, <hi>(Matth. 13. 46.)</hi> And
stick not at the price, but absolutely resign
your selves to Christ, and turn to him, as
Zacheus and other primitive Converts
did, surrendering all that you have unto his
<pb facs="tcp:63001:6"/>
Will <hi>(Luke 19. 8, 9.)</hi> Leave not any
root of bitterness behind; Make no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or reserves: but Deny yonr selves;
Forsake all; and follow him that hath led
you this self-denying way; aud trust to his
Blood, and Merits, and Promise, for a
Treasure in Heaven, and then you are his
Disciples, and true Christians indeed,
<hi>Luke 14. 33. Luke 18. 24, 25. Reader,
if thou heartily make this Covenant and
keep it, thou shalt find that Christ will
not deceive thee, when the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
them that chose it, in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
extremity. But if thou draw back,
and think these terms too hard, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that Everlasting Life was offered
thee, and remember why and for what
thou didst reject it.</hi> And if in this life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
thou wilt have thy good things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be tormented, when the believing,
self-denying Souls are comforted, <hi>Luke</hi>

            <head>Directions to Sinners that
are purposed to Turn,
and are under the Work
of Conversion; that it
miscarry not.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first and greatest matter
in the seeking after the
salvation of our souls, is
to be sure that we lay the
<hi>foundation</hi> well, and that
the work of <hi>Conversion</hi>
be throughly wrought. To this end
I have already used many <hi>perswasions</hi> with
you unconverted to return, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all further <hi>Directions</hi> vain, till we
have <hi>perswaded</hi> men to a <hi>consent</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63001:10"/>
               <hi>willingness</hi> to practice them. And in
the end of that Discourse, I added a few
Directions for the use of such as are
willing to be converted. But because I
know that this is a matter of exceeding
consequence, I dare not thus leave it,
before I have added some <hi>further Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,</hi>
to prevent the <hi>miscarrying</hi> of
this work where it is <hi>begun.</hi> And least
I should lose my labour, through the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedness
of the Reader; I shall first
give you some preparing Considerations,
which may awaken you to the practice
of the <hi>Directions</hi> which I shall give
you.</p>
            <p>Consider first, That <hi>half-Conversions
are the undoing of many thousand souls.</hi>
If you are but like <hi>Agrippa,</hi> Act. 26. 28.
<hi>almost perswaded to be Christians,</hi> you
will be but <hi>almost</hi> saved. Many a thousand
that are now past help, have had the
Word come near them, and cast them
into a fear, and make some stirre and
trouble in their souls, awakening their
consciences, and forcing them to some
good <hi>purposes</hi> and <hi>promises;</hi> `yea, and
bringing them to the <hi>performance</hi> of a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63001:10"/>
               <hi>half</hi>-reformation; But this is not it that
will serve your turn. Many have been
so much changed, as not to be <hi>farre from
the Kingdom of God,</hi> that yet came short
of it, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12. 34. There is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in Scripture that you shall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
if you <hi>almost repent</hi> and believe;
or be saved, if you be <hi>almost sanctified</hi>
and obedient: But on the contrary the
Lord hath plainly resolved, that you must
<hi>turn or die,</hi> though you <hi>almost</hi> turn:
and repent, or perish though you <hi>almost</hi>
repent: and that you shall not enter
into the Kingdom of Heaven, without
conversion and a new birth, though
you come never so near it. God hath
resolved upon the termes of your salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and it is in vain to hope for salvation
upon any other termes. God will not
change nor come down to your termes;
It is you that must change and come quite
over to his termes, or you are lost for
ever. If you come never so near them,
you are but lost men if you come not <hi>up
to</hi> them. The Lord well knew what
he did, when he made his Covenant
and Law, and he imposed nothing on
the sonnes of men, but what his infinite
wisdom told him, it was fit for him to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63001:11"/>
and he will not now <hi>compound</hi> with
sinners, and take less then he requireth;
that is, less then the preheminency in
their hearts; nor will he ever come down
to any lower termes with you, then
those which he propoundeth to you in
his Gospel. And therefore poor sinners
as you love your souls, do not stand
dodging and halving with God; but give
up your selves entirely to him: and
do not stop at the beginnings of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
but go through with it, till
you are become new creatures indeed,
or you are undone when you have done
all. A half unsound Convert will as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
perish as a Drunkard or a Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger;
though his torment may not be
so great.</p>
            <p>2. Consider also, That <hi>if you do not go
through with the work when you are upon
it, you may perhaps make it more difficult
then it was before ever you medled with
it,</hi> and make it a very doubtfull case
whether ever it will be done. As it
is with a wound or other sore; if you
tamper with it with salves that are not
agreeable to it, or are disorderly applied;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63001:11"/>
or if you skin it over before it be searched
to the bottom, it must be opened again,
and will cost you double pain before it
be cured. Or as I have seen it with some
that have had a bone broken, or out of
joynt, and it hath been set amiss at first;
O what torments were the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
fain to undergo, in having it
broken or stretcht and set again! which
might have been spared, if it had been
throughly done at first. So, if you will
be shrinking, and drawing back, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
your flesh, and will not go to
the quick, you will make your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
much more difficult; you must be
brought to it again, and fetch your
groanes yet deeper then before; and
weep over all your former teares: your
doubts will be multiplied: your fears
and sorrows will be encreased: and all
will go sorer with you then at first. O
what a case will you be in, when your
sores must be lanced a <hi>second</hi> time, and
your bones as it were broken again!
Then you will wish you had gone through
with it at the first.</p>
            <p>Yea, perhaps you may put God to
it to fetch you in by some sharpe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and send out so boisterous and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63001:12"/>
a Messenger to call you home, as may
make you wish you had hearkened to
a more gentle call: When the Sheep
will straggle, the Dog must be sent to
affright them home. Many a foolish
sinner makes light of the gentle invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of grace, and they stand hovering
between their sins and Christ, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they have a mind to turn, and the
next temptation they are off again, and
then they come on again coldly and with
half a heart; and thus they stand trifling
with the God of Heaven, till he is fain
to take another course with them, and
resolves to use some sharper means: And
when he layeth them under his rod, and
they can neither fly from him, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him, but see that their lives and souls
are at his mercy, then they begin to
look about them, and see their folly and
change their minds. You can tarry, and
delay, and dally with the dreadfull God,
in the time of your prosperity, and we
may ask you over and over whether you
will turn, before we can have a hearty
answer: But what will you do when God
shall begin to frown, and when he takes
you in hand by his unresistible power,
and lets loose upon you the terrours of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63001:12"/>
his wrath? Will you then make as light
of his mercy as you do now? Have you
not read <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 6. how small an appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his anger, did make a carou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
King look pale, and his joynts to
tremble, in the midst of his jovialty? A
<hi>Manasseth</hi> will bethink himself and come
in when he is laid in irons, though he
could set light by God before, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
33. 13. If <hi>Jonah</hi> will runne away from
God, he can send a boisterous Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to arrest him, and cast him as it were
into the belly of Hell, and make him
cry for mercy to him that he disobeyed.
So, if you will stand trifling with God,
and will not by fair meanes be perswaded
to yeeld and come away, you may short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
look to hear from him in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
for he hath a voice that will make
the proudest face look pale, and the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornest
heart that is to tremble. If an
idle stubborn Child will not learn nor be
ruled, the Master or Parent will teach
him with the rod, and give him a lash,
and ask him, <hi>Will you yet learn?</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
lash and ask him, <hi>What say you
now, will you yet obey?</hi> So will God
do by you, if he love you, and mean to
save you: When he hath taken away
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63001:13"/>
your wealth, your friends, your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
will you <hi>then</hi> hearken to him, or
will you not? When you lie groaning
on your couch, and all your parts are
overwhelmed with paines, and death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to lay hands upon you, and bids
you <hi>now come and answer for your rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and delayes before the living God,</hi>
What will you do <hi>then?</hi> Will <hi>you</hi> turn or
not? O the lamentable folly of sinners,
that put themselves to so much sorrow,
and create calamity for themselves! When
sickness comes, and death draws near,
you beg, and cry, and groan, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:
When you feele the rod, what
Christians will you then be? And why
not without so much adoe? You then
think God deales somewhat hardly with
you: And why will you not turn then by
gentler means? You might spare your
selves much of this misery if you <hi>would;</hi>
and you <hi>will</hi> not. Is it a seemly thing
for a man to be <hi>driven</hi> to Heaven by
scourges? Is God so bad a Master, and
Heaven so bad a place, that you will not
turn to them, and mind them, and seek
them, till there be no remedy, and you
are as it were driven to it against your
wills? Is the world such an Inheritance,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63001:13"/>
and sinne so good a thing, and the flesh
or devil so good a Master, that you will
not leave them till you are whipt away?
What a shamefull unreasonable course is
this?</p>
            <p>Well sirs, the case is plain before
you. Turn you must at one time or other,
or be the firebrands of Hell. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is a thing that must be done, were
it not best for you to take the easiest and
the surest way to do it? Why this is
the easiest and the surest way; even to
strike while the iron is hot, before it coole
again; and to go through with it when
God doth move you and perswade you;
If you love your flesh it self, do not put
him to take up the rod, and fetch you
home by stripes and terrours.</p>
            <p>But that's not the worst: For it will
sorely hazard the work it self, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
your salvation, if you do not
go through with it, at the first attempt.
I know there is many a one that hath
been converted and saved, after many
purposes and promises and half-conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
But yet I must tell you, that this
is a very dangerous course. For you
do not know when you grieve the Spirit
of grace, and set so light by mercy when
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63001:14"/>
it is offered you, whether that Spirit may
not utterly forsake you, and leave you
to your own ungodly wills, and let you
take your lusts and pleasures, and say,
<hi>[Let this wretch be filthy still: let him
keep his drunkenness, his companions, his
worldliness, and the curse of God with
them, till he have tried what it is that they
will do for him: Let him follow his own
conceits, and the pride and obstinacy of his
own heart, till he find whether they will
bring him: Let him serve the flesh and the
world, till he understand whether God or
they be the better master. Seeing he will
not be wise on earth, let him learn in hell,
and let torments teach him, seeing mercy
might not teach him.]</hi> O poor soul!
what a case art thou in, if this should
once be the resolution of God?</p>
            <p>Moreover, you may easily know that
the longer you stay, the more leasure
you give the devil to assault you, and to
try one way when he cannot prevail by
another, and to strengthen his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Like a foolish Souldier, that will
stand still to be shot at, rather then assault
the enemy.</p>
            <p>And the longer you delay, the more
your sin gets strength and rooting. If
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63001:14"/>
you cannot bend a twig, how wil you
be able to bend it when it is a Tree? If
you cannot pluck up a tender plant,
are you likely to pluck up a sturdy Oak.
Custom gives strength and root to vices.
<hi>A Blackmoor may as well change his
skin, or a Leopard his spots, as those that
are accustomed to do evil, can learn to
do well,</hi> Jer. 13. 23.</p>
            <p>If you stick at Conversion as a <hi>difficult</hi>
matter to day, it will be more difficult to
morrow, or the next moneth, and the
next year, then it is now.</p>
            <p>Yea, the very resistance of the Spirit
doth harden the heart, and the delayes
and triflings of the soul, do bring it to
an insensibility, and boldness in sinne, and
drive away the fear of God from the
heart. <hi>Now</hi> it may be you are somewhat
awakened, and begin to see that you must
turn or die: but if you trifle and delay,
this light may be gone, and leave you in
greater darkness then before: and the
voice that now awakeneth you may be
silent, and leave you to fall asleep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Moreover, you know that you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
of the continuance of the Gospel.
You know not whether you shall have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63001:15"/>
such lively serious Preachers, as you have
now: Nor you know not whether you
shall have such godly neighbours, and
company to encourage you, and help
you in the work. God will remove
them one after another to himself, and
then you will have fewer Prayers for
you, and fewer warnings, and good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
and perhaps be left wholly to
the company of deceived ungodly fools,
that will do nothing but hinder and
discourage you from Conversion. And
you are not sure that Religion will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in that reputation, as now it is in.
The <hi>Times</hi> may turn, before <hi>you</hi> turn:
and godliness may become a scorn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and it may be a matter of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and may cost you your lives to live
as the servants of Christ must do. And
therefore if you stop at it now as a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
thing, when you have all the helps
and encouragements that you can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
and the way to Heaven is made so
fair; and when Magistrates, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and Neighbours, are ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
and help you; what will you do
in times of persecutions and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
If you cannot turn when you
have all these helps and means, what will
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63001:15"/>
you do when they are taken from you?
If you cannot row with the stream, how
will you row against it? If you dare
not set to Sea, when you have wind, and
tide, and sunshine; what will you do in
stormes and tempests, when all is against
you! O what would some of your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
have given to have seen the daies
that you see! How glad would many
a thousand in other Countries of the
world be, to have but the helps to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that you have? Never look to have
the way fairer and easier while you live.
If you think Heaven is offered you at
too deer a rate now, you may even let
it go, and try whether Hell be better:
for the next offer is like to be upon
harder termes rather then easier. If
you cannot now find in your hearts to
turn and live a holy life; What would
you have done in the daies of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
or antient Christians? and,
What would you have done in <hi>Spain</hi>
or <hi>Italy,</hi> where it would cost you your
lives? He that will not be Converted
<hi>now,</hi> but thinks the termes of grace
too hard, is so impious a despiser of
Christ and Heaven, that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if God resolve that he shall never
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63001:16"/>
taste of the salvation that was offered
him, <hi>Luk</hi> 14. 24.</p>
            <p>Moreover, you know upon what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties
you hold your lives, you
have no assurance of them for an hour:
but you are sure that they are passing
away while you delay. And will you
trifle then in a work that must be done?
What a case are you in, if death find
you unconverted? The heart of man is
not able now to conceive the misery
of your case. How dare you venture to
live another day in an unconverted
state, least death should find you so?
Are you not afraid when you lie down at
night, and afraid when you go out of
your doors in the morning, least death
surprize you before you are converted?
If you be not, it's long of your dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and presumption.</p>
            <p>And I would fain hear what it is that
should thus stop you. What are you
afraid of? Is God an Enemy, that you
are loath to come to him? Is the devil
a Friend that you are so loath to leave
him? Is sinne a Paradise? Is Holiness
a Misery? Is it pleasanter life to love
your money, or your lands, or your
meat and drink, and lusts, then to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63001:16"/>
love the most blessed God, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
of the World, the life of our Souls,
and our Eternal Felicity? Is it better
to pamper a carcass that must shortly
stink as the dung, then to provide for a
living immortall soul? Whether do you
think that Earth or Heaven will be the
more glorious and durable felicity?</p>
            <p>What is it sirs that you stick at, that
you make so many delayes before you'l
turn? Is there any difficulty in the point?
Do you think it a hard question
whether you should turn or not? Why
how can you be so blind? Do you
stand pausing upon the business, as it were
a doubt, whether God or the world
were better, and whether sinne or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Christ or death, Heaven or Hell,
were to be preferred? I pray you Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider;
Can you reasonably think that
Conversion will do you any harm?
Can it bring you into a worse condition
then you are in? Sure you cannot
fear such a thing: You are in your
blood; you are dead in sinne; you
are children of wrath, while you are
unconverted: you are under the curse
of the Law of God; you are the
slaves of the devil, you are the heirs of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63001:17"/>
hell, and under the guilt of all your
sinnes; your life is a continued rebellion
against God; you are employed every
day in the destroying of your selves,
in kindling the flames that must ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
torment you, and laying in
fewell for the perpetuating of your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery;
and fighting against your friends
that would deliver you, and unthankfully
abusing Christ and grace, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and Friends that would save your
souls. This is the condition that every
one of you is in till you are converted.
And can you fear least Conversion
would bring you into a worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
then this? Sirs, these Truths are
sure and plain: and if yet you stick at
it, your errour is so palpably gross, that
unless you are mad men, I may be bold
to say, it is a wilfull errour. And if
you <hi>love</hi> to be deceived, and wilfully
choose a lie, you must take that you get
by it.</p>
            <p>3. Consider further, That <hi>half-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
do often prove an occasion of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
mens souls, and making them quiet
in a miserable state, and so of keeping
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63001:17"/>
them from being converted to the last.</hi> If
you had never done any thing in it, you
would more easily be perswaded that
your case is bad, and that there is still a
necessity of your change. But when you
have had some convictions, and troubles
of mind, and fears and sorrows, and so
have fallen into an outside partiall refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and now are perswaded that you
are truly converted, when it is no such
matter; What a dangerous impediment
to your Conversion may this prove?
And all because you slubber over the
work, and cut it off before it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to sincerity, and strive against the
workings of the Spirit, and break away
from your Physic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in before he hath
done the cure, and would not follow it
on to the end. I know that a half-Conversion,
if it be <hi>known</hi> to be no
more, is much better then none; and
doth often prepare men for a saving
work. But when this half-Conversion
is taken to be a true and saving change,
as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oo commonly it is, it proves one of
the greatest impediments of salvation.
When ever Christ shall afterwards knock
at your door, you will not know him,
as thinking that he dwells with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63001:18"/>
If you read any Books that call
on you to be converted, or hear any
Preachers that call on you to turn, you
have this at hand to cousen your selves
with, aud frustrate all: You'l think,
<hi>This is not spoken to me: For I am Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
already.</hi> O how quietly do such
poor deluded sinners, daily read and hear
their own doom and misery; and never
once dream that they are the men that
are meant, and therefore are never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed
at the matter. This formeth you
into a state of hypocrisie, and makes the
course of your duties and your lives
to be hypocriticall. If another man
that knows himself to be still uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
do but read the threatnings of
the Word against such, or hear of the
terrours of the Lord from a Minister, he
may be brought to confess that this is
his own case, and so to perceive the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of his condition. But when such
as you do read and hear these things,
they never trouble you, for you think
that they do not touch you: You are
Scripture-proof, and Sermon-proof;
and all by the delusion of your <hi>half</hi>-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.
O how zealously will such a
man cry out against the sinnes of others!
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63001:18"/>
and tell them of their misery, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them to turn, and shew them the
danger that is near them if they do not;
and in the mean time little thinks that this
is his own case, and that he speaks all
this against his own soul. How will such
men applaud a Sermon that drives at the
Conversion of a sinner, and that tels
them their misery while they are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted?
O thinks he, this touched such
and such: I am glad that such a man
and such a man heard it: And he little
thinks that it as nearly touched himself.
How smoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

It will turn not only the stream of your
thoughts into hypocrisie and self-deceit,
but also the stream of your speeches
to others; yea, and the current of
your prayers, and all the rest of your
religious performances. When in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
you should acknowledge and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will only confess that you have the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63001:19"/>
of the Saints, and that you have
this or that sinne, which yet you think
is mortified. When you should impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
beg for <hi>Renewing</hi> grace, you
will beg only for <hi>strengthning</hi> grace, or
assurance: When you should be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to <hi>break</hi> your hearts, you
will be studying to <hi>heal</hi> them: and will
be hearkning after present comforts,
when you have more need of godly
sorrow. It will fill your mouthes in
prayer with Pharisaicall thanksgivings for
the mercies of Regeneration, Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Adoption, Sanctification, which
you never received. Little doth many a
soul know what sanctification, and the
feverall graces of the Spirit are, that
use to give God thanks for them:
There's many and many a one that must
for ever be in hell, that were used in their
prayers to give God thanks for their
hopes of glory. And the common
cause of all this deceit and misery is,
that men do run from under the hands
of their Physician before he ever went
to the bottom of their sore, and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with a half-conversion, and so spend
all the rest of their lives in a meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion,
as verily thinking they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63001:19"/>
when they are not. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
will such receive the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and thrust themselves into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Saints, as if they had as
good right as any to be there? till the
Lord of the Feast shall take them to
task, and say, <hi>Friend, how comest thou
in hither, not having on a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
and then they will <hi>be speechless,</hi>
Mat. 22. 12. How many false deceiving
comforts, and perhaps even seeming rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and assurance, may these have in
themselves; as verily thinking their case
is good, when alas, they never yet laid
the foundation? Yea, and it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that Satan is a friend to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of this kind of men, and therefore
will do all that he can to promote them.
For he would willingly keep his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
in peace, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 21. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he may possibly be a comforting
spirit to them himself, and imitate the
Holy Ghost the Comforter of the Saints:
And it may be give them such raptures
as seem higher then those which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of holiness doth give. He envieth
the Saints their peace and comfort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he foresees how durable they
will prove: But he can be content that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63001:20"/>
deluded hypocrites may have joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>their</hi> comforts do not weaken
but strengthen his Kingdom within them,
and he knows they are like to endure
but for a while.</p>
            <p>And thus you may perceive, how hard
it is to convert one of these half-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
men, that have strangled the New
Creature as it were in the birth, and
that are fortified against all the means of
grace, by a false conceit that they are
sanctified already. See therefore that
you make sure work, and take not up in
the middle, and with halves, but take
your present time, and give up your souls
to a totall change.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Consider; If you</hi> take up short
of a through <hi>Conversion,</hi> you lose all your
labour, and sufferings, and hopes, as to
the matter of your salvation.</p>
            <p>And what pitty is it that so much
should be lost? Alas, to see many of our
hearers toucht at a Sermon, and come
to a Minister and bewail their sinne, and
seem to be humbled, and promise to be
new men, and yet all this to be lost;
How sad a case is this to think of?
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63001:20"/>
To see them leave their company and
former course of life, and come among
the professors of holiness, and all men
take them for reall Converts; and yet
all this to be lost, and their souls lost
after all: How sad a case is this? If
you grow up to the greatest parts for
outward duty, and be able to discourse,
or pray, or preach, even to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers; yet if you do not
ground this on a through Conversion,
all is but lost, as to your own salvation.
If you keep up the highest strain of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and get the highest esteem in the
Church, so that others depend upon
you as Oracles; yea, if the Pope with
all his infallibility should cannonize you
for Saints; it were all but loss. If you
should keep up the most confident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
of your salvation, and hope to
go to Heaven to the last hour of your
lives; it were all but lost if you build
not all on a through Conversion. Yea,
if you should be taken by persecutors
for one of the party to which you joyn,
and should suffer for the cause of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
among them; all were but lost,
without a sound Conversion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:63001:21"/>
It is a pittifull case to see some poor
unsanctified souls, how they wander and
change from one opinion to another,
and from party to party, to find out
that which they want within. They
turn to this party first, and that party
next, and then to another, and then
think they are <hi>sure</hi> in the way to Heaven:
when they never throughly turned to
God by Jesus Christ; and therefore are
certainly out of the way, whatever
party it be that they joyn with. Some
go to the giddy Sects that make the
highest pretences to strictness: And
some go to <hi>Rome,</hi> because they think that
there they shall have more company,
and hear the deluding sound of <hi>Vnity,
Vniversality, Antiquity, Succession, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
and such like: And then they think
they have hit the way. Alas poor souls!
If God were but nearest and dearest to
your hearts, and Christ and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
exalted within you, and your
soules unfeignedly turned from your
sinnes, you would be in the certain
way to Heaven, in what Countrey or
company, or Church soever you were;
supposing that you believe and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
there, which is inconsistent with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63001:21"/>
this life of Grace. (Though yet every
Christian should choose that particular
Society, if he can, where he may not
only be saved, but most certainly saved,
and find the greatest helpes and least
hinderances, or else where he may do God
the greatest service.) But choose what
company you will in all the world, the
strictest, the most reformed, the most
splendid in outward pompe and glory,
or of whatever excellency else you can
imagine, you will never be saved in it
your selves, as long as your hearts are
unconverted. I know the Papists have
found out many devices, by Sacraments,
and Ceremonies, and the Merits of the
Saints, to patch up the defect of a
through Conversion; but all are
meer delusions that pretend to such a
thing.</p>
            <p>O then think of this poor sinner: Hast
thou gone so farre, and done so much,
and shall all be lost, because thou wilt
not follow it to the end? Hast thou
groaned, and wept, and confessed and
bemoaned thine own condition? Hast thou
prayed, and read, and heard, and fasted, and
changed thy company, and much of thy
course of life? and shall all this be lost,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63001:22"/>
for want of going to the bottom, and
making a through work of it? What a
loss will this be?</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Consider also,</hi> What an admirable
help and advantage it will be to you
through the whole course of your lives, if
the work of Conversion be once throughly
wrought. <hi>I will shew you this in some
Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, It will be an excellent help to
your <hi>understandings,</hi> against the grosser
Errors of the world, and will stablish
you in the truth much more then meer
Arguments can do: For you will be able
to speak for the truth from feelling and
experience: He that hath the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
both in his Bible and in his heart, is
likely to hold it faster then he that hath
it in his Bible alore. But of this I have
spoken already in my Treatise against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
Part 2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you be but throughly
Converted, you will have that within
you which will be a a continuall help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
temptations: You have not only
experience of the mischief of sinning,
and the folly of those Reasons that are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63001:22"/>
brought for its defence; but you have
also a <hi>new nature,</hi> which is against the
temptation, as life is against poison;
and as it is a great disadvantage to the
Law of Christ, that it speaks against the
<hi>nature</hi> of the ungodly; so is it a disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the temptations of the Devil,
that they would draw a Christian against
his <hi>new nature.</hi> You have that <hi>within</hi>
you that will plead more effectually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sensuality, uncharitableness, pride,
or worldliness, or any the like sinne, then
reason or learning alone can do. (As in
the forecited Book I have further manifested.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If Conversion be throughly
wrought, you will have within you a
continuall helper of your graces, and a
Remembrancer to put you in mind of
duty, and a spurre to put you on to the
performance, and a furtherer of your
souls in the performance it self: It is out
of this spark and principle within you
that the Holy Ghost doth raise the acts
of grace. This is it that the Word,
and Prayer, and Conference, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and all the Means of Grace must
work upon. If we see you do amiss, we
have hopes that you will hear us: If we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63001:23"/>
plainly reprove you, we may look you
should take it in good part: For you
have that within you that saith as we say,
and is at deadly enmity with the sinne
which we reprove. If we provoke you
to Love and to good Works, we dare al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
promise our selves that you will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey:
For you have that within you that
disposeth you to the duty, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our Sermons to you over again.
O what an advantage it is to our teaching,
when you are <hi>all taught of God within,</hi>
as well as by his Messengers <hi>without!</hi>
But when we speak to the <hi>unconverted,</hi>
we have little to work upon: We give
Physick to the dead; We speak all against
the bent of their souls; and every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
and exhortation to holiness, goes
against their very <hi>natures:</hi> And therefore
what wonder if we have the smaller hopes
to prevail.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the work be throughly
done at first, it will help to <hi>resolve many
doubts</hi> that may be afterwards cast into
your minds. You need not be still at a loss,
and looking behind you, and question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your foundation, but may go cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and boldly on. O what an excellent
encouragement is this! to know that you
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63001:23"/>
have hitherto made good your ground,
and left all safe and sure behind you, and
have nothing to do, but to look before
you, and press on towards the mark,
till you lay hold upon the prize: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
if you be in any great doubt of your
Conversion, it will be stopping you and
discouraging you in all your work: you
will be still looking behind you, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>What if I should yet be unconverted?</hi>
When you should cheerfully address
your selves to Prayer or Sacraments, how
sadly will you go, as being utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
whether you have a saving right
to them, or whether God will accept
a Sacrifice at your hand? When you
should grow and go forward, you will
have little heart to it, because you know
not whether you are yet in the way; and
this will damp your life and comfort in
every duty, when you must say <hi>[I know
not whether yet I be throughly Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed]</hi>
O therefore stop not the work at
first.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and lastly, if the work be
throughly done at first, you will perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
when others fall away. You will
have rooting in your selves, entertaining
the seed as into depth of earth; and you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63001:24"/>
will have the Holy Ghost within you, and
(more then so) engaged for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
and the perfecting of your
salvation. When they that received the
Word as seed upon a rock, and never
give it deep entertainment, will wither
and fall away in the time of triall; and
from them that have not saving grace,
shall be taken away even that which they
seemed to have, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 12. &amp; 25. 19.</p>
            <p>6. And Lastly Consider, <hi>If you fall
short of a true Conversion at the first,
the Devil will take occasion by it, to tempt
you at last to utter despair.</hi> When you
have made many essaies and trials, and
been about the work again and again, he
will perswade you that there is no possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of accomplishing it. If we convince
an open prophane person that is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
he may easier see that yet there is
hopes of it: But if a man have been
<hi>half-converted,</hi> and lived long in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
self-deceiving profession of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and been taken by himself and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for a godly man, as it is very hard
to convince this man that he is unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
so when he is convinced of it, he will
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63001:24"/>
easily fall into desperation. For Satan
will tell him <hi>[If thou be yet unconverted
after so many Confessions, and Prayers,
and after so long a course of Religion,
what hope canst thou have that yet it
should be done. Thou wilt never have
better opportunities then thou hast had?
If such Sermons as thou hast heard could
not do it, what hope is there of it? If
such Books, and such Company, and such
Mercies, and such Afflictions have not
done it, what hope canst thou have?
Canst thou hear any livelyer Teaching then
thou hast heard? or speak any holyer words
then thou hast spoken? If yet the work be
quite undone, it is not forsaking another
sinne, nor going a step further, that will
do it: and therefore never think of it;
for there is no hope: Dost thou
not know how oft thou hast tryed
in vain? and, What canst thou do
more?]</hi> And thus you give advantage
to the Tempter by your first <hi>delayes,</hi>
and taking up in meer Preparatories,
And therefore I beseech you, as you love
your souls, take heed of resisting the
Spirit of grace, and breaking off the
work before it is throughly done, but
go the bottom, and follow it on, til
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63001:25"/>
it be accomplished in sincerity. And
now hoping that upon these Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
you are resolved to do your best,
I shall come to the thing which I prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
intended; which is, to give you
certain Directions, which if you will
obey, you may be Converts and Saints
indeed.</p>
            <div n="1" type="direction">
               <p>DIRECTION I. Lest the Work
of Conversion should miscarry where it

Nature of Christianity, and the Meaning

you.]</hi> You are naturally slaves to the

it Darknes is not the way to the

need of Knowledge, but a man may
be saved without it. But this is because
they want that Knowledge that should
shew them the misery of their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and the worth of Knowledge.
Hath not the Scripture plainly told you,
that <hi>If the Gospel be hid, it is hid to them
that are lost, whose mindes the God of this
world hath blinded, lest the Light of the
glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the
Image of God, should shine unto them,</hi>
2 Cor. 3. 4. I know that many that have
much knowledge are ungodly. But what
of that? Can any man therefore be
godly or be saved, <hi>without</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63001:26"/>
You may have a bad servant that
yet is skilfull enough in his work; but
yet you will not mend the matter, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
one that hath no skill at all. You may
send a man on your errand that knows
the way and yet will not go it, but loiter
and deceive you: But what of that? Will
you therefore think to mend the matter,
by sending one that knoweth not a step of
the way, nor will not learn it? Though
a man of knowledge may be the servant
of the devil, yet no man <hi>without</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
(that hath the use of his Reason)
can be the servant of God. A man <hi>may</hi>
go to Hell with knowledge: but he <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
shall</hi> go to Hell without it. I do
not say that you must all be men of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and skil'd in the Arts, and Sciencies,
and Languages: But you must have the
Knowledge of a <hi>Christian,</hi> though not
of a <hi>Scholar.</hi> Can you love or serve a
God that you <hi>Know</hi> not? Can you let
go friends, and goods, and life, for a
Glory which you have no Knowledge
of? Can you make it the principall bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of your lives to seek for a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
whose Excellencies you know not
of? Can you lament your sinne and
misery, when you are unacquainted with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63001:26"/>
it? Or will you strive against sinne as
the greatest evil, when you know not
the evil of it? Will you believe in a
Christ whom you do not know, and trust
your souls and all upon him? Will you
rest upon a Promise, or fear a Threatning,
or be ruled by a Law, which you do not
understand? It is not possible to be
Christians without knowing the substance
of Christianity: Nor is it possible for
you to be saved without knowing the way
of salvation.</p>
               <p>Labour therefore to be well acquainted
with the Grounds and Reasons, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of your Religion. The clearer
your Light is, the warmer and livelier
your hearts will be. Illumination is the
first part of Sanctification. The head is
the passage to the heart. O if you did
but throughly know what sinne is, and
what a life it is to serve the flesh, and
what the end of this will prove, with
what detestation would you cast it away?
If you did throughly know what a life
of holiness is, how speedily would you
choose it? If you did truly know what
God is, how infinitely powerfull, and
wise, and good; how holy, and just,
and true, and what title he hath to you,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63001:27"/>
and authority over you, and what and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Portion he would be to you, how
is it possible that you could preferre the
dirt of the world before him, or delay
any longer to return unto him? If you
did but truly know, what Christ is, and
what he hath done and suffered for you,
and what that pardon, and grace, and
glory are which he hath purchased for
you, and offereth to you, and how sure
his Promise is by which it is offered; it is
not possible that you should refuse to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
him, or delay to give up your
souls unto him. Do you think a man
that truly knows what Heaven is, and
what Hell is, can still be in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he should turn or not? Alas sirs,
if God would but open your eyes, to
to see where you are, and what you are
doing, you would runne as for your
lives; and quickly change your minds
and waies. You would no more stay in
your carnall state, then you would stay
in a house that were falling down on
your heads, or in a ship that you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
sinking under you; or on the sands
when you see the tide coming towards
you. If you did but see your Chamber
full of Devils this night; you would
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63001:27"/>
not stand to ask whether you should be
gone: And sure then if you knew how
the Devils are about you, how they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you, and rule you, and wait to
drag you away to Hell, you would never
stay a night longer willingly in such a
state. While men understand not what
the Gospel means, nor what a Minister
saith to them, no wonder if they regard
them not, but continue in their sinne.
If you see a Bear or a mad Dog making
towards a man, and tell him of it, and
call to him to be gone, if he be a man of
another language and do not understand
you, he will make never the more hast:
but if he understand and believe you,
he will away. If people think that
Ministers are in jest with them, or that
they are uncertain of what they say, no
marvell if they hear us in jest, or as men
that believe not what they hear: But
if you knew that your lives lay on it,
yea your everlasting life, would you not
regard it and look about you? Now you
stand deliberating and questioning the
business whether you should turn, and
let go sinne, or no: But if you knew
that you must certainly have Hell with it
if you keep it, methinks your doubt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63001:28"/>
should quickly be resolved, and you
should be loath to give another nights
lodging to so chargeable and dangerous
a guest. Now when we perswade you to
holiness of life, you will demurre on it,
as if there were some doubtfullness in the
matter: But if you knew the nature and
end of holiness, you would soon be out
of doubt; and if you knew but how
much happier you might be with God,
you would never stick at the parting with
your most delightfull sinnes. As the Jews
rejected Christ, and preferred a murderer
before him, and cryed out, <hi>Crucifie him,</hi>
and all because they did not <hi>know</hi> him,
1 <hi>Cor. 2. 8. Joh.</hi> 8. 9. &amp; 1. 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 27.
So you let Christ knock, and call, and
offer you salvation, and you stand questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
whether you should obey his call,
and whether you should not preferre
your lusts before him; and all because
you <hi>know</hi> him not, nor the Grace and
Glory which he tendereth to you. When
men understand not the Reasons of God,
that should prevail with them, no wonder
if they part not with that which is as
dear to them as their lives. But when
once they know the <hi>Reasons</hi> of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
those moving, weighty, undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63001:28"/>
Reasons, that are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fetcht from God,
and Heaven, and Hell, they'l then stand
questioning the matter no longer; but
they will resign up all even life it self.
All this I speak of a spiritual, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and a practical Knowledge; and
not of every swimming opinion and
conceit.</p>
               <p>Study therefore what God is, and
what he is to you, and what he would be
to you. Study what sinne is, and what
the damnation is which it deserveth.
Study what Christ is, and hath done and
suffered for you, and what he is willing
to do if you neglect him not. Study
what the world is, and what is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
that sinne will do for you. Study
what the everlasting Glory is, which
you may have with God, if you lose
it not by your folly. And study what
Faith is, and what Repentance is, and
what Love, and Joy, and a holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
life, and how little reason you have
to be afraid of them. If this <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
have but deeply possessed you, it will
byas your hearts, and make you resolved
setled Converts.</p>
               <p>Whereas if you seem to turn, and
scarce know why, and seem to take up a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63001:29"/>
Christian life, before you are throughly
possessed with the Nature, Grounds, and
Reasons of it, no marvell if you are

               <p>The Apprehensions of the mind do

We come not to cheat and deceive you;
and therefore we desire not that you
should take any thing from us, but what
we can prove to you from the Word
of God, to be certainly true. We desire
not to <hi>lead</hi> you <hi>in</hi> the <hi>dark,</hi> but by the
<hi>light</hi> to <hi>lead</hi> you <hi>out</hi> of <hi>darkness:</hi> and
therefore we refuse not to submit <hi>all</hi>
our Doctrine to an equall tryal. Though
we would not have you wrong your souls
by an unjust distrust of us; yet would
we not desire you to take these great and
weighty things, meerly upon our words:
For then your Faith will be in man; and
then no marvell if it be weak, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
and quickly shaken: If you
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63001:30"/>
trust a man to day, you may distrust him
to morrow; and if one man be of greatest
credit with you this year, perhaps ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a contrary mind may be of more
credit with you the next year. And
therefore we desire no further to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by you, then is necessary to lead
you up to God, and to help you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that Word which you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:
Our desire therefore is that you
search the Scripture, and try whether the
things that we tell you be the truth.
The Word will never work on you to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
till you see and hear God in it, and
perceive that it's he and not man only
that speaks to you. When you hear
none speaking to you but the Minister, no
marvell if you dare despise him: for he is
a frail and silly man like your selves:
When you think that the Doctrine which
we preach to you, is meerly of our
own devising, and the conjecture of our
own brain, no marvell if you set light
by it, and will not let go all that you
have, at the perswasion of a Preacher.
But when you have searcht the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and find that it is the Word of
the God of Heaven, dare you despise
it then? When you there find that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63001:30"/>
we said no more then we were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and God that hath spoken this Word
will stand to it; then sure it will go
nearer you, and you will consider of
it, and make light of it no more. If
we offered you bad wares, we should
desire a dark shop; and if our gold were
light or bad, we would not call for the
Ballance and the Touchstone. But when
we are sure the things that we speak are
<hi>true,</hi> we desire nothing more then try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
Beauty and comliness have no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of loathsome deformity, when
they are both together in the dark:
but the light will shew the difference,
Error may be a loser by the light,
and therefore shunnes it, <hi>Joh. 3. 19, 20,
21.</hi> But truth is a gainer by it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seeks it. Let Papists hide the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the people, and forbid the
reading of them in a tongue which they
understand, and teach them to speak to
God they know not what; we dare not
do so, nor do we desire it: Our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
will not go off well in the dark;
and therefore we call you, to the Law
and to the Testimony, and desire you
to take our words into the light, and
see whether they be according to the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63001:31"/>
Word of the Lord. Nothing troubleth
us more then that we cannot perswade
our hearers to this tryal. Some of
them are so hardened in their sinne and
misery, that they will not be at so much
labour as to open their Bibles, and
try whether we say true or not. Some
of them will not trouble their minds
with the thoughts of it; <hi>Psal. 10 4.
God is not in all their thoughts.</hi>
And some are already too wise to learn;
they will not so long abate their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their former opinions; though,
poor soules, their ignorance doth threaten
their damnation. And some are so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in a sinfull party, that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
will not give them leave, to
make so much question of the way that
they are in: And some will scarce take
the Scripture for the Rule by which they
must try and be tryed; but look more
to custom, and the will of those in
power over them. And most are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to try, because they are unwilling
to know the truth, and cannot
endure to find themselves miserable, nor
see the sinne which they would not
leave, nor see the duty which they love
not to practice. And thus we cannot
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63001:31"/>
get them to try whether the things that
we teach them be so.</p>
               <p>For want of this it is that men deceive
themselves, and think their case to be safe
when it is miserable, because they will
not try it by the Word. This makes
them rage and be confident in their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 16. and laugh, and sing,
at the brink of Hell, and swimme as
merrily down the stream to the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gulf, as if no evil were near them.
This makes them in the depth of misery
to have no pitty on themselves, and to
do so little to escape it: Though they
have time, and means and helps at hand,
yet there are not hearts in them to make
use of them; yea, they runne themselves
daily further on the score: and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we cannot get them to search the
Scripture, and try whether sinne be so
small a matter, and whether this will
not be bitterness in the end. Hence it
is that they are so easily drawn by a
temptation; and that they dislike a holy
life, and have base thoughts of them that
are most diligent for salvation, and are
most precious in the eyes of God, and
that they can even deride the way that
they should walk in, <hi>Prov. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. Psal.</hi> 1. 2.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63001:32"/>
because they will not search the Scripture
to see what it saith to these matters.
The Word is a Light, and would do
much to open their eyes, and winne them
over to God, if they would but come
to it with a desire to know the truth.
You think that the ungodly that are rich
and great, are in a better condition then
a godly man that is poor and despised.
And why is this? but because you will
not go into the Sanctuary, and see in what
a slippery place they stand, and what
will be the end of these men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 16,
17, 22. In a word, this is the undoing
of millions of souls. They are all their
life time out of the way to Heaven, and
yet will not be perswaded to ask the way;
but they runne on and wink, and put it
to the venture. Many a thousand are
gone out of the world, before they ever
spent the quantity of one day in trying by
the Scripture whether their state were
good, and their way were right. Nay,
let their Teachers tell them that they
must be sanctified and take another
course, they will differ from their
Teachers, though they be never so wise
or Learned; and they will contradict
them, and not believe or regard them.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63001:32"/>
And yet we cannot get them to come
to us, and put the case to the tryal,
and let the Scripture be the jndge.
Would they but do this, they could
never sure have such hard thoughts of
their Teachers, and be offended at their
plainest closest dealing. You would
then say [I see now the Minister saies not
this of himself; he speaks but that which
God commandeth him: And if he would
not deliver the Message of the Lord, he
were unworthy and unfit to be his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour:
He were cruel to me if he
would not pull me out of the fire, by
the plainest closest meanes, <hi>Jud.</hi> 23. He
hated me, if he would not rebuke me,
but suffer sinne upon me, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17.
If he would please men, he should not
be the servant of Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. I
know it is no pleasure to him to trouble
me, or to provoke me: but it would
be his own destruction if he tell me not
of my danger, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18. And I have
no reason to wish him to damn his own
soul, and suffer me to do the like by
mine, and all for fear of displeasing
me in my sinne.] These would be your
thoughts if you would but try our
words by the Scripture, and see whether
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63001:33"/>
we speak not the mind of God.</p>
               <p>And sure it would go somewhat deeper
in your hearts, and it would stick by
you, and be more before your eyes, when
you once understood that it is the Word
of God.</p>
               <p>This then is my request to you, sirs,
that the work of your Conversion may
not miscarry, that you would carry all
that you hear to the Scripture, and search
there, and see whether it be so or not:
that so you may be put out of doubt, and
may be at a certainty, and not stand
wavering; and that your Faith may be
resolved into the Authority of God;
and so the work may be Divine, and
consequently powerfull and prevailing,
when the Ground and Motive is Divine.
If you be not satisfied in the Doctrine
which the Minister delivereth to you,
first search the Scripture your selves,
and if that will not do, go to him, and
desire him, to shew you his grounds for
it in the Word of God, and joyn with
you in Prayer for a right understanding
of it. Do you question whether there
be so severe a judgment, and a Heaven
and a Hell, as Ministers tell you: Search
the Scripture, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. &amp; 2 <hi>Thes. 1.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63001:33"/>
8, 9, 10. Joh. 5. 29 Matth.</hi> 13. Do you
question whether a man may not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
without conversion, regeneration,
and holyness? Open your Bibles, and see
what God saith, <hi>John 3. 3, 6. Mal. 18.
3. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Rom. 8. 9. Heb. 12.
14.</hi> Do you think a man may be saved
without Knowledge. Let Scripture judge,
2 <hi>Cor. 4, 3, 4. Joh. 17. 3. Hos.</hi> 4. 6. Do
you think a man may be saved that doth
as the most do? and goeth in the common
way of the world. Search the Scripture
and see, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 13. and 20. 16. and 22.
14. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. Do you think an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled
Soul may be saved? that never
was contrite, and broken hearted for sin?
Try by <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15. and 66. 2. <hi>Psal. 51.
17. Luke 4. 18. Mat.</hi> 11. 28. Do you
think a man can be the Servant of God,
that liveth a fleshly life, &amp; <hi>will</hi> keep his sin?
Try by <hi>Rom. 8. 13. Joh. 3. 19. Ephes. 5.
5, 6. 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 9, 10. Do you doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be necessary to make so much adoe
to be saved, and to be so strict, and
make Religion our cheifest business? Try
by <hi>Psal. 1. 1, 2, 3. 1 Pet. 4. 18. Heb. 12.
14. Luke 10. 42. Luke 13. 24. Ephes.</hi> 5.
15, 16. Do you think a man can be saved
that is a worldling? whose heart is more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63001:34"/>
on Earth then heaven. Try by 1 <hi>Joh. 2,
15. Phil. 3. 19. Col. 3. 1. Luke. 14. 26,
33.</hi> Do you doubt whether you should
serve God with your families? and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them, and pray with them. Try
by <hi>Jos. 24. 15. Deut. 6. 6, 7. Dan. 6. 10.
11. Exod.</hi> 20. 10.</p>
               <p>Thus if you will in all these weighty
matters, but goe to the Scriptures, and
see whether it say as your Teachers say,
you might soone be resolved, and that
by the surest authority in the world. If
you think that your <hi>Ministers</hi> may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
I hope you will confess that <hi>God</hi>
cannot be deceived, If you think that
your Ministers are passionate, or felf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited,
or speak out of ill will to you, I
hope you dare not say so by the Lord: he
owes you no ill will, nor speaks a word
but what is most sure. If you think us
partiall, sure God is impartiall, what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
judge can you have now, then he that
is infallible, and must judge you all at the
last? If any Papist put it into your head
to ask [who shall be judge of the sence
of Scripture] I answer, who shall be
judge of the judge of all the world? The
Law is made to judge you, and not to be
judged by you. None can be the proper
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63001:34"/>
judges of the sence of a Law, but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of it: Though others must judge their
cases by the Law. Your work is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
it, and understand and obey it, and
your work is to help you to understand it,
but it's neither our work nor yours to be
the proper, or absolute judges of it.
At least where it speaks plaine, it needs
no judge.</p>
               <p>Come then to the word in meekness
and humility, with a teachable frame of
Spirit, and a willingness to know the
truth, and a resolution to stand to it, and
yield to what shall be revealed to you,
and beg of God to shew you his will, and
lead you into the truth, and you will find
that he will be found of them that seeke
him.</p>

not work much upon him that will not
think of them. <hi>Consideration</hi> opens the
eare that was stopt, and the heart that
was shut up: It sets the powers of the
Soul awork, and wakeneth it from the
sleep of incogitancy and security. The
<hi>Thoughts</hi> are the first actings of the Soul,
that set a work the rest. Thinking on the
matters that must make us wise, &amp; do the
work of God on the heart, is that which
lieth on us to do in order to our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
By <hi>Consideration</hi> a sinner makes
<hi>use</hi> of the Truth, which before lay by,
and therefore could do nothing. By <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration</hi>
he taketh <hi>in</hi> the Medicine to his
Soul; which before stood by, and could
not work. By <hi>Consideration</hi> a man makes
use of his Reason, which before was laid
asleep, and therefore could not do it's
work. When the Master's from home
the Schollars will be at play. When the
Coach-man is asleep, the Horses may miss
the way, and possibly break his neck and
their owne. If the plowman go his way,
the Oxen will stand still, or make but bad
unhandsome work. So when Reason is
laid asleep, and out of the way, what
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63001:35"/>
may not the Appetite do? and what may
not the Passions do? and what may not
Temptations do with the Soul? A wise
man when he is asleep, hath as little use
of his wisdome as a foole. A Learned man
when he is asleep, can hardly dispute with
an unlearnd man that is awake. A strong
man that's never so skillfull at his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
is scarce able in his sleep to deale
with the weakest child that is awake. Why
all the powers of your Soul are, as it were
<hi>asleep,</hi> till <hi>Consideration</hi> awake them, and
set them on work. And what the better
are you for being men and having Reason,
if you have not the <hi>Vse</hi> of your Reason,
when you need it? As men are <hi>Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
because they are <hi>wicked,</hi> so they are
the more <hi>wicked</hi> because they are <hi>inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate.</hi>
The keenest sword, the greatest
Cannon will do no execution against an
enemie, while they lie by and are not
used. There is a mighty power in the
Word of God, and the example of Christ,
to pull down strong holds, and conquer
the strongest lusts and corruptions. But
they will not do this while they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
and neglected. Will Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
the man that thinks not of it? Will
Hell deterre the man that thinks not of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63001:36"/>
it? Why is it that all the reasoning in the
world, will do no more good on a man
that is deaf, then if you said nothing? But
because the passage to his Thoughts and
understanding is stopt up. And if you
have eyes and see not, and eares and heare
not, and willfully cast it out of your
thoughts, what good can any thing do to
you that is spoken. It is not holding your
meat in your mouth that will nourish you
if you will not let it down: nor taking
it into your stomack, if you will not keep
it but presently cast it up again: But it
must be kept till it be disgested and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted.
So it is not the most excellent
Truths in the world that will change your
hearts, if you let them not down to your
hearts, and keep them not there by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
till they are digested and turned
into sprituall life. The plaister must be
laid upon the sore if you would be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
The wound and sickness is at your
<hi>Heart:</hi> and if you will not take <hi>in</hi> the
word to your <hi>heart,</hi> where the sickness
is, I know not how you should expect a
cure. The Soul will not be <hi>charmed</hi> into
Holiness, by the bare hearing or saying
over a few good words; as wizzards use
to cure diseases, or seeme to cure them.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63001:36"/>
It must be Truth at the <hi>Heart</hi> that must
change the Heart. And if you will not
<hi>Think</hi> on it, and think on it againe, how
can you expect it should come at your
Hearts.</p>
               <p>You say you would gladly have Christ
and grace, and are ready to lay the blame
on God, because he doth not give it you,
and say, We cannot convert our selves.
But would you have the Spirit come in,
while you hold the dore against him? He
knocks and desireth you to open and let
him in, and you wish him to come in,
but you bolt the dore, and no intreaty
will procure you to open it. It is Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the saving doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
that openeth the heart and giveth it
entertainment. Set you selves therefore on
purpose to this work, &amp; open the doores
of your heart which are now shut, and let
the King of Glory come in. Who will
believe that you love the Light, when you
shut the windows, and draw the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains?
If you will set your selves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of the Truth, the windows of your
Soul will be set open, and then the light
will certainly come in. Now you read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
whole Chapters, and hear Sermon
after Sermon, and either they never stir
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63001:37"/>
you, or at least, it's but a little for a fit,
like a man that hath a little warmd him
at the fire in the winter, and when he
goes from it is colder then before: But
if you would but set your selves to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of what you hear or read, one line of
a Chapter, or one sentence of a Sermon
would say you in tears, or make you
groane, or at least do more then now is
done. Satan hath garrisond the heart of
every carnall man: And consideration is
the principall means to cast him out. If
by considering of the terrible threatnings
of the word, you would discharge these
Canons of God against them, what a
battery would it make in the corruptions
of your Souls. Our God is a consuming
fire, and the fire of hell is threatned in his
Law, as the wages of sin: By serious
Consideration you may as it were, fetch
fire from God and from his word, and
set to the very gates of Satans garrison,
and fire him out of many of his holds.</p>
               <p>But because this is so needfull a point, I
shall be so large upon it as 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> to tell you
some of those things that you should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of, 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. to tell you in what manner
you should do it, and 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. to give you
some Motives to put you on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:63001:37"/>
I. The first thing that I would have
you oft to think on, is, <hi>The Nature of
that God with whom you have to do.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that if he be the most wise, it is all
the reason in the world that he should
rule you. If he be Good, and infinitely
Good, there is all the reason in the world
that you should Love him: and there is
no shew of reason, that you should love
the world or sin before him. If he be
faithfull and true, his threatnings must be
feared, and his promises must not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusted;
and there is no reason that you
should make any question of his Word.
If he be Holy, then Holiness must needs
be most excellent, and those that are the
Holiest must needs be the best; because
they are most like to God: And then he
must be an enemy to sin, and to all that
are unholy, because they are contrary to
his nature. Consider that he is Almighty,
and there is no resisting him, or standing
out against him: In the twink of an eye
can he snatch thy guilty Soul from thy
body, and cast it where sin is better
known. A word of his Mouth can set all
the world against thee; and set thine own
conscience against thee too: A frown of
his face can turn thee into Hell. And if he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63001:38"/>
be thine enemy, it is no matter who is thy
friend: For all the world cannot save
thee, if he do but condemne thee. They
are blessed whom he blesseth, and they
are cursed indeed whom he curseth. He
was from Eternity, and thou art but as it
were, of yesterday: Thy being is
from him: thy life is alwaies in his hands,
Thou canst not live an hour without him:
thou canst not fetch a breath without him:
nor think a thought, nor speak a word,
nor stir a foot or hand without him: Thou
mayst better live without bread, or drink,
or fire, or aire, or earth, or water, then
without him. All the world is before him
but as the drop of a bucket, or a little
sand of dust that should be laid in ballance
with all the earth: Hadst thou but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
about this lower world, and seen
all the Nations of it, and its wonderfull
furniture, and seen the great deeps of
of the mighty Ocean, and the abundance
of Creatures that be in all? O what
thoughts then wouldst thou have of God!
But if thou hadst been above the Starres,
and seen the Sun in all its glory, and seen
the frame and course of those higher
Orbes, and seen the blessed glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and all the inhabitants of the higher
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63001:38"/>
world, O then what thoughts of God
wouldst thou entertaine? O but if it
were possible that thou hadst seen his
Glory, or seen but his back-parts as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
did, or seen him in Christ the now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Redeemer, what apprehensions
wouldst thou have of him then. Then
how wouldst thou abhor the name of sin:
and how weary wouldst thou be of the
pleasantest life that sensuality could afford
thee? Then thou wouldst quickly know,
that no Love can be great enough, and no
praises can be high enough, and no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
can be holy and good enough, for
such a God: Then you wouldst soon know,
that this is not a God to be neglected, or
dallyed with: nor a God to be resisted,
nor provoked by the wilfull breaking of
his Laws. It is Eternal Life to know this
God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. and for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, it is that sin aboundeth in the
world. This maketh Holyness so scarce
and leane: Men worship they <hi>care</hi> not
<hi>how,</hi> because they worship they <hi>know</hi> not
<hi>whom.</hi> O therefore dwell on the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Almighty. So far as he
doth possess thy mind, there will be no
place for sin and vanity. One would think,
if I should set you no further task, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63001:39"/>
tell you of no other matter for your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
this one, should be enough:
For this one is in a manner all. What will
not the due knowledge of God do upon
the Soul. That's the best Christian, and
the most happy man that knoweth most
of him: And that's the most vile and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
wretch, that is furthest from him,
and strangest to him: It is the Character
of the foole of fooles, to have a heart
whose disposition and practice saith,
There is no God, <hi>Psal,</hi> 14. 1. That is,
To be so affected and employed in their
hearts, as if there were no God: and
when God is not in all his thoughts,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 4. It was better with man when
he had less knowledge for himself, and
fewer thoughts for himself, and more of
God. And there is no way to restore us
to sound understanding, and to perfect
our knowledge, but to turn our eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God again: For in knowing him, we
know all, that's worth the knowing.
Take hold then of the blessed God in thy
Meditations, and fill thy thougts with
him, and dwell upon those thoughts.
Remember he is alwaies with thee: and
where ever thou art, or what ever thou
art doing, most certainly he seeth thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63001:39"/>
sure as thou are there, the Lord is there.
He knowes thy thoughts: he heares
thy words, he sees all thy waies. And is
such a God as this to be provoked or des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised!
Were it not better provok
and despise all the world? Is his favour to
be sleighted.? Were it not better to lose
the favour of all the world? Consider of
this.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Another thing that I would have
you oft Think of, is, <hi>what end you were
made for, and what business it is, that you
came for into the world.</hi> You may well
think that God made you not in vaine:
and that he made you for no lower end,
then for himself: And that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have made you, nor so long preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
you, if he had not cared what you do.
He would never have endued you with a
Reasonable and immortal Soul, but for
some high, and noble, and immortal end.
Surely it was that you might be happy in
Knowing him, that he made you capable
of Knowing him: for he made nothing
in vaine. It is usefull to a horse to know
his pasture, and provender, and work, and
perhaps his master; but he needs not
know whether there be a God: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he is qualified. But it is sure
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63001:40"/>
mans chief concernment to know that
there is a God, and what he is, and how
to serve him, and what he is and will be
to us: Or else we should never have been
capable of such things. And he would
never have made you capable of loving
him, but that you should be exercised
and made happy in that Love. The
frame and faculties, and capacity of your
Souls; and the scope of Scripture, do all
declare, that you were sent into this
world, to seek after God, and to Love
him, and obey him, and rejoice in him in
your measure; and to prepare for a life
of nearer Communion, where you may
Enjoy him and please him in the highest
perfection. Consider with your selves,
whether a life of sin be that which you
were made for? Or whether God sent
you hither to break his Laws, and follow
your own lusts. And whether the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of your flesh, and the gathering of
a little worldly wealth, and the feathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of a nest which you must so quickly
leave, be like to be the business that you
were sent about into the world.</p>
               <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The next thing that I would have
you consider of is, <hi>How you have answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Ends of your Creation, and how you
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63001:40"/>
have done the business that you came into
the world to do.</hi> Look back upon the
drift of your hearts and lives: read over
the most ancient records of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences:
and see, what you have been,
&amp; what you have been doing in the world
till now. Have you spent you daies in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
after God? and your estates and
strength in faithfull serving him. Have
you lived all this time in the admirations
of his excellencies, and the servent Love
of him, and delightfull remembrance of
him, and the zealous worship of him? If
you had done this, you had not need of
a Conversion. But consider; have you
not forgotten what business you had in
the world, and little minded the world
that you should have prepared for, and
lived as if you knew not him that made
you, or why he made you? was sport
and merryment the end that you were
created for? was ease and idleness, or
eating, or drinking, or vaine discourses,
or recreation, the business that you came
into the world about? was living to the
flesh, and scraping up riches, or gape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after the esteeme of men, the work
that God sent you hither to do. Was
this it that he preserved you for, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63001:41"/>
daily gave you in provision for? what
was it to forget him and sleight him, and
turne him out of your hearts, and rob
him of his service and honour; and to
set up your flesh in his stead, and give
that to it that was due to him? Bethink
you what you have done, and whether
you have done the work that you were
sent to do, or not?</p>
               <p>4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> The next thing you should use to
Consider of is, <hi>How grievously you have
sinned, and what a case it is that your sin
hath brought you into.</hi> If you take but an
impartiall view of your lives, you may
see how far you have mist your marks,
&amp; how far you have been from what you
should have been; and how little you have
done of that which was your business: And
O what abundance of aggravations have
your sins, which I shall pass over now,
because I must mention them under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
head. It is not only some actuall
out-breakings against the bent of your
heart and life; but your very heart was
false, and gone from God, and set in you
to do evill.</p>
               <p>O the time that you have lost; the
means and helps that you have neglected;
the motions that you have resisted; the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63001:41"/>
swarms of evil thoughts that have filled
your imaginations; the streams of vaine
and evill words that have flowed from
your mouth! the works of darkness, in
publik and in secret that God hath seen
you in! And all this while, how empty
were you of inwad holiness, and how bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
of good works, to God or men.
What have you done with all your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents?
and how little or nothing hath
God had of all?</p>
               <p>And now consider what a case you are
in, while you remain unconverted? you
have made your selves the sinks of sinne,
the slaves of Satan, and the flesh; and are
skilfull in nothing but doing evill: If you
be called to prayer or holy meditation,
your <hi>hearts</hi> are against it, and you are
not used to it, and therefore you know
not how to do it, to any purpose: But
to think the thoughts of lust or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
or hatred, or malice, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
this you can do without any toile:
To speak of the world, or of your sports
and pleasures, or against those that you
bare ill will to, this you can do without
any study. You are such as are spoken
of, <hi>Jer. 4. 22. My people is foolish: they
have not known me: they are sottish chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63001:42"/>
and they have no understanding: they
are wise to do evill, but to do good they have
no knowledge.]</hi> You are grown strangers
to the God that made you, in whose
love and service you should live and find
your chief delights. Your hearts are
hardned, and you are dead in your sins:
The guilt of the sins of your lives are still
upon you: You can neither look into
your hearts or lives, no not on one day
of your lives, or the best hour that you
have spent, but you must see the ugly face
of sin, which deserveth condemnation.
You have made God your Enemy that
should have been your only felicity: And
yet you are alwaies at his mercy and in
his hands. Little do you know how long
his patience will yet endure you; or what
hour he will call away your Souls; And if
death come, alas, what a case will it find
you in! how lamentably unready are
you to meet him! how unready to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before the dreadfull God whom you
have offended; and what a terrible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
do you think that will be to
you? most certainly if you die before
you are converted, you will not be from
among the Devils and damned souls an
hour. The Law hath cursed you already:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63001:42"/>
and the execution will be answerable, if
you die in your sins. And thus you may
see the gain of sin, and what it is that
you have been doing all this while, for
your own Souls; and what a case it is
that you have brought you selvs into;
and what need you have speedily to look
about you.</p>
               <p>5. The next step of your <hi>Consideration</hi>
should be this. <hi>Bethink your selves what
a blessed Condition you might be in, if by
Conversion you were but recovered from
this misery, and brought home to God.</hi>
This moved the heart of the Prodigall
son to return, <hi>Luke 15. 16, 17. [When
he came to himself he said, How many hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
servants of my fathers have bread
enough, and to spare, and I perish with
hunger.]</hi> He that had not husks to feed
on with the swine, considered the plenty
that he had for saken at home. The poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
member of the houshold of Christ, is
in a better condition then the greatest
King on earth, that is unconverted. You
might have lived another kinde of life,
then you have done, for safety, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
and true content, if you would
have turned your minds and life to God.
Were you but Converted, you would be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63001:43"/>
the living members of Christ, and his
precious benefits would be yours: His
blood would clense you from all your
sins; and they would be all freely forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you: God would be Reconciled to
to you, and become your friend, yea
your Father and your God; and will
take you for his houshold servants, and
adopted children: The Holy Ghost
would dwell in you, and guide your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
and shew you that which
flesh and blood connot reveal, and bring
you into acquaintance with the mysteries
of God: He will be a Spirit of Light and
Life within you, and work your hearts
yet more to God, and give you yet
stronger inclinations and affections to the
things above. He will help you when
you are weak, and quicken you where
you are dull, and be your remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
when you are forgetfull of necessary
things. He will help you in prayer, both
for matter and for manner, and help you
in Meditation, and conference and other
duties: He will warn you of your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and strengthen you against tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and cause you to overcome; and
if you fall, he will cause you to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
he will be an in-dwelling comforter
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63001:43"/>
to you, and so effectually speak peace to
you in the midst of your disquietness, that
by speaking it, he will create it in you:
And in the multitude of your thoughts
within you, his comforts will delight
your Souls. O what a life might you live,
if Christ by his Spirit did once live in you!
you may easily conjecture how tender
Christ would be of his own members,
how dearly he would love them, how
constantly he would watch over them,
how plentifully he would provide for
them, and how safely he would preserve
them. And if you should come into a
rougher way, he would lead you out:
Afflictions should never be laid on you
but for your good; and continue no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then your need continueth them; and
be taken off at last to your satisfaction
and contentment. Indeed your life would
be a life of mercies: and that which is but
a common Mercy to common men,
would be a speciall Mercy to you, as
coming from your Fathers love, and
furthering you salvation, and hinting
out to you, your everlasting Mercies. You
could not open your eyes, but you
would see that which may encourage and
comfort you: all the works of God which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63001:44"/>
you behold, would shew you his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
his love and power, and lead you
to himself. You could not open your
Bible, but you would find in it the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
lines of Love: O what good it would
do you, to read there the blessed Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of your God! to look upon his
Name; to peruse the description of his
most perfect nature! what good would
it do you to read of the nature, and incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and life, and death, and resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and assension, and intercession,
and return of your blessed Redeemer?
what good would it do you to find those
holy Rules which your new nature is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to, and to read over the Law,
that is written in your hearts, and read
the curse from which you are delivered?
what life and joy would your Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the many, and full, and free
promises of grace! were you once but
truly sanctified and made new, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
would be often comfortable, but
alwaies safe: and when you were in the
greatest fears and perplexities, you
would still be fast in the armes of Christ:
And what a life would that be, to have
daily access to God in prayer: to have
leave in all your wants and dangers, to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63001:44"/>
seek to him with a promise of hearing and
success; that you may be sure of much
more from him, then a child can from
the tenderest father, or a wife from the
most loving husband upon earth. What
a life would it be, when you may alwaies
think on God as your felicity, and fetch
your higehest delights from him, from
whom the ungodly have their greatest
terrours? And it is no contemptible
part of your benefits, that you may live
among his people, and in their speciall
love, and have a speciall Communion
with them, and interest in their prayers,
&amp; may possess among them the priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Saints, and the Ordinances of
God: That in stead of idle talk, and the
unprofitable fellowship of the children
and works of darkness, you may joyne
with the Church of God in his Praises,
and feed with them at his table on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and blood of Christ, and then have
conveyances of renewed grace, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
pardon sealed to your Souls: But
how long should I stay. if I should tell
you but one half the blessings of a Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and spirituall state? In a word, God
would be yours, Christ would be yours,
the Holy Ghost would be yours, all
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63001:45"/>
things would be yours; the whole world
would have some relation to your well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
Devils would be subdued to you,
and cast out of your Soules; sinne would
be both pardoned and overcome; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
would be ministring spirits unto you
for your good: The promises of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
would be yours; and everlasting
Glory would at last be yours; and while
you staid on earth, you might comfort
your selves as oft as you would, with the
believing foresight of that unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
unspeakable, endless felicity.</p>
               <p>O sirs, what a treasure have I here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in a few words! what hearts
would you have, if they were but possessed
&amp; lively &amp; sensible of all that is contained
in this leafe or two! you would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
the greatest Prince on earth his glory,
nor change states with any man that
were a stranger to these things. Did you
but use to consider of the state of the
Saints, how could you keep off, and
stay with sinne, and make so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies
in turning unto God! Sure this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
might turne the scales.</p>
               <p>6<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>The next part of your Meditation
should be,</hi> Of the gracious and wonderfull
work of our Redemption, and the means
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63001:45"/>
and remedies which are provided for your
Souls, and the terms on which Salvation
may be obtained.</p>
               <p>For all the sins that you have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
you are not given over to despaire:
the Lord hath not left you without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remedie.
Your Conversion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is not a thing impossible. Nay
so much is done by Christ already, that
it is brought upon reasonable terms even
to your hands. A new and living way is
consecrated for us by Christ through the
veile of his flesh, and by his blood we
may have boldness to enter into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19, 20. He hath borne
your burden; and offere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h you in stead
of it his burden which is light, <hi>Matth. 11.
28.</hi> He hath removed the Impossibility,
and nailed to his Cross the hand writing
that was against you, <hi>Col</hi> 2. 14, 15. And
in stead of it offereth you his easie yoak.
He hath spoiled the Principalities and
Powers that had captivated you, and
openly triumphed over them on the Cross.
You are not left under the care of making
satisfaction to God for your own sinnes,
but only of accepting the Redeemer that
hath satisfied. This much I dare confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
say to you all, without extending
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63001:46"/>
his benefits too farre. It will be for want
of faith in you, and not for want of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
by the Redeemer, if any of you
perish. And how free are his offers?
How full are his promises? you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally
all pardoned and justified alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as is legible under the hand of God.
And the <hi>Condition</hi> which is imposed on
you, is not <hi>some meritorious or mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
work,</hi> but <hi>the Accepting of the benefit
freely given, according to its nature, use
and ends.</hi> This is the Faith by which you
must be justified. These are the terms on
which you may be saved. And which is
more, the Lord hath provided means,
even excellent, and plentifull, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
means, for the furthering of your
Souls in the performance of this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and helping you to Believe, and
Repent that you may live: And if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
make not these Means effectuall, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
not his speciall grace, &amp; after this you
remaine unconverted, it will not be long
of him, but of your selvs. So that you may
perceive how hopefull acase you are yet
in, by the blood of your Redeemer,
if you destroy not your own hopes, and
make not your case desperate by wilfull
Impenitency, and refusall of free grace.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63001:46"/>
How faire are you yet for Heaven? and
what happy advantages have you for
Salvation? It's brought even to your
doors; It's thrust as it were into your
hands: The Redeemer hath done so
much for you all, as to bring your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to the choice of you own wills;
and if you be his chosen ones, he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
make you willing. You have precepts
to Believe, you are threatned if you will
not Believe, you have promise upon
promise, and Christ himself offered
you pardon, and life, and Salvation
with him, if you are but truly and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
willing. You have God himself,
condescending to beseech you to accept
them: and Embassadours intreating you
in his name and stead: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20.
You have Ordinances fitted to your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities:
both Reading, and Preaching,
and Sacraments, and Prayer. You have
store of plaine and powerfull Books: you
have the Godly about you, most desirous
to assist you, that would be glad to see
or heare of your Conversion: You have
the sight of the wicked, that are wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their own dung, and the dirt of
the world, to make you hate such beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
waies. You have Reason and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63001:47"/>
within you to consider of these
matters, and set them home, and apply
them to your selves: You have time
and strength to do all this, if you will
not abuse it, and provoak God to take it
from you for your negligence. You
have Mercies of many sorts, outward
and inward, to win upon you, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
you in the work! And sometime
Afflictions to remember you, and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
you, and spur you on; The Devil
and all your Enemies are so far disabled,
that they cannot destroy you against your
wills, nor keep you from Christ, but by
your own Consents. The Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
are ready to helpe you, and would
even rejoice at your Conversion. This
is your case, and these are your helps,
and encouragements: You are not shut
up under desperation. God never
told you, <hi>It is in vaine to think of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;
It is too late;</hi> If any have told
you so, it was the Devil, and not God:
And one would think that such Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
as these should drive the nayle to
the head, and be effectuall to move you
to Resolve, and Turne.</p>
               <p>7<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The last thing that I would set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you to be Considered, is, <hi>What's
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63001:47"/>
like to be the end of it, if after all this you
should die unconverted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O sirs, your hearts are not able now
to conceive of it, nor the tongue of any
mortal man to utter it. But so much of
it we can certainly utter, as one would
think should make your hearts to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
You have seen it may be, a dying
man, in what pangs and agonies he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
with his Soul: and you have seen it's
like, the corps that was left there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind;
and seen it laid in the common
Earth. But you see not what became of
the Soul, nor what an appearance it made
in another world, nor what compani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
did attend it, nor what a place or state it
past into. O sirs, when the hour is at
hand that this must be your own case, it
will awaken you to other kind of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
then you have or can have at the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of these words. It's wonderfull that
a little distance should make us so insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of that change which we are all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
will come to pass: And yet through
the folly and deadness of our hearts, it is
so: But they are other kind of thoughts
of these weighty matters, which we shall
have the next hour after death, then the
liveliest affections beforehand can afford
us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:63001:48"/>
The misery was great that the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
did find you in, and which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by your sinne against the Law of
the Creator. But if you be found uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
at last, your punishment will be
much sorer, and your case far worss then
it was before. The Redeemers Law or
Gospel, hath it's peculiar Threatning,
which differeth from the Law of the meere
Creator in severall respects: Even 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. in
the nature of the punishment, which will
be torments of Conscience for the neglect
of a Redeemer, and recovering Grace,
which you should never have felt if you
had never been Redéemed: 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. And in
the Degree of the punishment, which
will be far sorer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. And 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.
in the Remedilesness of it, the Sentence
being irreversible and peremtory: The
first Law indeed provided no Remedy,
but it did not Exclude Remedy, nor make it
impossible: But the Law of Christ doth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
and expresly exclude all Remedy,
and leave the Soul that goeth unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of the body, to utter Despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Misery without Help or Hope
of End. But I shall not stand now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to you the terrors of Judgment or
of Hell, because I have done it already
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63001:48"/>
in other Books, which I desire you to
fetch the rest of this Meditation from;
that is, My Treatise of Judgment, and
the beginning of my third Part of my
Book of <hi>Rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Having tould you what should be
the Matter of your Consideration, I shall
next tell you (but briefly) in what
<hi>Manner</hi> you should performe it. And
here I shall not stand to prescribe you any
long or exact Method for Meditation,
both because it agreeth not with my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
resolved brevity, and because the
Persons that now I deale with are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of observing such Rules; and if
any desire such Helps they may trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the Directions which are given on
another Subject in my Book of <hi>Rest,</hi> to
the Subject now in hand.</p>
               <p>1. Do not stay till such thoughts will
come of them selvs into your minds, but
<hi>set your selves purposely to Consider of these
matters.</hi> Take some time to call your
Souls to an account concerning their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state, and their preparations for
Eternity. If a Heathen <hi>Seneca,</hi> could
call himself every night to an account for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63001:49"/>
the evill committed, and the good omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the day past, as he professeth that
he ordinarily did, why may not even an
Unconverted man, that hath the helps
which are now among us, bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of the state of his Soul? But I know
that a Carnal heart is exceeding backward
to serious Consideration, and is loath
to be troubled with such thoughts as
these; and the Devil will do what he can
to hinder it, by himself, and others:
but yet if men would but do what they
may do, it might be better with them
then it is. Will you but now and then
purposely withdraw you selvs from
company into some secret place, and
there set the Lord before your eyes, and
call your Souls to a strict account about
the matters that I have mentioned even
now, and make it your business to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
your Reason upon them; and as you
<hi>Purposely</hi> go to Church to heare, so <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely</hi>
set your selvs to this duty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
as a necessary thing</p>
               <p>2. When you are upon it, labour to
waken your Souls, and to be very <hi>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
in all your Thoughts; and do not
think of the Matters of Salvation, as you
would do of an ordinary triviall business,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63001:49"/>
which you do not much regard, or care
how it goes. But remember that your
Life lyeth on it, even your everlasting
Life: And therefore call up the most
earnest of your thoughts, and rouse up
all the powers of your Souls, and suffer
them not to draw back, but command
them to the work: And then set the
seven Points that I mentioned even now
before you: And as you think of them,
lobour to be Affected with them, in some
measure according to their exceeding
weight. As <hi>Moses</hi> said to <hi>Israel, Deut. 32.
46. Set your Hearts to all the words
which I testifie among you this day; which
ye shall command your children to do,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>For it is not a vaine thing for you; because
it is your life.</hi> And as Christ said. <hi>Luke 9.
44. Let these sayings sink into your ears.</hi>
So I say to you, Let the Matters which
you think of, go to your hearts, and
sink down to the quick of your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>And if your hearts would slip away
from the work, and other thoughts
would creep into your mind, and you
are aweary of these Considerations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have done their wor, see that
you give not way to this laziness, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63001:50"/>
but remember it is a work
that <hi>Must</hi> be done, and therefore hold
your Thoughts upon it, till your hearts
are stirred, and warmed within you.</p>
               <p>And if after all, you cannot awake
them to <hi>Seriousness</hi> and <hi>Sensibility,</hi> put
two or three such wakening Questions as
these to your selves.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Quest.</hi> What if it were but the
case of my body, or state, or name,
should I not earnestly consider of it? If
one do but wrong me, how easily can I
think of it, and how tenderly do I feel
it; and can scarce forget it: If my good
name be blemished, and I be but disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
I can think of it night and day: If
I lose but a beast, or have any Cross in
the world, or decay in my Estate, I
can think of it with sensibility: If I lose
a child or a friend, I can feel it as well
as think on it. If my health be decayed,
and my Life in danger, I am in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in thinking of this. And should I
not be as serious, in the Matters of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Life? Should I not think of it,
and soberly, and earnestly think on it,
when body and Soul do lie at the stake,
and when it concerneth my everlasting
Joy or Torment?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:63001:50"/>
2. <hi>Quest.</hi> What if I had but heard the
Sonne of God himself calling on me to
Repent, and be Converted, and secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his Commands with those earnest
expression, <hi>(He that hath an eare to hear
let him hear)</hi> would it not have brought
me to som serious Thoughts of my state?
Why this he hath done in his Word, and
doth it by his Embassadors, and why
then should I not consider it?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Quest.</hi> If I did but know that death
were at my back, and ready to arrest
me, and that I should be in another
world before this day sevennight, I should
then begin to bethink me in good sadness:
And why do I not so now, when I have
no hold of my life an hour, and when
I am sure that shortly that time will
come?</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Quest.</hi> If my eyes were but open
to see that which I pretend to believe, and
which is certainly true; even to see a
glimpse of the Majesty of the Lord? to
see the Saints in Joy and Glory, to see
the damned Souls in Misery; and if I
heard their lamentations; would not this
even force my heart to Consideration?
O then how earnestly should I think of
these things? And why should I not do
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63001:51"/>
so now, when they are as sure as if I saw
them, and when I must see them ere it
be long?</p>
               <p>Many more such awakening Questions
are at hand, but I give you but these
brief touches on the things that are most
common and obvious, that the most ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
may be able to make some use of
them. With such thoughts as these, you
must bring on your backward hearts, and
shake them out of their insensibility, and
awaken them to the work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III When you have brought your
hearts to be serious,</hi> be sure that you drive
on your Considerations to a Resolution.
<hi>Break not off in the middle, or before
you bring the matter to an issue; But
let all be done in order to Practice. When
you have been Thinking of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of God, and the world to come,
and comparing them with all the delights
on earth; put the question then to your
hearts, and say,</hi> What saist thou now, O
my Soul? which of these is the better for
thee? which is the more desireable? and
which of them shouldest thou preferre? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
then, and make thy choice accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63001:51"/>
to the light, and convictions which
thou hast received. <hi>When you are thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Reasons that should move
you to be Converted, ask your selves?</hi>
Whether these Reasons be not cleare, and
what you have to say against them? and
whether any thing that can be said to the
contrary, can prove it better for you to be
as you are, and to remaine unconverted?
<hi>Ask your selves,</hi> Is my Judgment Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
or is it not? And if it be (as sure it
must be, if you be not besides your selves)
then write it down under your hands, or at
least in your hearts. I do here confess be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, that his Commands are
just, his motions are Reasonable, his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
are exceeding Mercifull: I am sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that it's best for me to Turn to him
speedily, and with all my heart? I confess
before him that I have no Reason to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
that deserves to be owned, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Reason; This is my own Judgment;
of this I am Convinced: If I Turn not
after this, the Light that is in me, and
the Judgment that I now possess, must
needs be a witness against my Soul. <hi>If you
would but thus drive on the case to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of your Judgments, you would
have a great advantage for the resolving
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63001:52"/>
of your wills, which is the next thing
that you must proceed to. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
next ask your selves,</hi> Why should I
not now <hi>Resolve</hi> and <hi>fixedly Resolve,</hi> to
Turn without any more delay? Is not the
case plain before me? What Reason have
I to stand questioning the matter any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and to be unwilling to be happy? shall
I provoke God by dallying with him, and
hazzard my Soul by lingering out my time,
in such a miserable state? No; by the
Grace of God I will Return; Even this
hour, without any more delay. <hi>Thus drive on
all your Consideration to Resolution (But
of this, I have more to say anon.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this time you may see of what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
this duty of <hi>Consideration</hi> is, and
how it must be performed, that it may
further your Conversion: But because
it is a matter of so great Necessity, I am
loath to leave it thus, till I have done
what I can to perswade you to the
practice of it. To which end I intreate
you to think of these following Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Consideration</hi> is a duty that you
may performe if you will. You cannot
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63001:52"/>
say that it is wholly out of your power;
So that you are left unexcusable, if you
will not be perswaded to it. You say,
you cannot Convert your selves: But
cannot you set your selves to <hi>Consider</hi> of
your waies, and bethink you of those
Truths that must be the Instruments of
your Conversion? Your Thoughts are
partly at the command of your will: You
can turn them up and down from one
thing to another. Even an unsanctified
Minister that hath no saving relish of
Spirituall things, can think of them,
and spend most of his time in thinking of
them, that he may preach them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
And why cannot you then turn
your thoughts to them for your selves?
You can think of House, and Land, and
Friends, and Trading, and of any thing
that ayleth you, or any thing that you
want, or any thing that you love, or
think would do you good; And why
cannot you think, of your sinne, and
danger, of God, and of his Word and
Works, of the state of your Souls, and
of Everlasting Life? Are you not able
to go somtimes by your selves, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of these matters? Are you not
able when you are alone in your beds, or
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63001:53"/>
as you travail in the way, or at your
labour, to bethink you how things stand
with your Soules? Why are you not
able? what is it that could hinder you,
if you were but willing.</p>
               <p>2. Yea further <hi>Consideration</hi> is so
cheape a Remedy, that if you will not
use this, you despise your Souls: yea and
you despise the Lord himself, and the
Everlasting things which you are called
to Consider of. A man that is in danger
of losing his estate, or health, or life,
and will not so much as <hi>bethink</hi> him of a
Remedy, doth sure set light by them,
and lose them by his contempt. A man
that had but his house on fire, and would
not so much as <hi>Think</hi> how to quench it,
doth deserve that it should be burnt. If
your Parents, or Children, or Friends
were in distress, if you would not so
much as <hi>Think</hi> of them, it were a signe
you did not set much by them. Why
Sirs, are not your Souls worth the <hi>Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
on? Is not God, is not your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
worth the <hi>Thinking</hi> on? And
yet you will hypocritically pretend that
you love God above all, when you will
not so much as seriously <hi>Think</hi> of him?
How can you shew greater contempt of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63001:53"/>
any thing, then to cast it out of your
minds, as unworthy to be thought on?
And how can you more plainly shew
that you despise God, and Heaven, then
by such a course as this? If it be not
worth the <hi>Thinking</hi> on, it's worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>3. Consider that God doth not set so
light by your Salvation. He thought it
worth a great deale more: Must Christ
think it worth his bloody sufferings and
worth such a life of labour and sorrow,
and will not you judg it worth your <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
Consideration? If he had not
<hi>Thought</hi> on it, and <hi>Thought</hi> againe, how
miserable shoud we have remained? Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
also must <hi>Think</hi> on it, and <hi>Study</hi>
how to save your Souls. And should
you not <hi>Study</hi> how to save your own?
Must another man make it the business of
his life, to <hi>Think</hi> how to do you good,
that you may be saved? and are you n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t as
much bound to do good to your selves?
Yea, all that fear God about you are
bound to <hi>Study</hi> to do you good? and
should you not <hi>bethink</hi> you then, of the
things that concern your own good?</p>
               <p>4. Moreover, what have you your
Reason for, but to <hi>Consider.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63001:54"/>
do you differ from the beasts, so much
as in your Reason? If you have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and will not use it, you bruitifie
your selves? You live like mad men:
for what is Madness, but a loss of the use
of Reason? And do you think it a small
thing, to deface so noble a Creature as
man, and to turne your selves into beasts,
and mad-men? Do you think that God
will not call you to account for your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
how you have used it? Doubtless he
gave it you for a higher employment,
then to enable you to plow, and sow, and
follow your trades, and provide for
your flesh. If this were all that a man
did exceed a beast in, what a silly wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wight were man? Yea so much more
miserable then beasts, as his knowledg
begets more care, and sorrow, and fear,
then theirs. What matter is it for <hi>having</hi>
Reason at all, if it be not that we may
use it for the matters of God, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life?</p>
               <p>5. Moreover, your Soul is an Active
Principle, which will be working one
way or other: Your <hi>Thoughts</hi> will be
going on one thing or other; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the bare Consideration is no great
labour to you. And if you <hi>must</hi> lay out
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63001:54"/>
your thoughts on some thing, is it not
better lay them out on <hi>these</hi> things, then
on any other? Have you any Better
matters to think on then these? Have
you any Greater matters? or matters of
greater Necessity to think of; You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
sure imagine it; At least you will not
say so for shame. This makes your <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerateness</hi>
an unexcusable sinne. If
<hi>Thinking</hi> were a toile to you, it were
another matter. But when you must
Think of <hi>something,</hi> why not of God,
and your Eternall state, and the way to
Heaven, as well as of other matters.
Will you rather throw away your
<hi>Thoughts</hi> then God shall have them? If
a man command his servant that is
lame, to go on his business, the refuser
hath a good excuse: <hi>I cannot go, or not
without great pain, and danger:</hi> But if
he have a sonne or a servant, that is so
wanton that he cannot stand on his legs,
but spends his time in running up and
down and dancing, and leaping, this
person hath no excuse, if he will refuse to
go on his Masters or his Fathers Errand;
but will gadd about on his pleasure all
day, and will not go a few steps when
he is bidden; especially if it were for his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63001:55"/>
own life, or welfare. So when you have
<hi>Thoughts</hi> that <hi>will not</hi> be kept idle, but
will be gadding abroad through the
world, and yet you will not think of
God, and the matters of your peace,
what wilfullness is this. If you should ask
one that hath it not, for meat, or drink,
or money, they might well deny you.
But if you ask these of one that hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
and knows not what to do
with them, but would throw them down
the channell, rather then you should have
them, what would you think of such a
one? Especially, if it were your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
or your child that owed you much
more? Thus do you by God, and your own
Souls. You have <hi>Thoughts</hi> enough and to
spare, you know not what to do with
them; and yet rather then you will
spend one hour in a day or a week in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Thoughts</hi> of the state of your Souls,
and the life to come, you will cast them
away upon news, and tales, and other
folks business that <hi>do</hi> not concerne you;
yea, you will cast them downe the sink of
Covetousness, and Malice, and Lust,
and Wantonness, and make them ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to the Devil and the flesh. If you
have a brooke running by your Land, you
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63001:55"/>
will endeavor to turn it over your
ground, that seeing it <hi>must</hi> run, it may
as well run that way where it may do
good, as run in vaine. So when your
thoughts <hi>must</hi> run, is it not better that
you turne them to your own hearts, and
states, to prepare for the world that
you are ready to step into, then to let
them run in vaine. If you see a man go
into a wine-seller, (though it be his
own) and pull out all the spigots, and
let all the wine run about the seller, and
suffer no body to catch it, or be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for it, what would you conceive of
the wisdom or charity of that man?
Your <hi>Thoughts</hi> are a thing more precious
then wine, and such a thing as should
not be spilt. And yet is not this your
everie-daies practice? You are before
him that knows your Thoughts: Denie it if
you can. What hours of the day, can
a man come to you, and find your
<hi>Thoughts</hi> altogether idle? What mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
of an hour can a man come and ask
you, <hi>What are you now Thinking on?</hi>
and you can truly say, <hi>Nothing!</hi> I know
as long as you are awake you are alway
thinking of somewhat, (and perhaps
when you are asleep) And what is it on?
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63001:56"/>
                  <hi>This</hi> body shall have a Thought: and
<hi>that</hi> body a <hi>Thought:</hi> every word you
hear, and every wrong that's done you,
and almost every thing you look upon,
shall have a <hi>Thought:</hi> and God &amp; your
own Salvation shall have none: that is;
you will lose them, and let them run in
wast; but you will do no good with
them, nor take in any profit by them, to
your selves.</p>
               <p>6. Have you any <hi>Thing</hi> that better
deserves your Consideration, then God,
and your Salvation? Certainly God
hath more right to your <hi>Thoughts</hi> then
any thing else that you can place them on.
Your flesh, your Friends, your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
business are neither so honourable, so
necessarie, or so profitable Subjects, as
God, and Heaven are. As there is
more profit to be got by the tillage of
fruitful Land, then barren Heath; or by
digging in a Mine of Gold, then in a
Clay-pit. So is there more pleasure and
profit to be gotten, in one hours serious
<hi>Thoughts</hi> of your Salvation, then
in <hi>thinking</hi> all your life time of the
world.</p>
               <p>7. At least methinks you should Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
how disproportionably and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63001:56"/>
you lay out your <hi>Thoughts.</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
you spare God the Tenths; no nor
the hundreth-part of them? Look back
upon your lives, and trace your <hi>Thoughts</hi>
from day to day, and tell me how many
hours in a weeke, in a month, in a year,
you have spent, in serious <hi>Thoughts</hi> of
the state of your Souls, and of the life to
come? Is it one hour of a hundred, of
a thousand, of ten thousand, with some
of you, that is thus spent? Nay I have
very great cause to fear, that there are
some, yea that there are many, yea that
ther's far the greatest number, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
spent one hour since they were born,
in withdrawing themselves purposely
from all other business, and soberly, and
in good sadness bethinking themselves
what case they are in, what Evidence they
have of their Title to Salvation, or how
they must be justified at the Barre of God;
no nor what business they have in the
world, and to what end they were made,
and how they have done the work, that
they were made for. Ah Sirs, doth
Conscience justifie you in this? Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will it not torment you one day to
remember it? What? did thy Land, and
Livings, worldly matters deserve <hi>all</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:63001:57"/>
thy <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and did not the saving of
the Soul deserve some of them? Did thy
lusts, and sports, and wantoness deserve
all; and did not God deserve some of
them? Was it not worth now and then
an hours time, no nor one hours study
in all thy life, to bethink thee in good
sadness how to make sure of a life of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Joy and Glory, and how to scape
the flames of Hell? This is not an equall
distribution of thy <hi>Thoughts,</hi> As thou
wilt confess at last in the horror of thy
Soul.</p>
               <p>8. It is the end of your present Time
and warnings, that you may Consider,
and prepare for your Everlasting state.
What have you to do on Earth but to
Consider how to get well to Heaven? O
that you did but know what a Mercy it
is, before you enter upon an Endless Life,
to have but Time to bethink you of it,
and to make your Election sure! If you
were to be called away suddenly this
night, and the Angel of the Lord should
say to any of you, <hi>Prepare; for within
this hour thou must die, and appear before
the living God.</hi> Then would you not cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<hi>O not so suddenly Lord! Let me
have a little more time to Consider of my
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63001:57"/>
Condition: Let me have one month longer,
to bethink me of the case of my Soul, and
to make sure that I am Justified from the
guilt of my sins: Let me have one day more
at least to prepare for my Everlasting
state: for alas, I am yet unready.</hi> Would
not these be your cries, if God should
call you presently away? And yet now
you have time you will not <hi>Consider</hi> of
these matters and prepare.</p>
               <p>9. Moreover, is it not time for <hi>you</hi> to
<hi>Consider</hi> your waies, when <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</hi>
them: If <hi>he</hi> would forget them or
did not regard them, <hi>you</hi> might regard
them the less your selves: But be sure of
it, he doth observe them whether you do
or not, and he Remembreth them
though you forget them. Dost thou not
know that all the sins of thy life are still
on record before the Lord; saith <hi>Job 14.
16, 17. Thou numbrest my steps: dost
thou not watch over my sinne? My trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
is sealed up in a bag, and thou sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
up mine iniquity.</hi> Do you think that
God forgets your sins, as you forget
them? saith the Lord by the Prophet
<hi>Hosea, 7. 2. They Consider not in their
hearts, that I remember all their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
Now their doings have beset them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63001:58"/>
about, they are before my face:</hi> But, you'l
say, what if God do Consider our
waies? why surely then it is not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but evil is near if nor prevented,
As the Lord saith in <hi>Deut. 32. 34, 35.
Is not this laid up in store with me, and
sealed up among my Treasures? To me
belongeth vengeance, and recompence:
their foot shall slide in due time: For the
day of their calamity is at hand, and the
things that shall come upon them make hast.</hi>
If God be registring up thy sins, thou
hast cause to tremble to think what that
pretends: For in this <hi>hardness and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency
of thy heart, thou art treasuring
up wrath, against the day of wrath, and
revelation of the righteous Judgments of
God,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. As Grace is the seed
of Glory, so sinne is the seed of shame,
and trouble, and everlasting Torment:
and though it may seeme long before the
Harvest, you will tast the bitter fruit
at last; and whatsoever you have sowed,
that shall you reap.</p>
               <p>10. Moreover; if any thing ail'd
you, you look that God should present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Consider</hi> you: Or if you want any
thing, you think he should <hi>Consider</hi>
your wants: And yet will you not <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:63001:58"/>
of him, and of your own wants?
When you are in trouble you'l cry to
God, <hi>Have Mercy upon me O Lord,
Consider my Trouble,</hi> Psal. 9 33. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and heare me O God,</hi> Psal. 13. 3.
When you lie in pain and sickness, you'l
then cry to God; <hi>Consider mine afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and deliver me,</hi> Psal. 119. 153. If
you be oppressed or abused, you'l groan
as the <hi>Israelites</hi> under their Task-masters,
and perhaps cry to God, as the captived
people, <hi>Lam. 1. 11. See O Lord, and
Consider; for I am become vile: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
O Lord, what is come upon us; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and behold our reproach:</hi> ch. 5. 1. &amp; 2.
20. And must God Consider of you,
that will not Consider of him, or your
own Souls? Or may you not rather
expect that dreadfull answer, which he
gives to such regardless sinners. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. And heare
your cries, as you heare his Counsell,
and think of you, as you thought of
him.</p>
               <p>Nay more then so; even while you
forget him, the Lord doth daily Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you, and supply your wants, and
save you from dangers; and should you
then cast him out of your Thought? If
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63001:59"/>
he did not think on <hi>you,</hi> you would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feel it to your cost and sorrow.</p>
               <p>11. Moreover the Nature of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is such, as one would think, should
for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e a Reasonable creature to consider
of it, and often and earnestly to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
When all these things concurre in
the matter, he must be a block or a mad
man, that will not Consider. 1. When
they are the most excellent, or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
things in all the world: 2. When
they are our <hi>own</hi> matters; or neerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
us. 3. When they are the most
necessary, and profitable, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
things. And 4. When there is
much difficulty in getting them, and
danger of losing them, And all these go
together in the matter of your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>1. If you will not think of God, and
your Souls, of Heaven, and Hell,
what then will you think of? All other
things in the world are but toyes, and
jesting matters to these. Crowns, and
Kingdoms, Lands, and Lordships are
but chaff, and bawbles, dirt and dung,
to these Everlasting things. The acts of
renowned Kings and Conquerors, are
but as Popet-plaies, in Comparison of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63001:59"/>
the working out of your Salvation. And
yet will you not be drawn to the <hi>Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of such astonishing things as these?
One would think that the exceeding
Greatness of the matter, should force
you to Consider it whether you will or
no: when smaller Objects affect not the
Sences, yet Greater will even force their
way. He that hath so hard a skin that
he cannot feel a feather, methinks should
feel the weight of a mil-stone: And if he
feel not the prick of a pin, methinks he
should feel a dagger. He that cannot hear
one whisper, methinks should hear a
Cannon, or a clap of Thunder, if he
have any such thing as hearing left him.
He hath bad eyes that cannot see the Sun.
One would think that so Glorious an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
as God, should so entice the eyes of
men, that they should not look off him.
One would think that such matters as
Heaven and Hell should follow thy
thoughts which way ever thou goest, so
that thou shouldest not be able to look
besides them, or to think almost of any
thing else, unless with great neglect, and
disesteem. O what a thing is a stony
heart, that can forget not only the God
that he liveth by, but also the place
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63001:60"/>
where he must live for ever? Yea that
will not be perswaded to the <hi>Sober Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi>
of it for one hour.</p>
               <p>2. And as these are the Greatest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
so they are your <hi>Own</hi> matters, and
therefore one would think you should
not need so much ado to bring you to
Consider them. If it were only <hi>other mens</hi>
matters, I should not wonder at it. But
<hi>self-love</hi> should make you regard your
<hi>Own.</hi> In outward matters, all seek their
<hi>Own</hi> things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21. And have they
not more Reason to seek their <hi>Own</hi> Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?
It is your <hi>Own</hi> Souls, your
<hi>Own</hi> danger, your <hi>Own</hi> sin, your <hi>Own</hi>
duty, that I perswade you to Consider
of. It is that God, that Christ, that
would be your <hi>Own:</hi> it is that Heaven,
that blessedness that may be your <hi>Own,</hi>
if you lose it not by neglect: It is that
Hell, and torment, that will certainly be
your <hi>Own</hi> if you prevent it not. And
shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d not these be thought on? You
will think of your <hi>Own</hi> goods, or lands,
or riches; of your <hi>Own</hi> families, your
<hi>Own</hi> business, your <hi>Own</hi> lives, and why
not also of your <hi>Own</hi> Salvation?</p>
               <p>3. Especially, when it is not only your
<hi>Own,</hi> but it is the <hi>One thing needfull,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63001:60"/>
Luke</hi> 10. 42. It is that which your life,
or death, your Everlasting Joy or Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lieth on: and therefore <hi>must</hi> be
Considered of, or you are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
for ever. Necessity lyeth upon
you; and wo be to you, if you Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not of these things. It is not so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that you eat, or drink, or sleep,
or live, as it is Necessary that you make
sure your Everlasting life. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
also doth answer the necessity. Buy but
this one Pearle, and you will be infinite
gainers, though you sell all that you
have in the world to buy it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.
44, 45, 46. Get God, and get all:
make sure of Heaven, and then fear no
loss, nor want, nor sorrow. If you
count not all the world as dung, for
the winning of Christ, that you may be
found in him, possessed of his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it is because you know neither the
world, nor Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9. Yea
the Delight also will answer the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity:
<hi>For in the presence of God is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Joy, and at his right hand are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
for evermore,</hi> Psal 16. 11. And
the fore-thoughts of them may well make
<hi>glad our hearts, and cause our Glory to
rejoyce,</hi> Psal. 16. 8, 9. <hi>For Goodness and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63001:61"/>
Mercy shall follow us all the daies of our
lives, and we shall dwell in the House of the
Lord for ever:</hi> Psal. 23. 6. <hi>He shall
guide us with his Counsell, and afterward
receive us into Glory:</hi> Psal. 73. 24. And
lest yet you should suspect any lack of
Comfort, he tells you, you shall <hi>enter
into the Joy of your Lord,</hi> Matth. 25. 23.
<hi>And that you shall be with him where he is,
to behold his Glory,</hi> Joh. 17. 24.</p>
               <p>4. And yet if all this might be had with
a wet finger, If Heaven were the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of worldlings, and sluggards, that
trouble not their Thoughts much about
it, then you might have some excuse for
your Inconsiderateness. But it is not so:
there are difficulties, in your way; and
they are many and great: what a dark
understanding have you to informe, what
a dull and backward nature to spurre on?
What an unreasonable appetite? What
rageing passions? What violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
senses to contend with, to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and to rule? Abundance of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
on every hand: A subtil Devil, and
as malicious as subtil: and as furious and
able to do you a mischief, if God restrain
him not. A world of wicked men about
you: each one more stiff in Errour,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63001:61"/>
then you in the Truth; and more fast to
the Devil then you are to God, (if his
grace do not hold you faster, then you will
hold your selves:) and therefore they are
abler to deceive you, then you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
them: Many of them are crafty,
and can puzzle such ignorant beginners as
you; and can put a face of reverence
and truth upon damnable Errors, and
pernicious waies: And those that have
not wit, have foolish violence, and
scorn and passion; and can <hi>drive</hi> you
towards Hell, if they cannot draw you.
All these Enemies you must Conquer, or
you are lost. And is it not time for a man
in so much danger to <hi>Consider</hi> of them,
that he may know how to escape? And
for one that is compassed about with
such difficulties, to <hi>Consider</hi> how he may
well get through them. What abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of things have you to <hi>Consider</hi> of?
of all your life past; of the Relations you
have born; and how you have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the duties of those relations? Of
the time you have had; and how you have
spent it? Of the means you have had;
and what you have received by them:
Of the present state of your Souls, your
sins, your miseries, your hopes, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63001:62"/>
the duties that are incumbent on you, in
order to your recovery. Of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
to be encountred with; and the
graces that are daily to be exercised and
confirmed: should not a man <hi>bethink</hi>
himself with all possible care, and <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and an hundred times <hi>Consider,</hi> that
hath all this to do, or be undone for
ever? You have much to Know that
will not easily be known, and yet must
be known: and much to do, receive, and
suffer, that hath difficulty joyned with
Necessity: Were it Necessary and not
hard, the facility might draw you to
make light of it. And were it hard, and
not Necessary, the difficulty might more
discourage you then the matter would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
you: But when it <hi>Must</hi> be done, or
you must be shut out of Heaven, and lie
in Hell for it world without end; and yet
there are so many difficulties in the way,
I think it's time to look about you, and
seriously Consider.</p>
               <p>12. To conclude; <hi>Consideration</hi> would
prevent a world of misery, which else
will make you Consider when it is too
late. It must be a principall means of
your Salvation if ever you be saved. If
God have so much Mercy for you, he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63001:62"/>
will <hi>make</hi> you <hi>Consider;</hi> and set your sins
in order before you, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21. And
set Hell fire before your face, and hold
your Thoughts on it, that you cannot
look off. He will set before you a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Christ, and tell you, that this your
sins have done, and make you think of
the Reason of his sufferings; &amp; what there
is in sinne that could require it; and what
it is to rebell against the Lord, and runne
your selves into the Consuming fire.
Now your Thoughts are gadding abroad
the world, and stragling after every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle,
and going away from God: But if
ever God will save you, he will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
your hearts, and fetch them home,
and shew them that they have somewhat
else to think on. If Commands will not
serve, he will send out his threatnings,
and terrours shall come upon you, and
pursue your Soul as the wind, <hi>Job 30.
15.</hi> He'l fetch you out of the Ale-house,
and the Gaming-house, and take you off
the merry pin; and lay that upon your
heart, that you shall not easily shake
off. If you are taken up with the Cares
of the world, he'l shew you that you
have somewhat else to care for, and
drown those Cares in greater Cares. If
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63001:63"/>
you have such giddy, unsetled, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
minds, that you cannot call in
your Thoughts to God, nor hold them
with him; he will lay those clogs and
bolts upon them at first, that shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
them from their idle vagaries: and
then he will set upon them such a byass,
as shall better order them, and fix them
for the time to come. Men do not use
to go to Heaven, and never <hi>think</hi> of it.
And to scape Hell fire, and the plague of
sinne, and the curse of the Law, and
the Wrath of God, and the rage of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and never <hi>think</hi> on it: Nor do they
use to mind other matters, and find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Heaven, before they ever
dreamd of it, or before their hearts were
set upon it. No Sirs, if ever God will
save you, he will make you Consider,
and again Consider, and perhaps with
many a sigh and groan; and bring these
things so neere your hearts, that you
shall not only Think on them, but feel
them: According to that Command,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7. &amp; 11. 18, 19, 20. They
shall be as written before your eies: You
shall <hi>think</hi> of them when you lie down,
and when your rise up, as if they were
written upon the testure of your beds:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63001:63"/>
you shall <hi>think</hi> of them when you sit at
home, when you go abroad, as carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them still with you, which way so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you go. As before God was not in
all your Thoughts, so now he will be the
sum and end of them all.</p>
               <p>And if by your Resistance you scape
these Considerations, believe it, God will
bring you to <hi>Consideration,</hi> by a severer
and more dreadfull way. If he do but
give your Conscience a Commission, it
will follow you, and bring you to such
a Consideration, as <hi>Judas</hi> was brought
to. If he lay you under his Judgments,
and speak to you by his Rod, and give
you a lash with every word, and ask you
whether <hi>yet</hi> you will <hi>Consider</hi> of it? It
may bring such things to your Thoughts,
as you were little troubled with before.
If he say but the word, how soon will
your Soul be required of you; and when
you lie in Hell and feel the smart you will
then <hi>Consider</hi> of it. Now we cannot beg
of you to bestow one hour in sober Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;
but then you shall do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intreaty: Then you will be as a man
that hath the Stone, or Gout, or Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake,
that cannot forget it, if he would
never so faine. Forget your folly, your
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63001:64"/>
obstinacy, and unthankfullness, then if
you can, Forget Gods wrath, and the
torment which you feel, then if you can.
Now you were so busie that you could
not have while to think of the matters of
the world to come; but then God will
give you leasure; you shall have little
else to do; You shall have time enough:
When you have thought of these things
ten thousand years, you shall still have
time enough before you, to think of them
againe. You will not Consider now,
but, when <hi>God hath performed the intents
of his heart,</hi> in the latter daies <hi>you shall
perfectly Consider it,</hi> Jer, 23. 20. &amp; 30.
24. O that you were wise, that you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
this; that you would <hi>Consider</hi>
your latter end, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 29.</p>
               <p>What brings so many thousand Souls to
Hell, but because they would not <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</hi>
in time? If you could speak with
any of those hopeless Souls, and ask
them, How came you to this place of
torment? they would tell you, <hi>because
we did not Consider of our case in time: we
little thought of this day, though we were
told of it: We had a load of sinne upon us,
and did not Consider how we might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved:
We had Christ, and Mercy set
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63001:64"/>
before us, but we did not Consider the
worth of them, nor how to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of them: We had time, but we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
not how to make the best of it. We
had the work of our Salvation lay upon our
hands; but we did not Consider how we
might accomplish it: O had we but Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
what now we feel, we might have
escaped all this, and have liv'd with God!</hi>
These would be the answers of those mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Souls, if you could but ask them
the cause of their misery, Ther's scarce a
Thief or Murderer hang'd at the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
but will cry out, <hi>O if I had but
had the wit, and grace to have Considered
this in time, I need not to have come to
this.</hi> Ther's scarce an unthrift that falls
into beggery; no nor a man, that comes
to any mischance, but will say, <hi>If I had
Considered it before hand, I might have
prevented it.</hi> Most of the Calamities of
the world might have been prevented, by
timely and sober <hi>Consideration.</hi> God
himself doth place mens wickedness much
in their Inconsiderateness, and laies the
cause of their destruction upon it.
Whence is it that <hi>Israel</hi> was rebellious to
astonishment, <hi>Isa. 1. 3. Why, Israel doth
not know, my people doth not Consider.</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:63001:65"/>
Job 34 25, 26, 27. <hi>He shall break in
pieces mighty men without number, and
set others in their stead: therefore he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
their works, and he overturneth them
in the night, so that they are destroyed, He
striketh them as wicked men in the open
sight of others: because they turned back
from him, and would not Consider any of
his waies.</hi> Why do men live so wilfully in
sinne, but because <hi>They Consider not
that they do evill,</hi> Ecel. 5. 1. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such hath the world that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
a Wo to? <hi>Isa</hi> 5. 11, 12. that

to their merriments, <hi>but they regard not
the work of the Lord; neither Consider the
Operation of his hands. They Consider not
in their heart, the folly of their waies,</hi>
Isa. 44. 18, 19, 20. When they see Gods
Judgments, they <hi>Consider</hi> not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of them, and therefore lay them

               <p>And when God calleth men to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
or Reformation, he useth to
call them to <hi>Consideration</hi> as the way to it.
<hi>Hag. 1. 5. Thus saith the Lord of Hosts,
Consider your waies.</hi> The Sonne that
shall escape the misery of his Fathers, is
he that <hi>Considereth, and turneth away
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63001:65"/>
from his transgressions, and Considereth,
and doth not his Forefathers works;</hi> Ezek.
18. 14, 20. And when he sendeth the
Prophet to them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12. 3. It is
but with this encouragement; <hi>Though
they are a rebellious house, it may be they
will Consider.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> professeth, that
<hi>Consideration</hi> was the beginning of his
Conversion, <hi>Psal. 119. 59. I thought
on my waies, and turned my feet unto thy
Testimonies. I made hast and delayed not
to keep thy Statutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know that it is the Lord, that must
renew and revive a sinfull Soul: But yet
under God, <hi>Consideration</hi> must do much.
O could we but perswade our people to
<hi>Consider,</hi> it is not sure possible that they
could be as they are, or do as they do.
Would so many thousands live in ease,
and quietness under the guilt of so many
sinnes, and the wrath of God, if they
did, but well <hi>Consider</hi> of it? Durst they
live so peaceably in a state of death, and
in the slavery of the Devill, if they did
but well <hi>Consider</hi> of it? Would they do
no more to prepare for their speedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
before God, and for the scaping
of Hell fire, if they did but <hi>Consider</hi> of
it? Would th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> swallow down their

cups so greedily, and give up themselves
to the world so eagerly, if they did but
well <hi>Consider</hi> what they do? Methinks
they should not. The cause of sinne,
and the Devil is so naught, that I should
hope to shame it with most of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
if I could but bring them to a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Consideration</hi> of it. O how the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Satan would down, if we could
but tell how to make men <hi>Considerate:</hi>
How fast the Devil would lose his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?
What abundance Christ would
gaine? And how many would be saved,
if we could but tell how to make men

                     </gap>te?</hi> And one would think that
this should be easily done, seeing man
is a self-loving, and reasonable creature:
But yet to our grief, and great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we cannot bring them to it. I
should not doubt, but one Sermon, or
one Sentence of a Sermon, might do
more good then a hundred do now, If
I were but able to perswade the hearers,
when they come home, to follow it by
serious <hi>Consideration.</hi> But we cannot
bring them to it: If our lives lay on it,
we could not bring them to it: Though
we knew that their own lives and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
lieth on it, yet can we nor bring
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63001:66"/>
them to it. They think, and talk of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters, almost as soon as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's
done: and they turn loose their
Thoughts; or if they do read, or hear,
or repeat a little; yet cannot we get them
to one half hours secret, and sober <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration</hi>
of their case. This is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why it is so rare a thing to see men
throughly turn to God. This is much of
the use of all Gods teachings, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
too, but to bring men to sober <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</hi>
God knows that sinne hath
unmanned us, and lost us the use of our
Reason, where we have most use for it:
and therefore the means, and Works of
God, are to recover us to our <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
and to make us <hi>men</hi> againe. The
very graces of his Spirit, are to make us
to be more Reasonable.</p>
               <p>And now before I dismiss this Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I have a Question, and a Request,
to make to thee, whoever thou art,
that Readest these lines. My <hi>Question</hi>
is this; <hi>Hast thou ever s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>se greatest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to heart, or hast thou not?</hi> Dost
thou ever use to retire into thy self, and
spend any time in this need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ull work? If
thou dost not, my <hi>Request</hi> to thee is, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63001:67"/>
now at last thou wouldest do it without
delay. Shall I beg this of thee; shall the
Lord that made thee, that bought thee,
that preserveth thee, Request this of
thee; that thou wouldest sometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
thy self into some secret place, and
set thy self purposely to this work of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,</hi>
and follow it earnestly, and
close with thy heart, till thou hast made
something of it, and brought it to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.
Wilt thou then spend a little
time, in reasoning the case with thy self,
and calling thy heart to a strict account,
and ask thy self, <hi>What is it that I was
made for? And what business was I sent
into the world about? And how have I
dispatcht it? How have I spent my time,
my thoughts, my words; and how shall I
answer for them? Am I ready to die, if
it were this hour? Am I sure of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?
Is my Soul Converted, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sanctified by the Holy Ghost? If not,
what Reason have I to delay? Why do I
not set about it, and speedily resolve?
Shall I linger till death come, and find me
unconverted? O then what a sad appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
shall I make, before the Lord.</hi> And
thus follow on the discourse with your
hearts? What say you, Sirs? Will you
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63001:67"/>
here promise me to bestow but some
few hours, if it be but on the Lords Day,
or when you are private on the way, or in
your beds, or in your shops, in these
<hi>Considerations?</hi> I beseech you, as ever
you will do any thing at my Request, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
me not this Request. It is nothing
that is unreasonable. If I desired one of
you to spend an hour in talking with me,
you would grant it; yea, or if it were
to ride, or go for me: And will you
not be intreated to spend now and then
a little time in <hi>Thinking</hi> of the matters of
your own Salvation? Deny not this
much to your selves, deny it not to
God, if you will deny it me. Should
you not bethink you a few hours, of the
place, and state that you must live in for
ever? Men will build strong where they
think to live long: But a tent, or a hut
will serve a Souldiour for a few nights.

charge would this? I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
I have the witness of your Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
going along with me, and telling you
it is but reasonable, yea, and needfull
which I say. If yet you will not do it,
and I cannot beg one hours sober dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in secret, between you and your
hearts, about these things, then what
remedie, but even to leave you to your
misery. But I shall tell you in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
that I have no hope of that
Soul, that will not be perswaded to this
duty of <hi>Consideration:</hi> But if I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you to this reasonable, this cheap,
this necessary work, and to follow it
close, I should have exceeding great
hopes of the Salvation of you all. I have
told you the truth: <hi>Consider what I say,
and the Lord give you understanding:</hi>
2 Tim. 2. 7. Or if you put me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in harsher terms, they shall be still
the Oracles of God; <hi>Now Consider this
yee that forget God, lest I teare you in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and there be none to deliver you,</hi>
Psal. 50. 22.</p>
               <p>And so much for the third Direction,
about <hi>Consideration;</hi> on which I have
staid somewhat long, because I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it of exceeding necessity.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="direction">
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:63001:68"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>DIRECT. IV. The fourth Direction
which I shall give you, that the work of
your Conversion may not miscary is
this:</hi> See that the work of Humiliation be
throughly done, and break not away from
the Spirit of Contrition before he have done
with you: and yet see that you mistake not
the Nature, and the Ends of the work,
and that you drive it not on further then
God requireth you.</p>
               <p>Here I shall first shew you the true
Nature of Humiliation: and 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. the use
and ends of it, and 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. the mistakes about
it, that you must avoid, and 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. I shall
press on the Substance of the Direction,
and shew you the necessity of it.</p>
               <p>I. There is a Preparatory Humiliation
that goes before a saving change, which
yet is not to be despised, because it is a
drawing somewhat neerer unto God,
though it be not a faithfull closure with
him. This Preparatory Humiliation,
which many have that perish, doth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consist in these things following. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> It
lieth most in the <hi>Fear</hi> of being damned:
As it is most in the Passions, so most in
this of <hi>Feare.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It consisteth also in
some <hi>apprehension</hi> of the greatness of our
sinnes, and the wrath of God, that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63001:69"/>
hangs over our heads, and the danger
that we are in of being damned for ever.
3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It consisteth also in some <hi>apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of the folly, that we are guilty of in
sinning, and of some <hi>Repentings</hi> that
ever we did it, and some remorse of
Conscience for it. 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Hereto may be
joyned some Passions of <hi>Sorrow,</hi> and this
expressed by <hi>groans</hi> and <hi>tears.</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. And
all this may be accompanyed with <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions</hi>
of sinne to God and man, and
Lamentations for our misery, and in some
it preceedeth to desperation it self.
6<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. And lastly it may proceed to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
against our selves, and to the
taking of a severe revenge on our selves,
yea, more then God would have men
take; as <hi>Judas</hi> did by self-destroying.
This desparation, and self-execution are
no parts of the Preparatory Humiliation;
but the excess, and error of it, and the
entrance upon Hell.</p>
               <p>2. But there is also a Humiliation that
is proper to the Converted, and which
accompanieth Salvation; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eineth
in it, all that is in the former,
and much more: Even as the Rational
Soul conteineth the sensitive, and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,
and much more. And this Saving
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63001:69"/>
Humilation consisteth in these following
particulars.</p>
               <p>1. It beginneth in the Understanding;
2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> It is rooted in the Will; 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> It worketh
in the Affections; and 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. When there
is opportunity it sheweth it self in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
expressions, and actions.</p>
               <p>1. Humiliation in the Understanding,
consisteth in a low esteem of our selves,
and in a self-abasing, self-condemning
Judgment on our selves. And that in
these Particulars.</p>
               <p>1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It consisteth in a deep, and solid
apprehension, of the odiousness of our
own sinnes habitual; and actual, and of
our selves for our sinnes: and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are contrary to the blessed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Law of God, and so contrary
to our own perfection, and chief Good.
2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It consisteth also in a solid, and fixed
apprehension, of our own ill-deserving,
because of these sinnes: So that our
Judgments do subscribe to the equity of
the condemning sentence of the Law; and
we Judge our selves unworthy of the
smalest mercy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and worthy of Hell fire.
3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It consisteth in an apprehension of
our undone, and miserable Condition
in our selves: not only as we are the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63001:70"/>
Heirs of Torment, but as we are void of
the Image and Spirit of God, and have
lost his favour, and are under his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and enmity by our sinne, and have
forfeited our part in Everlasting Glory,
and how unable we are to help our selves.</p>
               <p>And 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. This is in such a measure,
that we truly judge our sinne, and our
selves for sinne, to be more odious then
any thing else could have made us, and
our misery by sinne in the foresaid parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
to be greater then any outward
Calamity in the flesh, and then any
worldly loss could have procured us.
And this we apprehend by a Practical
Judgment, and not only by a bare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
speculation. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. And the spring
of this is some Knowledge of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
whose Majesty is so Glorious, and
whose Wisdom is so Infinite; who is so
Good in himself, and unto us, and whose
Holy Nature is contrary to sinne; and
who hath an absolute Propriety in us,
and Soveraignty over us. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. And also
it proceedeth from a Knowledge of the
true state of mans felicity, which by sin
he hath cast away, that it consisteth in
the Pleasing and Glorifying, and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, in Loving, and Delighting
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63001:70"/>
in him, and Praising him for ever, and
having a Nature Perfectedly Holy, and
sitted hereunto. To see that sinne is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this felicity, and hath deprived
us of it, is one of the springs of true Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.
And 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> It proceedeth also
from a believing Knowledg of Christ
Crucified, whom our sinnes did put to
death, who hath declared in the most
lively manner to the world by his Cross,
and sufferings, what sinne is, and what
it had done, and what a case we had
brought our selves into. Thus much of
saving Humiliation consisteth in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The Principal seat of this Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is in the Will, and there it consisteth
in these following Acts. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As we
think basely of our selves, so the <hi>Will</hi>
hath a fixed <hi>Displacency</hi> against our selves
for our sinnes, and a kind of <hi>Loathing of
our selves,</hi> for all our abominations: as
you may read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. &amp; 20. 43.
&amp; 6. 9. A humble sinner is allen out
with himself, and as he is Evill, his
heart is against himself.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. There is also in the will a <hi>deepe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting</hi>
that ever we sinned, and wronged
God, and abused Grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and have
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63001:71"/>
brought our selves to this as we have
done; so that the humbled Soul could
wish that he had spent his daies in prison,
in beggery, or in bodily misery, so that
he had not spent them in sinne; and if it
were to do againe, he would rather
choose such a life of shame and calamity
in the world, then a life of sinne, and
would be glad of the exchange.</p>
               <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. A humbled Soul is truly <hi>willing, to
grieve</hi> for the sinnes which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and to be as deeply sensible of
them, and afflicted for them, as God
would have him. Even when he cannot
shed a tear, yet his will is to shed them.
When he cannot feel any deep afflicting
of his Soul for sinne, his hearty Desire
is, that he might feel it. He doth an
hundred times weep in Desire, when he
doth it not in Act.</p>
               <p>4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. A humbled Soul is truly willing to
Humble the flesh it self, by the use of
those appointed means by which God
would have him bring it in subjection: As
by fasting, or abstinence, or mean at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
hard labour, and denying it unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
delights. It's a Doubt worth the
Considering, whether any such Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
act must be used, purposely in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:63001:71"/>
on our selves for sinne, To which
I answer, that we may do nothing in
such <hi>Revenge</hi> that God doth not allow,
or that makes our body less fit for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
for that were to be <hi>Revenged</hi> of
God, and our Souls: But those Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
means which are needfull to Tame
the body, may well be used with this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
intention: First and <hi>Chiefly,</hi> as a
Means for our safety, and duty for the
time to come; that the flesh may not
prevail, and then <hi>Collaterally</hi> we should
be the more content that the flesh is put
to so much suffering, because it hath been,
and still is so great an Enemy to God,
and us, and the cause of all our sinne,
and misery: And this is the <hi>Revenge</hi>
that is warrantable in the Penitent, and
some think is meant 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11.</p>
               <p>5<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As the Humbled Soul hath base
thoughts of himself, so he is willing that
<hi>others</hi> should esteem, and think of him
accordingly, even as a vile, unworthy
sinner; so far as his disgrace may be no
wrong to the Gospel, or to others, or
dishonour to God. His Pride is so far
taken down, that he can endure to be
vilified, with some Consent: not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the sinne of any man that doth it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63001:72"/>
maliciously, but consenting to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Rebukes of those that do it
truly, and to the Judgment of God, even
by them that do it maliciously. The
Humbled Soul doth not stand defending,
and unjustly extenuating his sinne, and
excusing himself, and swelling against the
Reprover: Whatever he may do in a
temptation, if this temper were predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant,
his Pride, and not Humility,
must be predominant. But he judgeth
himself, as much as others can justly judg
him, and humbly confesseth, to be Base
in mens eyes, till God shall think it meet
to raise him, and recover his esteem.</p>
               <p>And the Root of all this in the will is,
1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. A Love to God, whom we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. A hatred of sinne, that hath
offended him, and that hath made us
vile, and 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. A believing sense of the
Love, and Sufferings of Christ, that in
his flesh hath condemned sinne, <hi>(Rom. 8.
2, 3.)</hi> And thus you see what Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is in the Will, which is the very Life
and Soul of true Humiliation.</p>
               <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Humiliation also consisteth in the
Affections: In an unfeigned sorrow for
the sinne which we have committed, and
the corruption that is in us; and a <hi>shame</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:63001:72"/>
for these sinnes; and a holy feare of God
whom we have offended, and of his
Judgments which we have deserved; and
a hatred of our sinnes, by which we have
deserved them. But (as I must further
shew you anon) it is not the Measure,
but the sincerity of these Passions, by
which you must make a Judgment of your
state: And that will be hardly discerned
by the Passions themselves, but only by
so much of the Will, as is in them: and
therefore the Will is the safest to Judg
by.</p>
               <p>4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Humiliation also consisteth expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
in the outward actions, when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
is offered: And it is not true
in the Heart, if it refuse to appeare
without, when God requireth it, in your
ordinary course. The outward acts of
Humiliation are these: 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. A volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Confession of sinne to God, and to
men, when God requireth it, and that
is, when it is necessary to his Honour,
to the healing of them that we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered,
and satisfying the offended:
At least in the hearing of men, in such
cases as these to Confess them openly to
God; An unhumbled Soul will refuse
this for the shame: but the Humble will
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63001:73"/>
freely take shame to themselves, and
warne their brethren, and justifie God,
and give him the Glory. 1. <hi>Joh. 1. 9. If
we confess our sinnes, he is faithfull and
just to forgive us:</hi> Read, <hi>Mark 3. 6.
Levit.</hi> 5. 5. &amp; 16. 21, &amp; 26. 40. <hi>Num. 5.
6, 7. Jam 5. 16. Confess your faults one
to another, and pray one for another, that
yee may be healed.</hi> Prov. 28. 13. <hi>He that
hideth his sinnes, shall not prosper: but
who so confesseth, and forsaketh them, shall
have mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Not that any man is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
his secret sinnes to others, except in
case that he cannot otherwise find relief:
Nor that a man is to publish those offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his owne, by which he may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dishonour God, and hinder the
Gospel: But when the sinne is open alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and specially when the offence of
others, the hardening of the wicked, the
satisfaction of the Church concerning
our Repentance, do require our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and open Lamentation, the
Humble Soul both must, and will submit
to it: But the rotten hearted, unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Hypocrite will <hi>Confess</hi> but in these
cases: 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. When the <hi>secrecy</hi> of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
or the <hi>smalness</hi> of the fault, or
the <hi>Customariness</hi> of such Confessing,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63001:73"/>
doth make it to be a matter of no great
disgrace: 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Or when it is so open, that
it is in vain to attempt to hide it, and his
Confession will do nothing to <hi>increase</hi> the
disgrace. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Or when Conscience is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened,
or they see they must die, or
are forced by some terrible Judgment of
God; In all these cases the wicked may
Confess. And so <hi>Judas</hi> will Confess, <hi>I
have sinned in b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>traying the innocent blood:</hi>
And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will Confess, <hi>I and my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have sinned.</hi> And a Thief on the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
will Confess: and the vilest wretches
on their death bed will Confess: But we
have more death-bed Confessions, then
voluntary Confessions before the Church.
Nay so far hath Pride and Hypocrisie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
and the ancient discipline of the
Church been neglected, that I think in
most Countries in England, there are
many more that make Confessions on
the Gallows, then personally in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Humiliation must be also expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
by all those external means, and
signes which God by Scripture, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
calleth us to. As by <hi>tears,</hi> and
groans, so far as we can seasonably
procure them. And by <hi>Fasting,</hi> and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63001:74"/>
laying by our worldly pomp and brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and using meane, (though decent)
attire: and by condescending to men of
the lower sort, and stooping to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est:
By humble Language, and Carriage:
and by forgiving others, on this account,
that we are sensible of the greatness of
our Debts to God. And thus I have
briefly shewed you the true Nature of
Humiliation, that you may know what
it is that I am perswading you to, and
which you must submit your hearts
unto.</p>
               <p>II. When I have told you the Use and
Ends of Humiliation, you will see more
of the Reason of it's Necessity to your
selves. And first, it is one Use of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
to help on the Mortification
of the flesh, or <hi>Carnal self,</hi> and to anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate
it as it is the Idol of the Soul. The
nature of mans sinfull, and miserable
estate is, that he is fallen from <hi>God,</hi> to
<hi>Himself;</hi> and liveth now to <hi>Himself,</hi>
studying, and loving, and pleasing <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
his <hi>Natural self,</hi> above God. And
a sinner will let go many outward sinnes,
and be driven from the out-works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63001:74"/>
he will let go <hi>Carnal self,</hi> and be
driven from the Castle and strength of
sinne. There is no part of Mortification
so Necessary, and so Hard as <hi>Self-denial:</hi>
Indeed this doth virtually comprehend
all the rest, and if this be done, all's
done. If it were but his Friend, his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities,
his House, his Lands, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a Carnal heart might part with it:
But to part with his life, his <hi>All,</hi> his
<hi>Self,</hi> this is a hard saying to him, and
enough to make him go away sorrowfull,
as <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 22, 23, 24. And therefore
here appeareth the Necessity of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
This layeth all the <hi>Load</hi> on <hi>Self,</hi>
and breaketh the heart of the old man,
and maketh a man loath <hi>himself,</hi> that
formerly doted on <hi>himself.</hi> It layeth this
Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> in the dust, and maketh
us abhorre <hi>our selves</hi> in dust and ashes: It
setteth the house on fire about our eares,
which we both Trusted and Delighted in.
And makes us not only see, but feel, that
it's time for us to be gone. Pride is the
Master Vice in the unsanctified: and it's
the part of Humiliation to cast it down.
<hi>Self-seeking</hi> is the busines of their Lives;
till Humiliation help to turn the streame:
And then if you did but see their
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63001:75"/>
thoughts, you should see them think
most vilely of <hi>themselves:</hi> And if you do
but over-heare their Prayers, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
you shall hear them still cry out
upon <hi>themselves,</hi> and beg help against
<hi>themselves,</hi> as their greatest Enemies.</p>
               <p>2. The next Use of Humiliation (and
implyed in this) is, to Mortifie those
sinnes, which <hi>Carnal self</hi> doth live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and is maintained by; and to stop
all the avenues, or passages of it's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Sinne is <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>dear,</hi> to all that
are unsanctified: But Humiliation makes
it bitter and base. As the <hi>Indians</hi> cured
the <hi>Spanish Captaine</hi> of his Thirst after
Gold, by pouring melted God down
his throat; or as Children are perswaded
from playing with a Bee-hive, when they
are once or twice stung by them; or from
playing with snappish dogs, when they
are bitten by them. So God will teach
his Children to know what it is to play
with sinne, when they have smarted by
it. They will know a nettle from a harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
herbe, when they feel the sting: we
are so apt to live by sense, that God seeth
it needfull, that our Faith have something
of sense to helpe it. When the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
doth accuse, and the heart is smar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63001:75"/>
and groaning in pain, and we
feel that no shifting, or striving will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us, then we begin to be wiser then
before, and to know what sinne is, and
what it will do for us. When that which
was our delight, is become our burden,
and a burden too heavy for us to bear,
it cureth our delighting in it. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
was watering his couch with his tears,
and made them his drink, his sinne was
not the same thing to him, as it was in
the committing. Humiliation washeth
away the painting of this harlot, and
sheweth her in her deformity. It unmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
sinne, which had got the vizard of
Virtue, or of a small matter, or harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
thing. It unmasketh Satan, who
was transformed into a Friend, or an
Angel of light, and sheweth him, as we
say, with his cloven feet and horns. How
hard is it to cure a worldling of the love
of money? But when God hath laid
such a load of it on his Conscience, that
makes him groan, and cry for help, he
hath then enough of it: When he feels
those words in <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. And
he begins to weep, and howl for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
that are comming on him, and
he feels the stink of his corrupted Riches,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63001:76"/>
and the Canker of his Gold and Silver do
begin to eat his flesh as fire, and his
Idol is but a witness against him, then he
is better able to judge of it, then he was
before. The wanton thinks he hath a
happy life, when the harlots lips do drop
as the honey-combe: But when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
her end is bitter as wormwood,
and sharp as a two-edged sword, and
that her feet go down to death, and her
steps take hold on Hell, and he lyeth in
sorrow complaining of his folly, <hi>Prov</hi> 5.
3, 4, 5, 11, 12. he is then of a more
rectified judgment then he was. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh</hi>
humbled in irons, is not the same
as he was upon the Throne: Though
Grace did more to it then his fetters, yet
were they some way serviceable to that
end, Humiliation openeth the doore of
the heart, and telleth you what sinne is
to the quick; and letteth in the words of
life, which passed no further then the
care or braine. It is a tireing work to
talk to dead men, that have lost their
feeling; especially when it is an affective<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and practicall doctrine, which we must
deliver to them, which is lost if it be not
felt and practised: Till Humiliation
comes, we speak to dead men, or at least
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63001:76"/>
to men that are fast asleep. How many
Sermons have I heard that one would
think, should have turned mens hearts
within them, and made them cry out
against their sinnes, with sorrow and
shame in the face of the Congregation,
and never meddle with them more:
When yet the hearers have scarce been
moved by them, but gone away as they
came, as if they knew not what the
Preacher said; because their hearts were
all the while asleep within them. But a
Humbled Soul, is an awakened Soul: It
will regard what is said to it: especially
when they perceive that it cometh from
the Lord, and concerneth their Salvation.
It is a great encouragment to us, to speak
to a man that hath eares, and life, and
feeling; that will meet the word with an
appetite, and take it with some relish,
and let down the food that is put into
their mouths. The will is the chiefest fort
of sinne. If we can there get in upon it,
we may do something: But if it keep the
heart, and we can get no neerer it then
the eare or braine, there will no good be
done. Now Humiliation openeth us a
passage to the heart, that we may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nne in it's strength. When I tell
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63001:77"/>
you of the abominable nature of sinne,
that caused the death of Christ, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
Hell, and tell you that it is better to
runne into the fire, then to commit the
least sinne wilfully; though it be such as
the world makes nothing of, another
man may hear all this, and superficially
believe it, and say it is true: but it is the
humbled Soul that <hi>feeleth</hi> what I say.
What a stir have we with a drunkard, or
worldling, or any other sensuall sinner,
in perswading him to cast away his sinnes
with detestation: and all to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
sometime he will, and sometime
he must needs be tasting them again; and
thus he stands dallying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because the word
hath not mastered his heart. But when
God comes in upon the Soul as with a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>empest, and throweth open the doores,
and as it were thundereth, and lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the Conscience, and layeth hold
upon the sinner, and shaketh him all in
pieces by his terrours, and asketh him,
<hi>Is sinning good for thee? Is a fleshly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
life so good? Thou wretched worm.
Thou foolish piece of clay. Darest thou
thus abuse me to my face? Dost thou not
know that I look on? Is this the work that
I made thee for, and that I feed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63001:77"/>
thee, and continue thee alive for?
Away with thy sinne, without any more
adoe, or I'le have thy Soul away, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
thee to the tormentors.</hi> This wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
him out of his dalliance, and delaies;
and makes him see, that God is in good
earnest with him, and therefore he must
be so with God. If a Physician have a
patient that is addicted to his appetite,
who hath the Gout, or S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>one, or other
disease, and he forbid him wine, or
strong drink, or such meats as he desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
as long as he feeles himself at ease,
he will be venturing on them, and will
not be curbed by the words of the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But when the fit is on him, and he
feels the torment, then he will be ruled:
Pain will teach him more effectually
then words could do. When he <hi>feeleth</hi>
what is hurtfull to him; and <hi>feeleth</hi> that
it alway makes him sick, it will restraine
him more then <hi>hearing</hi> of it could do. So
when Humiliation doth break your
hearts and make you feel that you are
sick of sinne, and filleth your Soul with
smart, and sorrow, then you will be the
more willing that God should destroy it
in you. When it lyeth so heavy on you,
that you are unable to look up, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63001:78"/>
makes you go to God with groanes and
teares, and cry, <hi>O Lord be mercifull to
me a sinner:</hi> When you are faine to go
to Ministers for ease to your Consciences,
and fill their eares with accusations of
your selves, and open even your odious
shamefull sinnes, then you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to let them go. Now there is no
talking to you of Mortification, and the
resolute rejecting of your sinnes: The
Precepts of the Gospel are too strict for
you to submit to. But a broken heart
would change your mindes. The health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Plow-man saith, <hi>Give me that which
I love: these Physicians would bring us all
to their Rules, that they may get money by
us: I never mean to follow their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
But when sickness is upon him, and
he hath tryed all his own skil in vaine,
and paine giveth him no rest, then send
for the Physician: and then he will do
any thing, and take any thing whatever
he will give him; so that he may but he
eased, and recovered. So when your
hearts are whole, and unhumbled, these
Preachers, and Scriptures are too strict
for you: You must have that which you
love: self-conceited precise Ministers
must have leave to talk; but you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63001:78"/>
believe that God is of their mind, or
will damn men for taking that which they
have a mind of. O but when these sinnes
are as swords in your hearts, and you
begin to feele what Ministers told you of,
then you will be of another mind: Away
then with this sinne: There's nothing so
odious, so hurtfull, so intollerable. O
that you could be rid of it, what ever it
cost you! Then he will be your best
Friend, that can tell you how to kill it,
and be free from it; and he that would
draw you to it, would be as Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to you; <hi>Matth. 16. 22, 23. Gal.</hi> 1.
8, 9. Humiliation diggeth so deep, that
it undermineth sinne, and the fortress
of the Devil; and when the foundation is
rooted up, it will soone be over throwne.
When the Murderers of Christ were pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to the heart, they'l then cry out for
counsell to the Apostles. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37.
When a murderer of the Saints is stricken
blindfold to the earth, and the Spirit
withall doth humble his Soul, he will then
cry out, <hi>Lord what would'st thou have
me to do?</hi> Acts 9. 6. When a cruel Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
that scourged the Servants of Christ,
is by an Earth-quake brought to a heart-quake,
he will then cry out, <hi>What
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63001:79"/>
shall I do to be saved?</hi> Acts 16. 30.</p>
               <p>And here comes in the usefulness of
<hi>Afflictions;</hi> even because they are so
great advantages to Humiliation. Men
will be brought to some <hi>Reason</hi> by extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
When they lie a dying, a man
may talk to them, and they will not so
proudly fly in his face, nor make a scorne
of the word of the Lord, as in their prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
they did. God will be more regarded
when he pleadeth with them, with the
rod in his hand: stripes are the best Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
and Rhetorick for a fool. When
sinne hath captivated their Reason to
their flesh, the Arguments to convince
them must be such, as the flesh is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of perceiving. We may long tell a
beast of dangers, and discommodities,
before we can perswade him from that
which he loves. Sensuality doth brutifie
men in too great a measure: And so far
as they are brutish, it is not the clearest
Reasons that will prevaile: And if God
did not maintaine in corrupted man, some
remnants of free Reason, we migh preach
to beasts as hopefully as to men. But <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi>
tend to weaken the Enemy that
doth captivate them; as prosperity by
accident tends to strengthen him. The
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63001:79"/>
flesh understandeth the language of the
rod, better then the language of Reason,
or of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>And as the sensible part of our Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
promoteth Mortification, so the
rational and voluntary Humiliation,
which is proper to the Sanctified, is a
principal part of Mortification it self. And
thus you may see that it's necessary that
we be throughly humbled, that sin may
be throughly killed in us.</p>
               <p>3. Another use of Humiliation is, to
fit the Soul for a meet entertainment of
further Grace, and that both for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Christ and Grace, and for our
own welfare.</p>
               <p>1. In respect of Christ, it is equal, that
he should dwell in such Souls only as are
fit to entertaine him. Neither his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
nor his business, are such as can
suit with the unhumbled heart. Till Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
make a sinner feel, his sinne,
and misery, it is not possible that Christ,
as Christ, should be heartily welcome
to him, or received in that sort as his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
doth expect. Who cares for the
Physician that feels no sickness, and feares
not death? He may pass by the doores
of such a man, and he will not call him in:

But when paine and feares of death are
on him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e will send, and seek, and bid
him welcome. Will any man fly to
Christ for succour, that feeleth not his
wants, and danger: Will they lay hold
on him, as the only refuge of their Souls,
and cleave to him as their only hope,
that feele no great need of him? Will
they lie at his feet, and beg for mercy,
that feel themselves well enough without
him? When men do but hear of sinne,
and misery, and superficially believe it,
they may coldly look after Christ, and
Grace; and feel the worth of the later,
in such a manner as they feel the weight
of the former. But never is Christ valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and sought after as Christ, till sorrow
have taught us how to value him: Nor
is he entertained in the necessary honour
of a Redeemer, till Humiliation throw
open all the doores: No man can seek
him with his <hi>whole</hi> heart, that seeks him
not with a <hi>broken</hi> heart.</p>
               <p>And it's certain that Christ will come
on no lower terms into the Soul. Though
he come to do us good, yet he will have
the honour of doing it: Though he come
to he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l us, and not for any need he hath
of us, yet he will have the welcome that's
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63001:80"/>
due to a Physician. He comes to save us,
but he will be honoured in our Salvation.
He inviteth all to the Marriage supper,
and even compelleth them to come in:
but he expecteth that they bring a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
garment, and come not in a garbe
that shall dishonour his house. Though
his Grace be free, yet he will not expose
it to contempt, but will have the fullness
and freeness of it glorified. Though he
came not to Redeem himself but us, yet
he came to be glorified in the work of our
Redemption. He hath no Grace so free,
as to save them that will not esteem it,
and give him thanks for it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though Faith is enough to accept the
gift, yet must it be a thankfull faith, that
will magnifie the giver, and a humble
faith that will feele the work of it, and an
obediential faith that will answer the ends
of it. And therefore that faith which is
the Condition of our Justification, is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as well to the honour of the Giver, as
the commodity of the receiver. And as
Reason telleth us that it <hi>should</hi> be so, so
Christian ingenuity consenteth that it be
so. The Soul that is truly united to
Christ, and partaketh of his nature, doth
think it's own Receiving greatest, where
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63001:81"/>
the honour of Christ is greatest: And it
cannot take pleasure in the thoughts of
such a kind of Grace, as should disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Lord of Grace himself. As
Christ is solicitous for the saving of the
Soul, so that he makes the Soul solicitous
of the right entertainment of him that
saveth it. And therefore though his
Blood, and not his Teaching or his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was the Ranson of our Souls,
yet he is resolved to Justifie none by his
Blood, but on the Condition of that
Faith, which is a hearty Consent to his
Teaching and Dominion. It is not in the
Application, or bestowing of Christ's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
as it was in the purchasing of
them. When he came to Ransom us,
he consented to be a sufferer, and gave
his cheeks to the smiter, and submitted
to reproach; he endured the Cross, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
the shame, and being reviled, he
reviled not, but prayed for his persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
But when he comes by his saving
Grace into the Soul, he will not there
be entertained with contempt: For in
the flesh he came on purpose to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:
but in the Spirit he comes to be
exalted: In the flesh he came to condemn
the sinne that reigned in our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> flesh,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63001:81"/>
                  <hi>(Rom. 8. 3.)</hi> and so was made sinne for
us (that is, a Sacrifice for sinne)
<hi>(2 Cor. 5. 21.)</hi> But in the Spirit he comes
to conquer our flesh, and by the Law of
his quickning Spirit, to free us from the
Law of sinne and death: both that the
Righteousness of the Law might be full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in us, and also that there might be
no Condemnation to us, who walk not
after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 4. The Kingdom of Christ
was not worldly; for if it had been
worldly, he would have sought to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
it by strength of armes, and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which are worldly means, <hi>Joh. 18.
36.</hi> But his Kingdom is within us: It is
a Spiritual Kingdom: and therefore
though in the world he was used with
contempt, as a fool, and as a Sinner,
and a man of sorrows; yet <hi>within</hi> us he
will be used with honour, and reverence,
as a King and absolute Lord. It was the
houre of the executioner, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of darkness, when he was in his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
but it is the houre of his triumph,
and marriage, and the prevailing Power
of the Heavenly Light, when he cometh
by Saving Grace into the Soul. On the
Cross he was <hi>as</hi> a sinner, and stood in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63001:82"/>
                  <hi>our</hi> place, and bore what was our due,
and not his owne. But in the Soul he is
the Conquerour of sinne, and cometh
to take possession of his own, and doth
the work that belongeth to him in his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and therefore he will <hi>there</hi> be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
and honoured. On the
Cross he was pulling down the Kingdom
of Satan, and setting up his own, but
in the preparatory purchase: But in the
Soul he doth both by immediate executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
On the Cross sinne and Satan had
their full blow at <hi>him:</hi> But when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Soul, he hath his blow at them,
and ceaseth not till he have destroyed
them. In <hi>purchasing</hi> he expended his
own: But in <hi>Converting</hi> he takes posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of that which he purchased. In a
word; he came into the world in flesh
for his undertaken Humiliation: but he
comes into the Soul, by his Spirit, for
his deserved exaltation: And therefore
though he endured to be spit upon in the
fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh, he will not endure to be sleighted
in the Soul: And as in the world he was
scorned with the Title of a King, and
crowned with thorns, and clothed in such
Kingly robes, as might make him the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
object for their reproach: So when
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63001:82"/>
his Spirit entereth into the Soul, he will
be there inthroned in our most reverent,
subjective, and deepest esteeme, and
crowned with our highest Love, and
Thankfullnes, and bowed to with the
tenders of Obedience, and our praise.
The Cross shall there be the portion of
his enemies, and the Crown and Scepter
shall be his: and as all were preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him on Earth, even <hi>Barrabas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
so all things shall be put under him
in the Sanctified Soul, and he shall be
preferred before all.</p>
               <p>This is the end of Humiliation, to make
ready the heart for a fuller entertainment
of the Lord that bought it: and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the way before him, and fit the
Soul to be the Temple of his Spirit. A
humbled Soul would never have put him
off with excuses from <hi>Oxen,</hi> and <hi>Farms,</hi>
and <hi>Wives;</hi> As <hi>Luke</hi> 14. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.
But the unhumbled will make light of
him.</p>
               <p>And 2. As Christ himself will be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
recieved, or not at all, so must
the Mercies, and Graces which he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:
He will not apply his blood, and
righteousness to them that care not for
it: He will not pardon such a masse of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63001:83"/>
iniquity, and remove such mountaines
as lie upon the Soul; for them that feel
not the Necessity of such a Mercy. He
will not take men from the power of the
Devil, and the drudgery of sinne, and
the suburbs of Hell, and make them his
Members, and the Sonnes of God, and
the Heirs of Heaven, that have not
learn't the value of these benefits, but
set more by their very sinne, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the trifles of the world. Christ
doth not despise his Blood, his Spirit,
his Covenant, his Pardon, nor his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Inheritance: and therefore he will
give them to none that do despise them,
till he teacheth them better to know their
worth. Do you think it would stand
with the Wisdom of Christ, to give such
unspeakable blessings as these, to men
that have not hearts to value them?
Why, it is more to give a man Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Adoption, then to give him
all this visible world; the Sunne, the
Moone, the Firmament, and the Earth.
And should these be given to one that
cares not for them. Why by this meanes
God should miss of his ends: He should
not have the Love, the Honour, or
the thanks, that he intended by his gift.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63001:83"/>
It is necessary therefore that the Soul be
throughly humbled, that pardon may
be received as pardon, and Grace as
Grace, and not set light by.</p>
               <p>And 2. as this is necessary for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
both of Christ and Grace, so also
it is necessary for our own benefit and
consolation. The Mercy cannot indeed
be ours, if Humiliation do no make us
capable of it. These Cordials must be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into an empty Stomack, and not be
drownd in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>legm, and filth. A man on
the Gallows will be glad of a pardon: but
a stander by that thinks he is innocent,
would not regard it, but take it for an
accusation. There is no great sweetness
in the name of a Redeemer, to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled
Soul. It sets not by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
the Gospel is no Gospel to it, the
tidings of Salvation are not so glad, to
such a one, as the tidings of riches, or
worldly delights would be. As it is the
preparation of the Stomack that maketh
our meat sweet to us; and the coursest
fare is pleasanter to the sound, then sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats
to the sick: so if we were not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied
of our selves, and vile, and lost
in our own apprehensions, and if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
did not quicken our appetites, the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63001:84"/>
Lord himself, and all the miracles of his
Saving Grace, would be but as a thing
of nought in our eyes; and we should
be but weary to heare or think of them,
But O what an inestimable Treasure is
Christ to the Humbled Soul. What life
is in his promises? What sweetness in
every passage of his grace; and what a
feast in his unmeasurable Love?</p>
               <p>4. Another Use of Humiliation, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in the former, is, that it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to bring men to yield to the terms
of the Covenant of Grace: Nature holds
fast it's fleshly pleasures, and lives by
feeling &amp; upon present things, and knows
not how to live upon invisibles, by a life
of Faith. And this is the life that all
must live, that will live in Christ: And
therefore he calleth them to the forsaking
of <hi>all,</hi> the crucifying the world and flesh,
the denying of themselves, if they will
be his Disciples. But O how loath is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to part with all, and make a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
unto Christ: but fain it would
make sure of present things, for fear le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
the promises of Heaven should but deceive
them; and then they would have Heaven
at last as a reserve. And on these terms
it is that Hypocrites are Religions, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63001:84"/>
thus it is that they deceive their Souls.
But when the heart is truly <hi>broken,</hi> it will
then stand no longer on such terms with
Christ, but yield up <hi>all.</hi> It will then no
longer <hi>Condition</hi> with <hi>him,</hi> but stand to
<hi>his Conditions,</hi> and thankfully accept
them. Any thing will then serve, with
Christ, and Grace, and the hopes of
Glory.</p>
               <p>5. Another Use of Humiliation is, to
fit us for the Retaining and Improving
of Grace, when we have received it.
The Proverb is, <hi>Lightly come, lightly go.</hi>
If God should give the pardon of sinne,
to the unhumbled, how soon would it be
cast away? And how easily would such
be hearkning to temptation, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their vomit. The burn't Child,
we say dreads the fire. When sinne hath
kill'd you once, and broken your hearts,
you will think the worse of it while you
live. And when a temptation comes, you
will think of your former smart: <hi>Is not
this it that cost me so many groans, and
laid me in the dust, and had almost damned
me? and shall I go to it again? Was I so
hardly recovered, by a Miracle of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
And shall I runne again into the
misery that I was saved from? Had I
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63001:85"/>
not sorrow, and fear, and care enough,
but I must go back again for more, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
my trouble?</hi> Thus the remembrance
of your sorrows, will be a continuall
preservative to you. And a contrite spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that is emptied of it self, and is taught
the worth of Christ and mercy, will not
only hold them fast, but will know how
to use them, in thankfullness to God, and
benefit to himself.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Another Use of Humiliation is, to
fit the Soul for it's approach to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
from whom it had revolted. As it
beseems not any creature, to approach
the God of Heaven, but in</hi> Reverentiall
<hi>humility: so it beseems not any sinner
to approach him, but in</hi> Contrite <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Who can come out of such wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and misery, and not bring along
the sense of it on his heart? It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth
not a Prodigal to meet his Father
as confidently and boldly, as if he had
never departed from him: but to say,</hi>
Father I have sinned against Heaven, and
before thee, and am no more worthy to be
called thy sonne, <hi>Luke 15. 18. It is not
ingenious for a guilty Soul, or one that
is snatcht as a brand out of the fire, to
look towards God with a brazen face,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63001:85"/>
but with shame and sorrow, to hang
down the head, and smite upon the brest,
and say,</hi> O Lord be mercifull to me a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
For God resisteth the proud, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
Grace to the humble: 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 5.
Jam.</hi> 4. 6. Though the Lord be high, yet
he hath regard unto the lowly: but the
proud he knoweth afar off. <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. 6.
For thus saith the High and Holy one,
that inhabiteth Eternity, whose Name is
Holy; and I dwell in the High and Holy
Place, with him also that is of a contrite,
and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of
the humble, and to revive the heart of the
contrite ones. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15. To this man
will I look, even to him that is poore,
and of a contrite spirit, and that trembles
at my Word. <hi>Isa</hi> 66. 2. The Lord is nigh
to them that are of a broken h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>art, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
such as be of a contrite spirit. <hi>Psal. 34.
18.</hi> The Sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God,
thou wilt not dispise. <hi>Psal. 51. 17. There
is no turning to God, unless we</hi> loath
our selves for all our abominations, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
16. 63.</p>
               <p>The nearer we approach him, the
more we must <hi>abhor our selves in dust,
and ashes,</hi> Job 42. 6. He will not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63001:86"/>
a sinner in his dung; but will first
<hi>wash and clense</hi> him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 16. Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
must make us humble, and as little
Children, that are teachable, and look
not after great matters in the world, or
else there is no entering the Kingdom of
God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3, 4. And thus you
see the Uses, and Necessity of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>III. By what hath been already said,
you may perceive what Mistakes are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to be avoided, about your Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and with what caution it must be
sought.</p>
               <p>1. One Error that you must take heed
of, is, <hi>That you take not Humiliation for
an indifferent thing,</hi> or for such an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenance
of Faith, as may be spared:
Think not an unhumbled Soul while such
can be Sanctified. Some carnal hearts
conceive, that it is only more haynous
sinners, that must be contrite and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hearted; and that this is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to them that have been brought up
civilly, or religiously from their youth.
But it is as possible to be saved without
Faith, as without Repentance, and that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63001:86"/>
special Humiliation, which I described
to you before. It's part of your Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>2. Another mistake to be carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
is, <hi>The placeing of your Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
either only, or principally, in the
Passionate part, or in the outward expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of those Passions.</hi> I mean, either in
pinching <hi>grief,</hi> and <hi>sorrow</hi> of heart, or
else in <hi>tears.</hi> But you must remember
that the Life of it is, as was said before, in
the Judgment and the Will. It is not
the measure of Passionate sorrow and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
that will best shew the measure
of your sincere Humiliation: much less
is it your teares, or outward expressions.
But it is your low esteem of your selves,
and contentedness to be vile in the eyes of
others: And your displacency with your
selves, and willingness to mourn, and
weep for sinne as much as God would
have you: with the rest of the acts of the
Judgment and Will before described.</p>
               <p>Two great dangers are here before you
to be avoided. First, some there be that
have terrible pangs of sorrow, and are
ready to teare their own haire, yea or
make away themselves as <hi>Judas,</hi> in the
horror of their Consciences: and these
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63001:87"/>
may seem to have true Humiliation, and
yet have none. And some can weep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
at a Sermon, or in Prayer, or
in mentioning their sinne to others: and
therefore think that they are truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:
and yet it may be nothing so. For
if at the same time their hearts are in love
with sinne, or had rather keep it then
let it go, or have not an habitual hatred
to it, and a predominant superlative
Love to God, their Humiliation is no
saving work. That which is in the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and teares may be even forced against
your wills: And it signifieth scarce so
much as a common Grace, where you
are not willing of it. Many a one can
weep through a passionate, womanish,
tender nature; and yet not only remain
unhumbled, but be Proud in a very high
degree. How many such do we ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see; especially women, that can weep
more at a duty or conference, then some
that are truly broken hearted could do in
all their lives: and yet be so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vile in their own eyes, and willing to
be so in the eyes of others, that they will
hate, and reproach, and raile at tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
that charge them with the faults, which
they seemed to lament; or at least, that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63001:87"/>
charge them with disgracefull sinnes: and
they will excuse and mince their sinnes,
and make a small matter of them, and
love none so well, as those that have the
highest thoughts of them. So that Pride
doth ordinarily reign in their hearts, and
break out in their words, and lives, and
make them hate the faithfullest reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and live in contention with any that
dishonour them for all the tears that
come from their eyes. Judge not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by passions, or tears alone, but by
the Judgment, and the Will, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
               <p>2. Another sort there are, much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and happier than the former, that yet
to their great trouble are mistaken in this
point: And that is, they that think they
have no true Humiliation, because they
find not such pangs of sorrow, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of tears, as others have: when as,
their hearts are contrite, even when they
cannot weep a tear. Tell me but this:
Are you vile in your own eyes, because
you are guilty of sinne, and that against
the Lord, whom you chiefly love? Do
you loath your sinnes, because of your
abominations, and could you heartily
wish, that you had been suffering when
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63001:88"/>
you were sinning; and if it were to do
again, would you chuse to suffer rather
then to sinne? Have you a desire to
grieve, when you cannot passionately
grieve, and a desire to weep when you
cannot weep? Can you quietly beare it,
when you are vilified by others, because
you know your selves to be so vile? And
are you thankfull to a plain Reprover,
though he tell you of the most disgracefull
sinne? Do you think meanly of your
own sayings and doings, and think better
of others, where there is any ground,
then of your selves? Do you justifie
Gods afflictions, and mens true rebukes,
and think your selves unworthy of the
Communion of the Saints, or to see
their faces; and unworthy to live on the
face of the Earth? Yea would you ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
God, if he should condemn you?
This is the state of a humbled Soul. Find
but this, and you need not doubt of Gods
acceptance, though you were unable to
shed a tear. There's more Humiliation
in a base esteem of our selves, then in a
thousand tears: And more in a will, or
desire to weep for sinne, then in tears,
that come through force of terror, or
moisture of the brain, or passionate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63001:88"/>
of Nature. If the Will be right,
you need not fear. It is he that most ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
sinne, and is hardliest drawn to it,
that is trulyest humbled for it. He that will
lament it to day, and commit it to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
is far less humbled and penitent,
then he that would not be drawn to it
with the hopes of all the pleasures of the
world, nor commit it, if it were to save
his life.</p>
               <p>3. To avoid this, some runne into the
contrary mistake, and think that <hi>sorrow</hi>
and <hi>teares</hi> are unnecessary, and that they
may Repent as well without them, as
with them; and they lay all in some dull
uneffectual wishes; and so they think, the
Heart is changed. But certainly God
made not the Affections in vain. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be that any man can have a Sanctified
Will, but his Affections will hold some
correspondence with it, and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by it. Though we cannot mourn
in that Measure as we desire, yet some
sorrow there will be wherever the Heart
is truly changed. And <hi>appretiativè</hi> this
sorrow will be the greatest. No man
can heartily believe, that sinne is the
greatest evil to his Soul, and not be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for it. And indeed our Liveliest Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63001:89"/>
should be exercised about these
weightiest things. It's a shame to see a
man mourn for a friend, and whine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Cross that toucheth but the flesh,
and yet be so insensible of the plague of
sinne, and the anger of the Lord, and
to laugh and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est with such mountains
on his Soul. Though grief, and tears be
not the heart, or principal part of our
Humiliation, yet are they to be lookt
after as our duty; yea sorrow in some
measure, is of absolute necessity: and
the want of tears is no good signe in them
that have tears, for other things. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the sense of our folly and unkindness
should be so great, that it should even
turn our hearts into sorrow, and melt
them in our brests, and draw forth
streams of tears from our eyes: and if we
cannot bring our selves to this; we must
yet lament the hardness of our hearts, and
not excuse it.</p>
               <p>4. In the next place, you are hence
informed, how to answer that Question,
<hi>Whether it be possible for a man to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and repent too much.</hi> That part of
Humiliation, which consisteth in the acts
of the Uuderstanding and the Will, <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
be too much as to the <hi>Intention</hi> of the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63001:89"/>
                  <hi>Act;</hi> And if it be too much as to the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
extent,</hi> then as it is misguided, so
it changeth its Nature, and ceaseth to be
the thing that it was before. A man
may think worse of himself then he is, by
thinking falsly of himself, as that he is
guilty of the sinne which he is not guilty
of: But this is not the same thing with
true Humiliation. But to have too clear
an apprehension of the evil of his sinne,
and his own vileness; this he need not
feare. And in the will it is more cleare:
No man can be too willing to be rid of
sinne, in Gods time and way; nor be
too much averse from it, as it is against
the Lord. But then the other part of
Humiliation, which consisteth in the
depth of sorrow, or in tears, may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be too much. Though I know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few that are guilty of it, or need to
feare it; because the common case of the
world, is to be stupid, and hard-hearted;
and most of the Godly are lamentably
insensible. But yet some few there are,
that have need of this advise, that they
strive not for too great a measure of grief.
Let your hearts be against sinne as much
as is possible: But yet let there be some
limits in your grief and tears. And this
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63001:90"/>
counsel is necessary to these sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
1. To Melancholly people, that
are in danger of being distracted, and
made unreasonable, and useless by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
sorrow. Their thoughts will be
fixing, and musing, and sad, and dark,
and full of fears, and either make things
worse then they are, or else be deeply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
affected with them then their heads
can beare. 2. And this is the Case of
some weak spirited women, that are
not Melancholly; but yet by natural
weakness of their brains, and strength
of their passions, are unable to endure
those serious deep affecting apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which others may desire; but the
depth of their sensibilitie, and greatness
of their passion, doth presently endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the crazing of their brains, and
quickly cast them into Melancholly, or
worse.</p>
               <p>And this is a very heavy affliction
where it comes, both to the persons
themselves, and those about them. To
be deprived of the Use of Reason, is one
of the greatest corporall calamities in this
life. And it is matter of offence, and
dishonour to the Gospel, in the eyes of
the ungodly, that understand not the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63001:90"/>
Case. When they see any languish in
unmeasurable sorrow, or fall into distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
it is a grievous temptation to
them, to fly from Religion, and avoid
godly sorrow, and all serious thoughts
of heavenly things: And it occasioneth
the foolish scorners to say, that Religion
makes men ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and that this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
and Conversion which we call
them to, is the way to bring them out,
of their wits. So that by reason of the
grief of the godly, and the hardening of
the ungodly, the Case is so sad, that it
requireth our greatest care to avoid it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But if it be so dangerous to sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
either too little, or too much, what
shall a poor sinner do in such a streight? And
how shall he know when to restrain his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is but very few in the world,
that have cause to feare excess of this kind
of sorrow. The common Case of men,
is to be blockish, and worldly sorrow
doth cast more into Melancholly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
then godly sorrow: But for
those few that are in danger of excess. I
shall first tell you how to discern it, and
then how to remedie it,</p>
               <p>1. When your sorrow is greater then
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:63001:91"/>
your brains can bear, without apparent
danger of destraction, or a Melancholly
disturbance and deminution of your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
then it is certainly too much,
and to be restrained. For if you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
your Reason, you will be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to Religion, and you will be fit
for nothing that's truly good, either to
your own Edification, or the Service of
God.</p>
               <p>2. If you be in any grievous disease,
which sorrow would increase, to the
hazzard of your life, you have reason to
restrain it: Though you may not forbear
Repenting, or Carefullness of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
yet the Passion of grief you must
moderate and abate.</p>
               <p>3. When sorrow is so great as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose
your mind, or enfeeble your
body, so as to un-fit you for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, and make you more una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do good, or receive good, you
have reason then to moderate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
it.</p>
               <p>4. When the greatness of your sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
doth overmatch the necessary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of your Love, or Joy, or Thanks,
and keep out these, and takes up more
of your spirit then its part, having no
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63001:91"/>
room for greater duties, then it is exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and is to be restrained. There are
some that will strive and struggle with
their hearts, to wring out a few tears,
and increase their sorrow, that yet make
little Conscience of other affections, and
will not strive half so much to increase
their Faith, and Love, and Joy.</p>
               <p>5. When your sorrow by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it, doth draw you into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
either to despair, or think hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of God and his Service, or to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
his Grace, and the Satisfaction of
Christ, as if it were too scant, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
for you; you have then cause
to moderate and restrain it.</p>
               <p>6. When your sorrow is unseasonable,
and will needs thrust in at those times,
when you are called to Thankfullness,
and Joy, you have then cause to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and restrain it at that season. Not
that we should <hi>wholly</hi> lay by sorrow in
any day of Joy and Thanksgiving: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we could lay by all our sinne in the
duties of that day: Nor should we <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
lay by Spiritual comfort and delight,
in daies of greatest Humiliation. For as
our state is here mixt, of Grace and
sinne, so must all our duties be mixt of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63001:92"/>
Joy and Sorrow: It is only in Heaven
where we must have unmixed Joyes, and
only in Hell that there are unmixed sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;
or at least, not in any state of
Grace. But yet for all that, there are
seasons now, when one of these must be
more eminently exercised, and the other
in a lower measure. As in times of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
and after a fall, we are ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>led
out so much to Humiliation, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
should but moderate our sorrows,
and the exercise of it be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>veiled for that
time; so in times of Special Mercies
from the Lord, we may be called out to
exercise our Thanks, and Praise, and
Joy so eminently, that sorrow should
but keep us humble, and be, as it were,
serviceable to our Joies. When Grace
and Mercy is most eminent, then Joy
and Praise should be predominant (which
is through the most of a Christians life,
that walketh uprightly and carefully with
God:) And when sinne and Judgments
are most eminent, sorrow must be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n
predominant, as being a necessary means
to solid Joy. And therefore ordinarily
a sinner that is but in the, work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and newly coming to God from
a rebellious state, must entertain more
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63001:92"/>
sorrow, and let out himself more to
groanes and tears then afterward, when
he is brought to Reconciliation with
God, and walketh in integrity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But when is it that my sorrow
is too short, and I should labour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. When there is no apparent
danger of the last-mentioned evils, that
is, Of destroying your bodies, distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
your brains, discomomposing your
minds, and drowning other Graces and
duties, and the rest; then you have little
cause to be afraid of an excess.</p>
               <p>2. When you have not smart enough
to cause you to value the Love of Christ,
and highly prise his blood, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it, and hunger and thirst after
him and his righteousness, and earnestly
beg for the pardon of your sinne; you
have cause to desire the more sorrow: If
you feel no great need of Christ, but pass
by him as lightly as the full stomack by his
food, as if you could do well enough
without him; you may be sure then you
have need to be broken more. If you set
not so much by the Love of God, that
you would part with any thing in the
world to enjoy it, and would think no
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:63001:93"/>
terms too dear for Heaven: You have
need to lie under the sence of your sinne
and misery a little longer, and to beseech
the Lord to save you from that heart of
stone. When you can hear of the Love
and sufferings of your Redeemer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any warmth of Love to him again;
and can read or hear the promises of
Grace, and offers of Christ, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, without any considerable Joy,
or Thankfullness, it's time for you then
to beg of God a tender heart.</p>
               <p>3. When you make many pawses in
the work of your Conversion, and are
sometime in a good mind, and then again
at a stand, as if you were yet unresolved
whether to turn or no; When you stick
at Christ terms of denying your selves,
and crucifying the flesh, and forsaking
all, for the hopes of Glory; and think
these sayings somewhat hard, and are
considering of the matter whether you
should yield to them or not; or are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
Reserving somewhat to your
selves; this certainly shews, that you
are not yet sufficiently humbled, or else
you would never stand trifling thus with
God. He must yet set your sinnes in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
before you, and hold you a while
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:63001:93"/>
over the fire of Hell, and ring your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
such a peal, as shall make you
yield, and resolve your doubts, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>each you not to dally with your maker.
If <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himself be off and on with
God, and sometime he will let <hi>Israel</hi>
goe, and then again he will not; God
will follow him with plague after plague,
till he make him yield, and glad to drive,
or hasten them away. And even where
he deals in waies of Grace, he maketh so
much use of sorrows, as to make men
yield the sooner to his terms, and glad
to have Mercy on such terms, if they
were harder.</p>
               <p>4. When you are heartless and dull
under the Ordinances of God, and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
hath little life or sweetness
to you, and you are almost indifferent
whether you call upon God in secret, or
no; and whether you go to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and heare the Word, and joyn
in Gods Praises, and the Communion of
the Saints, and you have no great relish
in holy Conference, or any Ordinance,
but do them almost meerly for custom,
or to please your Consciences, and not
for any great need you feel of them, or
good you find by them; this shews for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63001:94"/>
certain you want some more of the rod,
and spurre; your hearts be not wakened
and broken sufficiently, but God must
take you in hand again.</p>
               <p>5. When you can be mindless of God,
and of the life to come, and forget both
your sinne, and Saviours Blood, and
let out your thoughts almost continually
upon worldly vanities, or common
things, as if you were over-grown the
need of Christ; this shews that the stone
is yet in your hearts, and that God must
keep you to a harder dyet to mend your
appetites, and make you feel you sinne,
and misery, till it call off your thoughts
from things that less concern you, and
teach you to mind your Everlasting state.
If you begin to forget your selves and
him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t's time for you to have a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer.</p>
               <p>6. When you begin to tast more
sweetness in the creature, and be more
tickled with applause and honour, and
pleased more with a full estate, and more
impatient with poverty, or wants, or
wrongs from men, and crosses in the
world; and when you are set upon a
thriving course, and are eager to grow
rich, and fall in love with money; when
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63001:94"/>
you drown your selves in worldly cares,
and busines, and are combred about ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things, through your own choice;
this shews indeed that you are dangerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unhumbled; and if God have Mercy
for you, he will bring you low, and
make your riches gall and wormwood to
you, and abate your appetite, and teach
you to know that one thing is needfull;
and so be more eager after the food that
perisheth not, and hereafter to choose
the better part, <hi>Luke 10. 41, 42.
Joh.</hi> 6. 27.</p>
               <p>7. When you can return to play with
the occasions of sinne, or look upon it
with a reconcileable mind, as if you had
yet some mind on it, and could almost
find in your heart to be doing with it
again; when you begin to have a mind
of your old company and courses, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to draw as neare it as you dare, and
are gazing upon the bair, and tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the forbidden thing, and can scarce
tell how to deny your fancies, your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
your senses their desires; this
shews that you want some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wakening
work: God must yet read you another
lecture in the black book, and set you
to spell those lines of blood which it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63001:95"/>
seems you have forgotten; and kindle a
little of that fire in your Consciences,
which else you would runne into; till
you feel and understand,, whether it be
good playing with sinne, and the Wrath
of God, and the Everlasting fire.</p>
               <p>8. When you begin to be indifferent
as to your Communion with God, and
think not much whether he accept you,
and manifest his love to you or not, but
can huddle up your prayers, and look
no more after them, or what becomes of
them, and use Ordinances and seldom
enquire of the success: When you can
spare the Spiritual Consolations of the
Saints; and fetch little of your comfort
from Christ, or Heaven; but from your
friends, and health, and prosperity, and
accomodations; and perhaps can be as
merry in carnal company, when you say
and do as they, as if you were consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Love of Christ: this shews that
the threatnings went not deep enough.
Sorrow hath yet another part to play:
You must be taught better to know your
home, and to take more pleasure in your
father, and your husband, and your
brethren, and your Inheritance, then
in strangers, or enemies to God and you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:63001:95"/>
9. When you begin to grow wanton
with Ordinances, or other Mercies, and
in stead of thankfull receiving them, and
feeding on them, you pick quarrells with
them, and nothing will please you: either
the Minister is too weak; or he is too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
or too formall; you must have it
this way or that way; either you must
have more of a form, or no form; in
this gesture, or that order, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
or other is still amiss: this shews
that you want humbling, and that you
are fitter for the rod, then for meat. If
God do but open you a doore into your
hearts, and shew you the monsters and
emptyness that is there, you will then see,
that the fault lay somewhere else then in
the Minister, or the Ordinances: If it
were in them, it was more in you. The
cause of your loathing, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
with the Word, was the fullness of
your own stomack; and God must give
you a vomit, or purge, that shall make
your hearts ake before it hath done wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and then your appetits will be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and your wantonness will cease;
and that will be sweet to you which before
you sleighted.</p>
               <p>10. When you begin to be leavened
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63001:96"/>
with Pride, and think highly of your
selves, and have good conceits of your
own parts and performances, and would
be noted, and taken for some-body
among the godly, and you cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be overlookt, or past by: when
you think mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly of other mens parts,
and dutys, in comparison of yours, and
think your selves as wise as your Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and begin to hear them as <hi>Judas</hi>
magisterial spirit, and think you could do
as well as this your selves; when you are
finding fault with that which should
nourish you, and in every Sermon you
are most noting the defects, and think
that this you could have mended; when
you itch to be Teachers your selves, and
think your selves fitter to preach then
to learn, to rule then to be ruled, to
answer then to ask for resolution; when
you think so well of your selves, that
the Church is not pure or good enough
for your company, though Christ dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owneth
it not, and they force you not to
sinne; when you grow censorious;
and aggravate the faulte of others, and
extenuate their graces, and can see a
mote in another's eye, but will discern
none of their Graces, if they be not as
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63001:96"/>
high as mountains, and none can pass for
Godly with you, but those of the most
eminent magnitude; when you are itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after novelties in Religion, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
your wisdom against the present, or
ancient Church; and affecting singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
because you will be of no common
way; when you cannot heare this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
nor that Minister, though the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ; and you are harping
upon that, <hi>Come out from among them,
and be yee separate;</hi> as if Christ had called
you to come out of the Church, when
he called you to come out of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Infidels: All this cries aloud for
further Humiliation: You have a tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
that must be prickt, to let out the
wind that puffs you up: If you be not for
perdition, and to be forsaken, and given
over to your selves, you must be fecht
over again and humbled with a witness.
When God hath turned your inside out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and shewed you that you are
poor, and miserable, and blind, and
naked, and that you are empty Nothings,
who thought so well of your selves; he
will then make you stoop to those that
you despised, and think your selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of the Communion of those that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63001:97"/>
before you thought unworthy of your
selves. He will make you think your
selves unworthy to hear those Ministers
that you turned your back upon; and he
will take down your Teaching, talking
vaine, and make you glad again to be
learners: In a word, he will by Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
make you as little Children, or you
shall never enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven.</p>
               <p>And this spiritual Pride is a most lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
disease, and the issue usually is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
sad. For with many, 'tis the
fore-runner of damnable Apostacy, and
God gives them once to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
and the wisdom which they so
esteem, till it have led them to perdition.
And those that are cured, are many of
them cured by the saddest way of any men
in the world. For it is usual with God
to let them alone, till they have runne
themselves into some abominable errour,
or fallen into some shamefull scandalous
sinne, till they are made a hissing and
by-word among men; that shame and
confusion may bring them to their wits,
and they may learn to know what it was
that they were Proud of, and see that
they were but silly worms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:63001:97"/>
And thus I have shewed you, when
you must seek after deeper Humiliation,
and may conclude that you are not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
enough: Yea and when a greater
measure, is of some <hi>Necessity</hi> to your
Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Well, but yet you have not told
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is what course a poor Sinner should take in
such a strait, when he knows not whether
his Humiliation, as to the Affectionare
part, be too little or too much?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. You may partly discern
your selves by what is said, whether you
have need of more or less Humiliation,
if you can but try your hearts by these
signes. 2. But yet I would advise, and
earnestly perswade you, in Cases of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
to betake your selves to some
able faithfull Minister for resolution. If
you feel sorrow seize so deep upon your
spirits, that it distempereth you, or
threatneth your understanding, or your
health, especially if your are either pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
women, or Melancholly persons;
stay not then any longer, left delay do
that which cannot easily be undon, but
go and open your case, and crave advice.
This is a principal Use of Pastors, that
you should have them at hand, to advise
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63001:98"/>
with in the diseases and dangers of your
Souls, as you do with Physicians, in the
diseases and dangers of the body. Lay
by all sinfull bashfullness, and trust not
your selves any longer with your own
skill, but go to them that God hath set
in Office over you for such uses as these,
and tell them your Case: This is Gods
way; and he will bless his own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
Melancholly, and Passionate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered
persons, are not fit judges of
their own condition. In this Case you
must distrust your own understanding,
and be not selfconceited, and stick not
obstinately to every fancy that comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your heads, but in the sense of your
weakness rely upon the guidance of your
faithfull Overseers; till your distempers
are overcome, and you are made more
capable of discerning for your selves.</p>
               <p>5. You are further here to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that it is not for it selfe that sorrow
and tears are so desireable; but as they
are expressions of a gracious temper of
the will, and as they help on to the Ends
that Humiliation is appointed to. And
therefore you may hence learn in what
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63001:98"/>
sort you must seek after it. 1. You must
not place the chief part of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in it, as if it were a life of meer
sorrow, that we are called to by the
Gospel. But you must make it a servant
to your Faith, and Love, and Joy in the
Holy Ghost, and other Graces. As the
use of the needle is but to make way for
the thred, and then it is the thred and
not the needle that makes the seam: So
much of our sorrow is but to prepare
for Faith and Love, and these are they
that close the Soul with Christ. It is
therefore a sore mistake of some, that
are very apprehensive of their want of
sorrow, but little of their want of Faith,
or Love: and that pray and strive to
break their hearts, or weep for sinne,
but not much for those higher Graces,
which it tendeth to. One must be done,
and not the other left undone.</p>
               <p>2. As tears are the Expressions of
the heart, so those are the most kindly
and sincere, which voluntarlly flow from
the inward feeling of the evill that we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If you could weep never so much,
meerly because you think that tears are
in themselves necessary, and had not
within, the hatred of sinne, and sense
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63001:99"/>
of its vile and killing nature; this were
not true Humiliation at all. And if the
Heart be humbled before the Lord, it is
not the want of tears that will cause him
to despise it. Some are so backward to
weep by Nature, that they cannot weep
for any outward thing, no not for the
loss of the dearest friend, when yet they
would have done ten times more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
his life, then some that have tears
at will. Groans are as sure Expressions
of sorrow as tears, with such as these.
And the hearty rejecting and detestation
of sinne, is yet a better Evidence then
either. But where men have natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a weeping disposition, which they can
manifest about Crosses in the world, and
yet cannot shed a tear for sinne, there
the Case is the most suspicious.</p>
               <p>3. The principal Cause why you must
strive for deeper sorrow, is, that you may
obtaine the Ends of that sorrow; that
sinne may be more odious to you, and
more effectually mortified: that self may
be taken down, and Christ may be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued,
and desired, and exalted, and that
you may be fitted for a Holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God for the time to come, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from Pride, and kept in watchfullness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:63001:99"/>
6. From this that was last said you
have a Rule by which you may certainly
discern, what measure of Humiliation it
is that must be had. It mst go so deep as
to undermine our Pride, and so far the
heart must needs be broken, as is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to break the heart of sinne, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
self. If this be not done ther's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
done, though you weep out your
eyes. You must be brought so low,
that the blood of Christ, and the favour
of God, may be more precious in your
eyes then all the world, and in your very
hearts prefered before it: And then you
may be sure that your Humiliation is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
whether you have teares or none.</p>
               <p>7. From hence also you may see, that
you must take heed of ascribing to your
own Humiliation, any part of the office
and honour of Christ: Think not that
you can satisfie the Justice of the Law,
or merit any thing of God by the worth
of your sorrows, though you should
weep even tears of blood. It is not true
Humiliation if it consist not in the sense
and acknowledgment of your unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:63001:100"/>
and desert of condemnation, and
if it do not lead you to look out for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and life from Christ, as being lost
and wholly insufficient for your selves.
And therefore it would be a plain contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
if true Humiliation should be
taken as Satisfaction, or Merit, or tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
on instead of Christ.</p>
               <p>IV. Having thus far opened the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Reasons of true Humiliation, I
conclude with that advice which I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
here intended: Refuse not to be
throughly and deeply humbled. Be not
weary of the humbling workings of the
Spirit. Grief is an unwelcome guest to
Nature: but Grace can see Reason to
bid it welcome. Grace is ingenious, and
cannot look back on so great unkindness,
with unwillingness to mourne over it,
<hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. There is somewhat of
God in godly sorrow, and therefore the
Soul consenteth to it, and seeketh for it,
and calls it in: Yea and is grieved that it
can grieve no more. Not that sorrow
as sorrow is desireable; but as a necessary
Consequent of our grievous sinning, and
a necessary Antecedent of our further
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63001:100"/>
recovery: As we may submit to Death it
self, with a cheerful willingness, because
it is sanctified to be the passage into Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
how dreadfull soever it be to Nature
in it self: so much more may we submit
to Humiliation and brokenness of heart,
with a holy willingness, because it is san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
to be the entrance into the state of
Grace. Consider for your satisfaction of
these following things.</p>
               <p>1. The main brunt of your sorrows
will be but in the beginning: and when
once you are setled in a holy course, you
will finde more Peace and comfort, then
ever you could have had in any other
way. I know if you will be medling with
sinne again, it will in its measure breed
sorrow again: But a godly life, is a life of
Uprightness; &amp; Conversion is a departing
from sinne, and consequently a departing
from the Cause of sorrows. And can you
not bear such a sorrow for a little while?</p>
               <p>2. Consider but whence you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Is it not out of a state of wrath?
And where you have been all this while?
Was it not in the power of Satan? And
and what you have been doing all your
lives? Hath it not been the drudgery of
sinne, and the offending of your Lord,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63001:101"/>
and the destroying of your selves? And
is it meet, is it reasonable, is it ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
for you to come out of such a Case,
without lamentation that you staid in it so
long?</p>
               <p>3. Consider also, that it is Necessary
to your own recovery and Salvation. Do
you think to take so dangerous a surfeit,
and then to be cured without a Vomit?
You will endure for the health of your
bodies, the bitterest pills, and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somest
potions, the shortest dyet, and
the letting out of your blood: for you
know that your life lieth on it, and there
is no remedy. And should you not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
for the saving of your Souls, the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
sorrows, the keenest rebuks, the freest
Confessions, and the most plentifull tears?
Sinne will not down at easier rates: <hi>Self</hi>
will not be conquered else: The heart of
<hi>it</hi> will not be broken, till <hi>your</hi> hearts be
broken. We know your sorrows Merit
nothing, and make not God amends for
your sinnes; nor is it for want of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
in the blood of Christ that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
them. But it is part of the fruit of
his Blood upon your Souls. If his Blood
do not melt and break your hearts, you
have no part in him. It becomes you to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63001:101"/>
mourn over him whom you have pierced,
<hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. And this fruit of his Blood
is a preparative to more. You may as
well think of being saved without Faith,
as without Repentance, and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>4. Consider so much as is bitter in it, is
of your own preparation: You may
thank your selves for it. Who was it that
brought you to this Necessity of sorrow?
Have you been all your life time surfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the creature, and causing your
own disease, and now will you grudg at
the trouble of a cure? Whom have you to
blame, and find fault with but your selves:
was it not you that sinned? was it not you
that laid in the fuel of sorrows, and sowed
the feeds of this bitter fruit, and cherished
the Cause of trouble in your selves? God
did not do this: It was you your selves.
He doth but undo that which you have
been doing. Grudg not therefore at
your Physician, if you must be purged,
and let blood, and dieted strictly, but
thank your selves for it that have made it
so necessary.</p>
               <p>5. Consider also that you have a wise
and tender Physician, that hath known
what sorrow and grief is himself; for he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63001:102"/>
was made for you a man of sorrows,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 3. And therefore can pitty
those that be in sorrow. He delighteth
not in your trouble, and grief; but in
your Cure and after-consolations. And
therefore you may be sure that he will
deal gently and moderately with you: and
lay no more on you then is necessary for
your good: Nor give you any bitterer a
cup, then your disease doth require.
When he sheweth his greatest liking of
the contrite; it is that he may Revive
their hearts; and he professeth withall,
that he will not contend for ever, nor be
alwaies wrath, lest the Spirit should fail
before him, and the Souls which he hath
made, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15. 16. He calls to him
the weary and heavy laden, that he may
give them ease, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. He was
sent to heale the broken hearted, to
preach deliverance to the Captives, and
recoveing of sight to the blind, and
to set at liberty them that are bruised,
<hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. When he hath broken your
hearts he will as tenderly bind them up,
and as safely heal them as you can reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
desire. Even his <hi>Ministers</hi> that
labour to break your hearts, and bring
you low, even to the dust, have no
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63001:102"/>
worse meaning in it then to bring you to
Christ, and life, and comfort: And
though they are glad to see the weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eyes of their hearers, and to
heare their free Confessions and Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
yet this is not because they take
pleasure in your trouble, but because
they foresee the saving fruits of it, and
know it to be necessary to your Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Peace. You may read what their
thoughts are in the words of <hi>Paul,
2 Cor. 7. 9, 10, 11. Now I rejoyce, not
that ye were made sorry, but that ye sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
to Repentance: for ye were made
sorry after a godly manner, that ye might
receive dammage by us in nothing. For
godly sorrow worketh Repentance to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not to be Repented of; but the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of the world worketh death. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
this self-same thing that ye sorrowed
after a godly sort, what carefullness it
wrought in you; yea what clearing of your
selves; yea what indignation; yea what
fears; yea what vehement desire; yea
what zeal; yea what revenge;</hi> &amp;c. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
neither Christ, nor his Ministers
have that fond and foolish love to you,
and pitty of you, as you have to your
selves: They be not so tender of you, as
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63001:103"/>
to save you from the sorrow which is
needfull to the saving of you from Hell.
But they would not put you to any more
then needs: nor have you tast a drop of
the vinegar and gall, or shed one teare,
but what shall tend to your comfort and
Salvation.</p>
               <p>6. Consider what sorrows they be
that these sorrows do prevent, and what
those suffer in Hell, that avoid this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sorrow on earth. O Sirs, your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance-sorrows
are joyes to those:
Yours have Hope; but theirs are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with desperation: Yours are small,
and but a drop to their Ocean: Yours
are Curing; but theirs are Tormenting:
Yours are a Fathers Rod: but theirs are
the Rack and Gallows: Yours are mixt
with love; but theirs are unmixed, over-whelming
them with confusion: Yours
are short; but theirs are endless. And
had you rather sorrow as they do, then
as the godly do? Had you rather howl
with Devils and rebels, then weep with
Saints and Children? Had you rather be
broken in Hell by Torments, then on
earth by Grace? Is it not an unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
thing of you, to make such a stir
at the sorrow that must save you, when
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63001:103"/>
you remember what it would save you
from, and what all must suffer that are
not Humbled here by Grace. O it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
kind of sorrow that others are now
enduring. Grudg not at the pricking of
a vein, when so many thousands are
everlastingly bleeding at the heart.</p>
               <p>7. Consider, The more you are right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Humbled, the sweeter will Christ and
all his Mercies be to you ever after while
you live. One tast of the healing Love of
Christ, will make you bless those sorrows
that prepared for it. The same Christ is
not equally esteemed even by all that he
will save: And had you not rather be
emptied yet more of your selves, that
you may be fuller of Christ hereafter?
When you do but feel his arms embracing
you, and perceive him in that posture as
the prodigal's Father was, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 20.
You will thank that sorrow that fitted
you for his armes.</p>
               <p>8. If you be throughly humbled, you
will walk the more safely all your daies,
<hi>if other things correspond.</hi> It will make
you hate the sinne you smarted by, and
fly the occasions of that which cost you
once so dear.</p>
               <p>9. The sinne of Pride, is one of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:63001:104"/>
most mortal damning sins, in the world;
and that which thousands of professors do
miscarry by. And Humiliation is most
directly contrary to this: and therefore
must needs be an amiable and necessary
thing. It's worth all the sorrow that a
hundred men endure here, to be saved
from this dangerous sinne of Pride.</p>
               <p>10. A through Humiliation is usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a signe of the greater Exaltation, to
come after. <hi>For those that humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
shall be exalted; and those that exalt
themselves shall be brought low,</hi> Luke 14.
11. <hi>Humble your selves therefore under
the mighty hand of God, and he shall lift
you up,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 5. The higher you
mean to build, the deeper you will dig
to lay the foundation. Your Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are like to be greater, as your sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
have been greater. You may be
free from those doubts that follow others
all their daies, lest they were never truly
humbled. You need not be still que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning,
or pulling up your foundations,
as if you were to begin again. It is a sign
that you are intended to greater employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(if other things concurre.) <hi>Paul</hi>
must be laid exceeding low in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
that he might be the fitter as a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63001:104"/>
chosen Vessel, to bear Christs Name
among the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Lay all this now together Sirs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what cause you have to cherish the
Humbling works of Grace, and not to
quench them. When your hearts begin
to be afflicted for sinne, go not among
foolish and merry Companions, to drink
or laugh it away: drive it not out of
your minds, as unkindly, as if it came
to do you hurt: But get alone, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of the matter, and on your knees
in secret, beseech the Lord to follow it
home, and break your hearts, and make
you meet for his healing consolations,
and not to leave you in this red sea, but
to bring you through, and put the
Songs of praise into your mouths.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="direction">
               <p>DIRECT. V. Having thus directed
you about your Humiliation, the next Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
which I would offer you, that
you may not miscarry in the worke of
Conversion, is this: <hi>See that you close
with the Lord Jesus Christ, understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
heartily, and entirly as he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
and offered to you in the Gospel.</hi> In
this your Christianity doth consist: Upon
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:63001:105"/>
this your Justification, and Salvation lie.
This is the summe of your Coversion;
and the very heart of the New creature.
The rest is all but the preparatives to this,
or the fruits of this. Christ is the end
and the fulfiling of the Law; the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Gospel; the way to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
the life, the help, the hope of
the Believer. If you know not him, you
<hi>know</hi> nothing: If you possess not him,
you <hi>have</hi> nothing: And if you are out of
him, you <hi>can do</hi> nothing; that hath a
promise of Salvation. And therefore I
shall distinctly (though briefly) tell you
what it is to <hi>close with Christ, Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standingly,
heartily, and entirely, as he
is offered in the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I. That you may close with
Christ <hi>Vnderstandingly,</hi> you must look
to these things: 1. That you understand
who Christ is, as in his Person and his
Offices: 2. That you understand the
<hi>Reason</hi> of his undertaking: 3. That you
understand, what it is that he hath done
and suffered for us. 4 That you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Nature and worth of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
and what he <hi>will</hi> do for you. 5. That
you understand the terms on which he
conveyeth these benefits to men; and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63001:105"/>
what is the nature, extent, and condition
of his promises. And 6. that you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the <hi>Certain Truth,</hi> of all this.</p>
               <p>For the first, you must understand,
that Jesus Christ hath two Natures in one
Person: that he is both <hi>God and Man:</hi>
As he is <hi>God,</hi> he is of the same substance
with his Father, and one in essence with
him; the Second Person in the Blessed
Trinity; the Word of God; the only
begotten Sonne of the Father; Eternal,
Incomprehensible, and Infinite: As
<hi>Man,</hi> he hath a true Humane Soul and
body as men have: so that his Godhead,
his Humane Soul, and his Body, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
distinct. This Humane Nature was
conceived by the Holy Ghost in the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary,</hi> without man, and born of
of her, and is so truly united to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, as that they are one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
Not that the Godhead is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the manhood, nor the manhood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Godhead; but the Godhead hath
taken the manhood into <hi>Personal</hi> Unity
with it self. This was not from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but when man had sinned, and had
lost himself, and needed a Redeemer. By
reason of his Miraculous Conception,
he was free from all Original sinne,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:63001:106"/>
being holy, harmless, and undefiled.
His Person, and Natures, were fit for his
Office; which was to be the Mediator
between God and man, to make Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
and recover us to God. Had
he not been God, but meer man, his
dignity would not have been sufficient for
such an interposition, nor his obedience
or sufferings, of any such value, as to
be the price of our Redemption: Nor
could he have born our burden, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
death, and risen again, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
the Prince of death, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
nor have ruled his Church, and
preserved, and sanctified them, and
prospered his Cause, and subdued his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
nor effectually interceded with
the Father, nor judged the world, or
raised the dead, and done the work of a
perfect Saviour. Nor was the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Nature sufficient for this Office. Had
he not been man, he had not been neer
enough to us, to have suffered in our
stead, and taught us by his Doctrin, and
given us his Example, nor could he have
suffered, or dyed for us: For God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
die or suffer. As he is God he is One
in Nature with the Father; and as he is
man, he is One in Nature with us: and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:63001:106"/>
therefore is fit to Mediate for us; and in
him we are brought thus nigh to God.
To this Office of the Mediator there are
many acts belonging, from whence it
hath several denominations, of which
more anon. So much of Christ's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>2. The next thing that you must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
is, the <hi>Reason and Ends</hi> of his
Undertaking; which though we are not
able fully to comprehend (nor the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of any of the works of God,) yet
must we observe so much as is revealed.
And these following Ends or Reasons of
this work, do shew themselves clearly
in the Scripture, and in the event.</p>
               <p>1. One is, <hi>The Demonstration of Gods
Justice, as he is Governor of the world,
according to the Law of Nature.</hi> He made
man rational and a voluntary Agent, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Good or Evil, with Desires and
Hopes of the Good, and fears of the
Evil; and so to be ruled according to his
Nature. He made for him a Law that
Revealed Good and Evil, with Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to move him by Desire, and Hope,
and with Threatnings to drive him by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:63001:107"/>
Fear. By these engins God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to govern mankind. This Law
was the Rule of mans <hi>Duty,</hi> and of his
<hi>Receivings,</hi> or of Gods Judgment: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Law, the world was to
be Governed by God. His Governing
Justice consisteth in giving all their Due,
according to his Law: At least so far as
that the End of the Law may be attained,
that is, the honour of the Law-giver pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
transgression made odious by the
terror of penalty, and obedience made
honourable by its fruits of impunity and
reward: Otherwise the Law would not
have deterred effectually from Evil, nor
encouraged to Good, especially to so
much as Creatures must go through for
the Crown of Life: And so the Law
would have been no fit Instrument for
the Government of the world: that is,
the Law would have been no Law. But
this the Wise and Righteous God would
not be guilty of, of making a Law that
was no Law; and was unmeet for the
ends, to which he made it; which was
essential to it as a Law. There was no
way to avoid this intollerable consequent,
when man had sinned, but <hi>strict execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Law, or by <hi>sufficient Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:63001:107"/>
in stead of such an Execution. The
Execution would have destroyed the
Commonwealth, even the whole inferior
world, at least, the reasonable Creature
who was the Subject. The Wisdom, and
Love, and Mercy of God would not
give way to this, that the world should
be destroyed so soon after it was made,
and man left remediless in everlasting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery:
Satisfaction therefore must be the
Remedy: This must be such as might be
as fit to procure the Ends of the Law, as
if the Law it self had been executed, that
is; as if the offendors had all dyed the
death that it did threaten. It must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be a publik Demonstration of Justice,
and of the odiousness of Sinne, to the
terrour, and warning of sinners for the
future: And this was done by Jesus
Christ, when none else in Heaven, or
Earth could do it: For it did as fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
this Justice of God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
his honour, and the usefullness of
his Law and government, that a Person
so high and Glorious, and so dear to
him, should suffer so much for sinne, as
if all the world had suffered for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And thus God <hi>made him to be
sinne for us, who knew no sinne.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:63001:108"/>
21. And thus <hi>Christ hath Redeemed us
from the Curse of the Law, being made a
Curse for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13.</p>
               <p>2. Hereby also God <hi>Demonstrated the
Holiness of his Nature:</hi> How much he
hateth sinne; and how unreconcilable he
is to it; as light to darkness: As the
Law and Judgments of God do proceed
from his Perfect Nature and Will, so do
they bear the Image of that perfection,
and demonstrate it to the world. This
therefore is the nobler End, and work
of Christ in our redemption, to declare
the Holiness and Perfection of God in
his Nature and Will; though the former
(the declaring of his Governing Justice)
be the neerer End. If the death of
<hi>Aarons</hi> two sonnes were such a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>that God will be sanctified in all
that draw neer him.</hi> Lev. 10. 2, 3, If his
Laws and present Judgments do declare
him to be <hi>a Holy and Jealous God, that
will not forgive sinne (without a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
consideration, or satisfaction)</hi> Jos. 24.
19. <hi>how much more evidently is this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the death of Christ? If the Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shemites
cry out, who is able to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Holy Lord God?</hi> 1 Sam. 6. 20.
Upon the death of 50070 men; how
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:63001:108"/>
much more may the guilty Soul say so,
when he thinks on the Crucified Sonne of
God? As it is the End of Gods exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
on transgressors, that <hi>the Lord may
be exalted in Judgment, and God that is
Holy may be Sanctified in Righteousness;</hi>
Isa. 5. 16. So was it his End in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of his Sonne.</p>
               <p>3. Another End of our Redemption
by Christ, is the <hi>Demonstration of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Wisdom of God.</hi> His <hi>Wisdom</hi> in the
preventing the ruin of the late-created
world; that it might not be said that sin
and Satan had frustrated him of the Glory
of his Creation, and destroyed it almost
as soon as he had made it: Yea in getting
an advantage by the malice of his enemies,
for the more admirable attainment of the
Ends of his Law, and the Glorifying of
all his Governing Attributes: He would
not have made man a free Agent, and left
him in the hand of his own will, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him to sinne, if his Wisdom had
not known how to <hi>secure</hi> his own Intrest
and Honour to the full. And so also in
the oeconomy and admirable frame of his
Gracious Sapiential Government by
Christ, the manifold Wisdom of God
doth shine forth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 9, 10. As
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:63001:109"/>
the wonderfull structure of Heaven, and
Earth, and every part of this Natural
frame, doth gloriously reveale the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Creator; so the wonderfull
Contrivance of our Redemption by
Christ, and the Reparation of the world
by him, and the Moral frame of this
Evangelical dispensation, doth wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
demonstrate the Wisdom of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
And as the observation of our
Natures, may give us Cause to say with
<hi>David, Psal. 139. 14. I will praise thee,
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.</hi>
So the observation of our new Natures and
condition, may well cause us to say, <hi>I
will praise thee; for I am graciously and
wonderfully Redeemed, marvelous are thy
Works, and that my Soul knoweth right
well.</hi> As Nature may teach us to admire
the frame of Nature; so Grace will teach
us to admire the frame of Grace; and to
see the beauty of its several parts; and
much more of the <hi>whole</hi> where all the
parts are orderly composed.</p>
               <p>4. Yea <hi>the very Power of God is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
in Christ.</hi> And therefore he is called,
1 <hi>Cor. 1. 24. The Power of God, and the
Wisdom of God:</hi> not only <hi>formally,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ himself is the <hi>Wise and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:63001:109"/>
Powerfull God;</hi> nor only <hi>Efficiently,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God doth <hi>exercise his Power</hi> and
Wisdom, by his Sonne in Creation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and Government; but also
<hi>Effectually</hi> and <hi>Objectively,</hi> as Christ is
the great and most admirable <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
of the <hi>Power and Wisdom of God,</hi>
in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What work transcendeth the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
Miracle of the Incarnation?
That God should assume the Nature of
man into personal Union? The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sunne; is no greater a work
of</hi> Power, <hi>then the Incarnation, and
sending of the Sonne of God, the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Sunne, the Light of the world,</hi>
That living Light, that lightneth every
one that cometh into the world: though
yet the darkness comprehendeth not his
light. <hi>Joh. 1. 4, 6, 9. What was he but
the living visable Power of God, when
he healed all diseases, cast out Devils,
raised the dead, and rose from the dead
himself, and ascended into Glory, and
sent down the Holy Spirit on his Church,
enduing them with</hi> Power <hi>from on high.</hi>
Acts 1. 8. Luke 24. 49. <hi>when he was
on Earth, he was</hi> Anointed with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, and with Power, and went
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63001:110"/>
about doing good, and healing all that were
oppressed of the Devil, <hi>Acts 10. 38. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead</hi> he was declared to be the Sonne of
God with Power, by the Resurrection from
the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. When he ascended
up on high, he led captivity captive, <hi>Eph.
4. 8. Yea, he filled his servants with
power,</hi> Act. 6. 8. <hi>Even such as was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
and desired by the ungodly,</hi> Act. 8.
19. <hi>He being</hi> the brightness of Gods Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the express Image of his Person,
and upholding all things by the Word of his
Power, when he had by himself purged our
sinnes, he sate down on the right hand of
the Majesty on high, being made so much
better then the Angels, as he hath by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
obtained a more excellent Name
then they, <hi>Heb. 1. 3, 4. As Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in his glorified Humanity united to
the Godhead, is far more excellent then
the Angels of God, and more glorious
then the Sunne, so is the</hi> Power <hi>of God
more abundantly demonstrated in him,
than in the Sunne, or the Angels, or
any other Creature. The Illuminated do
know this,</hi> and what is the exceeding
greatness of his Power, to us-ward who
believe, according to the working of his
mighty Power, which he wrought in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:63001:110"/>
Christ when he raised him from the dead,
and set him at his own right hand in the
Celestials, farre above all Principality
and Power and Might and Dominion, and
every name that is named, not only in this
world, but also in that which is to come;
and hath put all things under his feet, and
given him to be Head over all things to the
Church, which is his body, the fullness
of him that filleth all in all, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 19.
20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>Besides this, even in the Works of Christ
for his Church, his Calling, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
and Ruling, and Preserving them,
his subduing their Enemies, and raising
them from the dead, and Glorifying
them with himself, how glorious is the
very <hi>Power</hi> of God by his Sonne, 2 <hi>Thes.
1. 11. Phil. 3. 10. Ephes. 3. 7, 20.
2 Pet. 1. 3, 16. 1 Cor. 4. 20. Ephes. 6.
10. 1 Cor. 15. 43. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 5. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Gospel may well be called, <hi>The
Power of God to Salvation,</hi> Rom. 1. 16.
Which hath been the Instrument of his
<hi>Power</hi> in doing such wonderful works in
the world. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. &amp; 2. 5. 2 <hi>Cor.
6. 7. 2. Cor.</hi> 13. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>5. But the most sweet, and conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
End of our Redemption, was the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:63001:111"/>
Demonstration <hi>of Gods Love and Mercy</hi>
to man-kind, and that he might <hi>make
known the Riches of his Glory on the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of Mercy, prepared unto Glory,</hi>
Rom. 9. 23. Of all Gods Attributes
there is none shineth more illustrously in
the work of our Redemption than <hi>Love
and Mercy. Hereby perceive we the Love
of God, because he laid down his life for us,</hi>
1 Joh. 3. 16. By the Creation, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation
of us we perceive the Love of
God, but more abundantly by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
<hi>In this was manifested the
Love of God towards us, because that God
sent his only begotten Sonne into the world,
that we might live through him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.
9. O wonderfull Love which condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to such Rebels, and embraceth such
unworthy and polluted sinners, and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyeth
them even in their blood! Even
after we had sold our selves to Satan, and
cast away the Mercies of our Creation,
and had all <hi>come short of the Glory of God,</hi>
and were sentenced to death, and ready
for the Execution; then did this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Love step in, and rescue and recover
us. Not staying till we Repented and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Mercy, and cast our selves at his
feet; but seeking us in the Wilderness,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:63001:111"/>
and finding us before we felt that we were
lost, and being found of us before we
sought him, and beging to us in the
depth of our Misery. <hi>Herein is Love,
not that we Loved God, but that he Loved
us, and sent his Sonne to be the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for our sinnes,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 10. Though
God Love us not in our sinne and misery,
before our Conversion, so far as in that
state to Justifie us, and Adopt us, and take
pleasure in us, or have Communion with
us in the spirit, yet doth he so far Love
us in that state, as to Redeem us by the
Blood of Christ, and tender us his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to bring in his chosen effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to entertain his offer. And thus <hi>the
Love of God is shed abroad in our hearts,
by the Holy Ghost which is given to us; For
when we were yet without strength in due
time Christ dyed for the ungodly: And
God commended his Love towards us, in
that while we were yet sinners Christ dyed
for us,</hi> Rom. 5. 6, 8. <hi>Greater Love hath
no man then this, that a man lay down his
life for his friends,</hi> Joh. 15. 13. What
was the Sonne of God, but <hi>Love Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate?
Love</hi> borne of a Virgin? <hi>Love</hi>
coming down from Heaven to Earth, and
walking in flesh among the miserable,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:63001:112"/>
seeking and saving that which was lost:
Was it not <hi>Love</hi> that spoke those words
of life, those comfortable promises, those
necessary precepts, those gracious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
which the Gospel doth
abound with? Was it not <hi>Love</hi> it self,
that went preaching Salvation to the
Sonnes of death, and deliverance to the
Captives, and offered to bind up the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hearts, <hi>Luke 4. 18?</hi> Was it not
<hi>Love</hi> that invited the weary and heavy
laden, <hi>Matth. 11. 28?</hi> And that sent
even to <hi>the high-waies, and the hedges
to compel men to come in that his house
might be filled,</hi> Matth. 22. 9, 10. Luke
14. 23. Was it not <hi>Love</hi> it self that went
up and down healing and doing good;
that suffered them, for whom he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to scorn him, and spit upon him, and
buffet him, and condemn him? that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>reviled, reviled not again: that gave
his life, an offering for sinne,</hi> and dyed,
and prayed for them that murdered him?
No wonder if the <hi>Gospel</hi> be it that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us, to call God by the name of <hi>Love</hi>
it self, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 8 For it is the <hi>Gospel</hi>
that hath most fully <hi>revealed</hi> him to be
so. No wonder if the <hi>Gospel</hi> do so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
and importunatly require us to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63001:112"/>
                  <hi>Love one another,</hi> and even to lay down
your lives for Christ, and for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when it hath given us such a ground
and motive, and president for our Love.
He that seeth the true face of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and understandeth, and savoureth
the <hi>Gospel</hi> and the Grace of Christ, must
needs see most cogent Reasons for such
dutyes, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
let us Love one another, for Love is
of God: and every one that Loveth is born
of God, and knoweth God: he that Loveth
not knoweth not God; for God is Love. If
God so Loved us, we ought also to Love
one another.—If we Love one another, God
dwelleth in us,—</hi> So 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 14,
16, 17, 18. No wonder if by this <hi>Love</hi>
we know that we are translated from
death to life, and if by it the Children of
God be known from the Children of the
Devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 14. For <hi>Love</hi>
is the very Nature and Image of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
No wonder if this be the <hi>New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
which had newly such a
powerfull motive, and president: And
no wonder if it be the great distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Caracter, by which all men shall
<hi>know</hi> that we are the Disciples of Christ,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 35. When he had set us such a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:63001:113"/>
Copie, and taught us this lesson by such
effectual means; writing it out for us in
lines of blood, even of his own most
pretious Blood, and shedding it abroad
in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>But if we should come down, to the
particular benefits of Christ's death, and
see what Love is manifested in them, even
in our Calling, our Justification our
Adoption, or Sanctification, our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
and our everlasting Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
we should find our selves in an
Ocean that hath neither banks nor bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom;
and when we have fathomed as far
as we can, we must be contented to stand
and admire it, and to say with the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Apostle, <hi>Behold what manner of Love
the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we
should be called the Sons of God!</hi> 1 Joh.
3. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this is the blessed imployment of
the Saints, which they are called to by
the</hi> Gospel, <hi>to live in the participation,
and consideration and admiration of this
wonderous Love,</hi> that Christ may dwell
in their hearts by Faith, and so being root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and grounded in Love, they may be
able to comprehend with all Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what
is the bredth, and length, and depth, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63001:113"/>
height, and to know the Love of Christ,
which passeth knowledg, and be filled with
all the fullness of God, <hi>Ephes. 3. 17, 18,
19.</hi> And withall, to be followers of God
as dear Children, and walk in Love as
Christ hath Loved us, and given himself
for us, an Offering, and a Sacrifice to
God, for a sweet smelling savour, <hi>Ephes.</hi>
5. 1, 2. And to love without dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9, 10. Even from a pure
heart fervently, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. That we
love as brethren, being compassionate,
pittifull, and courteous; not rendring
evill forevill, but contrariwise blessing;
knowing that we are thereunto called, that
that we should inherit a blessing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.
8, 9 And that we keep our selves in the
Love of God, <hi>Jud.</hi> 21. that nothing may be
able to seperate us from it, <hi>Rom. 8. 35,
36, 37. And if we thus imitate our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
pattern,</hi> the God of Love and Peace
will be with us, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 11. And
thus I have shewed you the principall
Ends of the undertaking of Christ in the
work of our Redemption, especially as
they are attained directly by his Cross,
and Resurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Another End also is apparent in
the Scripture; which is <hi>the Glorifying
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63001:114"/>
of Gods Rewarding Justice, together with
his Mercy in the Salvation of his Elect.</hi>
This End he hath partly attaineth <hi>here</hi>
(for God hath his Ends continually:) In
this life his Servants have much of his
Mercy; and the beginnings of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the beginning of their Salvation;
But the fullness is hereafter in their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification.
All his promises he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in their seasons. Even in the present
pardon of our sinnes he honoureth his
Faithfullness and Justice, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9.
His Faithfullness in making good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and his Justice in Rewarding the
performers of the condition, and giving
what his promise had made their due:
that so men may even here in part discern
between the <hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi>
between him that <hi>serveth God, and
him that serveth him not; while they see

in our Justification, <hi>Rom. 3. 21, 22.
Even the Righteousness of God, which is
by Faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon
all them that believe; for there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63001:114"/>
For all have sinned and come short
of the Glory of God; being Justified freely
by his grace, through the Redemption that
is in Jesus Christ, whom God hath set
forth to be a propitiation, through Faith
in his Blood, to declare his Righteousness:
for the remission of sinnes that are past,
through the forbearance of God: to declare,
I say, at this time his Righteousness; that
he might be Just, and the Justifier of
him that believeth in Jesus,</hi> Rom. 3.
25, 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it is most eminently at Judgment,
and in the world to come, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerative
Justice with Mercy will be
Glorified:</hi> When Christ shall come <hi>(pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely)</hi>
to be glorified in his Saints, and
to be admired in all them that believe <hi>(not
only in himself, but in them:) and that</hi>
because they were believers, 2 <hi>Thes. 1.
10. When</hi> we have fought the good fight,

is a God that Judgeth in the Earth, <hi>Psal.
58. 11. Much more when we receive
the</hi> Reward of the Inheritance, <hi>Col. 3.
24. This causeth the Saints to forsake
the pleasures of sinne, because they have</hi>
respect to the Recompence of Reward,
<hi>Heb. 11. 26. This is it that maketh them</hi>
Rejoyce and be exceeding glad in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
because that great is their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in Heaven: <hi>and therefore it is that
they</hi> Cast not away their confidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath great Recompence of Reward,
<hi>Heb. 10. 25. If we</hi> let no man beguil us
of our Reward, <hi>Col. 2. 18. And if we</hi>
Look to our selves that we lose not those
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:63001:116"/>
things that we have wrought, we shall
receive a full Reward, 2 <hi>Joh. 8. For
the Lord hath said</hi> Behold I come quickly,
and my Reward is with me, to give every
man according as his work shall be,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 12.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Another End of Christ's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
in this blessed work, is,</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
and Glory of God in the Love, and
Praise, and Service of his Redeemed ones;
<hi>in some measure here; but in perfection
when they are perfected. Sinne had
made us unserviceable to God: And
Christ bringeth us back into a fitness for
his service: He disposeth us Godward by
Faith and Love; and he hath</hi> Redeemed
us from our iniquity, and purifieth to
himself a Peculiar People zealous of good
works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. To which he createth
us, that we should walk in them, <hi>Ephes. 2.
10.</hi> And with such Sacrifice God is well-pleased,
<hi>Heb. 13. 16. Phil.</hi> 4. 18. The
blood of the Covenant <hi>was therefore shed,</hi>
to make us perfect in every good work to do
his will, who worketh in us that which is
wel-pleasing in his sight, <hi>Heb. 13. 20,
21. And this must be our care,</hi> to walk
worthy of the Lord in all well-pleasing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fruitfull in every good work, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 10.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:63001:116"/>
And then whatsoever we ask, we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of him, because we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
and do those things that are
Pleasing in his sight, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 22. see
1 Thes. 4. 1. Heb. 11. 6. Rom. 8. 8.
2 Tim. 2. 4. 1 Cor. 7. 32. Heb.</hi> 11. 5.</p>
               <p>But principally when we are Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and fitted by our perfection for the
Perfect Love, and Promises of God,
then will God perfectly take Pleasure in
us, and in our Love and Praise. The
Glory of the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of everlasting Praise and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
will be his delight. <hi>He will Rejoyce
over us with Joy, he will Rest in his Love;
he will joy over us with singing,</hi> Zeph.
3. 17.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Another End of Christ's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
this blessed work, is</hi> the Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Glory of God which shall shine forth in
the Glorified Manhood of the Redeemer,
and the everlasting complacency that God
will have in him, for his own perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the work that he hath wrought.</p>
               <p>Though Christ had no need to suffer
for any sinne or want of his own; yet
was it his personal dignity, dominion,
and Everlasting Glory, as well as our
Salvation, that was intended by him, and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:63001:117"/>
by the Father in this work, and which
he was to receive as the <hi>Reward</hi> of his
performances, <hi>Rom. 14. 7. Phil. 2. 8,
9, 10. Matth. 28. 18, 19 Heb. 1. 3,
4, 6. Ephes.</hi> 12. 22. Nay if we may
make comparisons, this seemeth the
highest part of Gods End, in the sending
of his Sonne. As there is no part of
all the Works of God, to be compared
to the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
there is none in which the Glory
of God will shine forth so admirably, and
illustriously as in Christ. If on Earth
the Heavenly voice bare witness that it
was <hi>in him that the Father was well-pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
Matth. 3. 17. &amp; 17. 5. &amp; 12. 18.
Which was uttered both at his Baptism,
and his Transfiguration, when his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
saw a glympse of his glory, and he
was the <hi>chosen Servant of God in whom his
Soul delighted,</hi> Isa. 42. 1. Much more
is it apparent, that in his Heaveny Glory
he will be the Fathers Everlasting Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and delight: and in him, and by
him, and for the work that he hath
wrought, the Redeemed in glory will
honour him for ever, Rev. 5. 9. <hi>He is
the Head of the body, the Church: the
beginning, the first-born from the dead,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:63001:117"/>
that in all things he might have the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence:
For it Pleased the Father, that
in him should all fullness dwell,</hi> Col. 1.
17, 18, 19. And therefore in him the
Glory of God will shine in fullness, and
he shall have the preheminence in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Everlasting Love. When Christ
prayed, <hi>Joh. 12. 28. Father Glorifie thy
Name:</hi> He was answered by a Voice
from Heaven, <hi>I have Glorified it, and
will Glorifie it again.</hi> Even in the Sonne
that thus desired it. He hath done it on
Earth, and he will do it again more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
in Heaven. <hi>He hath glorified the
Sonne, that the Sonne also may glorifie
him,</hi> Joh. 17. 1. As he <hi>glorified his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on Earth, and finished the work which
he gave him to do,</hi> so the Father hath now
<hi>glorified him with himself,</hi> that in his
Glory he may be yet more glorified, <hi>Joh.</hi>
17. 4, 5, 6. In his Transfiguration his
<hi>Face</hi> did shine as the Sunne. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 2.
And in his appearance to <hi>Paul,</hi> his shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
light did cast him <hi>blindfold</hi> and <hi>tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
on the Earth, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4, 6. It was
<hi>Stephen's</hi> encouragment to the <hi>suffering</hi>
of his Martyrdom, to see the <hi>Glory of God</hi>
and <hi>Jesus</hi> standing on Gods right-hand,
<hi>Acts</hi> 7. 55, 56. When <hi>John</hi> saw him on
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:63001:118"/>
the Lords Day in the spirit, he beheld
<hi>his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet like
burning brass, in the furnace, and his
voice was as the sound of many waters, and
in his right-hand were the starres, and out
of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword,
and his countenance was as the Sunne that
shineth in his strength,</hi> Rev. 1. 14, 15, 16.
His voice also did proclaim his Glory, <hi>I
am the first and the last. I am he that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
and was dead; and behold I am alive
for evermore, Amen, and have the keys
of Hell and of death,</hi> vers. 17, 18. It was
the <hi>Lord of Glory</hi> that was crucified,
1 <hi>Cor. 2. 8. God was manifest in the flesh,
justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels,
preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the
world, received up into Glory,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.
16. Where he is <hi>Glorified</hi> with the Father
in the praises of the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 12, 13.
The Glory in the Holy Mount was great
at the giving of the Law: But it was no
Glory to that of the Gospel administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 10 Much more, to
that purpose of the Glorified Redeemer
who hath <hi>overcome,</hi> and is set down with
the Father in his throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21. Yea the
Glory that will be given to God for ever
will be through Jesus Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:63001:118"/>
And indeed, it is a very great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether: we shall immediately see
the Essence of God in Heaven, or only
see him in the glorified Redeemer, and
whether Christ will not then be the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
of our Fruition,</hi> as he was here
the <hi>Mediator of Acquisition.</hi> But certain
we are, that God will be everlastingly
pleased and glorified in the Person of the
Redeemer, as well as in the Church,
which is his body.</p>
               <p>9. And <hi>reductively</hi> it may be said to be
Gods End in this blessed work, that he
may <hi>more fully demonstrate his Vindictive
Justice, according to the Gospel, or Law
of the Redeemer, upon them that finally
reject his grace,</hi> then it would have been
manifested on the terms of the Law of
Creation, on <hi>Adam</hi> and his off-spring.
Though Christ <hi>came not into the world,</hi>
(primarily) <hi>to condemn the world, but
that the world through him might be saved,</hi>
yet was it his purpose, that unbelievers
that <hi>love darkness rather then light, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ould</hi>
fall under the special condemnation,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18, 19. And that they should
not <hi>see life, but the Wrath of God should
abide upon them,</hi> vers. 36. God would
not so much as permit them to reject his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63001:119"/>
Salvation, but that he knows how he
may be no loser by them: <hi>He suffereth
with much patience the vessels of wrath, to
make his Wrath and Power known,</hi> Rom.
9. 22. The mouths of the condemned will
be utterly stopped, and they will be left
speechles, when they are judged on terms
of Grace, much more then they would
have been if they had been judged only by
the first Law: When they see Christ and
Heaven, that was offered them, and
remember their wilfull and obstinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of them, their own Consciences
and tongues shall justifie God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that he is Righteous in the dreadfulest
of his Judgments. <hi>If the word spoken by
Angels was stedfast, and every trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
and disobedience received a just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of reward, How shall they escape
that neglect of great Salvation, which at
first began to be spoken by the Lord, and
then was confirmed by them that heard him,
God also bearing them witness with signs
and wonders, and with divers Miracles
and gifts of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Heb. 2. 3,
4. And <hi>if they escaped not, that refused
him that spake on Earth, much more shall
not they escape that turn away from him
that speaketh from Heaven? For our
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63001:119"/>
God is a consuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12. 25, 29.
So much of the Ends of Christ's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
in our Redemption.</p>
               <p>In which you may see that there are
divers things which Demonstrate the
Glory of the forementioned Attributes
of God, in this Gospel Dispensation.
1. It shineth forth in the Person of the
Redeemer as he was on Earth, in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and wonderfull conception, and his
perfections. 2. And it also shineth forth
in the Actions of his life, overcoming
the world, and the Devil, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
fullfilling the Law of God: So
that the Image of his Father, did shine
forth in his Conversation. 3. And also
in his Death and Sufferings was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
glorified, as I shewed before. 4. And
also in the most Wise and Holy frame of
those Laws, by which the grace of the
Mediator is conveyed, and the Church
governed. 5. And by the Image of
God, by the impress of those Laws on
the Souls of his Saints, and by the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their lives, the Glory of God is
also demonstrated. 6. As also by the
Justifying sentence of the Judge, and the
glorious Reward bestowed on the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
7. And by the Condemning sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:63001:120"/>
and execution on the ungodly, in
whom Vindictive Justice will be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
8. And in the perfection of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Saints, and their perfect Love
and Praise. 9. And in the Saints as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodyed
in the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the
Glory of which will be the Glory of
God. 10. And pricipally in the Blessed
Person and Work of the Redeemer. In
all these will Gods Glory shine forth for
ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But to whom is it that God doth
thus Demosntrate his Glory?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.)</hi> 1. To the Saints in this life, in
that degree as is suited to a state of Grace,
and the condition of a travailer that lives
by Faith. We are apt to look upward,
and long after fuller revelations of the
Heavenly Kingdom and mystery, and
marvail that God will not shew himself
more fully to his Saints on Earth. Fain
we would know more of God, and Christ,
and the life to come, and it is oft matter
of some temptation to us, that God doth
not satifie these desires, but leaveth
them in so much darkness, that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his light. But this is, because we
do not consider how much of Glory
consisteth in the light: and that Grace is
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:63001:120"/>
more in the Disires of it then in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session:
and if we should have as much
of it as we desire, it were but to bring
down Heaven to Earth. Means must be
suited to their ends. God will discover
to us so much of his Glory, as may quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
our desires, and keep alive our hope,
and patience, and endeavours; but not
so much as shall satisfie us, and answer
our expectations. For Heaven is not
here. We must not carry our Home
about with us, but travail towards it,
that we may reach it at the last.</p>
               <p>2. God doth even now Demonstrate
the Glory of his forementioned Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
in the work of Redemption, not
only to his Saints, but to the Angels of
Heaven. The consideration of this hath
often satisfied me, when I have been
tempted to wonder at the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
that God should so far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
as to be incarnate, and make
such glorious discoveries of himself, and
yet that so few in the world should take
notice of it, and be should have from
men so little of the honour, that he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by his preparations to expect. But
the most part of the world did never once
see the Glory that shineth to them in the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63001:121"/>
Redeemer. But God hath another world
besides this, and other Creatures besides
man, in all likelyhood incomparably
more numerous (perhaps thousands for
one) and certainly more excellent. And
though Christ did assume the Nature of
Angels, and came not to Redeem them
that needed no Redeemer, yet may the
lustre of this work of Redemption appear
to the Angels more clearly then to man;
and God may have a thousand-fold more
Glory from them that are but the specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and admirers, then from us in our
present darkness, that are yet possessors.
As we that are here on Earth, do look
upon and admire the Glory of the Sunne,
which is as it were in another world, and
out of our reach; so the Angels much
more may gaze upon the Glory of the
Sonne of God, and admire the Lord in
the work of our Redemption, though
they were not the Redeemed ones. So
that unto <hi>them</hi> doth God shine forth by
it in his excellencies.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you'l say, <hi>that cannot be: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this is but seeing him in a glass;
when the Angels see him face to face, and
immediately behold his blessed Essence: or
else how can the Saints expect that beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63001:121"/>
Vision.</hi> To which I answer First, that I
am uncertain whether seeing face to face
bean immediate intuition of the Essence of
God, or only such a sight of his Glory
in those emanations, that are as appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to the place or state of Bliss. Gods
Essence is every where; but that Glory is
not every where: And so I know not
whether our present knowledg be not
called <hi>Enigmaticall, and as in a glass,</hi>
comparatively to that Glory prepared
for the Saints: But secondly, I answer,
that certain I am that God is Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
to his Angels in the Redeemer,
yea in the Church it self, which is the
Subject of his Grace, and that they are
both Affected, and Imployed about us
accordingly. He that <hi>spoiled Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Powers, and openly triumphed
over them, and by death, overcame him
that had the power of death,</hi> Col. 2. 15.
Heb. 2. 14. And had so much to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the evill Angels as Enemies, no
doubt is joyfully observed by the good
Angels. And he that is set so <hi>far above
Principalities, and Powers, and Might,
and Dominion, and every name that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in this world, or that which is to
come,</hi> Ephes. 1. 21. And is <hi>gone in to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:63001:122"/>
Heaven, and is on the right hand of God,
Angels, and Authorities, and Powers,
being made subject to him,</hi> (1 Pet. 3.
22.) <hi>no doubt</hi> is honoured and admired
by Angels. And indeed it is expresly said,
<hi>Let all the Angels of God worship him,</hi>
Heb. 1. 6. And what are <hi>they all but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
spirits, sent forth to Minister for
them, who shall be heirs of Salvation,</hi>
Heb. 1. 14. And therefore sent forth by
Jesus Christ, the Lord of Saints. Which
makes some think that the title of Angels,
was never given to any of these Spirits,
till the Mediators undertaking, and that
it was only as they were his deputed mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
or servants for the Ends of that
undertaking. Sure we are, they atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his birth with their acclamations, and
his life and sufferings (as far as was
meet) with their service; and that they
are deputed to bear his servants in their
hands, that they <hi>dash</hi> not their foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a stone; that they are ascending,
and descending, and are present with the
Churches in their Holy Worship; and
that they rejoyce at the <hi>Conversion</hi> of one
sinner; and that the <hi>least</hi> of Christ's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
have their Angels beholding the
<hi>face</hi> of God: and that the Law was given
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:63001:122"/>
by their disposition or ordination; and
they attend the departing Souls of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
and that they contend against evill
spirits for our good, and are encamped
about us, and that they shall attend the
Lord at his coming to Judgment, and be
his glorious retinue, and Instruments
in the work; and that they are numbred
with us, as members of the same Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and that we shall be
like or equall to them, <hi>Luke 2. 14, 15.
Marke 4. 11. Luke 22. 43. Acts 10.
6, 7, 22. Psal.</hi> 34. 7. &amp; 91. 11. <hi>Matth.</hi>
13. 39, 41. &amp; 16. 27. &amp; 24. 31. &amp; 25.
31. &amp; 26. 53. <hi>Luke 16. 22. Matth. 18.
10. 2 Thes. 1. 7. Luke 20. 36. Marke
12. 25. Acts 7. 65. Gal. 3. 19.
Heb. 12. 22. 2 Pet. 2. 11. Luke 15.
10. Joh.</hi> 1. 51. Yea men must be either
confessed or denied, owned or disowned,
before the Angels, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 8, 9. See
<hi>Rev. 19. 18. Rev.</hi> 3. 5. But if all this
seem not sufficient to perswade you that
the Angels are so far interessed in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of God about the Redeemed, as
to behold and admire him in this blessed
work, take notice of the express affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 12.
Which things the Angels desire to look into.</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:63001:123"/>
And why but to see and admire the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Power, and Goodness, and
Mercy, and Justice of God, shining
forth in the Redeemer? If this be not
plain enough, mark well those words,
<hi>Ephes. 3. 10. To the intent that now unto
the Principalities, and Powers in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
places, might be known by the
Church, the manifold Wisdom of God.</hi>
You see here that the Church of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,
is that admirable looking glass,
which God hath set up to this very intent,
that his Angels may in it, or by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the manifold Wisdom of God: Yea
and that upon the full revelation of Christ
by the Gospel, they saw that which did
more fully inform, and illuminate them.
No doubt but the very work of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yea of this inferior world, that are
made for the habitation, and use of man,
are far better known to Angels then to
man: for we know but little of what we
daily see and use: And consequently it is
by Angels more then by men, that God
is beheld, admired, and glorified in
them. And if it be so in these works of
Creation, we may well say, it is so in the
works of Redemption.</p>
               <p>3. But when we are perfected in
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:63001:123"/>
Glory, then <hi>we our selves</hi> shall clearly
see the Glory of this Mystery, and of God
therein. As it is not till we come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that we shall have the fullest <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits</hi>
of Redemption, so it is not till then,
that we shall have the fullest <hi>understanding</hi>
of it, and God have his fullest praises
for it. As we are here but sowing the
seed of our own Glory, which we must
reap in the everlasting fruition of God;
so God is here but sowing those seeds of
his Praise, and Glory, which he will
eternally reap by this blessed work. Do
not therefore judg of the ends, and fruits
of Christ's undertakings, by what you
see him attain on Earth, but by what he
shall attain in Heaven, when he hath
fully seen the travail of his Soul, to his
satisfaction, and hath presented the
whole Church without spot unto God,
and when the glorious manage of the
Lamb, with the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is
solemnized, and the Kingdom delivered
up to the Father, <hi>Isa. 53. 11. Ephes. 5.
27. Rev. 19. 7. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 24. It will
be another manner of <hi>conceiving</hi> which
we shall have in Heaven of this blessed
work, when we see the face of our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
Lord, and fully possess the fruits of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:63001:124"/>
his Redemption, then this is that we have
now by our weak believing. We shall
then have another manner of sight of the
Wisdom, and Power, and Love, and
Justice that appear to man, in the face
of Christ, then now we have.</p>
               <p>4. Yea the tormenting discoveries of
the Glory of Redemption to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
rejecters of it, shall also contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the Glory of God.</p>
               <p>You see then that this work hath most
Glorious Ends; which I have mentioned
the more largely, both to <hi>remove their
temptations</hi> that are apt to think, that it
<hi>was an unnecessary thing,</hi> and therefore
the less regardable, and <hi>to teach men the
true value of it, by shewing them the true
Ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>former,</hi> I say, There was no
necessity that God should make the
world, and reveale his Power, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Goodness, in this excellent
frame, but what did suppose the free
Will of God, the Original Cause. Will
you therefore say, that the Creation is
vaine; and undervalue Gods admirable
works in which he thus revealeth himself
to the intellectuall Creatures? So here;
we confess that there could be no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63001:124"/>
of Redemption, but what was Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
derived from the Will of God,
(though a necessity <hi>ad finem</hi> there was,
from the constitution of things, upon
supposition of what went before the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.)
But yet shall we undervalue
so glorious a work, in which the Divine
perfections do so fully reveale themselves
to the world?</p>
               <p>And I say the more of this, because I
do observe that its the not apprehending
the high and excellent Ends of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that makes it so much slighted,
and consequently tempteth many to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.</hi>
For the Ends and Uses do set
the value on the means. That is of little
worth, that is to little purpose, and
doth but little good. If men understood
more the Ends of Redemption, and how
much of God doth shine forth in the
world, in the Person, and Life, and
Laws, and Works of the Sonne of God,
they would then live in the admiration of
it, and be alwaies searching, and prying
into it, and desire to know nothing but
God in Christ Crucified, and account
all things else but as loss and dung for this
excellent knowledg: But alas, the most
do s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arce discern any higher Ends of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63001:125"/>
Christ, or other use of him, then to save
themselves from Hell, and for want of
Faith, and through Humiliation, they
have but little sense of that: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no wonder if the Redeemer be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and God denied the honour of
the work.</p>
               <p>So much of this second point, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and Ends of Christ's undertaking.
I shall purposely be shorter on the rest.</p>
               <p>3. The third point to be understood
concerning our Redeemer, is, <hi>What he
hath done and suffered for mankind, and
wherein his Redeeming work consisted both as
to the General and the special part.</hi> Should I
stand on these at large, I must needs be
voluminous; and therefore I shall but
briefly reciet them for your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>I. The first thing that Christ did for
the saving of the world, was his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
between offending man, and the
wrath of God; and so preserving the
world from the destruction, which the
execution of the violated Law would have
procured: Undertaking then to become
the Seed of the woman, and so to break
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63001:125"/>
the Serpents head: and revealing this
Grace by slow degrees, till the time of
his coming.</p>
               <p>And then when the fullness of time
was come, he was made man, being
conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born
of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and so the <hi>Word
was made flesh, and dwelt among men,
who beheld his Glory, as the Glory of the
only begotten of the Father, full of Grace,
and Truth,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. Thus God was
<hi>manifested</hi> to men in the flesh. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
3. 16.</p>
               <p>3. And as he was perfectly Holy in
his Nature without any stain or guilt of
Original sinne; so was he perfectly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his Life, and never broke the least
Command of God in thought, word, or
deed. Never could any <hi>convince</hi> him of
sinne, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 46. He fulfilled the Law
of Nature, which all the world was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the Mosaical Law which the
<hi>Jews</hi> were under, and the special Law
that was given to himself as Mediator,
and was common to no other Creature
in the world.</p>
               <p>And thus he performed these excellent
works. I. By the fullfilling of all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
he pleased the Father, alwaies
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:63001:126"/>
accomplishing his Will; and so did much
of the work of a Saviour in Meriting for
for us. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 15. &amp; 5. 17. <hi>Joh. 8.
29. Matth.</hi> 12. 18. &amp; 17. 5. <hi>Rom. 5.
19. For such an High-priest became us,
who is Holy, harmless, undefiled, separate
from sinners,</hi> Heb. 7. 26.</p>
               <p>2. He hath conquered the Tempter,
that conquered us. And therefore did
he purposely yield himself to such sore
temptations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. That his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
might be glorious, and the Second
<hi>Adam</hi> might overcome him that had
overcome the first. And thus he hath
done much to the rescue of the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated.</p>
               <p>3. Hereby also he hath overcome the
world, which overcame the first <hi>Adam,</hi>
and his posterity: He trampled upon
its seeming glory; he neglected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
its baits and allurements; he went
through all its cruel persecutions, and
oppositions: So that the world now as
well as the Devil, are conquered things.
By which he hath made way for the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
of his followers, and given them
ground of great encouragment, <hi>Joh. 16.
33. Be of good cheer: I have overcome the
world.</hi> Yea I may say in a sort he hath
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:63001:126"/>
overcome the flesh also. For though
Christ had no <hi>corrupt flesh</hi> as we have to
contend with, yet had he a natural and
sensitive appetite, which the Command
of God did forbid him to fulfill. And
therefore when innocent Nature di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>red
that the Cup might pass from him, and
abhor death by a simple <hi>Aversness;</hi>
yet perfect Holiness permitted not this
to proceed to a <hi>Refusal</hi> by the comparing
<hi>Intellect, and Choosing, or Refusing
Will;</hi> but saith, <hi>Not my will, but thine
be done.</hi> And when Christ was hungry
and weary, the desire of food and rest, by
the sensitive appetite, was no sinne: But
when the Work of God forbad the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of such desires, he still denyed
them.</p>
               <p>4. Hereby also he hath set us a <hi>perfect
copy and patern</hi> of obedience, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our Example whom we must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to imitate. For he knew that it is
the most effectual teaching, to do it by
words and deeds together. It is a great
help to us, when we do not only heare
his voice, but see also which way he hath
gone before us. When he saith, <hi>Learn
of me,</hi> he directs us, not only to his
words, but to himself, who was
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:63001:127"/>
                  <hi>meeke</hi> and <hi>lowly,</hi> Matth. 11. 28.</p>
               <p>5. Moreover Christ received of the
Father fullness of the Spirit, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for the benefit of the Redeemed:
that he might be meet to be the Head,
and the Treasury of the Church, and to
shower down the streams of Grace upon
his Members; and when all Power was
given him in Heaven, and Earth, he
might be fitted to the following applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his benefits, and to rule, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and defend his people.</p>
               <p>6. Moreover he was pleased himself
to become a Preacher of the Gospel of
Salvation; not to all the world, but
principally as a Minister of the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
that is, the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8.
He that purchased Salvation, condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
also to proclaime it. The preaching
of the Gospel, is a work that Christ
thought not himself too good for, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to many, sometimes to one or two
as he had opportunity; often with tears;
and alwaies with earnestness and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
did he go about doing good, and
seeking the <hi>lost,</hi> and healing the <hi>diseased,</hi>
and calling men to Faith, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and offering them the Grace, and
Life which he purchased.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:63001:127"/>
7. And he was pleased also to seale up
his Doctrine by his Works, casting out
Devils, healing all diseases, raising the
the dead, and working divers other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
to assure them that he came from
<hi>God,</hi> and did <hi>his</hi> Work, and revealed <hi>his</hi>
Will, that so the world might have no
excuse for their unbelife; but that they
that would not <hi>believe</hi> upon any other
account, might yet <hi>believe</hi> him for the
sake of his works, <hi>Joh. 3. 2. Acts 2. 22.
Heb. 2. 4. Joh.</hi> 5. 36. &amp; 10. 25 38. &amp;
14. 11, 12. &amp; 15. 24.</p>
               <p>8. Besides all this, he gave up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to a life of suffering, being despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by his Creatures whom he came to
Redeeme, and destitute voluntarily of
fleshly pleasures, and of that riches, and
worldly provision, that might procure
it: He was a man of sorrows, afflicted
from his youth; persecuted from the
Cradle; he gave his Cheeks to the smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and his Person to be made the scorn
of fools: He was crowned with thornes,
spit upon, and buffited, and having
sweat water, and blood, in his Agonie
in the garden, he was hanged on a Cross,
where thieves were both his companions,
and revilers, where they gave him gall,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63001:128"/>
and vineger to drink, pierced his blessed
Body with a spear and put him to a sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
cursed death. But he endured the
Cross, despising the shame, and gave
up himself thus a Sacrifice for sinne, and
bore our transgressions, that we might
be <hi>healed</hi> by his stripes; and having <hi>ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed</hi>
us by his Blood, he was buried as
an offender, continuing for a time in the
Power of the grave, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<hi>Matth. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp; 27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. All
this he consented to undergo (though he
consented not to the sinne of them that
did inflict it) For he laid down his <hi>Life,</hi>
it was not taken from him against his
Will, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>9. Having thus paid the price of our
Reconciliation to God, the third day
he Rose again from the dead: Though
Soldiours watcht his grave, because he
had <hi>foretold</hi> them that he would rise the
third day, yet were they soon daunted by
the glory of an Angel, that came and
roled away the stone. And so Christ
made known his Divine Power, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and the finishing of his work:
And as by death he overcame him that
had the power of death, that is, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3, 14. So by his Resurrection
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63001:128"/>
he triumphed over death it self. For how
should the grave detain the innocent, and
death overcome the Lord of Life? This
was the glorious day of triumph: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of this, he appointed the
Lords Day to be observed by the Church.
The Resurrection of Christ, was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of all the powers of darkness; the
great Argument to confirm the truth of
his Doctrine, and prove his Godhead
to the unbelieving world.</p>
               <p>10. Being risen, he more fully revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his Gospel, and sent forth his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Disciples, to proclaim the
offers of Life to the world, and settle the
Churches in a Holy order, when they
had gathered them, and to ordaine such
Ministers to succeed them, as might car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on his <hi>work</hi> to the end of the world,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. And thus he is the
faithfull Law-giver to the Church.</p>
               <p>11. When he had abode thus forty
daies on Earth, he ascended up into Heaven
while his Disciples stood by, and gazed
after him, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9, 10. And there hath
taken possession in our Nature, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
it to the Fathers right hand in
Glory, which was by sinne deprest so
low in misery. And so he is gone to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63001:129"/>
a place for us,</hi> leaving us a certain
word of promise that <hi>he will come again,
and take us to himself, that where he is there
we may be also,</hi> Joh. 14. 2, 3. And as <hi>our
life now is hid there with Christ in God, so
when he shall appear, we shall appear with
him in glory,</hi> Col. 3. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>12. Being ascended, he manifested
his Power and his Truth in sending down
the Holy Ghost upon his Disciples, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
them to do such works as he had
done, and such as were necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the unbelieving world, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the opposing wisdom and power of
the flesh: Enabling them to speak in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Languages, which they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
before learnt; as also to understand,
and powerfully preach the mysteries of
the Gospel, to confirm their Doctrine
by Miracles, healing the lame, the blind,
the sick, casting out Devils, raising the
dead, and conquering the resistance of
Principalities, and Powers, in seeming
weakness, and in a contemptible garbe.
Not to speak now of the Sanctifying
Work of the same Spirit, on them, and
on the rest of the Church.</p>
               <p>13. Lastly in this Glory Christ Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth
for us, and is our High-priest in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:63001:129"/>
the Heavens with God, living for ever,
procuring and conveying to us the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which we need upon the account of
his Sacrifice: Ruling his Church, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
them; succeeding his Cause, and
Servants; restraining and subduing his
Enemies and ours; and will perfect his
work at the day of his Coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So much of the works of Christ.</p>
               <p>4. The fourth point to be understood
concerning our Redemption, is, <hi>The
Nature and worth of the Benefits that are
procured for us.</hi> Which though you may
gather much from what is said, and the
full handling of them, would be a larger
work, then is suitable to my present Ends,
yet such a brief recital I shall here give
you, as my Ends require.</p>
               <p>In General, we have All from Jesus
the Mediator that is worth the having;
even all the blessings of this present life,
and of the life to come. As we lost our
Right to all by sinne, so we have our
restored Right by Christ alone, who
came to destroy sinne, and its effects.
Had not he interposed, we might have
had materially life, and natural faculties,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63001:130"/>
and other things which now are Mercies;
but not <hi>as Mercies,</hi> but as the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites
to our deserved punishment: Even
as the Devils have their Being, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
perfections to sustain them in their
sufferings. Nature it self, so far as Good,
and all Natural blessings, are now of
Grace: And that not only of such Grace
as they were to <hi>Adam,</hi> which was <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
without proper Merit:</hi> but of Gospel
Grace procured by Christ; which is <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
contray to Merit.</hi> It is no sounder Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to say, that God doth without
the Merit of his Sonne bestow our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
forfeited Mercies, either on the
Elect, or others, then that he giveth us
his Saving grace without it. As all things
are delivered into the hands of Christ,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 3. So none can receive any good
but from his hands. To give Mercies to
men that forfeit them, and descern mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
is <hi>so far</hi> to pardon their sinne; for
to remit the sinne, is to remit the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment:
But the Scripture is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with any pardon of sinne, but
what is on the account of the Merits of
Christ. They that deny this Mercy of
God, in giving even to the ungodly
such a measure of forgiveness, do speak
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:63001:130"/>
against the daily, and hourly experience
of all the world; and therefore need no
other confutation.</p>
               <p>More particularly. 1. Christ having
taken the Humane Nature into Union
with the Divine, our nature is thereby
unconceivably advanced, and brought
nigh to God.</p>
               <p>2. Having fulfilled the Law, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himself a Sacrifice for sinne, Gods
Justice, and Wisdom, and Holiness,
and Goodness, is admirably Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is both Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and meritorious, on our behalf,
<hi>Heb. 1. 3. 2 Cor. 5. 19. Heb.</hi> 9. 26.
and 10 12.</p>
               <p>3. The world, and the Devil, and
Death, and the Grave, are conquered
by him; in preparation to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</p>
               <p>4. The Lord Jesus himself being risen,
and Justified, hath received all <hi>Power</hi> in
Heaven and Earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to do all things that are necessary
for his further ends. As the Redeemer he
is become Lord of our selves, and of all
we have; and he is made the Soveraigne
Ruler of all, having full Power to relax
the Law that cursed us, and to deal
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:63001:131"/>
with the world on terms of Grace.</p>
               <p>5. Accordingly he hath kept off the
stroke of the rigorus Justice of God, and
hindered the strict execution of the Law
of works, and giveth still abundance of
forfeited Mercies to the sinfull world,
keeping them from deserved torments,
while he is treating with them on terms
of life.</p>
               <p>6. He hath made an Universal deed of
gift, of Christ, and Life to all the world,
on Condition that they will but <hi>Accept</hi>
the offer, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 10, 11, 12. Joh.</hi> 1.
11, 12. &amp; 3. 16, 17, 18, 19. In this
Testament or Promise or Act of Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the sinnes of all the world are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally
pardoned, and they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally
Justified, and Reconciled to
God.</p>
               <p>7. He hath given Apostles, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
Pastors, and Teachers, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
this Act of Grace to the world,
commanding them to go into All the
world, and preach this Gospel to <hi>every
Creature,</hi> and promise Salvation to all
that by Faith will become his true Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>Marke 16. 16. Matth. 28. 20,
22.</hi> So that their commission also for
the promulgation is universal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:63001:131"/>
8. Though his servants have most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably
neglected their duty, and have
not gone abroad the world, to divulge
the Gospel according to his Will; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that this work had been proper to
Apostles; and though the Nations have
sinfully neglected a due enquirie after this
blessed Light, yet hath he not left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
among them without witness, but
hath given them some dawnings of the
day, or some moon-light in the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Evangelical Truth, who have not
seen the Sunne it self: Much Mercy they
have had, notwithstanding their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions;
and while they served De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
they have been provided for by
God, <hi>in whom they live, and move, and
be: doing them good, and giving them
raine from Heaven, and fruitfull seasons,
filling their hearts with fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d and gladness;
and this to teach them, that they should
seek the Lord, if happily they might feel
after him, and find him; though he be not
farre from every one of them,</hi> Acts 14. 17.
&amp; 17. 27, 28. <hi>And that which may be
known, of God, is manifest among them,
for God hath shewed it to them; for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
things of him from the Creation of
the world are clearly seen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:63001:132"/>
by the things that are made, even his
eternal Power, and Godhead; so that they
are without excuse,</hi> Rom. 1. 19, 20. By
experience they may find, that God deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not now in rigor of Justice, but on
terms of Grace, and that sinne is not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow unpardonable: and they should
know that the <hi>Goodness of God leadeth
them to repentance,</hi> Rom. 2. 4.</p>
               <p>9. As the Gospel conditionally par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth
all their sinnes, and offereth them
Everlasting life, so it conteineth the
clearest Reasons, and most effectual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
to perswade them to Accept the
offer. It affordeth them most excellent
precepts, and instructions, and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and other helps to bring them
to a willingness, that Salvation may be
theirs.</p>
               <p>10. To which also is added abundance
of outward providential helpes, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the working of the Gospel; as sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
afflictions, and Mercies of divers
sorts.</p>
               <p>11. And with these is usually concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
some inward motions, and assistance
of the Holy Ghost; as knocking at the
doore, where he is not yet let in, and
entertained.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:63001:132"/>
12. And by their presence in the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church, even the ungodly have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
benefits in the Ordinances, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
and examples of the Saints.
All these (besides a Resurrection) are
common effects of General Redemption,
and not appropriated to the Elect.</p>
               <p>Besides which there are others that the
Elect only do receive. As 1. God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by effectual Grace, to draw them to
his Sonne, and make the Gospel succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to their Conversion, insuperably
teaching, and charging them by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and causing them to Repent, and
believe in Christ, and to perform the
Conditions of his forementioned Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
That Love that brought the Lord
on Earth, that cloatheth him with flesh,
that lifted him up upon the Cross, doth
stream forth in his season into the hearts
of his Elect, and toucheth them with a
changing Power, and winneth them to
his Father, and himself, and droppeth
into them those Heavenly Principles,
which will grow up in them to Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Life.</p>
               <p>2. Hereupon the Soul believing in
Christ is United to him, as a Member of
his Body, even of his true Catholik
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:63001:133"/>
Church; and Christ is become the Head,
the Husband, the Lord, the Saviour of
that Soul in a special sort. Christ <hi>himself</hi>
is <hi>first</hi> given to us in these <hi>Relations;</hi> and
<hi>from</hi> him as our <hi>Head,</hi> his following be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
are conveyed. <hi>He that hath the
Sonne hath life, and he that hath not the
Sonne hath not life;</hi> for <hi>this Life is in the
Sonne,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 11, 12. He is the <hi>Vine,
and we are the Branches,</hi> and out <hi>of him
we can do nothing,</hi> Joh. 15. 1, 2, 5. As
it was not we that <hi>purchased</hi> our own
Salvation, so it is not we, but Christ
that must have the keeping, and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the purchased benefits. For <hi>it
pleased the Father, that in him should all
fulness dwell, and that he should be the
Head over all things to his Church,</hi> that
it might by communication become his
fulness, <hi>Col. 1. 19. Eph's.</hi> 1. 22, 23.
He is our Treasury, and from him we
must have our continual supplies: For
<hi>with him the Father will give us all
things,</hi> Rom. 8. 32. And thus Christ
will <hi>dwell in our hearts by Faith,</hi> Ephes.
3. 17. And set up the Kingdom of God
within us.</p>
               <p>3. Hereupon we have the pardon of
all our sinnes; not only as to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:63001:133"/>
punishment, nor only as to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
of temporal Mercies, or common
helps of Creatures, and Providences;
for this is but a <hi>winking at the daies of our
ignorance</hi> (Acts 17. 30.) in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the pardon, which afterward we
receive Nor is it only a Conditonal, or
Offered pardon; But it is an Actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the <hi>Eternal,</hi> and of <hi>all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive</hi>
Punishment. And thus we are
Justified from all that might be charged
on us from the Law, and accepted, and
used as just by God. There is a kind of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
that was promised to the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
<hi>Lev. 4. 20, 26, 31, 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp; 5, 10, 13, 16,
18, &amp; 6. 7. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 28. But as that was
upon Christs account, so it extended not
to the pardon of the Eternal Punishment
to any but true Believers. He that was
once Crucified, is <hi>exalted by Gods right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
a Prince, and a Saviour, to give
Repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of
sinnes,</hi> Acts 5. 31. <hi>Through this man is
preached the forgiveness of sinnes; and by
him all that believe, are justified from all
things, from which they could not be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Law of Moses,</hi> Acts 13. 38,
39. When our eyes are open, and we
<hi>are turned from dakness to light, and from
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:63001:134"/>
the power of Satan unto God,</hi> we then <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Remissio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of our sinnes,</hi> Acts 26. 18.
When we are <hi>delivered from the power of
darkness, and translated into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ: in him we have then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
through his Blood, even the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of sinnes,</hi> Col. 1. 13, 14. And
<hi>blessed are they whose iniquities are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and whose sinnes are covered, to
whom the Lord imputeth not sinne,</hi> Rom.
4. 7. And now <hi>who shall condemn us? It
is God that justifieth us: For there is no
Condemnation to them that are in Christ
Jesus, that walk not after the flesh, but
after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 1, 33, 34.</p>
               <p>4. With this benefit doth concurre,
<hi>our Reconciliation to God,</hi> and our <hi>Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
by which we are made his Sonnes,
and God is pleased to own us as our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For being one with Christ the
Sonne of God, we are Sonnes by him.
For <hi>to as many as receive him, to them
gave he Power to become the Sonnes of God,
even to them that believe in his Name,</hi>
Joh. 1. 12. This is the wonderfull Love
that the Father hath bestowed on those
that were his Enemies; that they should
not only be reconciled to him, by the
death of his Sonne, but also be called the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63001:134"/>
Sonnes of God, <hi>Rom 5. 10. 1 Joh. 3.
1.</hi> For he hath <hi>chosen us in him, before
the foundation of the world, that we should
be Holy, and without blame before him in
love; having predestiuated us to the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Children, by Jesus Christ to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
according to the good pleasure of his
Will, to the praise of the Glory of his Grace,
wherein he hath made us accepted in the
beloved,</hi> Ephes. 1. 4, 5. 6. O what an
unspeakable Mercy is it, to have the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God, whom we had so oft offended,
to become our Reconciled Father in
Christ. For it is not an empty title that
he assumeth; but he hath more abundant
love to us, and tenderness of our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
then any title can make us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>And hereupon it doth immediatly
follow, that we have a right to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
Inheritance <hi>of his Sonnes, and are
certain</hi> Heirs <hi>of his Heavenly Kingdom,</hi>
Col. 1. 12. <hi>For if</hi> Sonnes, then Heirs,
Heirs of God, and Joint Heirs with
Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. Being saved by the
washing of Regeneration, and renewing of
the Holy Ghost, and justified by Grace
through Christ, we are made Heirs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the hope of Eternal Life,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63001:135"/>
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7. Being begotten againe to
a lively hope, by the Resurrection of Jesus
Christ from the dead, to an Inheritance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible,
and undefiled, and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not away, reserved in Heaven for us,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>6. With all the <hi>Holy Ghost is given to
us,</hi> not only to close us at first with
Christ, but to take up his abode in us as
his temples, and to be the <hi>Agent,</hi> and
<hi>Life</hi> of Christ within us, and to do his
work, and maintain his Interest, and
clense us of all filthiness of flesh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and Sanctifie us throughout, and
to strive against, and conquer the flesh,
and to keep us by Divine Power through
Faith unto Salvation, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 19. Gal.
5. 17, 22. 2 Cor. 6. 1. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 5. For
<hi>because we are Sonnes, God seudeth forth
the Spirit of his Sonne into our hearts,
whereby we cry Abba, Father,</hi> Gal. 4. 6.
This Spirit of Adopton which we receive,
doth <hi>bear witness with our spirits, that we
are the Sonnes of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 15, 16.
For <hi>if any man have not the spirit of Christ,
the same is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. By this
Spirit is the spirit of the world cast out of
us; the spirit of pride, and of blindness,
and of delusion, and hard-heartedness,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:63001:135"/>
and of sensuality, and malice, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
are cast out. By this is Gods
<hi>Image</hi> imprinted on our Souls; we are
conformed to his blessed <hi>Will; we are
made partakers of the Divine Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Holy, as God is Holy,</hi> Col. 3. 10.
2 Pet. 1. 4. 1 Pet. 1. 16. Hereby we
are delivered from the thraldom of sinne,
and the slavery of the Devil; and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the world, and our treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Flesh. Hereby also we are fitted for
the Service of God, to which before we
were undisposed and unfit. O what an
ease is it to the Soul, to be free from so
much of the burden of sinne? What an
honour is it to have the Spirit of God
within us, and to have a Nature so truly
Heavenly and Divine? How can it go ill
with him that hath <hi>God dwelling in him,
and that dwells in God?</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 15.</p>
               <p>7. Another of our precious benefits
by Christ is, that we <hi>shall be actually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the special, and neerest Service
of God, that on Earth is to be performed.</hi>
Let diseased Souls desire idlenes; and
swinish sinners take pleasure in the mire,
and feed like ravenous beasts on carrion,
or as dogs on dung: but the Saints will
ever rejoice in God, and take it for the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63001:136"/>
most blessed life on Earth, when they
can but do him the greatest Service. Let
his Enemies that hate his Service, be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it, as if it were a toile or drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
but his Children will desire no swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
work: They never think themselves
so well as when they are most serviceable
to their blessed Lord, though at the
greatest cost and labour to the flesh. So
sweet is Gods Service, that the more of
it we can do, the more is our pleasure,
and honour, and content. Other work
<hi>spendeth</hi> strength, but this <hi>increaseth</hi> it:
Other work must have r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>creation inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt,
but this is it self the most delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
recreation: Other service is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
for the love of the wages; but this
is undertaken for the Love of the Master,
and the work, and is wages it self, to
them that go through with it. For other
service is but a means, and that to some
inferior end; but this is a means to the
Everlasting perfection, and blessedness
of the Soul; and such a means as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth,
or Presently procureth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the end. All the Saints are even
here <hi>a chosen Generation, a royal Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
an holy Nation, a peculiar People,
that they should shew forth the praises of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63001:136"/>
him that hath called them, out of darkness,
into his marvelous light: They are an holy
Priesthood, to offer up a Spiritual Sacrifice,
acceptable to God by Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet.
2. 5, 9. Their very bodies are <hi>a living
Sacrifice, holy, and acceptable to God,
in their reasonable service.</hi> What a sweet
work is it to live in the daily Love of
God? in his Praises; in the hopes, and
sweet fore-thoughts of Everlasting Joyes:
The world affordeth not such a Master,
nor such a work.</p>
               <p>8. Another of the precious benefits
by Christ is, <hi>The liberty of accesse in all
our wants to God by Prayer, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to be heard.</hi> The flaming sword did
keep the way to the tree of life, till Christ
had taken it down, and consecrated for
us a new and living way, through the
Vaile, which is his flesh: and now we have
<hi>boldness to enter into the Holiest, by the blood
of Jesus: and therefore may draw neer with
a true heart in full assurance of Faith,</hi> Heb.
10. 19, 20, 22. When worldlings may
cry to their <hi>Baal</hi> in vaine, the <hi>Righteous
cry, and the Lord heareth them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth
them out of all their</hi> (hurtfull)
<hi>troubles.</hi> O what a Mercy is it in our
falls, in our distresses, in our dangers,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63001:137"/>
in our wants, to have a God, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
mercifull Father, to go to, and make
our moane to for relief? What a Mercy
is it, when our flesh, and our hearts do
faile us, when friends, and worldly
things all fail us, to have God for the
<hi>Rock</hi> of our hearts, and our <hi>Portion?</hi>
Psal. 73. 26. When sickness begins to
break these bodies, and earthly delights
do all forsake us, and death calls us to
come to our endless state, then to have
a Reconciled Father to go to, and crave
his ayd, upon the encouragment of a
promise, and recommend our Souls into
his hand as to a faithfull Creator, and our
surest deerest friend; this is a Mercy that
no man can well value, till they come to
use it. To know every day, that as oft
as ever we come to God, we are alwaies
welcome; and that our persons, and
prayers are pleasing to him through his
Sonne; what a Mercy is it? One would
think we should live joyfully, if we had
but one such promise as this for Faith to
live upon: <hi>Call upon me in the day of
trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou
shalt glorifie me,</hi> Psal. 50. 15. <hi>Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ye shall ask in my name, that will I
do, that the Father may be glorified in the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:63001:137"/>
Sonne,</hi> Joh. 14. 13, 14. No wonder if
they be rich, that have so free access
to such a treasure; and if they be safe that
have access to so sure a help. For God is
a very present <hi>help</hi> in trouble, <hi>Psal.</hi>
46. 1.</p>
               <p>9 Another precious benefit is, that
we have <hi>Peace of Conscience, or ground
for it at the least, in our Peace with God:</hi>
and <hi>so may come to assurance of Salvation,
and may partake of the Joy in the Holy
Ghost:</hi> For in this Peace and Joy the
Kingdom of God doth much consist.
When the chief cause of all our fear, and
sorrow is done away, what then is left
to break our Peace. When we have no
cause to fear the flames of Hell, nor the
sting of death, or the appearance of our
Judge, any further then to move us to
make ready; what then should greatly
trouble the Soul. If God and Heaven
be not matter of comfort, I know not
what is? If we saw a man, that had got
many Kingdoms, to be still sad, and
dumpish because he had no more; we
would say, he were very ambitious, or
covetuous: And yet he might have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it: But if you have the Love of
God, and a title by promise to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:63001:138"/>
Inheritance, and yet you are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented,
and God, and Glory is not
enough for you; this is most unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p>10. Another of our precious benefits
by Christ is, Our <hi>Spiritual Communion
with his Church, and holy members.</hi> We
do not only joyne with them in outward
Communion, but we unite our desires,
and there is an harmony of affections.
We are in the maine of one Mind, and
Will, and Way: and we joyntly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
the Body of our Lord: <hi>We are
come unto Mount Zion, and unto the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Living God, the Heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
and to an innumerable company of
Angels, to the general Assembly, and
Church of the first born, which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in Heaven, and to God the Judge of
all, and to the spirits of just men made
perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of the
new C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>venant,</hi> Heb. 12. 22, 23, 24.
We are joyned to that Body, and have
Communion with it; which consisteth
both of militant, and triumphant Saints,
and of the Angels also. <hi>We are no more
strangers and forreiners, but fellow Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
with the Saints, and of the houshold
of God, and are built on the foundation of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:63001:138"/>
the Apostles, and Prophets, Jesus Christ
himself being the cheif corner-stone; in
whom all the building fitly framed together,
groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord;
in whom we also are builded together, for
an habitation of God, through the Spirit,</hi>
Ephes. 2. 19, 20, 21, 22. And as in
holy concord we serve the Lord, having
<hi>one God, one Christ, one Spirit, one Faith,
one Baptism, one Rule,</hi> the Word of
God, <hi>one mind, one heart, one work</hi> of
Holines, and Righteousness in the main;
<hi>one hope, one Heaven,</hi> the place of our
expectations; so have we the fruit of the
Prayers of each other, and of all the
Church, and have the honour, the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and other benefits of being members
of so blessed a Society.</p>
               <p>Yea we have in this Communion, the
whole Church obliged, and disposed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their capacity to endeavour
the good of every member. So that
Ministers, and Magistrates, yea though
they were Apostles, and Prophets, <hi>Paul,</hi>
or <hi>Apollos, all are ours,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 22.
Kings have their <hi>Power for us:</hi> Ministers
have their <hi>Gifts for us:</hi> and <hi>for us</hi> they
must use them. If we <hi>suffer,</hi> every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
must be as forward to assist us, and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:63001:139"/>
if we want, to relieve us according to
their power, as if they suffered with us,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>Yea the Angels are our <hi>Brethren</hi>
(Rev. 22. 9.) and <hi>fellow servants,</hi>
yea <hi>ministring spirits, sent forth to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
for them that shall be Heirs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
Heb. 1. 14. To <hi>encamp about them,
and to bear them in their arms,</hi> rejoycing
to behold their graces, and prosperity,
as was shewed before.</p>
               <p>11. Another of our precious benefits
by Christ is, that <hi>All things shall work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for our good,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. When
we are Sanctified to God, all things are
Sanctified to us, to serve us for God,
and help us to him. Every Creature that
we have to do with, is as it were another
thing to the Saints, then to other men.
They are all wheels in that universal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
of Grace, to carry us to Salvation.
The same things that are common Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to others, are special to us, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from a special Love, and being
designed to a special use. As <hi>flesh-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
is the ultimate end of the ungodly,
and all things are thereby debased, to be
but means to that ignoble end: So the
<hi>Pleasing and fruition of God,</hi> is the End of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:63001:139"/>
all the Saints, and thereby all things that
they have to do with, are advanced to
the honour of being Sanctified means to
this most high, and noble End: And as
they are engaged to use them to this End,
and consequently to their own greatest
advantage; so God hath engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to bless them in that holy use, and
to cause them all by his gracious provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to cooperate to their good. The
greatest afflictions, the cruellest perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
from the most violent enemies,
our wants, our weaknesses, and death
it self, all must concurre to carry on this
work. What then should a Christian
fear, but sinne? How honourable, and
how safe, and how happy a life may he
live, that hath all these assured for his
service. And what causeless fears are
they that use to afflict the Servants of
God, concerning their outward troubles,
and necessities? What do we fear, and
groan under, and complaine of, but
our Fathers physick, and the means of
our Salvation? If this one Truth were
but believed, and received, and used ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its worth, O what a life would
Christians live.</p>
               <p>12. The last, and greatest of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:63001:140"/>
by Christ is, <hi>Our Resurrection, and
our Justification at the barre of God, and
our reception into Glory.</hi> This is the end
of all, and therefore containeth all. For
this Christ died; for this we are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
for this we believe, hope, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
for this we suffer, and deny our
selves, and renounce this world. Our
bodies shall then be spiritual and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
no more troubled with infirmities,
diseases, or necessities. Our Souls shall
be both naturally, and graciously perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
both in their faculties and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
We shall be brought nigh to God:
We shall be numbered with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and be
members of that blessed Society, and be
companions, and equal with the Angels
of God: we shall for ever behold our
Glorified Redeemer, and see our own
Nature, united to the Godhead; and
we shall have the greatest, and neerest
intuition and fruition of God, thefullest
Love to him, and the swetest Rest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and delight in him, that our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Natures are capable of: We shall
everlastingly be imployed in this Love,
and delight, and in his Praises with all
the Heavenly Host: And the Glory of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:63001:140"/>
God will shine forth in our Glory, and
the abundance of his Goodness will be
communicated to us; and he will be well
pleased with us, with our praises, with
all that blessed Society, and with our
Head: And this will endure to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>Christians I have now named in a few
words, those Benefits by Christ, which
the heart of man is not able to value, in
any proportion to their unexpressible
worth: I have named that in an hour,
which you must enjoy for ever. So much
of our Benefits by Christ.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>The fifth point to be understood,
in the right Knowledg of Christ, is,</hi> The
terms on which he conveyeth his Benefits to
men, and how we must be made partakers
of them.</p>
               <p>And these Mercies are of two sorts,
1. <hi>Common: 2. Proper</hi> to them that are
Heirs of Salvation. The <hi>Common</hi> are,
1. Those discoveries of Grace, that are
made even to <hi>Heathens</hi> in the <hi>Creatures,
and the mercifull Providences</hi> of God.
These are <hi>Absolutely,</hi> and freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:63001:141"/>
stowed, in some measure on all, but in
a greater measure upon some as please the
Giver. 2. The Supernatural, or Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
means, of Revealing Christ, and
Life to the world, and drawing them to a
saving consent of Faith. These are, the
Gospel written and preached, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concomitant helps. The Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ hath given to his Embassadors,
is to preach this Gospel to all the world,
even to every (reasonable) Creature,
without exception, or restriction. And
it is <hi>Absolutely,</hi> and freely, given where
it is given. But as to the providential
disposal of the event, God causeth it not
to be sent to all, but to whom he seeth
meet.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The</hi> Proper or Special Mercies <hi>are
of two sorts. 1. Some are</hi> Physical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
qualities, <hi>or</hi> performed acts:
2. <hi>And some are</hi> adherent Rights, or
Relations.</p>
               <p>Of the former <hi>inherent</hi> sort, there are
these three Degees: 1. There is the first
special work of Vocation, Conversion,
or Regeneration, causing the sinner to
Repent, and Believe, and giving him
the Principle of Spiritual Life. 2. There
is the bestowing of the In-dwelling
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63001:141"/>
Spirit of God, and progressive Santifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of heart, and life, and perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
with Victory. 3. There is the
perfecting of all this, in our Glorious
Perfection in the life to come.</p>
               <p>For the first of these, God hath not
promised it Conditionally, or Absolutely
to any individual person that hath it not.
He hath bound all to Repent, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but hath not promised to make
them do it: (only he hath revealed, that
there are certain persons, so given to
Christ, as that they shall be infallibly
drawn to believe.) But he hath appointed
certain means for the ungodly, which
they are bound to use, in order to their
Conversion; and if they will not use
them, they are without excuse. If they
will, they have very much encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from God: Both 1. In the Nature
of the means, which are fitted to their
ends, and are mighty to bring down, all
oppositions; and 2. In the Commands,
and Institution of God; whose Wisdom
and Goodness may easily resolve us, that
he will not appoint us means in vaine,
nor set his Creatures on fruitless labours:
And 3. Also from the Issue: for no man
can stand forth and say, such a one did
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:63001:142"/>
his best in the Use of means, and yet
could not attain the End, but fell short
of the Grace, and Glory of God.</p>
               <p>The diseases of mens Souls, are <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness,
and blindness:</hi> The means of
Cure, are the <hi>Perswasions,</hi> with the
<hi>Revelations</hi> of the Gospel. Men have
the Natural Powers of Understanding,
and Willing: but they want that right
disposition, which we call the Habit, or
Moral Power, which is no more then
to say, <hi>They are Habitually Blind</hi> and
<hi>Wilfull.</hi> It is so far from being unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to <hi>teach,</hi> and <hi>perswade</hi> men that are
under such an Impotency as this, that
there is nothing in the world, that doth
more bespeak our teaching, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions:
For this is the Natural, and
Instituted way to cure them, and give
them Power. What means of overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Ignorance</hi> like <hi>Teaching;</hi> and what
means of overcoming <hi>Habituated Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness,</hi>
like <hi>Perswasion,</hi> added to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
truths? We do not use to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
men out of a <hi>Natural Impotency,</hi> nor
to <hi>perswade</hi> them to do that, for which
they have no Faculties, or Object; but
it is the very means of overcoming a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Impotency,</hi> and making men willing
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:63001:142"/>
of the Good which they rejected. And
with this means doth God set in, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
cause it to be effectual with his
chosen. Thus no man cometh to the
Sonne, except the Father <hi>draw</hi> him;
And then for the two following De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
of Holiness in our Sanctification,
and Glorious Perfection, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
them to those that have this first
Degree. For the <hi>Spirit of Holiness</hi> is
promised to all that truly <hi>Repent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
and <hi>Salvation</hi> to all that are <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
and persevere.</hi> So that the <hi>Right</hi>
to these <hi>Inherent</hi> Mercies, being a <hi>Relae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
is conveyed as other <hi>Rights,</hi> and
<hi>Relations,</hi> of which we are next to
speak.</p>
               <p>2. As the <hi>Spirit</hi> by the Operation of
the Word upon the heart, conveyeth
the foresaid <hi>Inherent</hi> benefits, or qualities
and acts, so the <hi>Promise</hi> of Grace, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Christ, and the Spirit, doth as a
Deed of Gift, or Testament, or Act of
Oblivion, bestow on us our <hi>Rights,</hi> and
<hi>Spiritual Relations;</hi> and from these they
do result, as the immediate instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Cause. Thus doth he give Power, or
Right to as many as <hi>receive</hi> him, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Sonnes of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:63001:143"/>
Thus doth he give us Pardon, Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Adoption, and our Right to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Grace, and Glory. And these
Promises are Conditional; and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,
and Believing in Christ is the
Condition. And therefore till Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
do bring us to Repent and Believe,
we have no Right to any of these bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of the Promise. And therefore
though our Repentance and Faith, be
none of the <hi>Proper Cause</hi> of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Right; yet the main work, in
order to our procurement of these bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
that's now to be done, is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the sinner to Repent and Believe;
to turn that he may live: For Gods Act
of Grace is past already, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Pardon is granted long ago, and
will effectually Pardon us, as soon as we
perform the Condition, and not before.
Till then we hinder the Efficacy of the
Deed of Gift: For Unbelief and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency,
are true <hi>Causes</hi> of mens <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi>
though Faith, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
be not <hi>Proper Causes</hi> of their <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Promises being Conditional, we
cannot be assured of our part in the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
but by being assured that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:63001:143"/>
the Condition. By this you may
see the Nature of presumption: When
men say, they believe that which never
was promised; or believe that they have
right to the Blessings that are promised
to others, and not to them; or believe
that they shall have the benefits promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
when they perform not the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
all this is presuming, and not true
believing. If men believe that God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to them, and will Pardon them,
and Justifie them, and save them, when
they are unconverted, impenitent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
men; this is not indeed a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of God, that hath never made
them any such promise, nor ever told
them any such matter, but the contrary:
But it is a believing the false delusions of
the Devil, and their own hearts. He
that will claim any title to Christ, and
Pardon, and Salvation, must have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to shew for it; yea and something
more then the most of the world have to
shew: For the most shall be shut out.
Every man therefore that regardeth his
Salvation, must seriously ask his Soul
this question, <hi>What have I to shew for my
title to Salvation, more then the most of
the world can shew? It is not saying, I
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:63001:144"/>
hope to be saved, that will serve the turn'
except I can give a Reason of my hopes'
Thousands that lay claim to Salvation
shall miss of it, because they have no title to
it.</hi> And that which you must have to shew
is this: A <hi>Promise,</hi> or <hi>Deed of Gift</hi> on
<hi>Gods</hi> part, and the <hi>fullfilling of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
on <hi>your</hi> part. God saith to all
men, <hi>who ever Repenteth, Believeth, or
is converted, shall be saved.</hi> When you
have found that you Repent of all your
sinnes, and truly believe, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to God, then, and not till then,
you may conclude that you shall be
saved.</p>
               <p>6. The sixth Point to be understood,
or believed, concerning these Benefits
of Christ, is, the infallible Certainty of
them. While men look on the promised
Glory to come, as on an uncertain
thing, they will hardly be drawn to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and let go the porfits, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the world to attaine it; much
less to part with life it self. The life of
all our Christian motion, is the unfeigned
belief of the Truth of Gods Word, and
specially of the unseen things of the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:63001:144"/>
world to come. Such as mens belief of
Heaven, and Hell is, such will be the
bent of their hearts, and the course of
their lives, and such they will be in yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to sinne, or in resisting it, and in all
the service they do for God. As all men
would take another course, if they did
but see Heaven, and Hell with their
eyes; so all men would presently throw
away their worldly fleshly pleasures, and
turn to God, and a holy life, if they
did but as throughly believe the Joyes,
and torments to come; as if they saw
them. Flesh and blood can hardly judg
of things, without the help of sense; and
fleshly men take all things to be fantasmes
or nothings, that are not within the
judgment of their senses. They must see
it, or feel it, or tast it, or hear it; and
Believing is a way that hardly satisfies
them; though it be God himself, that
they are to believe. Believing is, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
the Credit of an other: and we are
naturally loth to trust to any, but our
eyes, or other senses. We are so false
our selves, that we are ready to measure
God by our selves, and to think that he
is a deceiver, because that we are such.
And hence it is that the world is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:63001:145"/>
that they venture on sinne, and
will not be at the cost, and labour of a
Heavenly life; because they take the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the life to come, to be but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
and have not so true a belief of
them, as might possess them with a deep
apprehension of their reallity. How should
the Word profit them, that mixe it not
with Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. Unless by beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Faith it self. O what a change would
a sound belief of the Scriptures, make
in the world. But having spoken so oft
of this, in other writings, I shall say no
more of it now. So much of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of Christ.</p>
               <p>II. I have shewed you the first part
of this Direction, <hi>How Christ must be
Received understandingly.</hi> I now come
to the second, which is, that <hi>He must
be Received heartily.</hi> As God must be
loved, so Christ must be believed in, with
all the heart, and Soul, and strength:
If not with All in a <hi>Perfect</hi> degree, (for
that will not be till we come to Heaven)
yet with <hi>All</hi> in a <hi>predominant prevalent</hi>
degree. There are many convictions,
and good meanings, and wishes, and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:63001:145"/>
purposes, which may proceed from
common Grace, and be found in those
that never shall be saved: These may be
called (analogically) Faith, and Love,
and Desire, as those are that are found in
the truly Regenerate: and yet the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in whom they are found, may not
fitly be called Believers, or Lovers of
God; because a man is to be denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
from that in him which is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and hath the chief power on his
heart. The Soul of man is not so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as to move but one way: Its state in
this life is to stand between two differing
Competitours, God and the world,
Spirit and flesh; and there is no man,
that is Totally given up to either of them.
No man is so good, and spiritual, that
hath not something in him that is bad
and carnal: And no man is so fully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to God, but the Creature hath
too much interest in his heart. Nor is
there any man so given up to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in whom God hath no manner of
interest at all, in his Estimation, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
if he indeed believe that there
is a God. At least it is not so with
all that are unconverted. Otherwise,
1. What: is it that common Grace
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:63001:146"/>
doth, if it no whit dispose them towards
God? Certainly it would not else be
Grace. 2. And if this were not so, then
we must say, that no unregenerate man
hath any Good in him, that is truly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
For if there be no interest of God in
his mind or will, there can be no Good
in him. But this is contrary to Scripture,
and experience. It was undoubtedly some
Moral Good, which Christ loved the
man for, in <hi>Marke</hi> 10. 21. Who was
not far from the Kingdom of God.
3. Otherwise all men must be equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from God, which is contrary to
experience: 4. Yea all men must be as
bad on Earth (privatively) as in Hell:
which certainly is false. I may well say,
that on Earth there is some Good in the
worst; much more in those, that are
almost perswaded to be converted Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Many a thought of the Goodness of
God and the necessity of a Saviour, and
of the Love of Christ, and of the Joyes of
Heaven, may be stirring, and working in
the minds of the unsanctified; but if they
take not up the Heart for Christ, the
person is not a true Believer. As the
Gospel must be Believed to be True, so
Christ that is offered us in the Gospel <hi>as
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:63001:146"/>
Good;</hi> must be Heartily, and Thankfully
accepted accordingly: And the Glory,
the Justification, Reconciliation with
God, and other benefits procured by
him, and offered with him, must be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued,
and desired above all earthly
fleshly things. If you are convinced that
sinne is evill, as contrary to God, and
hurtfull to you, and hereupon have
some mind to let it go, and some wishes
that Christ would save you from it, and
yet still have a Love to it that is greater
then your dislike, and the bent of your
heart is more for it, then against it, and
your habituate desires, are rather to
keep, then to leave it; this is not San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
nor a saving consent to be
saved by Christ. If you have some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
that Holiness is good, as being
the Image of God, and pleasing to him,
and necessary to your Salvation, and so
should have some mind of Holyness on
these grounds; yet if you have on the
other side a greater aversness to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it would deprive you of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of your sinne, and the Habitual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of your will, is more against it
then for it; certainly this will not stand
with true Sanctification, of Faith in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:63001:147"/>
Christ, to save you from the power of
sinne by his Spirit. Thousands deceive
themselves, by misunderstanding some
common passages, that are spoken to
comfort afflicted Consciences; viz. <hi>That
the least true desires after Grace, do prove
the Soul to be Gracious.</hi> This is true, if
you speak of the least Desires, which are
Predominant in the Soul, when our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi>
is more habitually then our <hi>unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and we thus preferre Christ before
all the world, the least of this is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Saving Grace. But such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
as are subdued by the contrary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
and such a will as is accompanyed
with a greater unwillingness, habitually,
and such a Faith, as is drowned in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
unbelief, these are not Evidences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of
a saving change; nor can you justly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any special comfort from them. He
that hath more unbelief then Belief, is
not to be called a Believer, but an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever:
And he that hath more hatred, or
dislike of God, and Holiness, then Love
to them, is not to be called Godly, but
ungodly, nor a Lover of God, but a
hater of him. I am easily perswaded,
that many of you that are ungodly, could
be contented that God be Glorified, if
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:63001:147"/>
his Glory do not cross your carnal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and so you desire Gods Glory even
for it self, as that which is absolutely
Good in it self: But if your fleshly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
be so dear to you, that you will sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
Gods Glory to it, and had rather
God were dishonoured, then your flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
interest contradicted, it is your flesh
then that is made your God, and your
chief End. It is not every wish, or mind
of Christ, no not to save you from sinne
as sinne, that will prove you true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:
Nor is it every minding of God,
or love to him, no not as one apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by you, to be the chiefest Good,
and desirable for himself, as your End,
that will prove indeed that you savingly
love him; as long as the contrary mind
and will, is Habitually predominant in
you. Such as the very habit and bent of
a mans heart is, such indeed is the man.
Its possible for a man, even a good man,
to have two contrary ends, and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
yea ultimate ends; as that which is
desired for it self, and referred to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, is called <hi>Vltima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e:</hi> but it is
not possible for him, to have two <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
predominant</hi> Ends. So far as we
are carnal still, we make the pleasing of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:63001:148"/>
our flesh our ultimate End: For doubtless
we do not sinne only, by pleasing the
flesh, as <hi>a means to Gods Glory;</hi> nor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the mischoosing of other means:
But yet this is none of our <hi>Principal</hi> End,
so far as men are truly Sanctified. And
because that is called a mans mind, or
will, which is the chiefest, and highest
in his mind, and will; therefore we use
to denominate men, from that only
which beareth rule in them: And thus
we may say with <hi>Paul, It is not I, but
sinne that dwelleth in me.</hi> For a disowned
act, that proceedeth from us, against
the bent, and habit of our wills, and the
course of our lives, from the remnants
of a carnal misguided will, is not it that
must denominate the person, nor is so
fully ours as the contrary act. And
therefore though indeed we sinfully par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
of it, yet when the question is,
whether Believing, or unbeliefe, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or obeying, be <hi>my</hi> work; it is not
Comparatively to be called <hi>mine,</hi> which
I am much more against then for. So on
the other side, if the unsanctified have
some transient, superficial, uneffectual
acts of Desire, or Faith, or Love to
God, which are contrary to the bent,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:63001:148"/>
and habit of their hearts, this is not <hi>theirs,</hi>
nor imputable to them, so far as hence,
to give them their. Denomination. It is
not <hi>they</hi> that do it, but the common
workings of the Spirit upon them.</p>
               <p>If ever then you would be assured that
your are Christians, look to the <hi>Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
bent</hi> of your hearts, and see that
you do not only talk of Scripture, and
sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ghtly believe it, and speak well of
Christ, with some good wishes, and
meanings, and purposes; but, as you love
your Souls, see that Christ be Received
as your dearest Saviour, with Thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and greatest Love; and as your
Soveraign Lord, with true subjection;
and that he have your Superlative estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Affections, and all things in
the world be put under him in your
Souls. This must be so, if you will have
the portion of Believers. No Faith that
is short of this, will prove you Christ's
Disciples indeed, or Heirs of the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
made to Believers. The voice of
Christ that calls to you in the Gospel, is,
<hi>My sonne give me thy heart,</hi> Prov. 23.
26. Do, what thou wilt in waies of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and think as highly as thou wilt of
thy self, thou art no true Believer in
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:63001:149"/>
Christ's account, till thou hast given him
thy heart. If he have thy tongue, if he
have thy good opinion; nay if thy body
were burnt in his Cause, if he had not
thy <hi>Love,</hi> thy <hi>Heart,</hi> it were as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. For thy works, and
sufferings, are so far acceptable (through
Christ) as they are testimonies of this,
that Christ hath thy heart. If he have
not thy heart, he takes it as if he had
nothing: And if he have this, he takes
it as if he had all. For this is not only
preferred by him before all; but also he
knows that this commandeth all. If
Christ have thy <hi>Heart,</hi> the Devil will
not have thy tongue, and life; the Ale-house,
or a Harlot will not have thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
nor the world will not have the
principal part of thy life. If Christ have
thy <hi>Heart,</hi> it will be heard much in thy
conference; it will be seen in thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
For that which hath a mans <hi>Heart</hi>
will hardly be hid, unless he purposely
hide it, which a Christian neither can,
nor ought to do. It would make a man
wonder to hear some wretches, that will
runne from God as fast as they can, and
yet face you down, that God hath their
hearts: that have no mind, so much as
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:63001:149"/>
to meditate, or talk of Christ, or his
precious Blood, or mysterious Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or the glorious Kingdom purchased
by him; that will be at neither, cost nor
labour in his Service, and yet profess
that Christ hath their hearts: that will
refuse a Holy Heavenly life, and perhaps
make a scorn of it, and maliciously prate
against the Sanctified, and yet will
stand to it that the Holy Ghost, the
Sanctifier of the Elect, hath their hearts.
No wonder if those hearts are ill mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and in a miserable deceived state,
that are so unacquainted with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>Faith entreth at the Understanding,
but it hath not all its essential parts, and
is not the Gospel Faith indeed, till it have
possessed the will. The <hi>heart</hi> of Faith
is wanting, till Faith hath taken possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>heart.</hi> For by <hi>Faith</hi> Christ
<hi>dwelleth</hi> in the <hi>Heart,</hi> Ephes. 3. 17. And
if he dwell not in the <hi>heart,</hi> he dwells
not in the <hi>Man,</hi> in a saving sort. He
had some interest in <hi>Judas, Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,
Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> as to the
<hi>head,</hi> and perhaps somewhat more in a
superficial sort. But Satan <hi>entred</hi> into
the <hi>heart</hi> of one, and <hi>filled</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:63001:150"/>
another of them with a lie, and the <hi>heart</hi>
of the third was not <hi>right in the sight of
God,</hi> and therefore he had no part, or lot
in Christ, but was still in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and bond of iniquity: and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ was not heartily entertained,
<hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3 &amp; 8. 22, 23. It is in the
<hi>heart</hi> that the word must have its rooting,
or else it will wither in time of tryal. It
is seeking with the <hi>whole heart</hi> that is the
evidence of the blessed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119 2.
And it is a <hi>feigned turning,</hi> when men
turn not to God with the <hi>whole heart,</hi>
Jer. 3. 10. This is Gods promise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Elect; <hi>I will give them a
heart, to know me, that I am the Lord,
and they shall be my people, and I will be
their God: for they shall return unto me
with their whole heart,</hi> Jer. 24. 7. See then
that the <hi>heart</hi> be unfeignedly delivered up
to Christ: For if Christ have it not, the
flesh, the world, and the Devil will have
it. Your Hearts must be a dwelling
for one of these Masters; choose you
whether.</p>
               <p>It is the damnation of most professed
Christians, that they have nothing for
Christ but a good opinion, or a few
good words, or outside services, or some
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:63001:150"/>
sleight Religiousness on the by; when
the flesh, and the world go away with their
hearts; and yet they will not know it,
nor confess it. Christ will not be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derling,
or servant to your flesh. Your
Hearts he hath bought, and your Hearts
he will have; or you are none of his.
If <hi>he</hi> shall have nothing from <hi>you</hi> but a
<hi>name, you</hi> shall have nothing but the
name of his purchased Salvation.</p>
               <p>III. The last part of the Direction
yet remains, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>you must cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se
with Christ entirely, as</hi> well as <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standingly</hi>
and <hi>Heartily.</hi> It is <hi>whole
Christ,</hi> that must be received with the
whole heart.</p>
               <p>For the understanding of this, it must
be known, both <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Why</hi> Christ is
offered to us.</p>
               <p>As he came into the world to destroy
the works of the Devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8 and
<hi>to seek</hi> and <hi>save</hi> that which was lost,
<hi>Luke</hi> 19. 19 And by his Mediation to
reconcile us to God, and bring us up to
Glory; so two things were to be done,
for the accomplishment of this: First he
was himself to Merit our Salvation, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:63001:151"/>
pay the price of our Redemption on the
Cross, and in his own Person to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the world, the Devil, and death,
and the grave: And then he was by his
Intercession in the Heavens, to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of this, and bestow the benefits
thus purchased by him. And because it
was he, and not we that made the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase,
it therefore pleased the Father,
that the purchased treasure should be put
into his hands, and not immediately put
into ours. He is become our Treasury,
and authorized to be our Head: All
Power is given him in Heaven, and
Earth. We have so fouly miscarryed
already, that he will no more trust his
honour in our hands, as at first he did.
We shall have nothing, of Pardon, or
Grace, or Glory, but what we have in
and from the Sonne. <hi>God hath given us
Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Sonne:
He that hath the Sonne hath Life, and he
that hath not the Sonne, hath not Life,</hi>
1 Joh. 11. 12. It is not only the Nature,
and Person of Christ, that is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in, but it is the Person, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
to certain ends, and clothed with
his Office, yet we must now entertain.
Now the Office of Christ being for our
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:63001:151"/>
Salvation, and the Glory of God, is sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to these happy ends.</p>
               <p>And our Necessities are principally in
these three points. 1. We have the Guilt
of sinne upon us to be pardoned, and the
Wrath of God, and Curse of the Law,
and the punishment of sinne to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
2. We have the Corruption of
our Nature to be healed; the power of
sinne to be destroyed; the Image of God
repaired on us; and our hearts, and lives
to be acted, and ordered according to
the Will of God; and to these ends,
Temptations to be conquered; and our
Souls, directed, strengthned, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to the end. 3. We must be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from the Grave at the last day; we
must be Justified in Judgment, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of that Glory which is the End of
our Faith. To this Justification, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and Glorification may the rest
be reduced.</p>
               <p>Now the Office of Christ is suited to
these Necessities of ours: and as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly be saved, unless all these Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
be supplied, and these works
done for us: so we cannot possibly have
these things done, but by Accepting of
Christ, as Authorized, and impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:63001:152"/>
by his Office, and Perfections, to
do them.</p>
               <p>The Glory that God will have by this
work, I have before expressed to you at
large. He will have his Justice, &amp; Wisdom,
and Power, and Holiness, and Mercy to be
demonstrated, and honoured by Christ.
And therefore Christ hath resolved to
give out none of his benefits, but in such
manner, and waies, as may best attain
these highest Ends.</p>
               <p>These several points therefore I must
intreate you here to note distinctly.
1. That you must be brought into a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Relation to the <hi>Person of Christ, as
cloathed with his Office,</hi> before you can
lay claim to his <hi>Saving Benefits.</hi> He is
the Head, and you must become his
Members: He is the Husband of the
Church, and you must become his
Spouse, and so of the rest. This is called
our <hi>Vni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ng</hi> to Christ, which must go
before your further Communion with
him. It is the Will of God, that you
shall never receive his Benefits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
or before you receive his Sonne:
(Except only those Benefits, which go
before your Union with Christ himselfe,
in order to the accomplishing it; as
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:63001:152"/>
the Gospel, the gift of Faith to the
Elect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) You shall never have actual
Pardon, Justification, Adoption, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
or Glory, till you have first
saving interest in Christ himself. He is
the <hi>Vine,</hi> and we are the <hi>Branches:</hi> we
must be planted into him, and live in him,
or else we can have nothing further from
God, nor do nothing acceptable to
God. And therefore the first, and great
work of Faith is to Receive, and close
with the Person of Christ, as cloathed
with his Office.</p>
               <p>2. Understand and note, that as you
shall not have his great <hi>Benefits</hi> before,
or without his <hi>Person,</hi> so God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
that you shall not have his Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<hi>Benefits,</hi> unless you will take them
<hi>all together.</hi> (I speak of men at age, that
are capable of all.) You shall not have
Pardon, and Justification, or Glory,
without Sanctification; nor the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of Christ, without the guidance,
and government of Christ. You must
have all, or none.</p>
               <p>3. From hence it follows, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you must Receive, and close with
Christ Entirely, in his whole Office, as
he is to accomplish all these works, or
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:63001:153"/>
else you cannot be United to him. He
will not be divided: You shall not have
Christ as a Justifier of yon, if you will
not have him as a Guid, and Ruler, and
Sanctifier of you. He will not be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Saviour: If you will not consent that
he shall save you from your sinnes, he
will not consent to save you from Hell.</p>
               <p>4. Understand, and note that Christ
will look to his <hi>Fathers Interest, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
and his <hi>own,</hi> as well as to your
Salvation; yea and before it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you must not hope for any Mercy
from him, in any way that is dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him, or that is inconsistent with
his own blessed Ends, and Interest. And
therefore do not look for any such Grace
from him, as shall discharge you from
your duty, or give you liberty to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or disobey him: Nor do not think
that you shall have him Related to you
only for your own ends, but on terms
of highest honour to God, and you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
And do not think that your
Grace is ever the less free, because Gods
Honour is thus preferred: For if you are
Christians indeed, you will take Gods
Interest, as your own highest Interest,
and will confess, that you could not have
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:63001:153"/>
your own Ends, and welfare any other
way.</p>
               <p>5. Understand and Note also, that as
all your Mercies are in the hand of
Christ, so Christ hath appointed in his
Gospel, a certain way and course of
means, in which he will bestow it: And
you cannot expect it from him, in any
other way, but his own. As God hath
made Christ the way, and no man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Father but by him, so Christ
hath ordained a standing course of means,
which are his way for the making over
of his Benefits: and here you must have
them, or go without them.</p>
               <p>6. Understand and Note, that there
are <hi>some</hi> of Christ's Ends, and Benefits,
that the very <hi>Natural man desires,</hi> and
some that <hi>Corrupted Natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e</hi> is against.
Now it is therefore the established way
of Christ, to Promise us those which we
<hi>can desire,</hi> on Condition that we will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>accept</hi> of, and <hi>submit to those that we
are against.</hi> Not but that his Grace doth
dispose men to the performance of such
Conditions: But his Grace worketh by
means: and a <hi>Conditionall Promise</hi> is his
stablished <hi>means,</hi> to draw mans heart to
the <hi>Performance</hi> of the Condition: (which
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:63001:154"/>
well considered, is a sufficient answer to
the Arguments that are commonly urged
against the Conditionality of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.)
As the Spirit doth Powerfully
work within; so he useth that Word from
without, as his Instrument, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Sapientially, and Powerfully to the
same work. If a Physician have two me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
to give his patient, as necessary
for his cure, the one very sweet, and
the other bitter; the one which he loves,
and the other which he loaths, he will
Promise him the <hi>Sweeter,</hi> if he will take
the <hi>Bitter</hi> one; that by the <hi>love</hi> of one,
he may prevail against the <hi>loathing</hi> of the
other, and may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ice it down. He will
not <hi>promise</hi> the <hi>bitter</hi> one which is loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and make the Taking of the <hi>sweet</hi> one
the Condition: He will not say, <hi>I will
give thee this Aloes, on Condition thou
wilt take this Sugar:</hi> but contrary; <hi>I
will give thee the sweeter, if thou wilt take
the bitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Christs Ends, and Works, 1. We
Naturally are more willing of that which
makes for our selves directly, then of that
which makes directly for the Honour of
God, and the Redeemer. We preferre
our own Ends before Gods Glory: And
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:63001:154"/>
therefore Christ hath so ordered the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his Promises, that unless we
will take him, in his Relations of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as King and Lord, and will make the
Glory, and Pleasing of God our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
End, we shall have none of him, or
his Saving Benefits. For he came not to
fulfill our selfish desires, but to fetch us
off from our selves, and recover us to
God, that he might have his own. And
if we will not have our All in God, we
shall have Nothing. 2. And Naturally
we are willing, as to our own Benefits,
to be pardoned, and freed from the
Curse of the Law, and the flames of Hell,
and Natural death, and punishment:
And therefore we are thus farre Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
willing of free Justification. But we
are unwilling to let go the seeming profit,
and credit, and pleasure of sinne, and
to deny the flesh, and forsake the world,
and we are averse to the Spiritual felicity
of the Saints, and to the Holiness of
heart, and life, that is the way to it.
And therefore Christ hath most wisely so
ordered it, in the tenor of his Promises,
that our Repentance and Faith, shall be
the Condition of our Justification, and
deliverance from death and Hell: And
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:63001:155"/>
this Faith is the believing in him, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
him Entirely in his whole Office,
to Sanctifie us, and Rule us, as well as
to Justifie us: And thus we must take
him wholly, or we shall have none of
him. And the Accepting him as our
Teacher; and Sanctifier, and King, is
as much; (at least, the Condition of our
Justification, and Pardon, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from Hell,) as the Accepting
him as a Justifier of us, is. He that had
the Power in his own hands, and that
made the free Promise, or Deed of Gift,
hath put in such Conditions, as his own
Wisdom saw best; and they are such as
suit most congruously to <hi>all</hi> his Ends;
even the Glory of God, in all his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
and the Redeemers Glory, and
our own, and most full and free Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And on his Conditions must we
have his Benefits, or we shall never
have them.</p>
               <p>7. Lastly Understand and Note, that
the Means which Christ hath resolved on
for Teaching, and Ruling us, ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
are <hi>his Word, his Ministers, and his
Spirit:</hi> all must be submitted to together,
where they may be had, and none of
them laid by, by separation. His <hi>Word,</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:63001:155"/>
is the <hi>Grammar,</hi> or <hi>Book,</hi> as it were,
that we must learn: His <hi>Ministers</hi> must
teach us this <hi>Book:</hi> And his <hi>Spirit</hi> (who
in the Apostles, and Prophets indited,
and sealed it) must inwardly teach us,
by powerfull Illumination. The Word
is Gods Laws: the Ministers are his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours,
or Heraulds to proclaime
them, and command obedience in his
Name: and his Spirit must open mens
hearts to entertain them. The Word is
Gods Seed: the Ministers are the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen,
or Servants that sow it: and
the Spirit must give the increase; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, our planting, and watering
will do nothing. He therefore that takes
Christ for his Master, and King, must
resolve to be taught, and ruled by his
established means, even by his Word,
and Ministers, and Spirit conjunct: For
he that <hi>refuseth</hi> and <hi>despiseth</hi> these, doth
<hi>refuse,</hi> and <hi>despise</hi> Christ; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Father that sent him, <hi>Luke
10. 16. 1 Thes.</hi> 4. 8. For it was never
the meaning of Christ, when he became
the Teacher, and King of the Church, to
stay on Earth, and personally, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siby
to teach them himself: but these
three are his means, which all must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:63001:156"/>
to, that will be his Subjects, and
Disciples. And he that despiseth the
<hi>Word,</hi> shall be destroyed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 13.
He that will not have the Word, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
and Spirit teach him, will not have
Christ teach him: and he that refuseth to
be ruled by these three, shall be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a Rebel against Christ himself,
<hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27. Still it is supposed that
Ministers must Teach, and Rule accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this Word.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Society in which Christ</hi> will
Teach and govern us, is his <hi>Church:</hi> As
members therefore of the <hi>Vniversal
Church,</hi> and in <hi>Communion</hi> with his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
Church, where we live and have
opportunity, we must wait on Christ
for his Teaching and Benefits. For this
is his Schoole, where his Disciples must
diligently attend and learn.</p>
               <p>Lay all this together, and this is the
summe: The Object of Justifying, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Faith, is One only undivided Christ,
one in Person, but of two Natures,
God, and Man; in Office the Mediator
between God and man, who hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
done the work of Sanctification, and
Merit, and is authorized further to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
the Benefits: By the Gospel Grant
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:63001:156"/>
he hath given himself as Head, and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
Teacher, King, and Saviour, to all
that will entirely, and heartily accept
him; and with himself he giveth Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by the Promise, Sanctification by
the Word, Ministry, and Spirit, and
final Absolution, and Everlasting Life.
If ever then you will have Christ, and
Life, you must accept him in all these
Essentials of his Person, and Office, and
that to the Ends, which his Redemption
was intended for; you must be willing to
be Sanctified by him, as well as to be
Justified: You must at once unfeignedly
become his Disciples, his Subjects, his
Members, if you would become his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ones. You wust consent, that as
your Teacher, and your Lord, he shall
Teach and Rule your heart, and life, by
his Word, Ministers, and Spirit, in
Communion with his Church. No barre
or exception must be put in, nor reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made against any one of these parts
of his Office. If you yield not to those
parts of his Saving work, that tend but
to the compleative growth, you sinne,
and deprive your selves of the Benefit;
but if you yield not to those that must
make you truly Sanctified, and Justified
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:63001:157"/>
men, you cannot be saved. The Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
of Christ's Person, and Office, do
costitute him the <hi>Christ,</hi> and if he be not
received in all those Essentials, he is not
received as Christ.</p>
               <p>And thus I have given you the summe
of the Gospel, and the description of
Faith, and true Christianity in this Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for a right closing with the Lord
Jesus Christ. And experience of most
that I discourse with, perswades me to
think this Direction of great necessity,
and to intreat you throughly to peruse,
and consider it: I find abundance of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
people, that talk much of Christ,
but know very little of him: that can
scarce tell us whether he be God or man,
or which Person in the Trinity he is, nor to
what End he was incarnate, and died, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
what Relation he stands in to us, or what
use he is of, or what he now is, or what
he is engaged to do for us. But if we
ask them about their hopes of Salvation,
they almost overlook the Redemption by
Christ, and tell us of nothing but Gods
Mercies, and their own good meanings,
and endeavours. And I am afraid too
many Professors of Piety, (do look) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all, at the Natural part of Religion,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:63001:157"/>
and the mending of their own hearts, and
lives, (and I would this were better
done) while they forget the supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
part, and little are affected with
the infinite Love of God in Christ. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
such to consider these things: 1. You
overlook the summe of your Religion,
which is Christ Crucified, besides whom
<hi>Paul</hi> desired to know nothing. 2. You
overlook the fountain of your own life,
and the author of your supplies; and you
strive in vaine for Sanctification, or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
if you seek them not from a
Crucified Christ. 3. You leave undon
the principal part of your work, and
live like moral Heathens, while you have
the name of Christians. Your daily
work is to study God in the face of his
Sonne; and to labour with all Saints to
comprehend the <hi>height,</hi> and <hi>bredth,</hi> and
<hi>length,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> and to know the
<hi>Love</hi> of Christ, which passeth knowledg,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 18. 19. All your Graces should
be daily quickned, and set awork by the
life of Faith, in the contemplation of the
Redeemer, and his blessed work. This is
the weight that must set all the wheels
agoing. You do God no Service, that
he can accept, if you serve him not in
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:63001:158"/>
this Gospel-work, of loving, trusting,
and admiring, and praysing him in the
Redeemer, and for his Redemption.
4. And so you rob God of the principal
part of his Glory, which you are to give
him; which is for this most glorious
work of our Redemption. I pray you
read over again the <hi>Ends</hi> of this work,
which I laid down in the beginning of
this Direction. 5. Moreover you rob
your selves of your principal comfort,
which must all come in, by living upon
Christ. 6. And you harden the <hi>Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi>
and <hi>Libertines,</hi> and tempt men
to their extreams, that runne from us as
<hi>Legalists,</hi> and as men that Savour not
the Doctrine of free Grace, and are not
of a Gospel-Spirit, and conversation.
I would our great neglect of Christ had
not been a snare to these mistaken Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
and a stumbling block in their way.</p>
               <p>O Sirs, if a thought of your hearts,
if a word of your mouths, have not some
relation to Christ, to suspect it, yea
reject it. Call it not a Sermon or a
Prayer, nor a duty, that hath nothing
of Christ in it. Though the pure God-head
be your principal End, yet there
is no way to this End, but by Christ:
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:63001:158"/>
and though Love, which is exercised on
that <hi>End,</hi> must animate all your graces,
and duties, as they are <hi>Means</hi> to that
End; yet Faith hath Love in it, or else
it is not the Christian Faith; and Christ
is the Object of your Faith and Love:
and your perfect Everlasting Love will
be animated by Christ: For your Love
and Praise, will be to him that was slain,
and Redeemed us to God by his Blood,
out of every Kindred, Tongue, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and made us Kings, and Priests to
God. So much for the fifth Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

to a Heavenly Real Everlasting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And when men are affrighted into
som kind of Religiousness, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
learnt to deny themselves, and never
mortified their fleshly mind, but the
love of this world, is still the chiefest
principle at their hearts; and so go on in
Profession of godliness, with a secret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that they will look as well as they
can to their outward prosperity, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
become of their Religion, and they
will have no more to do with the matters
of another world, then may stand with
their bodily safety in this world; these
are the miserable deluded Hypocrites,
whose hopes will prove, as the giving up
of the ghost; whom Christ will disown
in their greatest extremities, after all
their seeming Religiousness. O Sirs, look
to this as ever you would be happy. Its
an easie, its a common, its a most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
thing, to set upon a course of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Piety, and yet keep the world next
your hearts, and take it still as a great
part of your felicity, and secretly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:63001:159"/>
love your former lusts, while you seem
to be converted. The heart is so deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that you have great cause to watch
it narrowly in this point: It will closely
cherish the love of the world, and your
fleshly pleasures, when it seems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them, and when your tongue
can speak contemptuously of them. It
was not for nothing that Christ would
have the first fruits of his Gospel-Church
(who were to be the Example of their
successours) to sell all, and lay it down
at the feet of his Apostles: And it is his
standing Rule, that <hi>Whoever he be, that
forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot
be his Disciple,</hi> Luke 14. 33. In estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
affection, and resolution, it must
be forsaken by all that will be saved; and
also in practice, when ever God calls us
to it. You can have but one Happiness:
If you will needs have it in this world, in
the contenting of your flesh, there is
no hope of having it also in another
world, in the fruition of God. If you
think not God and Heaven enough for
you, and cannot let go the Prosperity
of the flesh for them, you must let go all
your hopes of them. God will not halve
it with the world in your hearts, nor
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:63001:160"/>
part stakes with the flesh; much less will
he be below them, and take their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings:
Heaven will not be theirs, that
set not by it more then Earth. God will
not call that Love to him <hi>Sincere,</hi> which
is not a Superlative Love, and able to
make you even hate all those things, that
would draw away your affections, and
obedience from him; <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26, 27.
There's no talk of serving God, and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and compounding you a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Earth. and Heaven. Do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as Christ bids you, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 28,
29, 30.</p>
               <p>Sit down, and <hi>count what it must cost
you, if you will be saved;</hi> and on what
rates it is, that you must follow Christ.
Can you voluntarily, for the love of him,
and the hope of Glory, take up your
Cross, and follow him in poverty, in
losses, in reproaches; though scornes,
and scourgings, and prisons and death?
Do you value his loving kindness better
then life, <hi>Psal. 63. 3?</hi> Can you deny
your eyes, and your appetites their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires?
Can you consent to be vile in the
eyes of men, and to tame your own flesh,
and keep it in subjection, and live a flesh-displeasing
life, that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:63001:160"/>
with Christ, you may also be <hi>glorified</hi>
with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. If you cannot
consent to these terms, you cannot be
Christians, nor you cannot be Saved. If
you <hi>must</hi> needs be rich, or <hi>must</hi> be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
yea, if you <hi>must</hi> needs save
your estates, or liberties, or lives, it's
past all question, you <hi>must</hi> needs let go
Christ, and Glory: If you <hi>must needs</hi>
have the world, you must needs lose
your Souls. If you <hi>must</hi> have your good
things here, you must not have them
hereafter too, but be tormented, when
Christ's sufferers are comforted, <hi>Luke 16.
25.</hi> These hopes of purveying for the
flesh, as long as they can; and then of
being saved, when they can stay here no
longer, is it that hath deceived many a
thousand, to their undoing. It's a strang
thing to see how the world doth blind ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
knowing men, and how unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
these Hypocrites are with their own
hearts. What a confident profession of
down-right godliness many of them will
make, yea of some extraordinary height
in Religion, when nothing is so dear to
to them, as their present prosperity,
and God hath not neer so much interest
in them as the flesh? What contrivances
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:63001:161"/>
some of them make for riches, or rising
in the world? And how tender others
are of their honour with men; and how
tenacious they are of their Mammon of
unrighteousness; and how much money,
and great men can do with them: And
most of them pamper their flesh, and
serve it in a cleanlier way of Religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
even as much, though not so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully,
and grossly, as drunkards,
and whoremongers do, in a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scernable
sensuality. If the times do but
change, and countenance any errour, how
smal an Argument will make their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
bend with the times: If truth or
duty must cost them deer: O how they
will shift, and stretch, and wriggle, to
prove Truth to be no Truth, and duty
to be no duty; and no Argument is
strong enough to satisfie them, when the
flesh doth but say, <hi>Its bitter, its dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous!
it may be my undoing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its none of my meaning, that any
should needlesly runne into suffering, or
cross their governours, and themselves,
through a spirit of pride, singularity,
and contradiction: But that men should
think themselves truly Religious, that
keep such reserves for their fleshly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:63001:161"/>
and shew by the very drift of their
lives, that they are worldlings, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
felt what it was to be crucified to the
world, and deny themselves, but are
Religious on this supposition only, that
it may stand with their worldly ends, or
at least not undo them in the world; this
is a lamentable hypocritical self-deceit.
When God hath so plainly said, <hi>Love not
the world, nor the things that are in the
world: If any man love the world, the Love
of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 15.
Nay that the neighbourhood, and all the
Country that know them, should ring of
the worldlyness of some, that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
good Christians; and yet they will
not see it themselves. What a cheating,
blinding thing is the world?</p>
               <p>Well Sirs; if you will be Christians,
count what it must cost you? And if
you will be Heirs of Heaven, away with
the world: Cast it out of your hearts:
and if your hands must yet trade in it,
yet trade not for it: Use it for God, but
enjoy it not for it self. Take your selves
as strangers here; and look on the world
as a desolate wilderness; through which,
in the Communion of the militant Saints,
you may safely travail on to Heaven; but
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:63001:162"/>
do not make it your home, nor take it
for the smallest part of your felicity. To
be Sanctified without Mortification, is
a palpable contradiction. Be at a point
with all things below, if you will groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly
hope for the Heavenly Inheritance.
But I shall purposely forbear to enlarge
this any further, because I have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and written a Treatise on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which I desire you to peruse.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="direction">
               <p>
                  <hi>DIRECT. VII My next Direction
is this:</hi> If you would be truly Converted,
be sure that you make an absolute resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your selves, and all that you have
to God.</p>
               <p>This is the very form, and life of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.
To be Sanctified, is to be
separated, in heart, life, and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from all other Masters, and Ends,
to God. When the heart that was set
upon the world, and flesh, is separated
from them, and inclined to God by the
power of Love, and devoted to him, to
serve and please him; this is indeed a
Sanctified Heart: And when the life that
before was spent in the service of Satan,
the world, and the flesh, is now taken
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:63001:162"/>
off them, and spent, as to the drift, and
course of it, in the Service of God, for
the Pleasing, and Glorifying of him,
from the impulse of Love; this is indeed
a <hi>Holy</hi> life. And herein consisteth the
very nature of our Sanctity. And when
a man doth but <hi>profess</hi> to renounce the
Devill, the world, and the flesh, and
to give up his heart, and life to God,
this is a <hi>Profession</hi> of Holiness. God is
both on the title of Creation, Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Redemption, or absolute
Lord or Owner, and we are not our
own but his! And therefore we must
<hi>give</hi> to God the <hi>things</hi> that are Gods,
and Glorifie him in our Souls, and bodies,
which are his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 19, 20. As we
are his Own, so he will have his Own,
and be served by his Own: Do not
imagine that you have any title to your
selves, or propriety in your selves; but
without any more adoe, make a full, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reserved,
absolute resignation of your
selves, of your understandings, and of
your wills, of your bodies, and of your
names, and of every penny-worth of
your estates, to God, from whom, and
for whom you have them. Think not
that you have power to dispose of your
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:63001:163"/>
selves, or of any thing that you have.
Ask not flesh and blood, what life you
shall lead, or what mind or will you
shall be of: But ask God, to whom
you do belong. Ask not your carnal
selves, what you shall do with any of
your estates, but ask God, and then
ask Conscience, which is the way that
God would have me use it in, that is,
which way may I use it to be most service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God? And that resolve upon.
No service that you do to God, will
prove you Sanctified, unless you have
heartily, and absolutely given up, and
devoted your selves to him; and he that
gives up himself, must needs give up all
that he hath with himself. For he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keep it for himself (ultimately) when
even himself is given up to God. Though
you be not bound to give all that you
have to the poore, nor all to the Church,
nor to deny your own bodies, or fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
their due supplies, yet must it <hi>all</hi> be
given up to God, even that which you
make use of for your selves, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:
For as you are given up to God
your selves, so you must feed your selves
as his, and cloath your selves, and
your families as his, to fit your selves,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:63001:163"/>
and them for his Service, and not as your
own, for the satisfying of your flesh.
Thus it is that all comes to be pure to the
pure, Sanctified to them that are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
first Sanctified: because when you
feed your selfe, you do but feed a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of God, that is Consecrated to him,
and separated from things common, and
unclean. And even as the Tythes, and
Offerings, that were given for the food,
and maintenance of the Priests, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
were called the <hi>Lords Portion,</hi> and
<hi>Holy to the Lord,</hi> because they were <hi>their</hi>
portion that were separated to his Altar;
Even so that which is necessary to fit you
for Gods Service, while you use it to that
very end, is <hi>Sanctified</hi> in <hi>your</hi> Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and is Holy to God; for all his
Saints are a Holy Nation, a Royal Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
to offer up acceptable sacrifice to
him. And thus, <hi>whether you eat, or
drink, or what ever you do, you must do
all to the Glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31. <hi>For
Of him, and Through him, and To him
are all things, and therefore to him must
be the Glory for ever,</hi> Rom. 11. 36.
God who is the End of your hearts, and
lives, must be the End of every action of
them, unless you will step out of the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:63001:164"/>
way of Order, and Safety, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
For every action that is not <hi>from</hi>
God, and <hi>by</hi> God, and <hi>for</hi> God, is
contrary to the nature of true Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If then you would be Christians
indeed, be heartily willing that God
should have his own. Understand what
an excellent honour, and priveledge,
and happiness it is to you to be his. If
his Right to you will not move you, let
your own necessity, and benefit at least
move you, to give up your selves, and
all you have to God. Bring you hearts
to the barre, and plead the Cause of God
with them, and convince them of Gods
title to them, and how sinfully they have
robbed him of his own all this while:
Have your daies and hours, your wealth
and interest, been used purposely for
God as his own! O what abundance
be there, that in word, and confident
profession, do give up themselves, and
all to God, and yet in the Use of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and all, do plainly shew that it's
no such matter; but they dissembled with
God, and yet never knew so much by
themselves. How little do they use for
God, when they have with seeming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
resigned all to him? If a Lord, or
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:63001:164"/>
Knight, or Gentleman, of 4000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>, or
3000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> a year, or 400<hi rend="sup">l</hi>, or 300<hi rend="sup">l</hi> a year,
were to shew the accomts of all his expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
how much of all this should you find
expended for God, when they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that all is his? One would
think by their lives, that they look to be
saved by robbing God, and confessing
the robbery; by saying that <hi>all</hi> is Gods,
while they allow him next to nothing.</p>
               <p>The devoted, resigned, Sanctified
Soul, hath the true principle of all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and that which will do much to
repel all temptations, and carry him
through the greatest straits and tryals.
If I am not my own, I need not be over
solicitous for my self, but may expect
that he that oweth me should care for me:
Nor do I need to use any sinfull shifts for
my own preservation. If I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of my own, what need I to sinne,
for the saving of any thing? What need
I to venture upon unwarrantable means,
to preserve either credit, or goods, or
life? It is <hi>Self,</hi> and <hi>Own,</hi> that are the
root of all sinne, the heart of the old
man, and the seed of Hell: Nothing else
is pleaded against God, and our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If the flesh would have you abuse
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:63001:165"/>
Gods Creatures, you must remember
they are not your <hi>own.</hi> If the Devil
would entice you to sinne against God,
either for the Geting, or Keeping of
any Creature, it would easily repel the
temptations, were you but rightly sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that nothing is your <hi>own:</hi> For
God hath no need that you should sinne,
to get <hi>Riches,</hi> or <hi>Honours,</hi> for <hi>him.</hi>
If you are called to let go your houses, or
lands, or friends, or lives, or to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
up you bodies, to the flames, did
you but rightly take them as none of your
own, how easy would it be. You can be
content that another man give his goods,
or life it self to God, when ever God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
it: but your <hi>own</hi> you cannot be
content to part with; and that because it is
your <hi>own,</hi> But if you had rightly resigned
all to God, and took not your selves, or
any thing for your <hi>own,</hi> but lookt upon
your selves, and all as Gods, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
works of obedience, or suffering,
would be much more easy to you; and
you would have little difficulty, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
in your way. Self denial is but
Sanctification it self; denominated from
the wrong End, and Principle, which
we forsake. And where self is denied,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:63001:165"/>
and dead, what is there left to draw us
from God, or stand up against him, in
any part of our lives. So much interest
as <hi>self</hi> hath in you, so much the world,
and the Devil hath in you. And nothing
is more proper to a miserable Hypocrite,
then deep Reserves of life, or worldly
things to themselves, while they seem to
give up all to God.</p>
               <p>O happy Soul, that is wrought to
this sincerity, by the Spirit of Grace!
to say unfeinedly, <hi>O Lord I devote, and
resign my self wholly unto thee! I am not
my own, nor desire any further to be, then
to be thine: I have nothing that is my own,
nor desire to have any thing that shall not be
thine.</hi> Happy and truly wise is that man,
that keeps as constant, and faithful a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
how he layes out himself, and
all that he hath for God, as a faithfull
Steward doth, of his receivings, and
layings out for his Masters use. Every
penny that is reserved from God, is the
fuell of sinne, and a Sacrifice to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and the flesh; and if it be pardoned
to the truly penitent, by the Sacrifice of
Christ, that's no thanks to us, that
would else have made it the fuel of Hell.
God is not so careless of us, or his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:63001:166"/>
but that he keeps an exact account
of all that we have from him, and will
require an account of our improvement
of all: Not only requiring his <hi>Own</hi>
againe, but his <hi>own</hi> with advantage,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 25 27. Why else did he give us
such leisure, and ability to improve it?
I can never forget what a sinfull thought
was once in my mind, which I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to confess, because it may possibly
be the case of others, that so they may
beware. I hearing of some that used to lay
by the tenth part of their yearly comings
in for charitable uses, I purposed to do
so too, and thought it a fair proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
But since I have perceived what a
vile and wicked thought that was, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to cut out a scantling for God, or
give him a limited share of his <hi>own,</hi> or
say that so much he shall have, and no
more. Though we cannot say that God
must have all in <hi>any one kind of service on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
either <hi>only for the Church,</hi> or <hi>only
for the poore,</hi> or <hi>only for publike uses;</hi> yet
must we resolve, that in <hi>one way or other</hi>
he must have <hi>all;</hi> and the particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
to the poore, or Church, or
other uses, must be assigned by truly
Sanctified prudence, considering which
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:63001:166"/>
way it may be most serviceable to God.
I must relieve my owne family, or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
if they want: but not because they
are <hi>my own,</hi> but because God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me, and so hath made it a part
of my obedience: But if I see where I
may do more service to God, by relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a stranger, and that God doth more
require it, I must yet preferre them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the kindred that I have in the
world. When the Christian pattern
was set us by the Primitive Church, <hi>Acts
2.</hi> and 4. They sold all, and laid down
the whole price at the Apostles feet,
which was not distributed to their natural
kindred only, but to all the poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
that had no other relation to them,
even as every one had need. And as it
is the loving of our Spiritual Brethren in
Christ, that is made the sign of our
translation from death to life, so is it the
relieving of Christ in these his Members,
that is, the relieving them, <hi>because</hi> they
are his Members, that is made the very
matter of our Cause in the last Judgment,
and the ground of the sentence of life, or
death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. I must provide for
my own body, and you must provide
for your children, but that is (as I said
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:63001:167"/>
before) not as I am my <hi>own,</hi> nor as
your children are your <hi>own;</hi> but as I am
a Servant of Christ, that must be suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his Service, or as your selves, and
yours, are put under your care, and
duty by God. So that I may give it to
my self, or others, when I can truly say,
I do but use it principally for God, and
think that the principal Service I can
do him by it: but I may neither take to
my self, nor give to any that are nearest
to me, any more then God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
or his Service doth require. When
you and yours have your <hi>daily bread,</hi>
(which also must be used for him) you
must not go to flesh and blood, but to
God, to ask which way you shall dispose
of the remainder. This is a strange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to the unsanctified world; but
that is because they are unsanctified. And
it is a Doctrine that a worldly Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
is loath to believe, and understand;
but that is because of Carnality, and
Hypocrisie, that alwaies deals with God,
like <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> lying to the
Holy Ghost, and giving God but halfe,
(and few so much as half) when they dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confess that all is from him, and should
be his, and pretend to be wholly devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:63001:167"/>
to him. There are few men so bad,
but will spare God something, rather
then go to Hell: But indeed this is not
to devote it to God, but to use it for
themselves, thinking by their Sacrifices, to
stop the mouth of Justice, and to please
God by a part, when they have displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him in the rest. I much fear (and not
without apparent cause) that abundance
among us, that think themselves Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
do worship, and serve God, but as
some <hi>Indians</hi> are said to offer sacrifice to
the Devil, not for any love they have to
him, or his service, but for fear he should
hurt them. And there are few Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porcites
but will pretend it is from very
love.</p>
               <p>O Sirs, it's a greater matter to resign,
and give up your selves, and all you have
to God, and heartily to quit all claim to
your selves, and all things, then many a
thousand self-deluding professours do
imagine. Many look at this, but as
some high extraordinary strein of Piety,
and the <hi>Papists</hi> almost appropriate it to a
few that live in Monastical orders, when
indeed the sincerity of this Resignation,
and Dedication, is the very sincerity of
Sanctification it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:63001:168"/>
And let me tell you, that the Unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Convert that attains to this, hath
not only pluckt up the Root of sinne,
(though all of us have too many strings
of it left) nor only stopt up the spring
of temptation, and got the surest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his uprightness, but also is got
himself into the safest, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
state. For when he hath abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ulutely
resigned himself, and all to God,
how confidently may he expect that God
should accept him, and use him as his

himself, and his cause, and all good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
to God, as knowing that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be negligent, and careless of his <hi>own.</hi>
It's an Argument that may make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of success, when we can say as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Psal. 119. 94. I am thine, save me.</hi>
Isa. 63. 19. Even Christ himself doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate
his Elect with the Father on this
account, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h. 17. 6, 9, 10. Thine they
were, and thou gavest them me: I pray
for them: I pray not for the world, but
for them which thou hast given me; for
they are thine: and all mine are thine,
and thine are mine, and I am glorified in
them.</hi> And indeed by resigning all to
God, it is the more our <hi>own;</hi> that is, we
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:63001:168"/>
have unspeakably more of the benefit of
it, and so there is no way to make it our
<hi>own,</hi> but by quitting it absolutely up to
God: This is the mistery that the world
will not learn, but God will teach it all
that shall be saved by the Spirit, and by
Faith, <hi>Matth. 16. 24, 25, 26. Then
Jesus said to his Disciples, If any man
will come after me, let him deny himself,
and take up his Cross, and follow me:
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it,
and whosoever will lose his life for my sake
shall find it.</hi> Me thinks a man that hath time,
and strength, and money, should long to
be disbursing all for God, that he might
put it in the surest hands, and it may be
out of danger; yea that it may be set to
the most honest, and profitable usery.
For when God hath it, from the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of an upright heart, it is sure:
but till God have it, is in hazzard; and
all that <hi>he</hi> hath not is lost, and worse
then lost. When it is in our hands,
thieves may steal it, bad Servants, or
unadvised Children may consume it, and
our own thievish flesh may steale it worst
of all, and consume it on our lusts; or
if <hi>our</hi> Children consume it not, <hi>their</hi>
Children may: Or if they save it, they
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:63001:169"/>
may lose it most of all, by feeding their
pride, and fleshly minds by it: But if
once it be in Gods hands, it is safe. You
can make no comfortable account of one
penny, nor of one hours time, unless
you can tell God that he had it himself;
that you used it for him: Or that you
live to him in the <hi>maine,</hi> and that the
rest is pardoned. O that those Parents
understood this Doctrine, that had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
strenghten the fetters, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Children with it, and help
them into that state which few are saved
in, then to devote and use their estates
for God. Though Christ hath told them
how hardly the Rich are saved, and how
few such come to Heaven, yet what care
is taken to leave their Children rich; and
how little to further the Work of God,
or their own accounts, that they may
hear the <hi>Well done, good and faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:
thou hast been faithfull over a few
things: I will make thee Ruler over many
things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>
Matth. 25. 21, 23.</p>
               <p>O Sirs, if you would be good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
and provident indeed for your
Souls, see that your hearts prove not
false to you in this, and make no secret
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:63001:169"/>
reserves for your selves, but that God
have your selves first, and all things
with your selves; as Christ first gives
himself to you, and all things with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. Never think your
hearts right, but when they can readily
say, <hi>We are not our own,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19.
Think not that you come aright to God
in any duty, if you do not heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
<hi>your selves</hi> to him, and intreat him
to accept you, as wholly his, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are, nor desire to be your own:
and intreat him accordingly to use you
for himself. Say not that any thing is
your <hi>Own</hi> that you possess, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 32.
In respect to <hi>God, and a Communion of
Charity,</hi> though it be your <hi>owne</hi> (as a
Talent that God doth intrust you with)
in respect of <hi>men,</hi> by <hi>a Legal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then trust God boldly, for you
are his <hi>Owne:</hi> Serve him cheerfully, and
draw neere him believingly; for you are
his <hi>Own.</hi> In poverty, sickness, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and the approach of death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in him confidently, for you are his
<hi>Own.</hi> Into his hands commend your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
Spirits; for they are his <hi>Own.</hi>
What reason of distrustfull feares can you
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:63001:170"/>
now have? Do you fear lest God will
yet hate you? why remember that <hi>no
man ever yet hated his own flesh,</hi> Ephes. 5.
29. Nay, for shame, think not the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God to be worse then the wicked
world: and Christ faith of the world,
<hi>Joh, 15. 19 If ye were of the world,</hi> the
<hi>world would love his own.</hi> And will not
God then Love his <hi>Own</hi> do you think?
And if you are willing to be his <hi>Own,</hi>
Christ is certainly willing that you <hi>should</hi>
be his <hi>Own;</hi> and will <hi>Own</hi> all that <hi>Own</hi>
not themselves, but <hi>him. He calleth his
Own sheep by name, and leadeth them out;
and when he putteth forth his Own sheep he
goeth before them, and the sheep follow him:
for they know his voice,</hi> Joh. 10. 3. 4.
<hi>And</hi> Joh. 13. 1. <hi>Having loved his Own
which are in the world, to the End he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you are but truly willing to be his
<hi>Own</hi> People, he is certainly willing to be
your <hi>Own</hi> Saviour and your <hi>Own</hi> God,
Not that you can have such a propriety in
him, as he hath in you. But in these
<hi>Relations</hi> he will be your <hi>Own;</hi> and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and Help, and Salvation shall be
yours. And you may well conclude
that <hi>God, even our Own God, shall bless
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:63001:170"/>
us,</hi> Psal. 6. 7, 6. There is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
may be fetcht from that in <hi>Luke 15.
31.</hi> Though Parables must not be strecht
too far: <hi>Sonne thou art ever with me, and
all that I have is thine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon this ground it is, that we
have the greater encouragement, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that God accepteth of our very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
themselves; because it is his Will
that they should be <hi>Devoted, engaged,
and dedicated</hi> to him: And that which he
would have us dedicate and offer to him,
he will surely accept in that Relation to
which he would have it offered.</p>
               <p>I beseech you therefore Remember
what it is to be truly Converted: It is to
be called from things common, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
and separated to God: It is to
be brought nigh to him, as the Children
of his Houshould, that are themselves,
and all that they have in his hands: It is
to be taken off your <hi>Selves,</hi> and your
<hi>Own,</hi> and to lose your selves, and all
you have in God, by the most gainfull
loss, lest indeed you lose your selves, and
all, while you perswade your selves you
<hi>save,</hi> or <hi>gain.</hi> It is a taking God in
Christ for your <hi>All,</hi> and so being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to have Nothing but him, and for
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:63001:171"/>
him. It is a changing of your old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>self,</hi> for <hi>God</hi> a better Master: and
your old work, which was <hi>self-seeking,</hi>
and <hi>self-pleasing,</hi> to <hi>self-denial,</hi> and to
the seeking, and pleasing of God. See
now that this be done, and that your
treacherous hearts hide nothing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as <hi>Rachel</hi> under pretence of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
hid her Idols, but say, <hi>Here I
am, to be thine, O Lord, and to do thy
Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More I would have said on this point,
but that I have written of it already, in a
Sermon on 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6. 19, 20. Of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Dominion of Christ, and our self-resignation;
which I desire you here to
peruse, to set this further home.</p>

            <div n="8" type="direction">
               <p>
                  <hi>DIRECT. VIII. My next Advice
that the Work of Conversion may not
miscarry, is this:</hi> Take heed, lest you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
a meer change of your Opinions, and
outward profession, and behaviour, for a
true Saving change.</p>
               <p>Wicked Opinions must be changed,
and so must evil professions, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
practices: But if no more be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
you are wicked still. I have great
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:63001:171"/>
cause to feare that this is the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
damning decit, that useth to befall
professors of Godliness, and that it's
the case of most Hypocrites, in the
Church. A man may be brought to hold
any Truth in Scripture as an Opinion;
and so far be sound, and Orthodox; and
yet never be indeed a sound Believer, nor
have his Heart possessed with the life and
power of those Sacred Truths. It's one
thing to have a mans Opinion changed,
and another thing to have his Heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
by the change of his Practical
Estimation, Resolutions, and Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.
It's one thing to turn from loose
prophane Opinions, to strict Opinions;
and to think the Godly are indeed in the
right, and that their case and way is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
and best: and it's another thing to
be made <hi>One</hi> of them in Newness, and
Spirituality of heart, and life. A lively
Faith differs much from Opinion; and
that which is in unsanctified men, which
we call <hi>Faith,</hi> and is a kind of Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
it is but a meer Opinionative Faith:
I call it an <hi>Opinionative Faith,</hi> because it
differs from Saving Faith, much like as
<hi>Opinion</hi> doth from <hi>Knowledg.</hi> Meerly
speculative it is not: for some intention
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:63001:172"/>
of practice there is: But the Practical
Intention of such persons, differs from
the Predominant Intentions of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
even as their <hi>Opiniative Faith</hi>
differs from the Saving Faith.</p>
               <p>And it is no wonder if there be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of these Opiniative believers in the
world: For the Truths of God have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great Evidence, especially some of
them; and men are yet men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
reasonable Creatures; and
therefore have some aptitude to discern
the Evidence of Truth: Some Truths
will compel Assent even from the unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
Many a thousand ungodly men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that to be True, which they would
not have to be True, if they could helpe
it; because they do not heartily take it
to be Good in respect to themselves.
Truth as Truth, is the Natural Object
of the Understanding; though the same
Truth as seeming Evill to them; may be
hated by them that are forced to Assent
to it. I know that sinne hath much
blinded mens Understandings, and that
the natural man, Receiveth not the things
of the Spirit, because they are foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to him, and must <hi>be</hi> spiritually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. But though he
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:63001:172"/>
cannot <hi>Savingly</hi> receive them without
the <hi>Special</hi> illumination of the Spirit, nor
<hi>Opinionatively</hi> receive them without a
<hi>common</hi> illumination of the Spirit, yet he
may have this Opinionative conviction,
and an answerable reformation, by the
common Grace of the Spirit, without
the Special Grace. An unsanctified man
may have something more then Nature
in him: And every unregenerate man, is
not <hi>meerly,</hi> or <hi>only</hi> Natural. Many are
farre convinced, that are farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Savingly Converted. I can make you
know that you shall die, that you must
part with all your wealth, and fleshly
pleasures, and divers such Truths, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you will or not. And one of these
Truths doth let in many more, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon them. So that as dark as the
minds of natural men are, they yet lie
open to many wholsom Truths.</p>
               <p>And as the Understanding is thus farre
open to Conviction, so the Will it self,
which is the Heart of the old man, will
farre sooner yield to the changing of
your <hi>Opinions</hi> then to the saving chang of
Heart, and life. It is not the bare <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
that your fleshly interest doth fight
against, but the Power, and Practice of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:63001:173"/>
Godliness is it; and <hi>Opinions</hi> as they lead
to these. It's one thing to be of <hi>Opinion,</hi>
that Conversion is necessary, that sinne
<hi>must</hi> be forsaken, and God preferred
before all the world: And its another
thing to be <hi>indeed Converted,</hi> and to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake</hi>
sinne, and to <hi>prefer</hi> God before the
world. It's a farre easier matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
a worldling that he <hi>shold not</hi> love
the world, then to cure him of his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love: aud to convince a drunkard that
he should leave his drunkenness, and the
whoremonger, that he should abhorre
his lusts, then to bring them to do these
things, which they are convinced of.
It will cost them deer (as the flesh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
it) to deny themselves, and cast
away the sinne: but it costeth not so deer
to take up the <hi>Opinion</hi> that these things
<hi>should</hi> be done. It will cost them deer to
be downright for God, and practically
Religious: but they can take up an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that Godliness is the best, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
course, at a cheaper rate. Strict
<hi>Practices</hi> pinch the flesh, but strict <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
may stand with its <hi>liberty.</hi> O what
abundance of our poore neighbours
would go to Heaven, that are now in the
way to Hell, if an Opinion that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:63001:173"/>
is the wisest course, would serve
the turn. If instead of Conversion God
would take up with an <hi>Opinion</hi> that they
ought to <hi>turn;</hi> and if instead of a Holy,
Heavenly life, God would accept of an
<hi>Opinion</hi> that such are the happiest men,
that live such a life; and if instead of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
and meekness, and self-denial,
and forgiving wrongs, God would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of an <hi>Opinion,</hi> and Confession, that
they should be temperate, and meeke,
and self-denying, and should forbear
others, and forgive them; then O what
abundance would be saved, that are now
in little hope of Salvation! If instead of
a diligent life of Holiness, and good
works, it would serve turn to lie still,
and be of a good <hi>Opinion,</hi> that men should
strive, and labour for Salvation, and
lay out all they have for God, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
then were our Towns, and Countries,
in comparison of what they are.</p>
               <p>I am afraid this deceit will be the undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of many, that they take a change of
their <hi>Opinions</hi> for a true Conversion.
Have not some of you been formerly of
the mind, that the best way is to eate,
and drink, and be merry, and venture
your Souls, and follow your worldly
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:63001:174"/>
business, and never trouble your selves
with any deep, and searching thoughts
about your Spiritual state, or your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?
Have you not thought that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
godliness, is but a needless strictness,
and precisness: and have you not since been
Convinced of your errour, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that this is the wisest course, which
you before thought to be needless, and
thereupon have betaken you to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the goldy, and set upon a course
of outward duties; and now you think
that you are made New Creatures, and
that <hi>this</hi> is Regeneration, and the work
is done? I fear lest this be all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
that many forward professours
are acquainted with! But wo to them
that have no more.</p>
               <p>And because the face of our present
times, doth plainly shew the commonness,
and prevalency of this disease, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a matter of so great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to you, I shall here give you (but
as briefly as I well can) some signes by
which a true Conversion may be known
from this meer Opinionative Change.</p>
               <p>1. The true Convert is brought to an
unfeigned Hatred of the whole Body of
sinne; and especially of those secret, or
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:63001:174"/>
beloved sinnes, that did most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
captivate him before, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11.
Tit. 3. 3, 5. Col.</hi> 3. 3, 5, 7, 8. But the
<hi>Opinionative</hi> Convert is still <hi>Carnall,</hi> and
unmortified, and inwardly at the heart,
the interest of the flesh is habitually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant.
He is not brought to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable
hatred to the great master
sinnes that ruled him, and lay deepest;
but only hath eased the top of his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
and cropt off some of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
of the tree of death. The thornes
of worldly desires, and cares, are still
rooted in his heart; and therefore no
wonder if they choak the seed of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Truth, and there be a greater <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest</hi>
for the Devil then for God, <hi>Gal. 5.
24.</hi> chap. 16. 19. &amp; 6. 4, 8. <hi>Rom. 8. 5.
Matth.</hi> 13. 22.</p>
               <p>2. Another sign that follows upon
this, is, that the sound Convert doth
carry on the course of his Obedience, in
a way of self-denial, as living in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
conflict with his own flesh, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
his comfort, and Salvation to
come in upon the conquest: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can <hi>suffer</hi> for Christ, as well as
be found in cheaper obedience, and he
dare not ordinarily refuse the most costly
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:63001:175"/>
service. For the spoiles of his fleshly
desires are his pray, and Crown of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
in the Lord, <hi>Luke 14. 27, 33.
Gal. 5. 17, 24. 1 Cor. 9. 27. Luke 9.
23, 24. 2 Cor. 12. 9. Gal.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Opinionative</hi> Convert still li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to his carnal-self: and therefore se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
at least, seeks himself, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
hold on present things, as the true
Convert layeth hold on Eternal Life. The
Truths of God being received but into
his <hi>Opinion,</hi> do not go deep enough to
conquer self, and to take down his great
Idol, nor make him go through fire,
and water, and to serve God with the
best, and honour him with his substance,
much less with his sufferings, and death:
He hath something that he cannot spare
for God, <hi>Matth. 13. 21. Luke</hi> 18.
22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>3. The Sound Convert hath taken
God for his Portion, and Heaven for
that sure and full felicity, which he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to venture upon: That's it that he
hath set his heart, and hopes upon, and
thither tends the drift of his life, <hi>Col. 3.
1, 2, 3, 4. Matth.</hi> 6. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>But he that is changed only in his <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>
had never such sure apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:63001:175"/>
of the life to come: nor so full a
confidence in the Promises of God, as to
set his heart unfeignedly upon God, and
make him truly Heavenly-minded. He
may have a Heavenly tongue, but he
hath an Earthly heart. A bare <hi>Opinion,</hi>
be it never so true, will not raise mens
hearts so high, as to make their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the very design, and business
of their lives to be Heavenly, <hi>Phil. 3.
18, 19, 20. Rom. 16, 17, 18. Rom.</hi>
8. 5.</p>
               <p>4. The Sound Convert hath seen the
vileness of himself, in the sinfullness of
his heart, and life, and the misery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
deserved; and so is a sincerly humbled,
self-accusing man.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Opinionist</hi> is commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled,
and well conceited of himself,
and a self-justifying Pharisee; unless it be
that self-accusing will cost him no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
and he take it up as a custom, or
that which may bring him into the repute
of being humbled, and sincere. For his
<hi>Opinion</hi> will not search, and pierce his
heart, nor batter down his self-exalting
thoughts, nor root up the master sinne
of Pride. These are too great works for
an <hi>Opinion</hi> to perform. And therefore
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:63001:176"/>
you shall hear him more in the excusing
of his sinne, the magnifying of himself,
or the stiff maintaining of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
then in unfeigned self-abasing,
<hi>Rom. 12. 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 19, 20. &amp; 3. 18.
2 <hi>Cor, 10. 12. Luke</hi> 16. 15.</p>
               <p>5. The Sound Convert is so acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the defects, and sinnes, and
necessities of his own Soul, that he is
much taken up at home, in his studies,
and cares, and censures, and his daily
worke: The acting, and strengthening
of Grace, the subduing of corruption,
and his daily walk with God, are much
of his employment: Above all keeping,
he keeps his Heart, as knowing that
thence are the issues of life. He cannot
have while to spy out the faults of others,
and meddle with their affaires, where
duty binds him not, as others can do;
because he hath so much to do at home,
<hi>Gal. 6. 3, 4. Prov</hi> 4. 23.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Opinionist</hi> is most employed
abroad, and about meer notions, and
<hi>Opinions,</hi> but he is little employed in
such heart-searching, or heart-obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
work. His light doth not pierce so
deep as to shew him his heart, and the
work that is there to be necessarily done.

As the change is little upon his Heart, so
his employment is little there. He is little
in bewailing his secret defects, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions;
and little in keeping his Souls
accounts; and little in secret striving
with his heart, to work it into commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God, and into a Spiritual lively
fruitfull frame. He is forward to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the sinnes of others, and oft-times
severe enough in censuring them: But he
is a very gentle censurer of himself, and
a patient man with his own corruptions,
and puts the best construction upon all
that is his own. He hath much labour
perhaps in shaping his <hi>Opinions;</hi> but little
for the humbling, and Sanctifying his
heart, by the power of the Truth.</p>
               <p>6. And as the difference lyeth thus
constantly in the <hi>Heart,</hi> so it is usually
manifested by the tongue, <hi>Matth. 12.
34.</hi> The Sound Convert is most desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to discourse of those great, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
truths, which his very heart hath
taken in, and which he hath found to be
the seed of God, for his Regeneration,
and the Instruments of that Holy, and
happy change, that is made upon him:
He feeleth most savour, and life in these
great, and most Necessary points, which
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:63001:177"/>
formed the Image of God upon him: and
upon these he daily feeds and lives. Read
<hi>Joh. 17. 3. 1 Cor. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
1 Cor. 2. 2. Phil. 3. 8, 9, 10, 11. 1 Tim.
3. 16. Acts</hi> 26. 22, 23. In these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
you may find what points they
were that the greatest Saints did study,
and live upon.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Opinionist</hi> is most forward to
discourse of meer <hi>Opinions;</hi> and to feed
upon the aire of notions, and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of lesser moment. For one hours
Holy, Heavenly, experimental, heart-searching
discourse, that you shall have
from him, you shall have many, and
many hours discourse of his <hi>Opinions.</hi> I
mean it indifferently of all his <hi>Opinions,</hi>
whether true or false. For though fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
cannot be fit food for the Soul,
yet Truths themselves, also may be made
of little service to them. A man may be
a meer Opinionist, that hath <hi>true</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
as well as he that hath false. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the free and zealous discourse of
these men, on matters of Religion, is
about their several sides, and parties,
and Opinions: If they be set upon a
point, especially wherein they seem to
themselves, to be wiser then others, they
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:63001:177"/>
have a fire of zeale for it in their brests,
that makes them desirous to be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
it to others. About the Orders,
and Ceremonies of the Church; about
the formes of Prayer, and the accidents
of worship; about Infant Baptism, or
other such controversies in Religion, is
the freest of their discourse.</p>
               <p>Yea, you may perceive much of the
difference even in the very manner of
their conference. A Serious Christian,
even when he is necessitated to speak of
lower controverted points, yet doth it
in a Spiritual manner, as one that more
savoureth higher Truths, and makes a
Holy, and Heavenly life his end, even
in these lower matters; and deals about
such controversies in a practical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and in order to the growth of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Opinionists,</hi> even when they
speak of the most <hi>weighty Truths,</hi> do
speak of them but as <hi>Opinions;</hi> and when
they discourse of God, of Christ, of
Grace, of Heaven, it is but as they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of a point in Philosophy, or little
better. They go not through the shell to
the kernel: they look after the <hi>Truth,</hi> but
they have but little relish of the <hi>Goodness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:63001:178"/>
The like may be said of their reading,
and hearing of Sermons. The sound
Convert feeleth life, spirits in that which
is little savory to the <hi>Opinionist.</hi> It is
one thing in a Sermon, or Text that is
pleasant to a true Christian, and another
thing usually that is most pleasant to the
Opinionist. The true Christian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
in, and feedeth on the inward
life of Spiritual Doctrine, and the Good
which they offer him; that is, indeed, it
is upon God, and Christ himself, that
he is feasting his Soul in reading, and
hearing: For this is the Soul of all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, letters, and words are but a
carcass. But the superficial Opinionist
is much more taken up, either with the
History, or the Elegancy of Speech, or
with the rational light of the discourse, still
sticking in the bark, and savouring not
Christ, and the Father in all. As a man that
reads the deeds, or lease of his own
Lands, delights in one thing; and a cleark
that reads the <hi>same,</hi> or the like in a book
of Presidents, for his learning, delights
in another thing. So is it in this case.</p>
               <p>7. And hence is follows, that they are
several sorts of duties, and exercises,
usually that these several sorts of persons
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:63001:178"/>
are most addicted to. The sound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
is most addicted to those Spiritual
means, that tend most to the strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Faith, and warming his heart
with the Love of God, and promoting
Holiness, and destroying sinne. But
the <hi>Opinionist</hi> delighteth most in those
means that tend to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rnish him with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
Knowledg, and discourse, and
to satisfie his fansie, or curious mind.
The sound Convert is much addicted to
Prayer, even in secret, and to Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Meditations, and gracious disourse.
But the <hi>Opinionist</hi> is much more addicted
to reading Histories, or Controversies,
or dogmatical Divinity, or Civil, and
Political matters. The sound Convert
savoureth best those Preachers, and
Books, that speak the most weighty, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Truths, in the most weighty,
Spiritual manner, in Power, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of the Spirit: But the <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionist</hi>
relisheth those Preachers, and
Books most, that either speak curiously
to please the eare, or exactly, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
to please the natural intellect, or that
speak for the <hi>Opinions,</hi> or partly that he
is addicted to: But others, he hath less
mind of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:63001:179"/>
8. Moreover the sound Christian lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out most of his <hi>Zeal, Affections,</hi> and
<hi>Endeavours,</hi> about the great Essentials
of Religion, and that as I said in a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
manner. But the <hi>Opinionist</hi> layeth
out his Zeale upon <hi>Opinions;</hi> Right or
wrong, it is but as <hi>Opinions:</hi> Of these
he makes his Religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: For these he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth:
He loveth those best, that are
of his own <hi>Opinion,</hi> though there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the special Image of God upon
his Soul, Or if he love a true Christian,
it is not so much for his Holiness, and
Spirituality, as because he is of his mind
in those matters of <hi>Opinion.</hi> Hence it is
that he is usually a bitter censurer of those
that are not of his <hi>Opinion,</hi> how upright
soever they may be: His very esteeme of
men, and love to them is partial, and
factious, to those that are of his Mind,
and Sect: A <hi>Papist</hi> will esteem, and love
men of the Popish Sect, and an <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi>
will esteem, and love men of that
Sect most, yea a <hi>Protestant,</hi> if he be an
<hi>Opinionist;</hi> doth esteem of men, and love
them as a Sect: Whereas the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
as he is truly Catholick, and of the
Catholick Church, which is not confined
to <hi>Papists,</hi> no nor <hi>Protestants,</hi> so he
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:63001:179"/>
hath truly Catholik affections, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
a Christian, as a Christian, a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, as Godly; yea if he saw more
serious Godliness in one that is not of his
<hi>Opinion</hi> in lesser things, yet would he
love him more then one that is in such
matters of his <hi>Opinion,</hi> that is ungodly,
or of more doubtfull Piety. For as it is
God in Christ that he principally lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
so it is Christ that he admireth in
his Members; and so much of Christ as
he sees in any, so much are his special af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
towards them.</p>
               <p>9. Ordinarily the meer <hi>Opinionist</hi> will
Sacrifice the very Ends of the Gospel, and
the honour, and success of the great fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Truths of God, to the interest
of those <hi>Opinions,</hi> which he hath in a
singular manner to his <hi>Own.</hi> He will
rather hinder the propagation of the
common Truths, and the Conversion of
the ignorant, then he will silence his <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>
or suffer them to lose any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
with the world. Hence it is that
we cannot prevaile with the <hi>Papists,</hi> to
silence a while the differences between us,
and them, till we have taught their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
(in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other barbarous
parts) the knowledg of those Truths
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:63001:180"/>
that all are agreed in. Nor can we get
many <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> or any such Sect,
that is engaged in a division, to forbear
their <hi>Opinions,</hi> till we have endeavoured
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o lay the necessary grounds, on which
all must build, that will be saved. But
though it be apparent to the world, that
their disputes, and contentions do excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
harden the ignorant, and ungodly
against all Religion, and hinder their
Conversion, and Salvation, yet will they
go on in the unseasonable, intemperate,
bruting of their conceits, and will not be
perswaded to agree on those terms, for
the managing of differences, as most tend
to secure the interest of Christ, and his
Gospel in the maine. If an <hi>Opinionist</hi> be
for the <hi>Truth,</hi> he is usually without much
zeale for it, because that Nature doth not
befriend the great Spirituall Truths of the
Gospel, so much as it doth errours, and
private conceits. But if he be of Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<hi>Opinions,</hi> he is usually very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for them: For Corrupted Nature,
and Self, and Satan, (and the world
oft-times) do more befriend these, and
furnish him with a Zeale for them, and
blow the coale. The counterfeit Angel
of Light, is very ordinarily also a spirit
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:63001:180"/>
of heat, and great activity: not a revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fire, nor a refining fire, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
fire, devouring Christian Love,
and meekness, and patience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Church, and Truth of God, so
far as it: can prevail. For lesser matters,
that minister Questions, such men can
say by that which tends to Godly Edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 4. Yea that
<hi>Charity,</hi> which is the very End of the
Commandement, out of a <hi>pnre Heart, a
good Conscience,</hi> and <hi>Faith unfeigned,</hi>
vers. 5. <hi>From these they swerve, and
turn aside to vain jangling: oft times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to be Teachers of such thigs, in
which they understand not what they say,
nor whereof they speak,</hi> vers. 6, 7. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
not to the wholsome Words of Christ,
and the Doctrine which is according to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
they teach otherwise, being proud,
knowing nothing, but doting about questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and strife of words, whereof cometh
envy, strife, railings, evill surmisings,
perverse disputing of men of corrupt minds,
and destitute of the Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 3, 4,
5. Yea they sometime take their <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>
or their worldly gain that they
often ayme at, to be instead of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
And think, that to be Godly, is to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:63001:181"/>
                  <hi>he of their mind, and way. They</hi> use
to strive about words to no profit, but to
the subverting of the hearers, and their
vain bablings increase to more ungodliness,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14, 16.</p>
               <p>But the True Convert looks principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the main: He loves every known
Truth of God; but in their Order, and
accordingly to their worth and weight:
He will not for his own <hi>Opinions,</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
do that which shall hazard the main,
or hinder the Gospel, and the saving of
mens Souls. Though he will not be false
to any Truth, yet he will avoid <hi>foolish, and
unlearned questions, knowing that they do
gender strife; and the Servant of the Lord
must not strive, but be gentle to all men,
and meekly instruct opposers; following
Righteousness, Faith, Charity, Peace
with them that call on the Lord out of a
pure heart,</hi> Tim. 2. 22, 23, 24, 25.</p>
               <p>10. Lastly, True Converts are sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,
but Opinionists are usually mutable,
and unconstant. The sound Convert re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
the greatest Truths, and receives
the Goodness as well as the Truth; and
takes it not only into the Head, but into
the Heart, and giveth it deep rooting:
He closeth with God as his only felicity,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:63001:181"/>
and with Christ as his only Refuge, and
Redeemer, and with Heaven as the sure
everlasting Glory, to which the world
is but a mole-hill, or a dungeon. No
wonder then if this <hi>man be stedfast, and
unmovable, alwaies abounding in the
Work of the Lord, that knows his Labour
is not in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor.
15. 58.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Opinionist,</hi> either fasteneth on
smaller matters, or else holdeth these
great matters but as bare <hi>Opinions,</hi> and
therefore they have no such interest in his
heart, as to stablish him against shaking
tryals, and temptations: For two sort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
there are of these <hi>Opinionists:</hi> the on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
sort have no Zeal for their own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
because they are <hi>but</hi> Opinions: And
these are time-servers; and will change
as the King, or their Land-lords change;
and fit their Opinions to their worldly
Ends. The other sort have a burning
Zeale for their Opinions; and these use
to wander from one Opinion to another,
not able to resist the, subtilty of seducers;
but are taken with fair, and plausible
reasonings; not able to see into the heart
of the cause. These are as Children t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to and fro, and carried about with
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:63001:182"/>
every wind of Doctrine, by the slight,
and cunning craftiness of men, whereby
they lie in weight to deceive <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14.
When with great confidence they have
held one sort of Opinions a while, and
railed against those that were not of their
mind, ere long they will themselves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
them, and take up another way,
and be as consident in that, and take no
warning by the experience of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
deceit. And thus they go oft from
one <hi>Opinion</hi> to another, till at last fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselves deceived so oft, some
of them cast off all Religion, and think
there is no certainty to be found in any:
Suspecting Religion, when they should
have suspected their false hearts: And
all this comes to pass because they never
received the Truth in the love of it, that
they might be Sanctified, and Saved by
it, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. Nor ever
gave it deep entertainment in their hearts,
that it might throughly Convert them;
but took it as a bare Opinion into the
brain to polish their tongues, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
and deceive themselves as much as
others.</p>
               <p>And thus I have shewed you the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between a sound Convert, and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:63001:182"/>
an Opinionist, or one that hath but a
overly superficial Change, that you may
see which of these is your own condition.</p>
               <p>To return now to my Advice, and
Exhortation, I intreat every person, that
readeth, or heareth these words, to see
that they stick not in an Opinionative
Conversion. To which End I further
desire you 1. To consider that it is a
higher matter, that Christ came into the
world for, then to change mens bare
Opinions; and it is a higher matter that
the Gospel is intended for, and that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
are sent to you for: For it is more
then a corruption of mens <hi>Opinions,</hi> that
siane hath brought upon you; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a deeper disease that must be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
The Work of Christ by his Gospel,
is no less, then to fetch you off all that
which flesh and blood accounts your
Happiness, and to unite you to himself,
and make you Holy, as God is Holy,
and to give you a new Nature, and make
you as the dwellers, or Citizens of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
while you walk on Earth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.
20, 21. And these are greater matters
then the changing of a Party, or Opinion.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:63001:183"/>
The Holy Ghost himself must dwell in
you, and work in you, and imploy
your Soul, and life for God, that you
may study him, and love him, and live
to him here, and live with him for ever.
Do but think well of the Ends, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Gospel, and how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
matters it drives at, and then you
will see that there's no taking up with an
Opinionative Religiousness.</p>
               <p>2. Keep company, if it be possible
with the most Sober, Spiritual, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
professours, that will be drawing
you to the observation of your own
heart, and life, and opening to you the
riches of the Love of Christ, and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
up your affections to God, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
And be not the companions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced
wranglers, that have no
other Religion, but a Zeal for their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and will endeavour rather to
make you like Satan, then like God, by
possessing your minds with malice, and
bitter thoughts of your brethren, and
employing your tongues in reproaches,
and vaine strivings, and making you
fire-brands in the places where you live:
Neither be companions of them that hold
the Truth no deeper then Opinion: For
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:63001:183"/>
though some such may be usefull to you
in their places, yet if you have not more
edifying familiars, your danger will be
very great, lest you should let go the
life of Religion, and take up with meer
notions, and formalities as they.</p>
               <p>3. When you have considered, that
every Truth of God is a Message to your
Hearts, as well as to your Heads, and
hath a work of God to do upon them,
look after that work; and when you have
heard, or read a Truth, go down into
your Hearts, and see what it hath done
there: And if you find not in your Will,
and Resolutions, and Affections, the
Image, and fruits of the Truth you have
heard, fetch it up again, and ruminate
upon it, and do not think you have
received it, or done with it, till this be
done; yea take it but as lost, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
rejected, if it have not done you
some good at the very Heart.</p>
               <p>4. Also be sure that you Practise all
practical Truths, upon the first oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
as soon as you have heard them.
Imprison them not in unrighteousness.
Cast them not out in forgetfulness; use
not a Lecture of Divinity as if it were a
lesson of Musick, or a meer Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:63001:184"/>
or Historical discourse. Read not
the Doctrine of Salvation, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Heaven, and the forewarnings
of everlasting misery, as you read a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
story, or a groundless conjecture
in an Almanack: But as a Message from
God, which tells you where you must
dwell for ever, and as a Direction sent
from Heaven to teach you the way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Fall to work then, and practise
what you know, if you would be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
indeed. <hi>Be yee doers of the word, and
not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</hi>
For the Opinionative hearer, seeth but a
slight appearance of the Truth, as a man
that <hi>lookes</hi> on his face in a glass, which he
quickly <hi>forgets:</hi> But he that is a Sound
Believer, and practiser, and not only
an Opinionative <hi>forgetful</hi> hearer, is <hi>the</hi>
man that shall be blessed in <hi>his</hi> deed,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 22, 23, 24, 25. Opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Practise, is building on the <hi>Sand;</hi> but
hearing, and sound Believing, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is building upon the <hi>Rock,</hi> where
the building will stand after all assaults.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 26, 27, 28. An Opinionist
doth but seem to be <hi>Religious,</hi> while he
keeps his reigning sinnes, and therefore
his <hi>Religion</hi> is in vain: but the Practical
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:63001:184"/>
                  <hi>Religion,</hi> is the pure, and undefiled <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
Jam. 1. 26, 27. Hearty obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will not only <hi>shew</hi> that your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is deeper then meer <hi>Opinion,</hi> but it
will also advance it to a greater purity,
and root it more deeply then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
A man that hath studied the Art
of Navigation in his closet, may talk of
it, almost as well as he that hath been at
sea; but when he comes to practise it, he
will find that he is far to seek: But let
this man go to sea, and joyn practise,
and experience to his Theory, and then
he may have a knowledg of the right
kind. So if a man that hath only read
over Military Books, would be a true
Soldier, or a man that hath only stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
Physick, would be a true Physician,
what better way is there, then to fall to
Practise. And so must you, if you
would have a Religion that shall save
your Souls; and not only a Religion that
will furnish you with good <hi>Opinions,</hi> and
expressions.</p>
               <p>5. Moreover, if you would get above
Opinion, be still searching more, and
more after the Evidences, of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
fundamental Truths, that you have
received; and lay open your hearts to
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:63001:185"/>
the power of them. Think it not enough
that you take the Christian Religion for
true; but labour after a <hi>clearer sight</hi> ot its
truth. For you may possibly upon some
conjecture take it for a Truth, by bare
Opinion, whenas the sight of fuller Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
and a full sight of those Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
might raise you from <hi>Opinion</hi> to a
working, saving Faith.</p>
               <p>6. Lastly, take heed lest any thing be
suffered to keep possession of your
Hearts, and so to confine the truth to your
braine. When the world is kept up in
life, and power, and is nearest the heart,
there is no room for the Word there, but
it must float upon the top, and swim in
your Opinion; because it can go no dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
your lusts, and profits having pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
before it. The Word can never
go to the heart with unmortified men,
but by casting your Idols out of your
hearts; nor will it take rooting in you,
but by rooting out the world.</p>
               <p>O Sirs, if you knew the misery of a

               <p>
                  <hi>DIRECT. IX My next Direction
that your Conversion may prove sound,
is this,</hi> Acquaint your Souls by Faith
with the Glory of the Everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and see that you make it your Portion,
and your End, and from thence let the
rest of your endeavours be animated.</p>
               <p>No man can be a sound Christian, that
knoweth not the Ends, and Portion of a
Christian. There is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the desires of Heaven in a
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:63001:186"/>
Sanctified man and an unsanctified. The
Believer prizeth it above earth, and had
rather be with God then here (Though
death that stands in the way, may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
have harder thoughts from him)
But to the ungodly there is nothing
seemeth more desirable then this world:
and therefore he only chooseth Heaven
before Hell, but not before earth; and
therefore shall not have it upon such
a choice. We heare of Gold and Silver
mines in the <hi>Indies:</hi> If you offer a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
mountaine there, to an English man
that hath an estate and family here, that
are deare to him; perhaps hee'l say,
<hi>I am uncertain whether their Golden
mountains be not meer fictions to deceive
men; and if it be true that there are such
things, yet it is a great way thither, and
the seas are perilous; and I am well enough
already where I am, and therefore let who
will go thither for me, I will stay at home
as long as I can.</hi> But if this man must
needs be banished out of <hi>England,</hi> and
had his choise whether he would go to
the Golden Ilands, or to dig in a cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
or live in a wilderness, he would
rather choose the better then the worse.
So is it with an ungodly mans desires, in
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:63001:186"/>
respect to this world, and that to come.
If he could stay here, in fleshly pleasure,
for ever, he would; because he looks
at Heaven as uncertain, and a great way
off, and the passage seemeth to him
more troublesom, and dangerous then
it is; and he is where he would be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
But when he sees that there is no
staying here for ever, but death will
have him away, he had rather go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
then to Hell; and therefore will
be Religious, as far as the flesh, and
the world will give him leave, left he
should be cast into Hell, when he is taken
from the Earth.</p>
               <p>But take an English man that is in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
and reproach, and hath neither
house, nor land, nor friend to comfort
him, and let him have the offer of a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Iland, and a person of unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
skilfullness, and fidelity, that will
promise in short time to bring him safe
thither, if he believe this person, and
can put his trust in him, doubtless he will
be gone and follow him over sea and
land, and though the passage may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
daunt him, yet the promised pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
will carry him through all. So is
it with the true Christian; He is dead to
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:63001:187"/>
this world, and sees nothing here in which
he can be happy; he is burdened and
wearied with sinne and suffering; he is
firmly perswaded of the truth of the
Gospel, and seeth by Faith the world,
that is to flesh invisible, and believeth in
Jesus Christ who hath promised to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
him safely thither; and therefore
he would away; and though he love
not death, the stormy passage, yet he
will submit to it, having so sure a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
because he loves the life which
through death he must pass into, and
had rather be there then here.</p>
               <p>Such as a mans principall End is, such
is the man, and such is the course of
his life. He that takes this world for
his Portion, and makes the felicity of
it his end, is a carnall, worldy, unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
man, whatever good and godly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may come in upon the by. It is he,
and only he, that is a sanctified Believer,
who looks on Heaven as his only Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and is sailing through the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Seas of this world, of purpose
to come to that desired harbour; not
loving these seas better then the Land
of Rest, which he is sailing to; but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
and painfully passing through
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:63001:187"/>
them, because there is no other way to
Glory. As it is the desire of the Land
to which he is sailing, that moveth the
Marriner or Passenger to do all that he
doth in his Voyage; and the desire of
his home or journeys End, that moveth
the travailer all the way; and the desire
of seeing a perfect Building, that
moveth the Builder in every stroke of
his Work; so it must be the love of
God, and the desire after Everlasting
blessedness, that must be the very En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to move the rest of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and endeavours of the Saints, and
must make men resolve on the necessary
labour and patience of Believers. Take
off this weight, and all the motions of
Christianity will cease. No man will
be at labour and sufferings for nothing,
if he can avoid them. It is a life of
Labour, though sweet to the Spirit,
yet tedious to the flesh, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
doth engage us in; and there
is much suffering to be undergone;
and this to the very last, and to the
denyall of our selves; and, if God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it, to the loss of all the comforts
of the world: For no less then <hi>forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all</hi> that we have, will serve to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:63001:188"/>
make us Christs Disciples. And will any
man do this for he knows not what?
Will any man forsake all that he hath,
unless it be for something better, which
may be as sure to him as that he had,
and may make him more happy? Look
to it therefore that you have right
and beliving thoughts of Heaven, and
that unfeignedly you take it for your
Home and Happiness, and look not for
any other Portion. <hi>Till you see so
much of the certainty and excellency of
Everlasting Glory, as shall prevail with
you to lay out your faithfull labour for
it, and to be at a point with all this
world, as having laid up your Treasure
and Hopes in the world to come, you have
no ground to conclude that you are true
Christian Converts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that it's Heaven
that is the very Reason, the End, the
Life of all your Religion, it follows that
you must necessarily <hi>understand</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of its <hi>excellency,</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> its
<hi>certainty,</hi> and accordingly <hi>set your hearts
upon it,</hi> and make the attainment of it
your daily work, and business in the
world: This is to be a Convert in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:63001:188"/>
Remember therefore first what I told
you before wherein the nature of this
Blessedness doth consist. I will only
name the Essentials of it, that your
apprehensions may be right, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to say much, as being done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>1. The first thing considerable in our
Everlasting Blessedness, will be our <hi>personal
Perfection of the whole man;</hi> This is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the Perfection of our Everlasting
Operations and Enjoyments. Our
bodies shall be no more flesh and blood,
nor corruptible, or mortall, or subject
to hunger or pain, or weariness, nor to
passions that rebell against the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
soul: but they shall be spiritul
bodies, and Immortall, and Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Undefiled. Our Souls will be
perfected in their Natural Perfections,
and in their Moral. They shall be of
more advanced Understanding, and
comprehensive Wisdom then now: Our
wills shall attain to perfect rectitude in
a perfect conformity to the Will of
God, and every affection shall be
brought to its perfect order and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
All sinne shall be done away,
whether it were in the understanding,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:63001:189"/>
will, affections, or the actions. The
executive power will be answerable to
the rest of the Perfections, and to the
blessed work which it hath to do:
And thus we shall be like the Angels
of God.</p>
               <p>2. The next thing considerable in our
Blessedness is, our <hi>approximation or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to God:</hi> We shall be admitted
into the holiest, and brought as neer
him as our natures are capable of, and
we are fit for.</p>
               <p>3. Moreover, we shall be <hi>Members
of the new Jerusalem,</hi> and receive our
Glory in Communion with that blessed
Society, and so as Members contribute to
her Glory.</p>
               <p>4. And we shall <hi>behold the glorified
Person of our Redeemer,</hi> and he will be
glorified on us as the fruits of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               <p>5. And we shall <hi>behold the face of
the blessed God,</hi> and see his wisdom, and
power and glory, and know as we are
known. Though we cannot now fully
know the manner, yet in that sense as
our Angels are said to <hi>behold the face
of God,</hi> Mat. 18. 10. we also shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:63001:189"/>
6. We shall also <hi>enjoy him in the
neerest relation, and by the most raised
vigorous affections of our souls:</hi> We shall
be filled with his <hi>Love</hi> as full as we can
hold, and we shall abound with perfect
<hi>Love to him</hi> again: And the <hi>Joy</hi> that is
in his presence, which this Intuition and
Everlasting Love will afford us, is such as
no heart is here able to conceive.</p>
               <p>7. Being thus furnished, we shall be
<hi>employed in his perfect Praises,</hi> in singing
and rejoycing to him with the heavenly
Host, and Magnifying his great and holy
Name.</p>
               <p>8. And in <hi>all this will the Glory of God
shine forth,</hi> and he will be admired in his
Saints, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10. 11. In us it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
how abundant he is in power, and
wisdom, and goodness, in holiness, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and righteousness.</p>
               <p>9. And <hi>God himself will be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with us, and with the new Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
and his glorified Sonne, and will take
complacen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y in this manifestation and
communication of his Glory and of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto his creatures.</hi> And this is his
Ultimate End, and should be the highest
point of ours. The Revolution hath
now brought all to that Center, which
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:63001:190"/>
is both the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and the end. His Will is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or Efficient of all; and it is the
Ultimate End and Perfection of
all.</p>
               <p>There is no more to add, as to the
<hi>matter,</hi> but that as to the <hi>Duration,</hi> first
we may take it as that which leaves no
room for any addition, that <hi>all this will
be Everlasting,</hi> leaving not any doubts,
or fears of a cessation. Abundance of
glorious adjuncts of this felicity might
be mentioned; but I pass them all by,
and do but name these few which are
the Essentiall Constitutive parts of our
Happiness, because I have touched them
before, and fullyer spoken of them in
the <hi>Saints Rest.</hi> Thus much I thought
meet to mention here, that you may
have somewhat of that in your eye that
I am perswading you to intend and seek;
and the rather, because I perceive that
many of the godly have not such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Apprehensions of the constitutive
parts of this Felicity, as they should
have; but much wrong their souls, and
God Himself, and the Glory of their
Profession, by looking but at some of the
Parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:63001:190"/>
Believe God sirs that this is the life
that you shall live, if you will take it
for your Portion, and set your hearts
upon it, and follow the Conduct of
Christ for the obtaining it. Can you
be content with Heaven alone? Is it
enough for you, though you be despised
and persecuted in the world? Do you
account this for Certainty and Excellency
to be worth all? Yea, that all is dross
and dung to this. Thus must you do
if you will be true Converts. For all
such are heavenly in their minds, and
hearts, and in the drift of all their lives
and Conversations.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="direction">
               <p>
                  <hi>DIRECT. X. My next Advice that
you may prove</hi> sound Converts, <hi>is this:</hi>
[Rest not, and count not your selves
truly Converted, till God and his holy
Waies have your very Love, and Desire,
and Delight: and take not that for a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Change, when you had rather live
a worldly ungodly life, if it were not for
the fear of punishment.]</p>
               <p>I shall speak but little of this, because
I toucht upon it before, when I told
you that Christ must have your hearts,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:63001:191"/>
and because it is but a consectary of the
last, or contained in it. But yet I think
it best to present it here distinctly to
your Consideration, because a slavish
kind of religiousness, doth deceive so
many; and because the life of Grace
is here exprest. I deny not but <hi>holy Fear</hi>
is e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ceeding usefull to us; even a Fear
of the Threatnings and Judgments of
God. But yet I must tell you, that in
<hi>Fear</hi> there is much more that is common
to the unsanctified, then there is in
<hi>Love, Desire and Delight.</hi> Though the
<hi>Fear of God be the beginning of wisdom,</hi>
it is <hi>Love</hi> that is the <hi>Perfection:</hi> and
that <hi>Fear</hi> is not filial, and of the right
strain, if <hi>Love</hi> be not its Companion.
<hi>Fear</hi> of punishment shews that you love
your <hi>natural selves:</hi> but it shews not
that you <hi>love</hi> God, and are true-hearted
to him. The Devils fear and tremble,
but they do not <hi>Love.</hi> It is <hi>Love</hi> and
and not <hi>Fear</hi> that is the Byas, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
and, as I may say, the <hi>Nature</hi>
of the will of man By his Love it is that
you must know what the man is. The
Philosopher saith, <hi>[Such as a man is,
such is his end]</hi> which is all one as to say,
<hi>[Such as a man is, such is his Love.]</hi>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:63001:191"/>
You may Fear a thing at the same time
when you hate it: and it's too <hi>common</hi>
to have some hatred mixt with Fear. You
may be as much against God and his
holy waies, when Fear only drives you
to some kind of religiousness, as others
are that scarce meddle with Religion
at all. The first thing that God looks at
is, what you <hi>would</hi> do; and the next is,
what you <hi>do.</hi> If you do it, but had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
leave it undone, you lose your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and God will take it as if you had
not done it: For it was not <hi>you</hi> that did
it, if you did it not from <hi>Love;</hi> but it
was <hi>Fear</hi> that dwelleth in you. God
takes mens hearty Desires and Will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the Deed, where they have not
power to fulfill it: But he never took
the bare <hi>Deed</hi> instead of the <hi>Will.</hi> A
blockish kind of worship, consisting in
outward actions, without the heart, is
fit to be given to a wooden god, a sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Idol: but the true and living God
abhorres it. He is a Spirit, and will be
worshiped in Spirit and in Truth: such
worshipers he seeketh, and such he will
accept, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 23, 24. A begger will be
glad of your Almes, though you leave
it with an ill will; because he <hi>needeth</hi> it:
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:63001:192"/>
but God hath no <hi>need</hi> of you, nor of
your service, and therefore think not
that he will accept you on such termes.
That people worshipeth God in vain,
that draw near him with their mouth, and
honour him with their lips, when their
<hi>heart</hi> is <hi>farre</hi> from him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 8, 9.
A mans heart is where his <hi>Love</hi> is, rather
then where his <hi>Fear</hi> is. If you should
lie still upon your knees, or in the holy
Assembly; If you should be the strictest
Observer of the Ordinances on the Lords
daies; and yet had such hearts in you,
as had rather let all these alone, if it
were not for fear of punishment; it will
all be disregarded, and reckoned to you
according to your wills, as if it had
never been done by you at all. It's
Love that must win <hi>Love,</hi> or make you
fit for <hi>Love</hi> to entertain. If you give
your goods to the poor, or your bodies
to be burned in a cause that in it self
is good, and yet have not Love, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth
nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 5. You
will not think your Wife hath conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
affections that loveth another man
better then you, and had rather be gone
from you, if she could live without you.
It's an unnatural Son that loves not his
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:63001:192"/>
Father, but had rather be from him,
then with him. If God called you to a
bestiall drugery or slavery, he would
then look but for your work, and not
care much whether you be willing or
unwilling. If your Ox draw your
plow, and your Horse carry his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
you care not much whether it be
willingly or unwillingly. Or if it be an
enemy that you have to deal with, you
will look for no more then a forced sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
or that he be disabled from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you hurt. But this is not your case:
It is a state of friendship that the Gospel
calls you to: you must be nigh to God;
his Children; and the Members of his
Sonne; espoused to him in the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
strongest bonds: And do you think
it is possible that this should be done
without your wills and affections? If
you can be content with the <hi>Portion</hi> of a
<hi>slave</hi> and an <hi>enemy,</hi> then do your <hi>task,</hi>
and deny God your <hi>affections:</hi> But if
you look for the entertainment and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>Friend,</hi> a Child, a Spouse; you
must bring the <hi>heart</hi> of a Friend, and
of a Child, and of a Spouse. Fear may
do good by driving you to the use of
means; and taking out of your hands the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:63001:193"/>
things by which you would do your
selves a mischief: It may <hi>prepare</hi> you
for saving Grace; and when you are
sanctified, it will prove a necessary ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of Love; to keep you in awe, and
save you from temptations. But Love
is the ruling affection in the sanctified;
and fear is therefore necessary because
of the present imperfection of Love,
and because of the variety of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that here beset us: Think not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that you are savingly renewed,
till God have your very hearts. When
you do but believe and tremble, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then to be unbelieving, and stupid, and
secure: but you are not true Christians
till you believe and Love. We use to fly
from that which we fear, and therefore
do apprehend it to be evil to us. We a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the presence and company of those
that we are afraid of, but we draw
nigh them that we love, and delight in
their company. We Fear an Enemy:
We Love a Friend: We Fear the Devil
naturally; but we do not Love him:
It is Love that is that Affection of the
soul that entertaineth God as God,
even as Good: though that Love must
be accompanied with a filial fear, even a
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:63001:193"/>
dread and reverence of his Majesty and
greatness, and a fear of displeasing him.
If you should toile out your selves in
Religious duties, with a heart that had
rather forbear them, if you durst, you
have not the hearts of Gods Children
in your breasts. The <hi>Magistrate</hi> can
<hi>frighten</hi> men to the Congregation and
outward worship: You may lock a man
in the Church, that had rather be away:
And will any man think that this makes
him acceptable to God? You may keep
a Theif from stealing by prison and
irons; but this makes him not accepted
with God as a true man: You may cure
a man of cursing, and swearing, and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and idle and ribbald talking, even
in a minute of an hour, by cutting of his
tongue: but will God accept him ever the
more as long as he hath a heart that
would do it if he could? There's abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of people at this day that are
kept from abusing the Lords day, and
from swearing, and stealing, yea and
from laying hands on all about them
that are godly, and this by the Law of
man, and the fear of present punishment:
And do you think that these are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
innocent or acceptable with God?
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:63001:194"/>
By this account you may make the Devil
a Saint, when he is chained up from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mischief: You may as well say, that
a Lyon is become a Lamb, when he is
shut up in his Den: Or that a mastiff
Dog is become harmelss and gentle,
when he is muzled. Believe it sirs, you
are never Christians, till you see that
in God that winnes your hearts to him,
so that you would not change your
Master for any in the world; and till
you see that in the Hopes of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Glory, that you would not change
it for any thing else that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the heart of man; And till you
see that goodness in a heavenly life, that
you had rather live it, then any life in
the world: You are not converted to
God indeed, till you had rather live
in Holiness then in Sinne, if you had
your freest choice; and till you would
gladly be the strictest holiest persons
that you know in the world; and long
after more and more of it, and fain
would reach Perfection it self: For
though we cannot be perfect here, yet
no man is <hi>upright</hi> that <hi>desireth</hi> not to
be <hi>perfect.</hi> For he that loveth Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as Holiness, must needs love the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:63001:194"/>
greatest measure of Holiness, with the
greatest Love. This is it that maketh
sound Converts to be so faithfull and
constant with God: A man is forward
and ready to a work that he loves,
when he draws back from it, as if it
were a mischief, that hath no mind to
do it. A man is hardly kept from the
persons, and places, and employments
that he loves: but a little will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
him from that which he loveth
not. Why is it that we have so much
adoe to take off a Drunkard from his
Companions and his lusts, but because
he loves them better then temperance
and gracious company? And why can
we so hardly draw the lustfull wretch
from his filthy lusts, or the glutton,
or the idle sensuall person from his
needless or ezcessive recreations, but
because they love them? And why is
it that you cannot draw the worldling
from his covetousness, but he parteth
with his money almost as hardly as with
his blood, but because he loveth it?
And therefore what wonder if tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be resisted, and the fairest baits of
the world despised, by him that is truly
in Love with God: No wonder if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:63001:195"/>
can turn back that man from the
way to Heaven, that is in Love both with
Heaven and with the Way. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if that man stick close to Christ and
never forsake a holy life, that tafteth
the sweetness of it, and feels its to do
him good, and had rather go that way
then any in the world. There is no true
Christian but can say with <hi>David,</hi> that
<hi>a day in Gods Courts is better then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
and he had rather be a door-keeper in
the house of God, then to dwell in the tents,</hi>
[yea, or the Pallaces] <hi>of wickedness.</hi>
Do but mark those Professors that prove
Apostates, and sorfake the way of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which they seemed to embrace, and
see whether they be not such as either
took up some bare Opinions and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Duties, upon a flash of superficial
illumination, or else such as were fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into a course of Religion, and so
went on from duty to duty for fear of
being damned, when all the while their
hearts were more another way, and they
had rather have been excused. These hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
are they that are disputing so oft
the Obligations to their Duty, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
How do you prove that it is a Duty
to pray in my Family, or a Duty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:63001:195"/>
the Lords Day, or to come con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
to the Congregation, or to use
the Communion of the godly in private
meetings, or to repeat Sermons, or sing
Psalms, and the like? Intimating that
they are as Birds in a Cage, or Hens
in a Pen, that are boaring to get out,
and had had rather be at liberty: If it
were not for the fear of the Law of God
that is upon them, they had rather let
all these Duties alone, or take them up
but now and then at an idle time, when
Satan and the flesh will give them leave.
If a Feast be prepared and spread before
them, a good stomack will not stand to
ask; How can you prove it my duty to
eat? but perhaps the sick that loath it,
may do so. If the Cup be before the
Drunkard, he doth not stand on those
termes [How do you prove it my duty
now to drink this Cup, and the other
Cup] No, if he might have but leave,
he would drink on, without any questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
whether it be a duty: If the
Gamester, or the Whoremonger, might
but be sure that he should scape the
punishment, he would never stick at the
want of a Precept, and ask, Is it my
duty? If there were but a gift of twenty
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:63001:196"/>
pound a man, to be given to all the
poor of the Town, yea and to all the
people in generall, I do not think I
should meet with many people in the
Town that would draw back and say,
What Word of God commandeth me
to take it? Or how can you prove that
it is my duty? And why is all this?
but because they have an inward Love
to the thing; and Love will carry a
man to that which seemeth good for
him, without any command, or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
If these ungodly wretches had
one sparke of spiritual life within them,
and any taste and feeling of the matters
that concern their own salvation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of asking, How can you prove that
I <hi>must</hi> pray with my Family, or that
I <hi>must</hi> keep the Lords day, or that I
<hi>must</hi> converse with the godly, and live
a holy life? they would be readier to
say, How can you prove that I <hi>may not</hi>
pray with my Family? and that I may
not sanctifie the Lords Day? and that
I may not have Communion with the
Saints in Holiness? Seeing so great a
mercy is offered to the world, why
may not I partake of it as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
I can perceive in many that I
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63001:196"/>
converse with, the great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a heart that loves God and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and a heart that seemes religious
and honest without such a Love. The
true Convert perceiveth so much sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in holy Duties, and so much spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
advantage by them to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oul,
that he is loath to be kept back; he
cannot spare these Ordinances and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
no more then he can spare the
bread from his mouth, or the cloathes
from his back; yea, or the skin from
his flesh, no nor so much. He loveth
them; he cannot live without them;
at the worst that ever he is at, he had
rather be holy then unholy, and live
a godly then a fleshly worldly life.
And therefore if he had but a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re leave
from God, without a Command, to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
the Lords Day, and to live in the
holy Communion of the Saints, he
would joyfully take it, with many thanks:
For he need not be driven to his rest
when he is weary, nor to his spiritual
food when he is hungry, nor to Christ
the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uge of his soul, when the curse
and accuser are pursuing him. But the
unsanctified hypocrite, that never loved
God or Godliness in his heart, he stands
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:63001:197"/>
questioning and enquiring for some proof
of a necessity of these courses. And
if he can but bring himself to hope
that God will save him without so much
adoe (which by the help of the Devil
he may easily be brought to hope,)
away then goes the duty: If you could
not shew him that there is a <hi>Necessity</hi> of
Family Prayer, and a <hi>Necessity</hi> of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Lords Day, and a <hi>Necessity</hi> of
forsaking his tipling and voluptuousness,
and a <hi>Necessity</hi> of living a heavenly
life, he would quickly resolve of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
course: For he had <hi>rather</hi> do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
if he durst. He never was
Religious from a true Predominant
Love to God and a holy life, but for
<hi>fear</hi> of Hell, and for other inferiour
respects.</p>
               <p>Remember this when you have preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
opportunities before you, of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or receiving good, and when you see
that you have leave to take these op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
and yet you draw back, and
are questioning, How we can prove it
to be your duty; or that you cannot be
saved without it? Do not these Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
plainly shew that you Love not the
work, and Delight not in a holy life;
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:63001:197"/>
and that you had rather let it alone?
Are you not blind if you see not this
is in your selves? Yea, it's plain that
you have such an aversness or hatred
to God and a holy course of life, that
if you did but know what shift to
make to scape damnation, you would
fly away from God and Holiness, and
have as little to do with them as you
can. Your Questions and Cavils do
plainly declare this wicked emnity and
backwardness of your hearts: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
shew how farre you are from
true Conversion.</p>
               <p>Not that I am of their mind that think
there is any Good which the Law of
Christ Obligeth us not to accept, and
which we can refuse without sinne and
danger to our selves: For God doth
both draw us, and drive us at once.
But when the Threatning and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only can prevail with men, and men
Love not God and Godliness for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but had rather have liberty to
live as the ungodly, I shall never take
one of these for a sanctified man, nor
have any hope of the saving of such a
soul, how farre soever his fears may
carry him from his outward sinnes,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:63001:198"/>
or to outward duties: Till God shall
give him a better Conversion then this,
I say, I have not the smallest hope of
this mans salvation. Then you are
Gods, Children, when the Honour, the
Work, the Family, the Name of your
Father are lovely and delightfull to you:
And when you grieve that there is any
remnants of sin in your souls; and when
your sinnes are to you as lameness to
the lame, that pain them every step
they go; and as sickness to the sick, that
makes them groan and groan again,
and long to be rid of it: And when
you think those the happiest men on
earth that are the most holy, and wish
from your hearts that you were such
as they, though you had not a house
to put your head in: When you look
towards God with longing thoughts,
and are grieved that your understandings
can reach no nearer him, and know no
more of him, and that your hearts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
embrace him with a more burning
Love: When you admire the beauty of
a meek, a patient, a mortified, spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
heavenly mind, and long to have
more of this your self, yea to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in all Holiness and Obed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence: When
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:63001:198"/>
your hearts are thus brought over to
God, that you had <hi>rather</hi> have him then
any other, and <hi>rather</hi> live in his Family
then any where, and <hi>rather</hi> walk in his
waies then in any, then are you indeed
Converted, and never till then,
whatever other dispositions you may
have.</p>
               <p>And now if that were my business,
what abundance of reason might I shew
you, to make you willing to come over
unto God, with Love, and with Delight.
Whom else can you Love, if he that is
<hi>Love</hi> it self seem not lovely to you.
All loveliness is in <hi>him</hi> and from <hi>him:</hi>
The creature hath none of it self, nor
for it self: To Love a life of sinne, is
to Love the Image and Service of the
Devil, and to Love that which feeds
the flames of Hell: What is it then to
Love this sinne so well, as for the
Love of it to fly from God and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness?
Methinks men at the worst
should Love that which will do them
good, and not preferre that before it
which will hurt them. Do sinners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
believe that God and Holiness will
do them hurt, and that sinne will do
them greater good? Is there ever a
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:63001:199"/>
man so mad that he dare speak this
and stand to it? If indeed you think
it best to live in sinne, and therefore had
rather keep it then leave it, your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
are befooled, I had almost
used <hi>Paul</hi>'s Phrase, and said, <hi>bewitched,</hi>
Gal. 3. 1. Will it do you any hurt to
leave your beastly sensual lives, and to
live <hi>soberly, righteously, and godly in the
world, denying ungodliness and worldly
lusts, and looking for the blessed hope, and
the glorious appearing of the great God
and our Saviour Jesus Christ?</hi> This is
the Doctrine of Saving Grace, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.
11, 12, 13. Would it do you any harm
to be assured of Salvation, and ready
to die, and to know that the Angels
shall Conduct your departing souls to
Christ, and that you shall live in Joy
with him for ever? Or to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in those holy works that must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
you for this day, and help you to
this assurance. If God be naught for
you, if Holiness, and Righteousness,
and Temperance be naught for you,
then you may as well say, Heaven is
naught for you; and therefore you
must resolve for sinne and Hell, and
see whether that be good for you. I
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:63001:199"/>
shall say no more of this Point, because
I have written of it already, in the
Conclusion of the <hi>Saints Rest,</hi> which I
desire you to peruse.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="direction">
               <p>
                  <hi>DIRECT. XI. The next part of my
Advice is,</hi> If you would not have this
Saving Work misearry, Turn then this
present day and hour, without any more
Delay.</p>
               <p>Somewhat I have spoke of this already,
and therefore shall say the less. But
yet I shall back this Direction with
such Reasons as will certainly convince
you, if you be not unreasonable, of the
folly of Delay, and shew you that it
concerneth you presently to Return.
And though my Reasons will be nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
it is not the Number but the
Strength of them that I shall urge you
principally to Consider; and because
of the Number, I will go over them
with the greater brevity.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Consider to whom it is that you are
commanded to Turn:</hi> and then tell me
whether there can be any Reason for
<hi>delay.</hi> It is not to an empty deceitfull
creature, but to the faithfull All-sufficient
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:63001:200"/>
God: To him that is the cause of all
things; the Strength of the Creation;
the Joy of Angels; the Felicity of the
Saints; the Sun and Shield of all the
Righteous; and Refuge of the Distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
and the Glory of the whole World.
Of such Power, that his Word can take
down the Sun from the Firmament, and
turn the Earth and all things into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
for he doth more in giving them
their being and continuance. Of such
Wisdom, that was never guilty of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
and therefore will not mislead
you, nor draw you to any thing that
is not for the best. Of such Goodness,
as that evil cannot stand in his sight;
and nothing but your evil could make
him displeased with you; and it is from
nothing but evil that he calleth you
to Turn. It is not to a malitious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that would do you a mischief,
but it is to a gracious God, that is Love
it self: Not to an implacable Justice,
but to a reconciled Father; not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
Indignation, but to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement
of those Arms, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of that compassionate Lord, that is
enough to melt the hardest heart, when
you find your self as the poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:63001:200"/>
Prodigall, <hi>Luk.</hi> 25. 20. in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
when you deserved to have been
under his feet. And will the great and
blessed God invite thee to his favour,
and wilt thou delay and demurre upon
the Return? The greatest of the Angels
of Heaven are glad of his favour, and
value no Happiness but the light of his
countenance: Heaven and Earth are
supdorted by him, and nothing can stand
without him: How glad would those
very Devils be of his favour, that tempt
thee to neglect his favour: And wilt
thou delay to turn to such a God?
Why man, thou art every minute at his
mercy: If thou turn not, he can throw
thee into Hell when he will, more easily
then I can throw this Book to the ground;
And yet dost thou delay? There are
all things imaginable in him to draw thee:
There is nothing that is good for thee but
it is perfectly in him; where thou maist
have it certain and perpetuated. There
is nothing in him to give the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement:
Let all the Devils in Hell,
and all the Enemies of God on Earth, say
the worst they can against his Majesty;
and they are not able to find the smallest
blemish in his absolute Holiness, and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:63001:201"/>
Wisdom, and Goodness: And yet wilt
thou delay to Turn?</p>
               <p>2. Consider also, as to <hi>Whom, so to
what it is that thou must Turn.</hi> Not to
uncleanness, but unto Holiness: not, to
the sensual life of a Beast, but to the
Noble rationall life of a man, and the
more Noble Heavenly life of a Believer:
Not to an unprofitable worldly toyl, but
to the gainfullest Employment that ever
the Sonnes of men were acquainted
with: Not to the deceitfull drudgery of
sinne, but to that <hi>Godliness which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to all things, having the promise
of the life that now is, and of that which
is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. Sirs. Do you know
what a life of Holiness is? You do not
know it, if you turn away from it: I
am sure if you knew it, you would never
fly from it, no nor endure to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. Why, a life of Holiness, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a living unto God: to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
with him as the wicked are with
the world; and to be devoted to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
as sensualists are to the flesh. It is
to live in the Love of God and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and in the foretasts of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Glory, and of his Love: and in
the sweet fore-thoughts of that blessed life
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:63001:201"/>
that shall never end: and in the honest
self-denying course that leadeth to that
blessedness. A godly life, is nothing
else but a sowing the Seed of Heaven on
Earth; and a learning in the School of
Christ, the Songs of praise which we must
use before the Throne of God; and by
<hi>suffering,</hi> a learning how to Triumph and
reign with Christ. And is there any
thing in this life which you have cause to
be afraid of? The sinnes and weaknesses
of the godly are contrary to Godliness;
and therefore Godliness is no more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured
by them, then health and life is
dishonoured by your sicknesses. As
health is never the worse to be liked but
the better, because of the painfull
grievousness of sickness; so Godliness is
to be liked the better, because the very
failings of the Saints are so grievous. If
a true Believer do but step out of the
way of God, he is wounded, he is out
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oynt, he is as undone till he come in
again; though it was but in one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
And can you endure to continue
strangers to it altogether so long. I
know you may find faults in the godly,
till they are perfect: but let the most
malicious Enemy of Christ on Earth find
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:63001:202"/>
any fault in Godliness if he can.</p>
               <p>Can you delay to come into your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Family; into the Vineyard of
the Lord; into the Kingdom of
God on Earth; to be fellow Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of the Saints, and of the
Houshould of God; to have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of all your sinnes, and the sealed
Promise of Everlasting Glory? Why
Sirs, when you are called on to Turn,
you are called to the Porch of Heaven;
into the beginning of Salvation: And
will you delay to accept Everlasting
life?</p>
               <p>3. Consider also <hi>from what you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to Turn:</hi> and then judg whether there
be any reason of delay. It is from the
Devil your Enemy: from the love of
a deceitfull world; from the seducement
of corrupted bruitish flesh: It is from
sinne the greatest evil: What is there
in sinne that you should delay to part
with it? Is there any good in it? Or
what hath it ever done for you, that you
should love it? Did it ever do you good?
Or did it ever do any man good? It is
the deadly enemy of Christ and you, that
caused his death, and will cause yours,
and is working for your damnation, if
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:63001:202"/>
converting and pardoning Grace prevent
it not: And are you loath to leave it?
It is the cause of all the miseries of the
world, of all the sorrow that ever did
befall you, and the cause of the damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them that perish: And do you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
to part with it.</p>
               <p>4. Your <hi>Delaying shews that you Love
not God, and that you preferre your sinne
before him, and that you would never
part with it if you might have your will.</hi>
For if you loved God, you would long
to be restored to his favour, and to be
near him, and employed in his service
and his Family. Love is quick and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
and will not draw back. And it
is a sign also that you are in love with
sinne: For else why should you be so
loath to leave it? He that would not
leave his sinne and turn to God, till
the next week, or the next Moneth or
year, would never turn if he might have
his desire. For that which makes you
desirous to stay a day or week longer,
doth indeed make you loath to turn at
all. And therefore it is but hypocrisie
to take on you, that you are willing to
turn hereafter, if you be not willing to do
it now, without delay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:63001:203"/>
5. Consider <hi>but what a Case you are in
while you thus delay.</hi> Do you think you
stand on drie ground, or in a safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
If you knew where you are, you
would sit as upon thornes, as long as
you are unconverted: you would be as
a man that stood up to the knees in the
Sea, and saw the tide coming towards
him; who certainly would think that
there's no standing still in such a place.
Read what I have said of the state of
the unconverted, in my first Treatise of
Conversion. In a word, you are the
drudges of sinne, the slaves of the
Devil, the enemies of God, the abusers
of his Grace and Spirit, the despisers of
Christ, the heirs of Hell. And is this a
state to stay in an hour? You have all
your sin unpardoned; you are under the
Curse of the Law; the Wrath of God
is upon you; and the fulness of it hangs
over your heads; Judgment is coming to
pass upon you the dreadfull doom; the
Lord is at hand; death is at the door,
and waits but for the Word from the
mouth of God, that it may arrest you,
and bring you to Everlasting misery:
And is this a state for a man to stay
in?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:63001:203"/>
6. Moreover, <hi>Your Delaying giveth
great advantage to the Tempter.</hi> If you
would presently turn and forsake your
sinnes, and enter a faithfull Covenant
with God, the Devil would be almost
out of hope, and the very heart of his
temptations would be broken: He
would see that now it is too late: there's
no getting you out of the arms of Christ.
But as long as you delay, you keep him
still in heart and hope: He hath time to
strengthen his prison and fetters; and to
renew his snares; and if one temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
serve not, he hath time to try an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and another: As if you would
stand as a mark for Satan to shoot at,
as long as he please. What likelihood
is there that ever so foolish a sinner
should be recovered and saved from his
sinne?</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Moreover,</hi> Your Delaying is a vile
abuse of Christ, and the holy Ghost, and
may so farre provoke him as to leave you to
your self; and then you are past help. <hi>If
you delight so to trample on your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Lord, and will so long put him to
it by your refusing his Grace, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Spirit; What can you expect but
that he should turn away in wrath, and
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:63001:204"/>
utterly forsake you, and say,</hi> [Let him
keep his sinne, seeing he had rather have it
then my Grace: Let him continue ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
seeing he is so loath to be sanctified:
let him take his own course, and die in his
sinne, and repent in Hell, seeing he would
not repent on Earth?] <hi>You provoke
Christ thus to give you up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Consider also I beseech you, <hi>if
you ever mean to turn, what it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that you
stay for.</hi> Do you think to bring down
Christ and Heaven to lower rates, and
to be saved hereafter with less adoe?
Sure you cannot be so foolish: For God
will be still the same; and Christ the
same; and his Promise hath still the
same Condition, which he will never
Change; and Godliness will be the same,
and as much against your carnall interest
hereafter as it is now? When you have
lookt about you never so long, you'l ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
find a fairer or nearer way; but this
same way you must go or perish. If you
cannot leave sinne now, how should
you leave it then: It will be still as
sweet to your flesh as now: Or if one
sinne grow stale by the decay of nature,
another that's worse will spring up in its
stead, and though the acts abate, they
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:63001:204"/>
will all live still at the root; for sinne
was never mortified by age. So that if
ever you will turn, you may best turn
now.</p>
               <p>9. Yea more then that; <hi>The longer
you stay, the harder it will be.</hi> If it be
hard to day, it is like to be harder to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
For as the Spirit of Christ is like
to forsake you for your wilfull delayes, so
custom will strengthen sinne: and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
in sinning will harden your hearts,
and make you as past feeling, to work
all uncleanness with greediness, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 19.
Cannot you crush this Serpent when it
is but in the Spawne; and can you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
it in its Serpentine strength?
Cannot you pluck up a tender Plant,
and can you pluck up an Oak or Cedar? O
sinners, what do you do, to make your
recovery so difficult by delay? You are
never like to be fairer for Heaven, and
to find Conversion an easier work, then
now you may do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Will you stay till the
work be ten times harder, and yet do you
think it so hard already?</p>
               <p>10. Consider also, That <hi>fin gets daily
Victories by your delay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

against it, and preach, and exhort, and pray
against it, and it gets a kind of victory
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:63001:205"/>
over all, as long as we prevail not with
you to turn. It conquereth our perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and advice: It conquereth all the
stirrings of your Consciences: It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereth
all your heartless purposes, and
deceitfull Promises. And these frequent
Conquests do strengthen your sinne, and
weaken your resistance, and leave the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
almost hopeless. Before a Physician
hath used remedies, he hath more hope
of a cure, then when he hath tried all
means, and finds that the best Medicines
do no good, but the man is still as bad or
worse. So when all meanes have been
tried with you, and yet you are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
the case draws towards despa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
it self: The very means are disabled
more then before; that is, your hearts
are unapter to be wrought upon by
them; When you have long been under
Sermons, and Reading, and among good
examples, and yet you are unconverted,
these Ordinances lose much of their
force with you: Custom will make you
slight them, and be dead-hearted under
them. And it is these very same Means
and Truths that you have frustrated that
must do the work, or it will never be
done: The same Plaister must heal you, that
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:63001:205"/>
you have thrown off so oft; And what
a sad case is this, that there is no hope
left, but in the very same Medicine which
you have taken so oft in vain.</p>
               <p>11. Moreover, <hi>Age it self hath many
inconveniences, and youth hath many great
advantages; and therefore it is folly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.</hi>
In age the understanding and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
grows dull; and people grow
uncapable and almost unchangeable.
We see by our every daies experience,
that men think they should not change
when they are old; that opinion or
practice that they have been brought up
in, they think that they should not then
forsake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To learn when they are old,
and to turn when they are old, you see
how much they are against it. Besides,
how unfit is age to be at that paines, that
youth can undergo? How unfit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the holy Warfare against the flesh,
the world, and Devil? Gods way is to
list his Souldiers as soon as may be; Even
in their infancy; which they must own
as soon as ever they come to age: And
the Devil would not have it done at all;
and therefore he would have it put off
as long as may be: In infancy he will tell
the Parents with the Anabaptists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:63001:206"/>
too soon to be dedicated to God, and
entred into his Covenant: when they
come to their childhood, and youthfull
state, he will then perswade them
that it is yet too soon; and when he
can no longer perswade them that it is
yet too soon, he will then perswade
them that it is too late. O what a happy
thing it is to come unto God betimes, and
with the first. What advantage hath
youth? They have the vigour of wit and
of body: They be not rooted and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in sinne, nor filled with prejudice
and obstinacy against Godliness, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
be. Besides, the capacity of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

and encouragement as few ages of the world

of good examples; and the
society of the godly; private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique

under as little suffering as ever you can

to serve God, and a dishonour to
neglect it (as well it may) Our Rulers
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:63001:206"/>
countenance the Practises of Godliness:
they proclaim themselves the forward
Professors and Patrons of it, and take
this as their Glory. And this is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in the world. Seldome hath
the Church seen such daies on Earth. And
<hi>yet</hi> is not the way to Heaven fair enough
for you? <hi>Yet</hi> are you not ready to turn
to God? When should men make Hay
but when the Sun shines? Will you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
till this Harvest time be over, and
the Winter of persecution come again?
Can you better turn to God, when
a godly life is the common scorn of the
Countrey, as it was a while agoe? and
when every one will be deriding and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at you? Or when it may possibly
cost you your lives? Have you Sun, and
winde, and tide to serve you, and will you
stay to set out in stormes and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>13 Moreover, <hi>Your del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And is your Everlasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ully hazarded, by
causeless and unreasonable delays? 1. If
you delay to day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are utterly uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of living till to morrow. If you
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:63001:207"/>
put by this one motion, you know not
whether ever you shall have another.
Alas, that ever the heart of man should
be so sensless, as to delay, when they
know not but it may prove their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and when Heaven or Hell must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
follow; that they dare put off
a day or hour, when they know not
whether ever they shall see another.
2. And as your life is uncertain, so
are the means uncertain, by which God
useth to do the work. He may remove
your Teachers, and other helps; and
then you will be further off then before.
3. And if both should continue, yet
Grace it self is uncertain. You know
not whether ever the Spirit of God will
put another thought of turning into your
hearts: Or at least whether he will give
you hearts to turn.</p>
               <p>14. Moreover, <hi>The delay of Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
continueth your sinne, and so you will
daily increase the number, and increase
your guilt, and make your souls more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
miserable.</hi> Are you not deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in debt to God already, and have
you not yet sinnes enough to answer for
upon your Souls? Would you fain have
one years sinnes more, or one daies sinnes
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:63001:207"/>
more to be charged upon you? O if you
did but know what sinne is, it would
amaze you to think what a mountain ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
already upon your Consciences. One
sinne unpardonned will sink the stoutest
sinner into Hell: And you have many a
thousand upon your Souls already: and
would you yet have more. Me thinks
you should rather look about you, and
bethink you how you may get a pardon
for all that's past.</p>
               <p>15. And as <hi>sinne increaseth daily by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
so consequently the Wrath of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth;
you will run further into his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;</hi>
and possibly you may cut down
the bough that you stand upon, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
even bodily destruction to your
selves. When you live daily upon God,
and are kept out of Hell, by a miracle
of his mercy, me thinks you should not
desire yet longer to provoke him, least
he withdraw his Mercy, and let you fall
into misery.</p>
               <p>16. And do but consider, what <hi>will
become of you, if you be found in these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies.</hi>
You are then lost body and Soul
for ever. Now if you had but hearts to
know what is good for you, the worst
of you might be converted, and saved:
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:63001:208"/>
for God doth freely offer you his Grace.
But if you die in your delaies, in the
twink of an eye you will find your selves
utterly undone for ever. Now there is
hope of a change: but when delays have
brought you to Hell, there is no more
change, nor no more hope.</p>
               <p>17. Consider, that your <hi>very time
which you lose by these delaies, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
loss.</hi> When time is gone,
what would you then give for one of those
years, or daies, or hours, which now
you foolishly trifle away. O wretched
sinners; are their so many thousand Sous
in Hell, that would give a world if they
had it, for one of your daies; and yet
can you afford to throw them away, in
worldliness, and sensuality, and loite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
delaies. I tell you, Time is better
worth, then all the wealth and honours
of the world. The day is coming when
you will set by time: When it is gone
you will know what a blessing you made
light of. But then all the world cannot
call back one day or hour of this precious
time, which you can sacrifice now to the
service of your flesh, and cast away on
unprofitable sinning.</p>
               <p>18. Consider also that <hi>God hath given
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:63001:208"/>
you no time to spare.</hi> He hath not lent you
one day or hour, more then is needfull
for the work that you have to do: and
therefore you have no reason to lose any
by your delaies. Do you imagine that
God would give a man an hours time for
nothing; much less, for to abuse him,
and serve his enimy. No, let me tell you,
that if you make your best of every hour;
if you should never lose a minute of
your lives, you would find all little
enough for the work you have to do. I
know not how others think of time, but
for my part I am forced daily to say,
<hi>How swift, how short is time? and how
great is our work; and when we have done
our best, how slowly goeth it on.</hi> O pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> what hearts have they, what
lives do those men lead, that think time
long? that have time to spare, and pass
in idleness.</p>
               <p>19. To convince you more; consider I
beseech you <hi>the exceeding greatness of the
work you have to do;</hi> and tell me then
whether it be time for you to delay.
Especially you that are yet unconverted,
and strangers to the heavenly nature of
the Saints; you have far more to do then
other men. You have a multitude of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:63001:209"/>
head-strong passions to subdue, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of deadly sinnes to kill; and
rooted vices to root up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> You have many
a false opinion of God, and his waies, to
be plucked up; and the customes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years standing to be broken: You
have blind minds that must be enlightned
with heavenly kowledg; and abundance
of Spiritual Truths, that are above the
reach of flesh and blood, that you must
needs learn and understand: You have
much to know, that is hard to be known,
You have a dead Soul to be made alive,
and a hard heart to be melted; and a sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Conscience to be softned, and made
tender; and the guilt of many thousand
sinnes to be pardoned: You have a new
heart to get, and a new End to ayme at,
and seek after, and a new life to live:
abundance of Enemies you have to sight
with and overcome: abundance of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
to resist and conquer. Many
Graces to get, and preserve, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
and increase: and abundance of
holy works, to do for the Service of God,
and the good of your selves, and others.
O what a deal of work doth every one of
these words conteine! and yet what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
more might I name! And have
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:63001:209"/>
you all this to do, and yet will you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay?
And they are not indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that are before you: It is no less
then the saving of your Souls; and the
obtaining the blessed Glory of the Saints.
Necessity is upon you: These are things
that <hi>Must</hi> be done, or else <hi>wo</hi> to you
that ever you were born: And yet have
you another day to lose! Why Sirs, if
you had a hundred mile to go, in a day or
two, upon paine of death; would you
delay? O think of the work that you have
to do, and then judg whether it be not
time to stirre.</p>
               <p>20. And me thinks it should excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
terrifie you to consider, <hi>what
abundance by such Delayes do perish:
and how few that wilfully delay are ever
converted, and saved.</hi> Many a Soul that
once had purposes hereafter to repent, is
now in the misery, where there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
that will do them any good.
For my part, though I have known some
very few Converted when they were old;
yet I must needs say, both that they
were very few indeed, and that I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe, that they were such that
had sinned before in ignorance, and did
not wilfully put off Repentance, when
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:63001:210"/>
they were convinced that they must turn.
Though I doubt not but God may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
even these if he please, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say that I have ever known many,
if any such to be converted. Sure I
am that Gods usual time is in Child-hood,
or youth, before they have long abused
grace, and wilfully delaid to turn when
they were convinced. Some considerable
time I confess many have before their first
convictions, and purposes be brought to
any great ripeness of performance: but
O how dangerous is it to delay.</p>
               <p>21. Consider also; <hi>Either Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is Good, or Bad for you: Either it is
needfull, or unnecessary. If it be bad,
and a needless thing, then let it alone for
altogether? But if you are convinced that
it is Good, and necessary, is it not better
now then to stay any longer?</hi> Is it not the
sooner the better? Are you afraid of
being safe, or happy too soon. If you
are sick, you care not how soon you
are well: If you have a bone out, you
care not how soon it is set: If you fall
into the water, you care not how soon
you get out: If your house be on fire,
you care not how soon it be quenched:
If you are but in fears by any doubts, or
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:63001:210"/>
ill tidings, you care not how soon your
fears be over. And yet are you afraid
of being to soon out of the power of the
Devil, and the danger of Hell; and of
being too soon the Sons of God, and the
holy, justified heirs of Heaven.</p>
               <p>22. Consider also: <hi>Either you can
turn now, or not. If you can, and yet
will not, you are utterly without excuse.
If you cannot to day, how much less will you
be able hereafter;</hi> when strength is less,
and difficulties greater, and burdens
more. Is it not time therefore to make
out to Christ for strength; and should
not the very sense of your disability dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you from delay?</p>
               <p>23. Consider <hi>how long you have staid
already,</hi> and put Gods Patience to it by
your folly: Hath not the Devil, the
world, and the flesh, had many years
time of your life already? Have you not
long enough been swallowing the poison
of sinne? and long enough been abusing
the Lord that made you, and the blood
of the Sonne of God, that was shed for
you, and the Spirit of Grace, that hath
moved and perswaded with you? Are
you not yet gone far enough from God?
and have you not yet done enough to the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:63001:211"/>
damning of your selves, and casting away
Everlasting Life. O wretched sinners;
it is rather time for you, to fall down on
your faces before the Lord, and with
tears and groans, to lament it, day and
night, that ever you have gone so far
in sinne, and delayed so long to turn to
him as you have done. Sure if after so
many years rebellion, you are yet so far
from lamenting it, that you had rather
have more of it, and had rather hold on
a little longer, no wonder if God forsake
you, and let you alone.</p>
               <p>24. Have you any hopes of Gods accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and your Salvation, or not? If
you have such hopes, <hi>that when you turn,
God will pardon all your sinnes, and
give you Everlasting Life: is it think you</hi>
an ingenious thing to desire to offend him
yet a little longer, <hi>from whom you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
such exceeding Mercy, and Glory
as you do? Have you the faces to speak
out what is in your hearts, and practice;
and to go to God with such words as
these;</hi> Lord I know I cannot have the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of one sinne, without the Blood of
Christ, and the riches of thy Mercy: Nor
can I be saved from Hell without it: But
yet I hope for all this from thy Grace: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:63001:211"/>
thee let me live a little longer in my
sinnes; a little longer let me trample on
the Blood of Christ, and despise thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and abuse thy Mercies; a little
longer let me spit in the face of thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and prefer the flesh, and the world
before thee, and then pardon me all that
ever I did, and take me into Glory.
<hi>Could you for shame put up such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
to God as this? If you could, you
are past shame: If not, then do not
practise and desire that, which you
cannot for shame speak out and request.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>25. Moreover, <hi>it is an exceeding ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to you, to come in to God betimes,
and an exceeding loss, that you will
suffer by delay,</hi> if you were sure to be
converted at the last. If you speedily
come in, you may have time to learn,
and get more understanding in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of God, then else can be expected:
For knowledg will not be had but by
time, and study. You may also have
time to get strength of Grace, when
young beginners can expect no more then
an infant strength: You may grow to be
men of parts and abilities, to be usefull
in the Church, and profitable to those
about you, when others cannot go or
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:63001:212"/>
stand, unless they lean on the stronger
for support. If you come in betime, you
may do God a great deale of service;
which in the evening of the day, you will
neither have strength, nor time to do.
You may have time to get Assurance of
Salvation, and to be ready with comfort
when death shall call: When a weakling
is like to be perplexed with doubts, and
fears, and death is like to be terrible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their unreadiness.</p>
               <p>26. And <hi>did you ever consider, who
and how many do stay for you while you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay?</hi>
Do you know who it is that you
make to waite your leisure. <hi>God himself</hi>
stands over you with the offers of his
Mercy, as if he thought it long till you
return, saying, <hi>O that there were such
a heart in them! and when will it once be?
How long ye simple will you love simplicity,
and scorners delight in scorning, and fools
hate knowledg? Turn you at my reproof.</hi>
Deut. 5 29. Jer. 13. 17. Prov. 1. 22.
And do you think it wise, or safe, or
mannerly for you to make the God of
Heaven to wait on you, while you are
serving his Enimy? Can you offer God
a baser indignity, then to expect that
he should support your lives, and feed
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:63001:212"/>
you, and preserve you, and patiently
forbeare you, while you abuse him to
his face, and drudg for the flesh, the
world, and the Devil? Should a worm
thus use the Lord that made him? You
will not your selves hold a candle in your
hands, while it burns your own fingers;
nor will you hold a nettle, or a wasp in
your hand to sting you; nor will you
keep a dog in your house, that is good
for nothing but to snarl at you, and bite
your Children, or worry your sheep:
And yet God hath long held up your
lives, while in stead of Light, you have
yielded nothing but a stinking snuff; and
in stead of graps you have brought forth
nothing but thorns and thistles; and while
you have snarled at his Children, and his
Flock, and done the worst you could
against him. And would you indeed put
God to wait on you thus, while you
serve the Devil yet one day more. Must
God as it were hold the drunkard the
candle while he reeles and spues? Must
he draw the curtain, while the filthy
wretch doth once more please his fleshly
lusts? Marvaile not, if he withdraw his
supporting Mercy, and let such wretches
drop into Hell.</p>

that all are waiting on you. The Angels
stay for the joy that is due to them upon
your Conversion. Ministers are study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and preaching, and praying for
you. Godly neighbours are praying,
and longing for your change. The
Springs, and rivers are flowing for you:
The winds blow for you: The Sunne
shines for you: The clouds raine for you:
The Earth bears fruit for you: The beasts
must labour, and suffer, and die for
you: All things are doing, and would
you stand still? or else do worse. What
hast makes the Sunne about the world, to
return in its time to give you light?
What hast make other Creatures in your
service? And yet must you delay. Must
God stay, and Christ, and the Spirit
stay; Must Angels stay, must Ministers
stay, must the Godly stay, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
stay, and all the Creatures stay
your leasure, while you are abusing
God, and your Souls, and others, and
while you delay, as if it were too soon to
turn?</p>
               <p>27. Consider, that <hi>when you were
lost, the Sonne of God did not delay the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:63001:213"/>
work of your Redemption.</hi> He presently
undertook it, and turned by the stroak
of damning Justice. In the fulness of
time he came and performed what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook:
he failed not one day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time. And will you now <hi>Delay</hi>
to accept the benefit, and turn to him?
Must he make such hast to save you at so
dear a rate, and now will you delay to
be saved.</p>
               <p>28. Moreover, <hi>God doth not delay to do
you good:</hi> You have the day and night in
their proper seasons: The Sunne doth
not faile to rise upon you at the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time: You have the Spring, and
Harvest in their meetest seasons: the
former and later raine in season. When
you are in want you have seasonable sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies:
and when your are in danger, you
have seasonable deliverance: And is it
meet or equal that you should refuse to
bring forth seasonable fruit, but still be
putting off God with your delaies?</p>
               <p>29. Moreover, <hi>When you are in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and necessity, you are then in hast
for deliverance, and relief.</hi> Then you
think every day a week till your danger
or suffering be past. If you be under the
pain of a disease, or in danger of death, or
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:63001:214"/>
under poverty, or oppression, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
you would have God relieve you
without delay: And yet you will not
turn to him without delay. Then you
are ready to cry out, <hi>How long, Lord,
how long</hi> till deliverance come: but you
will not hear God, when he cryeth to you
in your sinnes, <hi>How long will it be ere
you turn from your transgressions: when
shall it once be?</hi> When you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any outward deliverance, you care
not how soon; the sooner the better:
but when you are to turn to God, and
receive his Grace, and title to Glory,
then you care not how late, as if you had
no mind of it. Can you for shame beg
of God to hasten your deliverances, when
you remember your delaies, and still
continue to trifle with him, and draw
back?</p>
               <p>30. Your <hi>present prosperity, and
worldly delights are posting away without
Delay:</hi> and should you delay to make
sure of better in their stead? Time is
going; and health is going; youth is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
yea life is going: your riches are
taking wing: your fleshly pleasures do
perish in the very using: Your meat,
and drink is sweet to you little longer
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:63001:214"/>
then it is in your throat. Shortly you
must part with house, and lands, with
goods, and friends, and all your mirth,
and earthly business will be done. All this
you know; and yet will you delay to lay
up a durable treasure which you may
trust upon, and to provide you a better
tenement before you be turned out of
this? What will you do for a habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for pleasures and contents, when
all that you have now is spent and gone,
and Earth will afford you nothing but a
grave? If you could but <hi>keep that you
have,</hi> I should not much wonder, that
knowing so little of God, and another
world, you look not much after it: But
when you perceive death knocking at
your doores, and see that all your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comforts are packing up, and hasting
away, me thinks, if you have your
wits and sense about you, you should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
turn, and make sure of Heaven,
without any more delay.</p>
               <p>31. Consider also <hi>whether it be equal,
that you should delay your Conversion,
when you can seasonably dispatch your
worldly business, and when your flesh would
be provided for, you can hearken to it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Delay.</hi> You have wit enough to sow
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:63001:215"/>
your seed in season, and will not delay it
till the time of harvest: You will reap
your corn when it is ripe, and gather
your fruit when it is ripe, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.
You observe the seasons in the
course of your labours, day by day, and
year by year: You will not lie in bed
when you should be at your work, nor
delay all night to go to your rest; nor
suffer your servants to delay your busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
You will know your dinner time,
and supper time day by day: If you be
sick you will seek help without delay, lest
your disease should grow to be uncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And yet will you delay your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and the making sure of Heaven?
Why Sirs, shall these trifles be done
without delay, and shall your Salvation
be put off? In the Name of God Sirs
what do you think of? Do you imagine
that you can better suffer Hell-f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re, then
hunger, or nakedness? Or that you
can better bear the loss of Everlasting
Joyes, then the loss of your commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and provisions in the world. Sure
if you believe the life to come, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think so. And can you have while
for every thing, except that one thing,
which all the rest are meerly to promote?
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:63001:215"/>
and in comparison of which they are all
but dreams? Can you have while to
work, to plow, and sow, and reap, and
cannot you have while to prepare for
Eternal Life? Why Sirs, if you cannot
find time yet to search your hearts, and
turn to God, and prepare for death; give
over eating, and drinking, and sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and say, you cannot have time for
these. You may as wisely say so for these
smaller matters, as the greater.</p>
               <p>32. Moreover; <hi>if men offer you cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies,
and commodities for your bodies,
you will not stand Delaying, and need so
many perswasions to accept them.</hi> If your
Landlord would for nothing renew your
lease; if any man would give you houses,
or lands, would you delay so long before
you would accept them? A beggar at
your doore will not only thankfully take
your almes, without your intreaty, and
importunity, but will beg for it, and be
importunate with you to give it. And
yet will you Delay to accept the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
offers of Grace, which is a greater
thing?</p>
               <p>33. Ye Consider, that <hi>it is God that
is the Giver, and you that are the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
beggars, and receivers: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:63001:216"/>
it is fitter that you should wait on God
and call on him for his Grace, when he
seemeth to delay, and not that he should
waite on you.</hi> He can live without your
receiving, but you cannot live without
his giving. The beggar must be glad of
an alms at any time; and the condemned
person, of a pardon at any time: but
the giver may well expect that his gift be
received without delay, or else he may
let them go without it.</p>
               <p>34. And me thinks you <hi>should not deal
worse with God,</hi> when he comes to you
as a Physician to save your own Souls,
<hi>then you would do with a neighbour, or a
friend, when it is not for your own good,
but for theirs.</hi> If your neighbour lay
a dying, you would go and visit him
without delay: If he fell down in a
swoon, you would catch him up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay: If he fell into the fire, or
water, you would pluck him out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay: Yea you would do thus much
by a very beast. And yet will you delay
when it is not another, but your selves,
that are sinking, and drowning, and
within a step of death, and desparation?
If a woman be but in travaile, her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
will come to her without delay:
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:63001:216"/>
And yet when their own Souls are in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to sinne, and Satan, and a state of
death, they will let them lie there, year
after year, and when we desire them
to be Converted, here's nothing but
delaies.</p>
               <p>35. If yet you perceive not how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonably
you deale with God, and
your Souls, I beseech you consider <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you do not deal worse with him, then
you do with the Devil himself.</hi> If Satan or
his servants perswade you to sinne, you
delay not so long, but you are present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at it: You are ready to follow every
tipling companion, or gamester that
puts up the finger. You are as ready to
go, as they to invite you: The very
sight of the cup doth presently prevaile
with the drunkard: and the sight of his
filthy mate prevaileth with the fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour;
and sinne can be presently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
without delay. But when God
comes, when Christ calls, when the
Spirit moveth, when the minister per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth,
when Conscience is convinced,
we can have nothing after all, but wishes,
and purposes, and promises, with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies.
O what a stomack hath that man,
or what a brain, that will snatch at poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:63001:217"/>
and swallow dung and dirt with
greediness, without any chewing; and
when you offer him meat, stands sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and looking on it, and hardly will
be perswaded to put it in his mouth: and
if he do, he is chewing it so long, that
at last he even spits it out againe, and
cannot get it down. Thus deal ungodly
wretches, between their poisonous sins,
and the saving means, and Grace of
Christ.</p>
               <p>Nay more then this, so eager are they
on their sinne, that we are not able to
intreat them to delay it. When the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
man is but provoked, we cannot
perswade him to delay his rayling lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
so long as to consider first of the
issue. We cannot intreat the drunkard
to put off his drunkenness but for one
twelve-month, while he tryeth another
course: All the ministers in the Country
cannot perswade the worldling to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
his worldliness, and the proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
their pride, and the ungodly person
his ungodliness, for the space of one
moneth, or week, or day. And yet when
God hath a command, and a request to
them, to Turn to him, and be saved,
here they can Delay without our intreaty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:63001:217"/>
36. Consider also that <hi>it is not possible
for you to turn too soon; nor will you ever
have cause to repent of your speediness.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
may undoe you: but speedy turning
can do you no harm: I wonder what
hurt you think it can do you, to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reconciled to God. And why then
should there be any Delay, where it is
not possible to be too hasty. Do you
think that there is ever a Saint in Heaven,
yea or on Earth either, that is sorry that
he stayed not longer unconverted? No:
you shall never hear of such a repentance
from the mouth of any that is indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               <p>37. But I must tell you on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
side, that if <hi>ever you be so hapy as to be
Converted, you will Repent it, and an
hundred times Repent it, that you delayed
so long before you yielded.</hi> O how it will
grieve you when your hearts are melted
with the Love of God, and are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with the infinite kindness of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning,
saving Grace; that ever you
had the hearts to abuse such a God, and
deal so unkindly with him, and stand out
so long against that compassion that was
seeking your Salvation? O how it will
grieve your hearts to consider, that you
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:63001:218"/>
have spent so much of your lives in sinne,
for the Devil, and the flesh, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
world. O you will think with
your selves; was not God more worthy
of my youthfull daies? Had I not been
better have spent it in his Service, and the
work of my Salvation? Alas, that I
should wast such precious daies, and now
be so farre behind hand as I am! Now I
want that Faith, that Hope, that Love,
that Peace, that Assurance, that Joy in
the Holy Ghost, which I might have
had if I had spent those years for God,
which I spent in the service of the world,
and the flesh. Then I might have had
the comfort of a well spent life, and with
joy have now lookt back upon those
daies, and seen the good I had done to
others, and the honour I had brought to
God: whereas I must now look back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all those years with sorrow, and
shame, and anguish of mind. You will
think to your selves then a hundred times,
O that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had but that time againe to spend
for God, which I spent for sinne! and
to use for my Soul, which I wasted for
my bruitish flesh. Believe it, Sirs, if
ever you be converted, you must look
for these Repenting sorrows for all your
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:63001:218"/>
Delaies. (and that is the best that can
come of it) And who would now wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make work for sorrow?</p>
               <p>38 And I pray you consider, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it belongs of right to God or you, to
determine of the day and hour of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in?</hi> It is he that must give you the
pardon of your sinnes; and doth it not
then belong to him to appoint the time of
your receiving it? You cannot have
Christ, and life without him: It is he
that must give you the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
And is he not worthy then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
the time of your Conversion, that
you may be made partakers of it? But if
he say, <hi>To day,</hi> dare you say, <hi>I'l stay
till to morrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>30. Nay consider, <hi>whether God or you
be likelier to know the meetest time.</hi> Dare
you say that you know better when to
turn, then God doth. I suppose you
dare not: And if you dare not say so;
for shame let not your practice say so
God saith, <hi>To day, while it is called to
day, hear my voice, and harden not your
hearts.</hi> And dare you say, <hi>It's better
stay one moneth longer, or one day longer,</hi>
God saith, <hi>Behold this is the accepted
time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> behold this is the day of Salvation,</hi>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:63001:219"/>
2 Cor. 6. 2. And will you say, It's time
enough to morrow? Do you know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then God? If your Physician do but
tell you in a plurisie, or a feaver, you
must let blood this day before to morrow;
you will have so much reason as to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to his understanding, and think that
he knows better then you: And can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
you allow as much to the God of
Wisdom?</p>
               <p>40. Consider also, that the <hi>speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Conversion when God first calls
you, doth make you the more welcome,
and is a thing exceeding pleasing to God.</hi>
Our Proverb is, <hi>A speedy gift is a double
gift:</hi> If you ask any thing of a friend,
and he give it you presently, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
at the first asking, you will think
you have it with a good will: but if he
stand long delaying first and demurring
upon it, you will think you have it with
an ill will, and that you owe him the
smaller thanks. If a very beggar at your
doore must stay long for an alms, he will
think he is the less beholden to you. How
much more may God be displeased, when
he must stay so long for his own, and
that for your benefit? God loveth a
cheerfull giver; and consequently a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:63001:219"/>
Obeyer of his call: And if it be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and chearfull, it is the liker to be spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
without such delaies.</p>
               <p>41. And I would desire you <hi>but to do
with God as you would be done by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Would
you take it well of your Children if they
should tear all their cloaths, and cast
their meat to the doggs, and tread it in
the dirt, and when you intreat them to
give over, they will not regard you?
Would you stand month after month,
intreating and waiting on them, as God
doth on you, in a foolisher course?
Or rather would you not either soundly
whip them, or take their meat from
them, till hunger teach them to use it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
If your servant will spend the whole
day and year, in drinking and playing,
when he should do your work, will you
wait on him all the year with intreaties,
and pay him at last, as if he had served
you? And can you expect that God
should deal so by you?</p>
               <p>42 And consider I pray you, that
<hi>your Delay is a Denial,</hi> and so may God
interpret it. For the <hi>Time of your Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
is part of the <hi>Command.</hi> He that
saith <hi>Turn,</hi> saith <hi>Now,</hi> even <hi>To day,</hi>
without delay. He giveth you no longer
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:63001:220"/>
day: If time be lengthned, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er
made again and again, that's more
then he promised you, or you could have
promised your selves. His Command is,
<hi>Now Return and Live.</hi> And if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
the <hi>Time,</hi> the <hi>Present Time,</hi> you
refuse the offer, and forfeit the benefit.
And if you knew but what it is, to give
God a denial in such a case as this, and
what a case you were in if he should turn
away in wrath, and never come neer you
more, you would then be afraid of je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
with his hot displeasure, or dally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Lord.</p>
               <p>43. And me thinks you should remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that <hi>God doth not stay thus on all as
he doth on you.</hi> Thousands are under bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and despaire, and past all remedy,
while patience is waiting yet upon you.
Can you forget that others are in Hell at
this very hour, for as small sinnes as
those that you are yet intangled, and
linger in? Good Lord, what a thing
is a sensless heart? That at the same time
when millions are in misery, for delaying
or refusing to be Converted, their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
should fearlesly venture in their
steps. Surely if Faith had but opened
your ears, to hear the cries of those
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:63001:220"/>
damned Souls, you durst not imitate
them by your Delaies.</p>
               <p>44. And I must tell you, that <hi>God will
not alwaies thus wait on you,</hi> and attend
you by his patience, as hitherto he hath
done. Patience hath his appointed time.
And if you outstay that time, you are
miserable wretches. I can assure you
Sirs, the glass is turned upon you; and
when it is runne out, you shall never
have an hour of patience more: Then
God will no more intreate you to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.
He will not alwaies stand over
you with Salvation, and say, O that
this sinner would Repent and live! O
that he would take the Mercies that I
have provided for him! Do not expect
that God should do thus alwaies with
you: for it will not be.</p>
               <p>45. <hi>Your Delaies do weary the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Christ, that are employed for your
recovery.</hi> Ministers will grow weary of
preaching to you, and perswading you:
When we come to men that were never
warned before, we come in hopes, that
they will hear and obey: and this hope
puts life, and earnestness into our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions:
But when we have perswaded
men but a few times in vaine, and leave
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:63001:221"/>
them as we found them, our spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to droop and flag: Much more when
we have preached and perswaded you
many years, and still you are the same,
and are but where you were: This dulls
a Ministers spirit, and makes him preach
heavily and coldly, when he is almost
out of heart and hope. I do not justifie
Ministers in this, and say, they <hi>should</hi>
do thus: I know they <hi>should not;</hi> and if
they were perfect they <hi>would not:</hi> but
they are but men, and imperfect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
and what man is able to be as
lively and fervent in his work, when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
stir not, and he sees no good done
on the miserable hearers, as if he had
the encouragement of success? O when
we do but see the hearts of hardned, stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
sinners relent, and break, and melt
before the power of the Word, and
when we hear them cry out for Christ and
Mercy, and cry out against themselves
for their former folly, and confess their
sinnes, and ask us what they shall do to
be saved? and are but willing to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Christ the Physician of their Souls;
this would put life into a Preacher that
was cold and dull; this would even make
a stone to speak. But when we tell men
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:63001:221"/>
of Gods threatnings till they are past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
them, and tell you of Gods An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
till they seem to be past fearing it, and
tell them of the plague of sinne, till they
are past feeling; when in stead of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men to Faith, and Repentance, and
fear, and tenderness of heart, we preach
them into greater unbelief and careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and dead stupidity, this is enough
to dull or break the heart of almost any
Preacher in the world: What man is able
to sollow so fruitless a work with liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
And then it's you that will have
the loss, and danger of it: When you
have dried the brests, the child may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish:
If your Preachers could not
awake, and change you with all their
convincing arguments, and fervency,
how quietly may you sleep on when you
have flatted them by discouragements:
If Satan can either dismount, or make
useless these Cannons, that were wont
to batter his garrison, he may then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
you Souls in peace. You talk against
persecutors that silenced Ministers: But
O Sirs, it is you that are our greatest
persecutours, that refuse and delay to
yield to the calls of Christ by our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
and make us labour so much in
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:63001:222"/>
vaine: Though it be not in vaine as to
our own Souls, yet you make it in vaine
as to yours: When we have studied till
we almost break our braines, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till we have quite broke our strength,
and we are consumed, and worn away
with labour, and bodily paines that it
procureth, then you come after, and
make us requital by breaking our hearts,
by your delaies, and refusing to turn
and live. Truly Sirs, I must tell you for
my own part, that if it had not been for
those that gave me better encouragment
by their obedience, I should never
have held out with you a quarter of this
time: If all had profited as little as some,
and all had stuck as fast in an unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
state as some; if the humble penitent,
obedient ones among you, had not been
my comfort, and encouragment under
Christ, I had been gone from you
many a year ago; I could never have
held out till now: either my corruption
would have made me runne away with
<hi>Jonas;</hi> or my judgment would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to shake the dust of my feet,
as a witness against you, and depart:
But to what end do I speak all this to
you? To what end? Why? to let you
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:63001:222"/>
see how you abuse both God and man, by
your Delaies and disobedience. You
cannot possibly do us that are your
Teachers, a greater injurie or mischief in
the world. It is not in your power to
wrong us more. Are our studies, and
our labours worth nothing, think you?
Are our watchings and waiting, worth
nothing? Are our Praiers, and tears,
and groane; to be despised? God will
not despise them if you do: Believe it,
he will see them all on your score, and
you will on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> day have a heavy reconing of
them, and pay full deare for them. Is
it equal dealing with us, that when we
are watching for your Souls, as men that
know we must give an account, you
should rob us of our comfort, and make
us do it with sighes and sorrow? <hi>Heb.</hi>
13. 17. Yea that you should undo all
that we are doing, and make us lose our
labour and our hopes: And yet do you
not think to pay for this? I tell you
again, unconverted sinners, we are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with your delaies: Many years we
have been perswading you but to Turn
and live, and yet you are unturned: You
have been convinced long, and thinking
on it, and wishing long, and talking of
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:63001:223"/>
it, and promising long, and yet it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
and here is nothing but delaies.
We see while you delay, death takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
one this week, and another the
next week, and you are passing into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world apase; and yet those that are
left behind will take no warning, but
still delay: We see that Satan delaies not
while you delay: He is day and night at
work against you: if he seem to make a
truce with you, it is that he may be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
secretly while you suspect him
not: We see that sinne delaieth not while
you delay: It is working like poyson, or
infection in your bodies, and seazing
upon your vital powers; it's every day
blinding you more and more; it's har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening
your hearts more, and searing
up your Consciences, to bring you past
all feeling and hope: And must we stand
by, and see this miserable work with our
peoples Souls, and all be frustrate, and
rejected by themselves, that we do for
their deliverance? How long must we
stand by with the light in our hands,
while you are serving the flesh, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
that which we are sent to call you
to? It is not our business to hold you
the candle to play by, or to sleep by,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:63001:223"/>
or to sinne by: these are works that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
agree with the dark: But God sent us
to you on another message; even to Light
you out of your sinnes to him, that you
might be saved. Truly beloved hearers,
I must needs say, that the time seems
long, and very long to me, that I have
been preaching so many yeares to you
for Conversion, and for an Holy, Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life, even since I first knew you, and
that yet so many of you are drown'd in
sinne, and ignorance, and are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;
when I think your very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
tell you that it is a thing that must
be done: I tell you all these years do seem
to me a long time to wait on you in vain:
Blessed be the Lord that it hath not been
in vaine with some; or else I would scarce
preach any more then one other Sermon
to you, even to bid you farewel. I pray
you deal but fairly with us, and tell us
whether ever you will turn or not: If
you will not, but are resolved for sinne
and Hell, say so that we may know the
worst; speak out your minds, that we
may know what to trust to: For if we
once knew you would not turn, we
would soon have done with you, and
leave you to the Justice of God. But if
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:63001:224"/>
still you say, <hi>you will turn, when will you
do it?</hi> You <hi>will</hi> do it, and you <hi>hope</hi> you
shall, but when? How long would you
have us wait yet? Have you not abused
us enough? Nay I must tell you, that
you even weary God himself. It is his
own expression, <hi>Mal. 2. 17. Isa. 43.
24. Thou hast wearied me with thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi>
Isa. 1. 14. And I must say to
you as the Prophet, <hi>Isa. 7. 13. Is it a
small thing for you to weary men, but you
will weary my God also?</hi> Consider what
it is that you do.</p>
               <p>46. Consider also that <hi>you are at a
constant unspeakable loss every day and
hour that you Delay your Conversion.</hi>
O little do you know what you deprive
your selves of every day. If a slave in
the Gallies, or prison, might live at
Court as a favourite of the Prince, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and delight, and ease, would he
delay either years, or hours? Or would
he not rather think with himself, <hi>Is it
not better to be at ease, and in honour, then
to be here.</hi> As the Prodigal said, <hi>How
many hired servants of my fathers have
bread enough and to spare, and I perish
with hunger?</hi> All this while I might be
in plenty, and delight. All the while
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:63001:224"/>
that you live in sinne, you might be in
the favour of God; in the high and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
employments of the Sants; you
might have the comforts of daily Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Christ, and with the Saints;
you might be laying up for another
world, and might look death in the face,
with Faith and confidence, as one that
cannot be conquered by it; you might
live as the Heirs of Heaven on Earth: All
this and more then this, you lose by
your delaies: All the Mercies of God are
lost upon you: Your food and rayment,
you health and wealth, which you set so
much by, all is but lost and worse then lost,
for they turn to your greater hurt: All
our pains with you; and all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God which you possess; and
all your time, is lost and worss. And do
you think it indeed a wise mans part to
live any longer at such a loss as this, and
that wilfully and for nothing? If you
knew your loss, you would not think
so.</p>
               <p>47. Nay more, <hi>you are all this while
doing that which must be undone againe, or
you will be undone for ever.</hi> You are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from God; but you must come back
again or perish when all is done. You
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:63001:225"/>
are learning an hundred carnal lessons,
and false conceits, that must be all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnt
again: You are shutting up your
eies in wilful ignorance; which must be
opened again: You must lean the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ, the great Teacher of
the Church, if you stay never so long,
or else you shall be cut of from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22. &amp; 7. 37. When you
have been long accustoming your selves
to sinne, you must unlearn, and break
all those customes again: You are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
your hearts daily, and they must
again be softned. And I must tell you
that though a little time, and labour may
serve to do mischief, yet it is not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undone again. You may sooner set
your house on fire, than quench it when
you have done. You may sooner cut and
wound your bodies, then heal them
again: And sooner catch a cold, or a
disease, then cure it: You may quickly
do that which must be longer a undoing.
Besides; the cure is accompanied with
paine: You must take many a bitter
draught, in groanes or tears of godly
sorrow, for these delaies: The wounds
that you are now giving your Souls, must
smart, and smart again, before they are
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:63001:225"/>
searcht and healed to the bottom. And
what man of wisdom would make himself
such work and sorrow. Who would
travail on an hour longer, that knowes he
is out of his way, and must come back
again? Would you not think him a mad
man that would say, I will go on a little
further, and then I will turn back?</p>
               <p>I know <hi>Mr. Bilney</hi> the Martyr was
offended with this comparison, because
he thought it was against Free Grace.
But comparisons extend not to every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect:
There are two things in your sins
to be undone: the one is the Guilt, and
the other is the Habit and power of sin:
the first indeed is done away, when you
are Converted: but at the cost of Christ,
which should not be made light of: And
yet some scarres may be left behind, and
such twigs of Gods Rod may fall upon
you as shall make you wish you had come
sooner in. And for the habit of sinne,
though Conversion break the heart of it,
yet will it live and trouble you while you
live: and those sinnes that now you are
strengthning by your delaies, will be
thorns in your sides, and rebels in your
Country, and find you work as long as
you live. And thus I may well say that
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:63001:226"/>
you are doing that while you delay, that
must be long in undoing, and will not be
undone so easily as it is done; and you
are going on that way, that must be all
trod backward.</p>
               <p>48. And me thinks if it were but this,
it should terrifie you from your Delaies;
that it <hi>is likely to make your Conversion
more grievous, if you should have so great
Mercy from God, as after all to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</hi>
There is very <hi>few scape</hi> that are
so exceeding long in travaile: but if you
come to the birth, it's like to be with
double paine. For God must send either
some grievous affliction to fire and frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
you out of your sinnes, or else some
terrible gripes of Conscience, that shall
make you groane, and groane againe, in
the feeling of your folly. The pangs and
throws of Conscience, in the work
of Conversion, are far more grievous in
some then in others. Some are even on
the wrack, and almost brought besides
their wits, and the next step to despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with horror of Soul, and the sense
of the Wrath of God; so that they lie in
doubts and complaints many a year toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and think that they are even for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
of God. And to Delay your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:63001:226"/>
is the way to draw on either
this or worse.</p>
               <p>49. Consider also, that <hi>Delaies are
contrary to the very nature of the work,
and the nature of your Souls themselves.</hi>
If indeed you ever mean to turn, it is a
work of hast, and violence, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that you must needs set upon: <hi>You
must strive to enter in, for the gate is
strait, the way is narrow that leads to life,
and few there be that find it. Many shall
seek to enter, and shall not be able,</hi> Luke
33. 24, 25. <hi>When once the master of the
house is risen up, and hath shut to the
doore, and ye begin to stand without, and
knock at the doore, saying, Lord, Lord,
open to us, he shall answer, I know you not
whence you are: depart from me, all ye
workers of iniquity,</hi> vers. 27. It is a race
that you are to run, and Heaven is the
prize. <hi>And you know that they which run
in a race, run all: but one receiveth the
prize: and therefore you must so run, as
that you may win and obtain,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.
24, 25. And what is more contrary to
this then Delay? You are Souldiers in
fight, and your Salvation lieth on the
victory: and will you trifle in such a case,
when death or life is even at hand? You
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:63001:227"/>
are travailers to another world, and will
you stay till the day is almost past, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you will begin your journey? Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
is a work of that infinite conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and requireth such speedy, and
vigorous dispatch, that Delay is more
unreasonable in this then in any thing in
all the world.</p>
               <p>And besides, your Souls are Spirits,
of an excellent active nature; that will
not be kept idle: and therefore Delay is
unsuitable to their excellencie. The best
and noblest creatures are most active:
The basest are most dull, and unfit for
action: The earth will stand still: You
may easily keep clods and stones from
moving: But fire and winds that are
purer things, and the Sunne, and such
nobler sublimer creatures, you are not
able to keep idle for an hour. Who can
cause the Sunne to delay its <hi>Course?</hi> or
who can stay the ascending flames? And
therefore to your more excellent immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Souls, and that in a work that must
needs be done, how exceeding unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
are Delaies?</p>
               <p>50. If all this will not serve turn, let
me tell you, that <hi>while you are Delaying,
your Judgment doth not delay; and that
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:63001:227"/>
when it comes, these Delaies will multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
your misery, and the remembrance of
them, will be your Everlasting torment.</hi>
What ever you are thinking of, or what
ever you are doing, your dreadfull
doom is drawing on apace; and misery
will overtake you, before you are aware.
When you are in the Ale-house little
thinking of damnation, even then is your
damnation coming in hast: when you
are drown'd in the pleasures, or cares
of the world, your judgment is still ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening.
<hi>You</hi> may delay, but <hi>it</hi> will not
delay. It is the saying of the Holy
Ghost, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 3. Whose judgment
now of a long time lingereth not, and their
damnation slumbreth not.</hi> You may slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and that so carelesly that we cannot
awake you: but your damnation slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
not, nor hath not done of a long
time, while you thought it slumbred; and
when it comes, it will awaken you. As
a man that is in a coach on the road, or
a boat on the water, what ever he is
speaking, or thinking, or doing, he is
still going on, and hastening to his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neies
end, or going down the stream: So
what ever you think, or speak, or do,
whether you believe it, or mock at it,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:63001:228"/>
whether you sleep or wake, whether you
remember it or forget it, you are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening
to damnation, and you are every
day a day neerer to it then before: and
it is but a little while till you shall feel it.
<hi>Behold the Judg standeth before the doore,</hi>
Jam. 5. 9. The Holy Ghost hath told
you, <hi>The Lord is at hand,</hi> Phil. 4. 5.
<hi>The day is at hand; the time is at hand;
the end of all things is at hand,</hi> Rom. 13.
12. Rev. 22. 10. 1 Pet. 4. 7. <hi>Behold,</hi>
saith the Lord, <hi>I come quickly, and my
reward is with me, to give to every man
according as his work shall be,</hi> Rev. 22.
12. And do you as it were see the Judge
approaching, and damnation hasting on,
and yet will you delay?</p>
               <p>And withall consider, that when it
comes, it will be most sore to such as
you: and then what thoughts do you
think you shall have of these Delaies?
You are unable to conceive how it will
torment your Consciences, when you
see that all your hopes are gone, to think
what you have brought your selves to,
by your trifling: To feel your selves in
remediless misery, and remember how
long the Remedy was offered you, and
you Delaied to use it, till it was too late.
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:63001:228"/>
To see that you are for ever shut out of
Heaven, and remember that you might
have had it as well as others; but you lost
it by Delay. Oh then it will come with
horrour into your mind, <hi>How oft was I
perswaded, and told of this? how oft had
I inward motions to return? how oft was I
purposed to be holy, and to give up my
heart and life to God? I was even ready
to have yeelded; but I still delaied, and
now it is too late.</hi> Then you shall pay for
all our warnings, and all the Sermons
and motions which you lost.</p>
               <p>And now having laid you down no less
then fifty moving Considerations, if it
be possible to save you from these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies,
I conclude with this Request to
you whoever you be that read these
words; that you would but consider of
all these Reasons, and then entertaine
them as they deserve. There is not one
of them that you are able to gainsay;
much less all of them. If after the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of all these, you can yet believe
that you have reason to delay, your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
are forsaken of God: But
if you are forced to confess that you
should not Delay, what will you do
then? Will you obey God, and your
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:63001:229"/>
own Consciences, or will you not? Will
you Turn this hour without delay? Take
heed of denying it, lest you have never
such a motion more: You know not, but
God that calls you to it, may be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that it should be <hi>now or never.</hi> I
do beseech you, yea as his messenger I
charge you in his Name, that you Delay
not an hour longer, but presently be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
and make an unchangeable Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God; and as ever you would
have favour in that day of your distress,
delay not now to accept his favour, in
the day of your visitation. O what a
blessed family were that, which upon the
Reading of this, would presently say,
<hi>We have done exceeding foolishly in Delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so great a matter so long: Let us
agree together to give up our selves to God
without any more Delay. This shall be
the day: we'l stay no longer. The flesh,
and the world, and the Devil, have had
too much already: It's a wonder of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
that hath borne with us so long: we
will abuse the patience of God no longer;
but begin to be absolutely his this day.</hi> If
this may be the effect of these exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
you shall have the everlasting bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
But if still you Delay, I hope I
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:63001:229"/>
am free from the guilt of your blood.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="12" type="direction">
               <p>DIRECT. XII. The last Direction
that I shall give you, for preventing
your miscarriage in the work of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is this: <hi>Stop not in weak and wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Purposes, and faint attempts: but
see that you be groundedly, unreservedly,
and habitually</hi> (or firmly) <hi>Resolved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many good thoughts, and
meanings in the Soul, before <hi>Resolution:</hi>
but you are not truly Converted, till
you are <hi>Resolved,</hi> and thus <hi>Resolved</hi> as is
here exprest. Here I shall shew you,
1. What this <hi>Resolution</hi> is. 2. Why it
is so necessary: and 3. I shall urge you
to resolve: and 4. I shall Direct you
in it.</p>
               <p>1. Resolution is the firm or prevalent
Determination of the Will upon Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</p>
               <p>In opening this Definition, I shall
first shew you how we are led up to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
by Deliberation: and 2. What
is this Determination of the will.</p>
               <p>There are several steps, by which the
will doth rise up to <hi>Resolution,</hi> which I
shall set before you. And first it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:63001:230"/>
that in the state of corrupted
Nature, the Soul is <hi>unresolved</hi> for God,
if not (in many that are exceeding wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked)
<hi>Resolved against</hi> him. At first the
sinner doth either <hi>Resolve</hi> to be as he is,
or else he hath no <hi>Resolution</hi> to Return.
But God breaks many a wicked <hi>Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
or else woe to the ungodly; for
there were no hope. Many wicked
wretches, have not only neglected their
Souls; but also Resolved that they would
never lead a Holy life, nor never joyn
themselves to the Communion of Saints,
nor never leave their drunken company,
or be so precise, and make so great a
matter of sinne, as the Godly do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When
we urge them with the plainest Words of
God, and the most unquestionable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
so that they have not a word of sense
to speak against it. When we have told
them of the Command of God, and told
them of the certain danger of their Souls,
they will plainly tell us that they are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved</hi>
never to be so precise: When
they have nothing else to say, but non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
they will put us off with this, that
they are <hi>Resolved</hi> to venture their Souls
without so much adoe. But as Resolute
as they are, God will break and chang
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:63001:230"/>
their <hi>Resolution,</hi> and make them as much
Resolved of the clean contrary, if ever
he will save them. For woe to them that
ever they were born, if he should take
them at their word, and Resolve as they
Resolve!</p>
               <p>Now in this case there are many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
that men go through, before they
come to be <hi>Resolved</hi> for God.</p>
               <p>1. The first thing usually that befalleth
such a Soul, is some further <hi>Light,</hi> which
shews him that which before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not. 2. This Light causeth him to
begin to <hi>Doubt,</hi> whether all be so well
with him as he thought it had been; and
whether he were so wise in his former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
as he thought himself. 3. When
Light hath bred these Doubtings in his
mind, these Doubtings breed some <hi>Fears</hi>
within him, and he begins to be a little
awakened. Lest evil be neerer him then
he was aware of, and lest the threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings
of God, and his Ministers should
prove true. 4. These <hi>Fears</hi> do drive
him to <hi>Consider</hi> of the matter, and to
<hi>Deliberate</hi> what he is best to do: To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whether these things be so or not,
and what course he must take if they
should prove true. 5. Though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:63001:231"/>
God may bless the very first Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
to be the present means of true
conversion, yet that is no usual thing;
but ordinarily the first Considerations do
help the mind to some slight convictions,
so that the man begins to see a great deal
more then he did before; and so much
as puts him now past doubt that he was
before mistaken; and out of the way.
6. Finding himself, in this case, his
fears increase, and his grief comes on for
his former folly, and he finds himself in
a miserable case, and at a loss for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
7. By this much he is quickened
to a purpose or resolution, to hearken to
those that can instruct him, and enquire
of them that he thinks are in the right,
and to use such means as he is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with, to find out what he must do to
be saved. And accordingly he goes
among good company, and begins to
hear more diligently, and sensibly, and
to mark, and regard what he hears, and
reads; and also to cry to God in Prayer
for mercy and relief. But all this is but
from the Natural Fears of misery, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
in him by Common preparing
Grace. 8. In the use of these Means of
Grace, he begins better to understand,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:63001:231"/>
and relish the Doctrine of Redemption
by Jesus Christ, and the nature and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of true Sanctification by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost. And though sometime these
Evangelical Illuminations may be special
saving works at the very first, yet it's
more usual, especially with us that
are bred up under the Gospel, to have a
more superficial common Illumination,
before the saving Light come in. And by
this common Light, men have at first
but a general glimmering, and confused
Knowledg of a Saviour, and of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of Mercy to be had by him.
And sometime they have a distinct Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of <hi>some parts only</hi> of the Christian
Faith; and sometime a <hi>distinct</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
and belief of <hi>every Article;</hi> but
only <hi>superficial,</hi> and not savingly effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.
9. By this general, or superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Knowledg of Christ, and Mercy, a
kind of Hope ariseth in the heart, that
yet there is a possibility of escape: and a
kind of comfort answerable to this Hope.
10. These Hopes are accompanied with
some <hi>Desires</hi> to understand yet more of
the Mistery of the Gospel; and to be
made partakers of the saving Mercy of
which he hath had a confused light.
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:63001:232"/>
11. And hereupon there is further kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the will, a Purpose, or Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to go further on in learning, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
into the Will of God, and using
his means: And 12. This purpose is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and means are further used. And
thus far the Soul is but in Preparation,
and under the common workes of Grace,
and possibly may fall off and perish. The
first degree may be so stifled, that it shall
not reach unto the second; or the second
so stifled that it shall not reach unto the
third: But the most common stop is at
the third degree: when men are a little
frightened, they will not follow it on to
Consideration: And they that follow
Consideration diligently, do usually
speed well, and get through all the rest.</p>
               <p>But when the Soul is brought thus
farre, if God will save it, he next proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eds
to this much more: 1. He giveth a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Light into the Soul, which giveth a
more distinct, or at least a more pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
convincing, deep and savoury ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the essentials of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
then he ever had before.</p>
               <p>Where note of this special Heavenly
light, 1. The <hi>being,</hi> usually the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of a more common knowledg,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:63001:232"/>
therefore most ordinarily the sum of
Christian Doctrine is in some manner
known before. 2. That it doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
only some one point of Faith alone,
and then another, and so on: as if we
savingly knew one essential point of
Faith, when we have no saving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the rest: For that is a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
But finding all these Truths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the mind before by a common
Knowledg, the special Light comes in
upon them all at once; and so shews us
the Anatomy of Christianity, or the
parts of Gods Image in one frame, as to
the essentials. 3. For the understanding
of which you must further know, that
there is such an inseparable connection of
these Truths, and such a dependance of
one upon another, that it is not possible
to know one of them truly, and not
know all. For example, Believing in
Jesus Christ, is an act so inseparable
from the rest, that (if the essentials of
Christianity be not essential to it) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
you cannot do this without them.
For to Believe in Christ, is essentially to
believe in him as God and man, two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in one Person, by Office the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
our Redeemer and Saviour, to
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:63001:233"/>
save us from guilt and sinne, from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and pollution, and to give
us by the Holy Ghost, a Holy nature and
life, and to give us the forgiveness of
sinne, and Everlasting life, and so to
restore us to the mutual Love of God
here, and fruition of him hereafter: and
all this as merited and procured by his
Death, Obedience, Resurrection, Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and Intercession for his Church.
Whether here be all that is Essential to
Christianity, and absolutely necessary to
Salvation to be believed, I leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;
but sure I am that all this is
Essential to saving Justifying Faith. And
Christ is not taken as Christ, if he be not
thus taken: For the Ends thus enter the
definition of his Relation as the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and Saviour, and Lord.</p>
               <p>So that the Love of God as our felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and End, and the belief in Christ, as
the way, are both together in the same
minute of time, which soever of them be
first in order of nature: (which is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
that I dare not here so unseasonably
handle)</p>
               <p>2. Upon this special Illumination of
the Soul, and the special Consideration
with which it doth concurre; the Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:63001:233"/>
Soul is presently Resolved. And in
these two Acts which alwaies go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
consisteth the special Sanctifying
Work: Even in the <hi>Illumination,</hi> and
<hi>Estimation</hi> of the Understanding, and
in the true <hi>Resolution</hi> of the Will.</p>
               <p>2. The Determination of the Will, is
its own free act, performed by its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
self determining power, procured
by the special Grace of God (I mean in
this special case) It followeth Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
While we are unresolved, we
Deliberate what to Resolve upon; that
is, we are considering which is best and
most eligible, and which not; and as we
practically judg, we use to Determine,
and to choose. And when this choice after
Deliberation is peremtory and full, it's
called Resolution.</p>
               <p>So that my meaning is to let you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that when the Matter of our
Faith is set open to the Soul, it is not a
wavering fickle purpose, that is a saving
closure with it, but it must be a <hi>firm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</hi>
Much less will it ever bring a
man to Heaven, to be <hi>thinking and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating</hi>
what to do, as long as he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved.
And now I shall prove the
Necessity of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:63001:234"/>
II. Till you are Resolved, you are not
Converted, and that appeareth by these
Evidences. 1. If you are not <hi>firmly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,</hi>
it is certain that you do not <hi>firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe.</hi> For such as your <hi>Belief</hi> is,
such will be the effects of it upon the <hi>Will.</hi>
An unsound Opinionative belief, will
produce but tottering, languishing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses:
but a firm belief will cause a firm
Resolution of the Will. And if your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
be unsound, you must confess you
are unconverted.</p>
               <p>2. Moreover, if you do not esteem
God above all Creatures, and Heaven
above Earth, and Christ and Grace
above sinne, you are certainly uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.
But if you have such a true <hi>esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
you will certainly have a firm
Resolution. For you will Resolve for
that which you highly esteem.</p>
               <p>3. If God have not your firm Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he hath not indeed your Heart
and Will: For to give God your Hearts
and Wills, is principally by firm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
for him. And if God have not
your Hearts, you are sure unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>4. Moreover, if you are not firmly
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:63001:234"/>
Resolved, your <hi>Affections</hi> will not be
<hi>sincere and stedfast.</hi> For all the <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are such as to their <hi>sincerity,</hi> as the
<hi>Will</hi> is, which doth excite or command
them And nothing is more mutable then
the <hi>Affections</hi> in <hi>themselves</hi> considered:
They will be hot to day, and cold to
morrow, if they be not rooted in the
<hi>firm Resolution</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> which is the
life of them.</p>
               <p>5. Lastly, Without a <hi>firm Resolution,</hi>
there can be no <hi>faithfull obedience</hi> and
<hi>execution,</hi> of the Will of God. For if
men be not <hi>Resolved,</hi> they will heavily go
on, and lazilie proceed, and easily come
off: For their hands go to work without
their hearts. It is the greatest work in
all the world, that God calls you to;
and none but the <hi>Resolved</hi> are able to go
through with it. Of which we shall give
you a fuller account anon.</p>
               <p>III. In the next place, let me intreat
you, in the feare of God, to look after
this great and Necessary part of your
Conversion. There are many degrees of
good motions in the mind; but all that
falls short of Resolution is un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound.
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:63001:235"/>
Many are brought to Doubt whether all
be well with them, and to have some
fears thereupon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that yet will not be
brought so far as to consider soberly of
the matter, and deliberate what is best
to be done, and to advise with their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
for the furthering of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Many that are perswaded so far
as to consider, and deliberate, and take
advice, yet go no further then some cold
wishes, or purposes, which are all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by the love of the world, and the
power of their sinnes Many that do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to some kind of Practice, do only
take a tast, or an essay of Religion, to
try how they can like it; and begin some
kind of outward Reformation, without
any firm Resolution to go through with
it: Or if their purposes seem strong, it is
but occasioned by something without,
and not from a setled habit within. All
these are short of a state of special Saving
Grace, and must be numbred with the
unconverted.</p>
               <p>It is a common, and very dangerous
mistake, that many are undone by, to
think that every good Desire is a certain
sign of Saving Grace: Whereas you may
have more then <hi>bare Desires,</hi> even <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,</hi>
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:63001:235"/>
and <hi>promises,</hi> and <hi>some performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and yet perish for want of <hi>Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Regeneration.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Do you think
that <hi>Judas</hi> himself had not some <hi>good
Desires,</hi> that followed Christ so long,
and preached the Gospel? Do you
think that <hi>Herod</hi> had not some <hi>good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,</hi>
that heard <hi>John</hi> gladly, and did
many things accordingly? <hi>Agrippa</hi> had
some <hi>good Desires,</hi> when he was almost
perswaded to be a <hi>Christian.</hi> They that
for a time believe have sure some <hi>good
Desires,</hi> and more, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 20.
And so had the young man, that went
away sorrowfull from Christ, when he
could not be his Disciple; unless he would
part with <hi>all</hi> that he had, <hi>Luke 18. 23.
Matth.</hi> 19. 22. And doubtless those
had more then good Desires, that had
<hi>known the way of Righteousness, and had
escaped the pollutions of the world, through
the knowledg of the Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 20, 21. And so
had those, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 29. That had
<hi>received the knowledg of the Truth, and
were Sanctified by the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
And those <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. That
<hi>were once inlightened, and tafted of the
Heavenly gift, and were made partakers</hi>
                  <pb n="454" facs="tcp:63001:236"/>
of the Holy Ghost, and tasted the good
Word of God, and the powers of the world
to come. <hi>And sure</hi> Ananias <hi>and</hi> Saphira
<hi>had more then some</hi> good Desires, <hi>when
they</hi> sold all, and brought half the price to
the Apostles.</p>
               <p>Believe it Sirs, there are none of your
Desires, or Endeavours, that will serve
turn, to prove you in a state of Grace,
unless they be accompanied with firm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.
Be it known to you that you
are unconverted, if you are not <hi>habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Resolved.</hi> And therefore I must here
intreat you all, to put the question close
to your hearts, Are you <hi>Resolved; firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Resolved,</hi> to give up your selves and
all to Christ, and to be wholly his, and
follow his conduct? or are you not?
The question is not, what good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
or wishes, or purposes, you may
have, but whether you are <hi>Resolved,</hi> and
<hi>firmly Resolved?</hi> Take heed Sirs, what
you venture your Souls upon: God will
not be dallied with, nor be deceived.
He will have no <hi>unresolved,</hi> false-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
servants.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed to urge you further,
I shall here tell you what <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
it must be, that will prove a man
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:63001:236"/>
                  <hi>converted:</hi> and then I shall give you such
<hi>Motives</hi> as should perswade you to it.</p>
               <p>It is not <hi>all kind</hi> of <hi>Resolution</hi> that will
serve turn; but it is only that which hath
these following properties, that will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
a state of Grace.</p>
               <p>1. As to the <hi>Matter,</hi> it must be the
whole Essence of Christianity, that must
be Resolved on. It must be no less then a
closing with God as your chiefest happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to be Loved above all, and as
your chiefest Lord to be obeyed before
all: and a closing with Jesus Christ, as
your only Saviour, your Teacher, and
your Lord; to bring your hearts again
to God, and reconcile you to him: and
a closing with the Holy Ghost as your
Sanctifier, to make you a holy people,
and clense you from all your sinne of
heart and life, and guide you by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
Word, and Ordinances, to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life. Thus must you Resolve to
deliver up your selves to God the Father,
Sonne, and Holy Ghost, to be made a
peculiar people, zealous of good works.
Should you be never so Resolute in some
point of Religion, and as <hi>Ananias</hi> to
give God Half, and to become half Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
and half Holy, and half Heavenly,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:63001:237"/>
this is but to be half Christians, and will
not bring you half way to Heaven: It's
entire Christianity that must be Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on.</p>
               <p>2. You must also be <hi>Resolved</hi> for <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
obedience, and to turn without any
more delay; and not only Resolve to
turn to <hi>morrow,</hi> or sometime hereafter.
No Resolution is sincere in this case, if it be
but for the future: If you had rather stay
but one day or hour longer in the state
of sinne, and service of the flesh, you
are no true Disciples of Christ, though
you should be Resolved to turn to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>3. And your Resolution must be <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi>
and peremptory, not only <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
any secret <hi>Reserves,</hi> but <hi>Positively</hi>
against any such Reserves. Here it is
that <hi>Hypocrites</hi> commonly fall short:
They see they must mend, and they are
convinced that a holy life is necessary,
and they Resolve hereupon to change
their course, and turn religious: but
either it is with this secret Reserve, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
alwaies that I look to my credit, or
estate, or life, what ever I do, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that I go no further in Religion then
will stand with these; provided that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:63001:237"/>
be not my undoing in the world.</hi> Or
else if he have not actually such thougths,
he hath them alwaies virtually, and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually:
He is not Resolved <hi>against</hi> such
Reserves: He hath not considered that
Christ will have no Disciples that cannot
and will not part with all; and that if he
hope for Heaven, he must not look for
a treasure on earth, but only pass
through the world as a travailer, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in it as the harvest of the Lord, in
expectation of a Reward and Rest here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
and so Resolved to take Christ on
these self denying terms. But he that
will be saved must be <hi>thus</hi> resolved: Even
to sell <hi>all,</hi> to buy the unvaluable <hi>pearl,</hi>
Matth. 13. 46, 47. To make sure of
Heaven, though he lose all on Earth by
it: to lay up his hopes in the life to
come, and venture, and let go all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then those hopes: to take Christ
absolutely upon his own terms, for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and worse, as being certain that there
is no other way to life, and that there is
no danger of losing by him. The Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
is like a man that when he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
up the possession of his house, will
make his bargain, that he will keep this
room, or that room to himself, for his
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:63001:238"/>
own use. Or like a servant that will not
be hired but on Condition that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
shall not set him to such or such
work that he loves not: But Christ will
have no such servants: You must deliver
up all to him, or he will accept of none:
You must give <hi>him</hi> leave to make his
Conditions for you, and tell you on
what terms you must serve him, and
wholly referre the matter <hi>to him,</hi> even
for life it self, and not offer to put Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
upon him, and think to bring
<hi>him</hi> to any terms of yours. It is not true
Resolution unless it be Absolute, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reserved,
and against all reserves: Yea,
and that also as to perseverance; that
you Resolve to give up your selves <hi>finally</hi>
as well as <hi>totally,</hi> not only without any
Reserve of a Revocation, but against any
such Revocation: It must not be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Christ upon essay, or meer tryal,
that if you do not like you may leave
again: But you must make an unchanga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
everlasting Covenant: It must be
part of your Covenant, that you will
never revoke it.</p>
               <p>4. Moreover, your Resolution must
be <hi>well grounded:</hi> You must know what
the <hi>Essentials</hi> are of that Religion which
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:63001:238"/>
you Resolve on, and you must be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to it by right and weighty Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
and go upon reasons that will
hold up your Resolution. For should
you Resolve on the most necessary work
(as this is) upon mistakes, and wrong,
or insufficient Reasons, as the will of
man, the custom of the country, the
reputation of Christianity, or only such
like; there is no likelyhood that your
Resolution should endure, and it is not
sincere while it doth endure.</p>
               <p>5. Your Resolution must be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with a <hi>sense of your own insufficiency,</hi>
to stand to it immutably, and execute it
faithfully by your own strength; as
knowing the corruption, and deceitfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our own heart: And it must be
strengthned, and supported by a <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
or <hi>dependance</hi> on the <hi>sufficiency of
Christ.</hi> on whose Grace, and Spirit you
must rely, both for the continuing, and the
performing of your Resolutions; as
knowing that without him you can do
nothing, but that you can do all things
(necessary) through Christ strengthning
you.</p>
               <p>6. Lastly, Your Resolution is not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
sincere, unless it be <hi>habitually.</hi> It
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:63001:239"/>
is a very hard question, how far some
moving exhortation, or the approach
of death in sicknes, may prevaile with
the unsanctified for an <hi>Actual</hi> Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Undoubtedly very farre: But
that's a mans mind and will which is <hi>Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi>
his mind and will: When the very
Inclination, and bent of your will is
Right, then only is your heart right.
A bowle may by a rub, or banck, be
turned contrary to the byas: but when it
is over the rub it will follow the byas
againe in its ordinary course. The flame
may be hindred from assending a little
while, but when it is got over the stop,
it will be mounting upward. A stone will
move upwards against its Nature, while
it is followed by the strength of the hand
that cast it; but when the strength is
spent, it will quickly fall again. It is not an
extraordinary act, that you can try your
selves by, but such a free course and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of your lives, as will prove that you
have a <hi>new Nature,</hi> or a <hi>heart Inclined
and Habituated to God.</hi> The main busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
therefore is to prove that you are
<hi>Habituallly Resolved.</hi> Set all these toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
now, and you may see what Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
it is, that must prove you to be
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:63001:239"/>
Converted. 1. It must be a Resolution
for all the Essence of Christianity, and
not only some part. 2. It must be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
for <hi>present</hi> Obedience, and not
only for some distant time to come: 3. It
must be an <hi>Absolute,</hi> peremptory Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
without and against <hi>Reserves</hi> for
the flesh: both <hi>Total,</hi> and final; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
and against any Revocation. 4. It
must be <hi>soundly grounded;</hi> and <hi>moved</hi> by
<hi>right Principles:</hi> 5. It must be joyned
with a <hi>humble sence of your insufficiency,</hi>
and a dependance on Christ, for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing,
and performing it. And 6. It
must be <hi>Habitual,</hi> and such as sets right
the bent and drift of heart and life. All
this is of Necessity.</p>
               <p>Well Sirs; you see now what you <hi>must</hi>
do: the next question then is, what you
<hi>will</hi> do? A great many of motions God
hath made to you, to let go your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and wickedness, and become New
Creatures, and live to God, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
could you be got to Resolve, and
obey them. Many thoughts you have
had of it, I suppose; and long you have
been purposing that: Turn you would;
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:63001:240"/>
but all have come to little or nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you were never fully Resolved. I
am once more sent to you on this mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
from God, to see whether yet you
will Resolve: Whether after all you tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
delaies, and after all your wilfull
sinning, and abuse of Gods Patience,
against your own knowledg and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
you will yet Resolve. What say
you? Shall God be your Master indeed,
and shall Christ be your Saviour &amp; Lord?
Shall Heaven be your happiness, and have
your hearts indeed? Shall Holiness be
your business indeed? and shall sinne be
your hatred, and the flesh and the world
be your enemies indeed, and used accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
from this day forward, without
any more ado? I beseech you Sirs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
and fully Resolve.</p>
               <p>And because I know if we prevaile not
with you in this you are undone for ever,
and therefore I am loath to let you go
before we have brought you, if it may
be, to Resolve: I will give you here
some Considerations to turn the scales,
and if you will but read them, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
consider of them, I shall have great
hope to prevail with you, yet after all.
One would think that the fifty Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:63001:240"/>
under the last Direction might
suffice: But lest all should be too little, I
will add these following.</p>
               <p>1. Consider I beseech you, <hi>what lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you have had to think of the matter.</hi>
You have lived many years in the world
already; and you have had nothing to
do in it, but to seek after true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
Even your worldly labours ought
to have been all but in order to this. And
yet are you <hi>unresolved?</hi> Alas Sirs, have
you lived some twenty some thirty years
and more in the world, and yet are you
not Resolved, what you came hither for,
or what you have to do here? Is it
twenty, or thirty, or fourty years, since
you set out, and should by this time have
been farre on your journey, and are
you yet <hi>unresolved whither</hi> to go, or
<hi>which way</hi> to go? As if you were newly
entering the world, or as if you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of your business. I think so
many years are a faire time of Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and it's time to be Resolved, if
you will Resolve at all.</p>
               <p>2. And I pray you consider, <hi>what
Helps you have had to have Resolved you
before this.</hi> If you did not <hi>know</hi> what you
had to look after, and which way to
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:63001:241"/>
take, you should have enquired: You
had the Word of God to advise with; and
you had your Teachers to advise with;
and many experienced Christians to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
with. You wanted not for the
wisest faithfulest Counsailers; if you had
been but willing and diligent, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you might have been Resolved long
ago.</p>
               <p>3 And consider I beseech you, what a
case it is that you are unresolved in: Is it
so hard a question that all this time, and
all these helps cannot Resolve you?
What? whether God or the flesh should
be first obeyed, and loved? Whether
Heaven or Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eternal Glory or the
transitory pleasures of sinne should be
preferred? Whether you should care
and labour more to be saved from sinne
and Hell, or from poverty and worldly
crosses, and reproaches? These, and
such like are the questions to be Resolved:
And are these so hard, that all your wit,
and all the advise you can have from
Scripture and Ministers, would not serve
turn to help you to a Resolution, no not
in twenty or thirty years time? O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful!
that ever the Devil should be
able so to befool men! That Reasonable
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:63001:241"/>
Creatures should be so phrenet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck, that
they cannot be resolved whether it be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be saved, or be damned? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sinne with Hell after it, be better
than Holiness with Heaven after? The
Lord have Mercy upon the poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
world, and bring some more of
them to their wits! We have <hi>Wise men,</hi>
if themselves may be judges; very wise
in their own conceit, that know many
great matters in the world, and yet do
not practically know whether God or
the Devil be the better master; whether
sinne or Holiness be the better work;
and whether Heaven or Hell be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wages? If they say <hi>They know</hi>
these things, judge by their lives whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they <hi>know</hi> them <hi>Practically</hi> or not?
<hi>Resolve</hi> they will not for God, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and Heaven, nor against the
flesh, the world, and sinne; whatever
they may be brought to confess to their
self-condemnation. Is it not a pitifull
case, that such points as these, should
seem so hard to reasonable men, as to be
so long in Resolving of them?</p>
               <p>4. And I pray you Consider, <hi>How
horribly by this you disgrace your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.</hi>
You that cannot abide to be
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:63001:242"/>
derided as sots and fools in the world, do
yet abuse your selves thus grosly, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
there were never greater sots scarce upon
the Earth. We have proud men that are
so high in their now eies, that they can
hardly endure contempt from others,
and love almost none that think but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or dishonourably of them; and yet
what a horrible contempt and dishonour
do they cast upon themselves? If one of
these our wise neighbours, should study
seaven years, to know whether the Sea
be fire or water, whether a mountain be
heavy? Whether the fire be hot or
cold? and could not be Resolved after
so many years Consideration; what
would you think and say of these wise
men? Why Sirs, it is far grosser folly,
I tell you again, it is far grosser folly, to
be unresolved whether you should be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or unholy? which is in plain English,
whether it be better go to Heaven or to
Hell? For Faith and Holiness is the way
to Heaven; and an unholy life is the way
to Hell: And if you will needs forsake
the <hi>way to</hi> Heaven, you may hope to
come thither as long as you will; but you
may as well hope to touch the Moon with
your finger, or to runne up and down
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:63001:242"/>
with a mountain on your backs. And if
you will hold on in the <hi>way</hi> to Hell, that
is, in an unsanctified state, you may
say you hope for all that to escape Hell,
even as wisely as to leap into the Sea, and
say I hope to scape drowning, or to
throw down your selves headlong from
the top of the steeple, and say I hope to
scape hurting me, as well as you. Sirs,
I beseech you do not abuse God, and abuse
Christ, and the Spirit, and Scripture,
and withall abuse your immortal Souls,
for I know not what; for a stinking sin;
for a thing of nought: Your Souls are
noble Creatures, and your understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are noble faculties: Why will you
expose them to be the scorn of Satan,
and make them so base and sottish as you
do? You can see the folly of a poor
drunkard, that will make a beast of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and go reeling and talking non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
about the street, for the boies to
hoot at him, and make himself the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-stock
of the town: And I pray you
why do you not understand, that till you
are Resolved for a Holy, Heavenly life,
you are all drunk, while you think your
selves to be sober? You are as miserable
as the other, and more in this, that
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:63001:243"/>
yours is in your natures, and theirs is
but an accident; yours is continued, and
theirs (in that particular) but by fits.
In the Name of God Sirs, bethink you,
whether you can possibly more disgrace
your wits, then to be unresolved of a
case as plain as the high way, and which
your Everlasting Salvation or damnation
lieth on? If one of you could not in
twenty years be Resolved; whether the
the Sunne be light or dark, or whether
the day or the night be fitter for rest; or
whether it be better plow and sow, or
let all alone, and hope God will give
you a crop without labour; would you
take this for a wise man? Again I tell
you, your folly is more gross, that
cannot all this while be Resolved, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you should cast away your wilfull
sinnes, and give up your selves to Christ,
and a Holy life, to obtain the Glory,
and scape the misery that is hard at hand.
If you stood up to the neck in the water,
or stood but in a storm of raine, you
would not be so long in deliberating,
whether it were better for you to stay
there longer or come out. If your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
were but in the fire, you need not
so long a deliberation, whether you
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:63001:243"/>
should take it out. Any yet these wise
men, are under many thousand unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
sinnes, and under the curse of the
Law of God, and within a step of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
fire, and have no way possible to
escape, but by Conversion, Faith and
Holiness; and this God hath told them,
as plain as the tongue of man can speak,
and yet they are <hi>Considering</hi> of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be best to come out of it; and <hi>yet</hi>
they cannot be Resolved? Did I say
They are <hi>Consid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ring?</hi> Nay, the Lord
be mercifull to them, they are so dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
and besotted, that they do not
so much as <hi>seriously Consider</hi> of it: But
even runne on without <hi>Consideration:</hi>
Ah poor wretches! They are ready to
go to another world, and may look eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day when the bell toles for them, and
when death will bring them to their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
life, and yet they have not wit
enough, to <hi>Resolve</hi> whether they should
make ready: no nor with enough in their
most carless, worldly state, to know
that they <hi>are unready.</hi> Death is coming,
and Judgment is coming, and the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wrath of God is coming, and are
even at the doore; and yet these wise
men are unresolved of that only way that
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:63001:244"/>
is of absolute necessity to their safety;
They must have more time yet to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the matter, whether it be best for
them to turn or no? They stand at the
very brink of Hell; and yet they must
further consider of it, whether it be better
to turn back or to go on: Nay they will
go on without Consideration! And yet
these men would take it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aynously, if
one should lay hands on them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
them to <hi>Bedlam;</hi> or but tell them of
the hundreth part of the sottishness that
they are guilty of.</p>
               <p>5. And it is further considerable, that
<hi>these men that are all this while unresolved,
about their Conversion and Sanctification,
have wit enough to resolve of doubtfuller,
and less necessary matters, without any
such advising or delaies:</hi> And they are
men of ordinary parts and capacities,
for the matters of this world. They can
eat when they are hungry, and drink
when they are thirsty, without a twelve-months
tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to advise first on it: They
can resolve to go to bed at night, and to
rise in the morning, without a years or
a daies deliberation. If they have any
thing to buy or sell, they will not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
upon it till the market be past: If
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:63001:244"/>
they have their land to plow, or their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orn to sow, or reap, or mow, they
will not take a twelve months time to
pause upon it. They can quicky Resolve
upon their every-daies business, their
travails, their labours, and all their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
affaires. And yet these <hi>same men</hi>
cannot Resolve in seaven years time, and
seaven to that, whether Heaven or Earth
should be more loved and laboured for?
Or whether a corruptible flesh, a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
fancie, a greedy throat, should be
pleased before the God of Heaven,
though the pleasing of it cost them the loss
of their Salvation?</p>
               <p>Why Sirs, a man that is well in his
wits, would think that these matters
should be more out of doubt then the
former, and speedilier resolved on?
One would think it should be an easier
question, whether you should turn to
God and a Holy life, for the saving of
your immortal Souls? then whether you
should eate, or drink, or sleep, for the
preservation of your bodies? For I can in
many cases bring some reason that should
perswade you to forbeare eating, or drink<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing,
or sleeping for a considerable time:
but no man breathing can speak a word
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:63001:245"/>
of reason (except mens folly should be
called <hi>Reason,)</hi> that should perswade
you to forbear your Conversion for a
minute. And if you mistake about these
<hi>bodily</hi> matters, the loss may be repaired,
at least in the world to come: but if you
die before you are Resolved, and firmly
Resolved, to give up your Soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to Christ, and live a Holy, Heavenly
life, you are undone body and Soul for
ever, and all the world can never save
you.</p>
               <p>Oh what a strange and horrible thing
is it, that a man that hath the wit to
mannage his affaires as plausibly as any of
his neighbours, that can overwit others
in the matters of the world; that can
govern Towns and Countries; that is
learned in his Profession, in Law, in
Physick, in Merchandize, in Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or any the like; I say, that a man of
so deep a reach, so plodding and active
a wit as this, should yet be unresolved,
yea at 30 or 40 years old be unresolved,
whether to be Sanctified or unsanctified;
whether to be Holy and be Saved, or to
be unholy, though God hath professed
expresly that such shall not see the face
of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. These are our
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:63001:245"/>
wise men, these are too many (besides
the ignorant country men) of our
Gentlemen, our Worshipfull, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
men, our great Schollars, and
men of noble or reverend esteem; that
yet are unresolved, whether to be saved
or to be damned. Though God hath
written a Bible to Resolve them, and a
thousand books are written to Resolve
them; and Preachers are studying, and
preaching to Resolve them; and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
mercies are cast into the scales, that
one would think should help to turn
them; and some sharp afflictions are
helping to Resolve them; and twenty,
or fourty years certain experience, of
the vanity of this world, the deceitfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of riches, and honour, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and the unprofitableness of sinne,
one would think should Resolve them;
yet after all this they are <hi>unresolved,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they should presently let go their
sinne, and whether God, or the flesh
should be pleased or displeased? If this
be the wisdom of these men, the Lord
bless me, and all his chosen, from such
wisdom!</p>
               <p>6. Nay consider further of <hi>your unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
wickedness: Are not many of your
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:63001:246"/>
Judgments Resolved, when yet your hearts
and wils are unresolved.</hi> I am confident,
nay I am certain it is so. You are at once
both <hi>Resolved and unresolved.</hi> What a
confusion and warre do you thus make
in your own Souls? The Judgment is
for one thing, and the Will and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are for another thing. What? are
you not led by Reason? Will you let
out your Affections, and lead your lives,
quite contrary to your knowledg. Would
not most of you give it me as your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
under your hands, that it's a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times better to cast away your drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
your filthiness, your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and other known sinnes, then to
keep them any longer? What say you?
are you not Convinced that it were
your wisest course to part with them this
very day and hour? Undoubtedly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of you are. And yet for all this will
you not Resolve to do it? Are you not
perswaded in your Consciences, that it's
better to dye in a Holy and Heavenly
state, then in a loose and careles world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
state? And that it were your safest,
and wisest course to become New men,
and lead a Holy Heavenly life without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.
Dare you deny this? Is it not
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:63001:246"/>
your Judgment? And yet will you not
do it? Are you Resolved that it <hi>should</hi>
be done, and <hi>must</hi> be done, and yet will
you not Resolve to <hi>do</hi> it? Why what is
this but to be condemners of your selves?
to carry a Judge about with you in your
own brests, that is still passing sentence
against you? <hi>Happy is he</hi> (saith the
Spirit of God, <hi>Rom. 14. 22.) that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
not himself in that which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</hi>
If your Judgments be Resolved,
let your Wills Resolve, or else you are
wilfull adersaries of the light, and fight
against Reason, and unman your selves,
and sinning wilfully against your Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
shall be beaten with many
stripes.</p>
               <p>7. Me thinks also it should somewhat
quicken you to <hi>Resolve,</hi> when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<hi>what a case you had now been in, if
death had found you unresolved.</hi> For if
you are <hi>unresolved,</hi> you are <hi>unsanctified;</hi>
and if not Sanctified, you are not pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or justified, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
you had been past all help, in
endless misery, if you had died all this
while, before you were firmly Rosolved
for God. O what a dangerous ticklish
condition have you stood in all this while?
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:63001:247"/>
What wise man would live an hour in such
a case for all the world? For feare lest
that hour should be his last. And yet
would you stay longer in it? and still are
you unresolved?</p>
               <p>8. Believe it, <hi>Christ will not own you
as his servants, nor trust you what ever
promises you may make him, as long as you
are unresolved.</hi> Who will take a servant
that is not resolved to do any service?
Who will take an unresolved person if he
knows it, as a wife, or friend into his
intimate love? And indeed you are not
truly Christians till you are Resolved to
take Christ for better and worse. What
ever state is short of this, is also short of
true Sanctification, and will fall short of
Heaven. Christ is Resolved to stick to
his servants, and he will have no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that be not resolved to stick to
him.</p>
               <p>9. And indeed if <hi>you be unresolved; as
you are falshearted at the first setting out,
so it is certain that you wll never go well on,
nor endure to the end in case of tryall, nor
can you do the business of a Christian life,
without Resolution.</hi> If you will be Christ's
Disciples, you must reckon upon perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions:
<hi>You must take up your Cross
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:63001:247"/>
and follow him: You must be hated of all
men for his sake and the Gospels; and you
must prepare for prison, and fire, and
sword. There's no hope of being saved,
while you purpose to save your pleasures,
riches, liberties, or lives,</hi> Matth. 16.
25. Marke 8. 35. Luke 9. 24. And will
a man that is unresolved forsake his
friends, estate, and life, for the sake of
Christ, and the hopes of Glory? He
cannot do it. I know that a carnal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded
Resolution, may decive a man
in the day of tryal; when the self-suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,
fearfull Christian may hold out:
But yet without a humble self-denying
Resolution, joyned with an adherence to
Christ for strength, there's no man will
hold out. <hi>If thou be a wavering minded
man, thou wilt be unstedfast in all thy
waies,</hi> Jam. 1. 8. If thou be not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
the words of a mans mouth will
turn thee out of the way; the very
mocks and scorns of a drunkard, or a fool
that hath no understanding in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Salvation, will make thee shrink,
and hide thy profession, and be ashamed
of Christ, in whom alone thou hast cause
to Glory. If thou be not a Resolved
man, what better can be expected, but
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:63001:248"/>
that thou turn as the weather-cock with
every wind, and fit thy Religion to thy
worldly ends, and as another <hi>Judas</hi> sell
thy Lord for a little money. If thou fall
not away, it will be but for want of a
tryal to procure it; and therefore in
Gods account thou art gone already;
because thy Resolution was never with
him.</p>
               <p>When you turn to God, there will
remain within you the remnants of your
corruption, a body of death, a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
flesh: and this will be still tempting
you, and drawing you from God: And
O how strong do these temptations seem
to the Soul that is unresolved? Yea
without a firm habituate Resolution, it
is impossible to overcome them. Your
whole way to Heaven is a continual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
You have enemies that will dispute
every foot of the way with you. There's
no going a step forward, but as the ship
doth in the Sea, by cutting its way
through the waves, and billows; and as
the plow doth in the earth, by cutting
through the resisting soil: There is <hi>self</hi>
which is your principal enemy, and there
is Satan, and the world, and almost all
that you meet with in it, will prove your
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:63001:248"/>
hinderers: And you must make your
way by valour, and Holy Violence
through all: And will an <hi>unresolved</hi> man
do this? You will scarce ever how your
knee to God in secret prayer, nor set
your selves upon serious Meditations, but
the flesh and the Devil will be drawing
you off; You will never attempt, a
faithfull reproof, a liberal work of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
a hazardous confession of Christ,
or any dangerous or costly duty, but the
flesh and the Devil will plead against it,
and put you to it: And in these and
many such cases of your lives, you will
never break through, nor do any good
on it, without Resolution. Do I need to
tell you how hard the way of Salvation is,
that fly from it on mistake, because you
think it harder then it is? Do I need to
tell you how false you will prove to
Christ, if you have not Resolution, that
know it by your ordinary, miserable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that a poor temptation will
make you sinne against your knowledg?
How many good wishes and purposes
have you had already, in sickness or at a
lively Sermon, that are all come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
for want of a firm Habituate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution?
What abundance of time-servers,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:63001:249"/>
and of chaffie professours are
lately fallen off, to the way of rising and
riches in the world, or to the pride, and
giddy levity of dividers, that oppose the
Truth of God, and their Teachers, and
trouble the Church, and all because they
were never well rooted by a sound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.
They that take Christ but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
liking, do usually mislike him, when
he calls them to self-denial. For they had
never that connatural principle that
should effectually dispose their Souls to
like him; nor had they ever the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
experiences of power and sweetness,
which are proper to the sincere, and
should increase their liking of him.
Either <hi>Resolve</hi> therefore, or stand by
and perish.</p>
               <p>10. I beseech you consider also, <hi>what
abundance of clear undeniable Reasons,
doth God give in to thee, to turn the Scales,
and cause thee to Resolve.</hi> He fetcheth
Reasons from his own Dominion, and
Soveraignty? Should not a creature
obey the Lord that made him? He rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth
with you from his daily preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Do you live upon him, and
should you not obey him? He reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with you from his Almightiness:
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:63001:249"/>
You are all at his Mercy, and wholly in his
hands; and yet dare you disobey him?
He reasoneth with you from his Love
and Goodness: Never did evil come
from him; nor did he ever do any wrong:
Never was there man or Angel that was
a loser by him; it is not possible to have
so good a master, and yet will you not
obey him? He fetcheth reasons from all
his Mercies: Every bit of bread is from
him, and should be an Argument with
thee to obey him: Every daies health,
and strength, and comforts; and every
nights rest and ease, thy Mercies at home,
and thy Mercies abroad; in private and
in publike; all should be so many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with thee to Resolve. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
look upon a plant, or a flower un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your feet, upon the Sun, or a Starre
that's over your heads; or upon any
creature, but you may see so many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that should move you to Resolve. If
all these will not serve, he fetcheth yet
stronger Reasons from the Incarnation,
example, and blood of the Sonne of
God: Canst thou look on God incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
for sinne, combating with Satan,
and conquering for thee, and dying, and
bleeding, and buried for thy sinne, and
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:63001:250"/>
yet be unresolved to leave that sinne, and
turn to him that hath bought thee by his
blood? If all this will not serve, he
Reasoneth with thee from thy own bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
If thou care not for God, dost thou
care for thy self? Dost thou regard thy
own Soul? If thou do, it's high time to
Resolve. He reasoneth with thee from
Everlasting Glory. Is a certain King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
an Everlasting, glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
nothing to thee? Art thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be thrust out of that Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance?
Is the filthy pleasure of the
flesh for a few hours, better then the
endless joys of the Saints? He pleads
also with thee from the danger that thou
art near. Poor Soul, thou little seest
what others see, that are dead before
thee. Thou little knowest what they
feel that died before they were Resolv'd
for God. He fetcheth his Reasons from
the certaine, everlasting flames of Hell:
and is there not force enough in these for
to Resolve thee? Good Lord, what a
thing is a senseless sinner? Dost thou
believe Heaven and Hell as thou takest on
thee to do? If thou do believe them, is
it possible for thee believingly to think of
Heaven, and its Eternal Glory, and yet
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:63001:250"/>
to be unresolved whether to turn or not?
Or canst thou think of the endless mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the damned, and yet be unresol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
whether to turn or not? Can any
heart be so senseless, or deluded?</p>
               <p>Moreover he pleadeth with thee from
the equity and sweetness of his Service.
It is but to Love him, and to seek his
Kingdom, and forbear those things that
hurt thy Soul. His Commands are not
unreasonable nor grievous. Darest thou
speak out and say that sinne is better; and
that Satan hath provided thee a better
work then God hath done? He reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with thee also from his Wisdom and
his Justice. He tels thee that as Satan
hath nothing to do with thee, and as he
is none of thy friends, and meaneth
thee not so well as God doth; so he is
not able to prescribe thee a more just and
perfect law then God hath done. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
God and thou art sure thou shalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be deceived or misled. For he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not Wisdom, or Power, or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to be a meet Law-giver and Guide:
But if thou follow the Devil, the world,
or the flesh, thou followest a blind and a
deceifull guide. And yet after all these
Reasons art thou not Resolved?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="484" facs="tcp:63001:251"/>
                  <hi>He Reasoneth with thee also from thy
own experience: What good hath sinne
done thee? And what hurt would Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
do thee? Yea he reasons with thee
from the experience of all the world:</hi>
Who was ever the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tter for sinning? And
who was ever the worse for Holiness? How
long will thy fleshly delights endure? What
will this do for thee in thy extremity? Was
ever man made Happy by it? Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
well enough thou must shorty leave it;
and that it will forsake thee in thy greatest
need: But so would not God, if thou hadst
Resolvedly given up thy self to him. All
men that refuse a Heavenly life, do soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or later wish that they had chosen it.</p>
               <p>Abundance of such Reasonings God
useth with thee in his Word, and by his
Ministers; and dost thou think indeed
that there is not weight enough in these
to give thee cause immediately to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve?
How little or nothing canst thou
say against them? Canst thou bring any
Reason, that is Reason indeed, against
these or any of these Reasons of the Lord?
Darest thou say that ever a one of them
is false, or insufficient? And what are
the Reasons which you have on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to hinder you from Resolving?
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:63001:251"/>
Forsooth, because your sinnes are sweet,
you would fain have the pleasure of them
a little longer yet: O wretched Souls!
that find more pleasure in the abusing of
your Maker and Redeemer, then in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
honoring, and pleasing him:
That delight more in serving the flesh,
and the Devil, then in serving God and
seeking after his Favour and your own
Salvation. You are a hundred times
madder then a man that lieth tumbling
himself in his dung, and will not rise out
of it to receive a Kingdom, because it is
so soft and so sweet that he is loth yet to
leave it: You are foolisher then <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

loath to return again to his Kingdom,
because he would fain stay longer among
the beasts of the fields; among whom in
his distraction he had betaken himself,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 31, 32, 33. And what other
Reasons have you against Resolving?
Forsooth you shall be mockt or jested at
by others: By whom I pray you? Not
a man but a miserable fool will do it?
Yea but you are told you must forsake
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll, and be ready to die for Christ, if he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all you to it. Very true! and can you
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eep that which he calleth you to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake?
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:63001:252"/>
How long will you keep it? Silly
Souls! do you not know that you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it by not for saking it, and lose all,
by saving any thing? and that you have
no way to save it but by losing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakeing
it. Suppse you were by enemies
banished out of <hi>England,</hi> and upon pain of
death you must be gone within a twelve-month:
And a King that loveth you invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
you to his Country, and tells you
for the poor livings that you have lost, he
will make you Lords and Princes, so you
will bring with you the little goods you
have, and leave nothing behind you.
Hereupon one man takes the next wind,
and ships over all his riches, that he may
have it when he comes there: Another
saith, I am loath to leave my goods; I
have a while longer to stay here, and
what shall I do without them? I am
loath to see the habitation of my Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
impoverished: And so when his
time is expired, he is fain to leave them
all behind him, and hath none that will
receive him in the Country where he must
abide. Which of these think you is the
wiser man? Which of them was it that
lost his goods, and which did save them?
I speak to you but such another parable
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:63001:252"/>
as Christ used to you himself, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.
2, 3, 4, 9. Where you are advised to
send your riches before you; and to make
you friends of the <hi>mammon</hi> of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that when you <hi>dye</hi> you may be
received into the everlasting habitations.</p>
               <p>I know there are other vain delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that hinder you from Resolving: I
will not call them Reasons; for they are
unreasonable. I shall only say this to
you, that if there be ever a man of you
that heareth his words, that dare be such
a Blasphemer, as to reproach the Laws
and Image of his maker, and say that he
hath made you too strict a Law, and
laid too heavy a task upon you, and a
Heavenly life is troublesome and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
If there be a man of you, that
is so devilish, as that you dare plead the
Devils cause, and justifie his work before
the Lord's, and say that it is better to
please the flesh; let that man prepare
himself to make good these words before
the Lord, and his Holy Angels; and be
sure that he shall be there put to it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner then he is here by me: And
if you have such Reasons as you will stand
to before the Barre of God, to prove the
Devil the better Master, and an unholy
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:63001:253"/>
life to be better then a Heavenly; see
then that you look them up, and there
make your best of them; and expect to
live with the Master that you served, and
to reape as you sowed, and eate the fruit
of your fleshly waies, which you took
to be the best. But if you have no such
Reasons, but your Consciences are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that God should be served, and
sinne should be speedily forsaken, and
Heaven should be provided for above all;
<hi>Resolve</hi> then to do it before you stirre?
Or else say plainly, <hi>I have no Reason to
be wicked, but because I will be wicked:
I will forseke God, and damn my own Soul
without any Reason because I will do it.</hi>
And if you are at this pass, you may take
your course.</p>
               <p>11. Another thing that I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to consider of is this: <hi>It is a
most base and treacherous abuse of God, to
make any question of this which you are so
long unresolved of.</hi> I confess when a
blind mind haith raised such a question, it
is lawfull for a reasonable man to answer
it. But in him that makes a doubt of such
a thing, as its a shame to himself, so it is
a hainous indignity to God. If you had
a chast and modest woman to your wife, I
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:63001:253"/>
think shee would take it for an injury, if
you should but make a question of it,
whether shee or a common whore be the
honester woman? If your wife or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
should bring before you a Hobby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse
or an Ass, and make a great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of it, whether you or the Ass be
the comlier, or the wiser; How would
you take this of them? If you should
bring an ideot or a mad man before your
Prince, and make a question whether he
or they be the wiser man: or if you set a
Rebel before him, and make a question
which of them hath the better title to the
Crown; what entertainment might you
expect? I tell you it is ten thousand
thousand times a baser affront and wrong
to God, to set the pleasure of sinne
before him, and make a question which
of them is the better; and to set your
riches, and your sports, and your drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness
and gluttonny, and your whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and your revenge, in competition
with your Redeemer, and Everlasting
Glory, and to make a question which of
them is to be preferred. To make once a
question whether God or flesh should be
pleased; whether Christ or the world
should be loved, and followed? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:63001:254"/>
the Holy Ghost or the Devil should
dwell in us, and guide us? Whether
the Saints of God, or the servants of the
Devil should be our chosen company?
Whether the Word and Minsiters of
Christ, or the examples and words of
wicked men, should more prevail with
us? Whether Heaven or Earth should
be more carefully sought after? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Holy, or a careless, wicked life be
more to be desired? Or whether it be
better to turn to God, or not? I say,
to make such a question as this, or one
of these, is little better then to put a
scorn upon the God of Heaven? and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth
of such malice as is more like a
Devil then a reasonable man; or else of
such folly, as is below the Devil, and as
none of you would be guilty of, in the
matters of this world; If one should but
make a comparison between you and
some deformed monster, or between
your house and a swine-stie, though he
gave you the better, I think you would
take it as a scorn, that he should make
such a comparison, or question? Much
more may God so take it, when you
make a question betwixt sinne and him.
There is <hi>but one</hi> Infinite, unconceivable,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:63001:254"/>
perfect Good; and shall he be abased by
such a question? There is <hi>but one</hi> thing
that is contrary to God in all the world,
that is worse then the Devil himself, and
that is sinne; and shall this be put in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
or comparison with God? There
is but <hi>One</hi> that hath Loved us to the
death, with a matchless, unconceivable,
saving Love, and that is Jesus Christ:
And there is but one thing that is a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enemy to us and him, and that would
damn us, when he is endeavouring to save
us; and that is sinne: And must there be
a question or comparison between these?
There is <hi>One</hi> Sanctifying Spirit, that
would clense, and heal, and save us; and
there is a malicious spirit that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us, defile us, and destroy us: And
must there be any question or compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
made between these? There is <hi>but one</hi>
Eternal Happiness, and <hi>One</hi> Holy way
to it: and there is but <hi>One</hi> everlasting
misery, and a fleshly, filthy, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
way to it: And must there be made
any question which of these should be
preferred? Consider I beseech you what
you do; And if it be so vile a thing to
make any question of it, what is it then to
be still unresolved? Yea and to choose the
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:63001:255"/>
worser part, and stick to it in your heart
and life?</p>
               <p>12. Consider also that <hi>Present Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
would put an end to a great many
fruitles, troublesome deliberatiens, and
delaies.</hi> If a man had but a weighty busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the world upon his hand, that his
estate or life lieth on, it is a perplexity
to him as long as he is unresolved, what
course he should take: It will be troubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him when he should rest, and break
his sleep; it will fill him with musings,
and disturb and distract his mind, and
even make him Melancholy. And how
can it choose but be a troublesome distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
thing to your mind, to be unresol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
what course to take for your Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
state? I know some hearts are so
desperately hardened, and past feeling,
<hi>(Epes. 4. 19.)</hi> and some mens Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
so seared as with an hot iron, <hi>(1 Tim.
4. 2.)</hi> that they can throw away all
thoughts of Resolution, and never be
much troubled: But I hope that many
are <hi>not so</hi> desperate: It is not thus with
all that are unconverted. How long have
some of your minds been troubled whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to turn or not? <hi>Resolve</hi> man, if
thou love thy Soul, and put an end to such
troubles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="493" facs="tcp:63001:255"/>
13. Consider also, that <hi>Resolving will
put an end to a great many of troublesome
Temptations, that do assault you, and
will break the heart of Satans hopes.</hi> As
long as you are unresolved, he hath still
possession of you, and is still in hopes to
keep possession. And as long as he hath
any hope he will never give over, but
will be repairing his Garrison, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up all the breaches that the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God had made. When one temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
takes not, he will be offering you
another; and will be following and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting
you day and night: But if once
he see you firmly <hi>Resolved,</hi> his hopes will
faile him, and you may be much freer
from his temptations then you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
I do not say he will give over: For
even when you are broken away from
him, he will make after you again. But
it is a greater advantage to you to fight
against him in the open field, under such
a Captaine as Jesus Christ, that will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you of the victory, then to be in his
own prison with his fetters on your heels.
You know the way to be troubled with an
unwelcome suiter, is to delay your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
and take time to consider of it:
and the way to be eased of him, is to give
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:63001:256"/>
him a peremptory Resolute answer. And
when he seeth you Resolved, he will
cease.</p>
               <p>14. Moreover, till <hi>you are Resolved
of your Conversion, you cannot Rationally
Resolve of any one word or action of your
lives:</hi> Nay till they are all misem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to your hurt. For no man can
Resolve of the <hi>Means</hi> till he is Resolved
of the <hi>End.</hi> You must Resolve <hi>whither</hi> to
go, before you can Resolve <hi>which way</hi>
to go. Before Conversion mens End is
wrong: Their Intention and business is
to please the flesh: And all their thoughts,
and words, and actions, that have such
an End, are wicked and pernicious. Till
you are Resolved by Conversion to be
for God, you have never a right End (in
a prevailing sence;) and therefore you
cannot order one thought, nor word,
nor deed aright. I tell you, every thought
you think, and every word you speak,
and every deed you do while you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted,
are so many steps towards
Hell, except only those that tend towards
Conversion, and some way further it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
therefore of this, or you can Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
of nothing.</p>
               <p>15. Moreover, if <hi>you would presently
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:63001:256"/>
and firmly Resolve, you would ease your
friends and the Ministers of Christ of much
of their sorrows, and fears, and cares for
you; and of much of the most troublesome
part of their work.</hi> As long as you are
unconverted, they can look on you but
as the heirs of Hell, that will be quickly
in those torments, if conversion prevent
it not: and therefore their hearts are
full of sorrow for you, when you sorrow
not for your selves; and their care is how
they might prevent your damnation,
which they know without Conversion
can never be done. Many a groan doth
your Misery cost them! and many a
thought have they of your danger, which
you are not aware of. O what a grief is
it to believing Ministers, to see so many
of their people in the power of Satan,
and the high-way to Hell, after all their
care and labour for their recovery? We
cannot <hi>say</hi> that the unconverted <hi>shall</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
perish, because we have yet hopes
that they may be Converted, though
they be not: But we know that if they
<hi>die</hi> in the case that they are in, there is
no hope of them at all; and we know
they are uncertin to live an hour: And
therefore as long as they are in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:63001:257"/>
how can we chuse but be filled
with fear, and grief, and care for them?
All the troubles that befall a faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
in his worldly affaires, by crosses
and persecutions, are nothing to the
trouble that your sinne and misery bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to their minds. O what a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
life were it for a Minister to live with
bread and water among a people that
would obey the Gospel; and give us
hopes that we should live with them in
Heaven? O how cheerfully may we stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for them, and preach to them, when
we see that it is not lost upon them! How
willingly should we prepare them the
bread of life, when we see they feed and
live upon it? How joyfully may we pray
and praise God with them, when we
think how they must joyn with us in the
Celestial Praises? O Sirs, I beseech you
grudg not your Ministers this comfort:
Do not destroy your selves to grieve and
trouble them. O put them once out of
their fears and grief for you, by your
<hi>Resolving, ad speedy return to God:</hi> That
they that have many a time thought in
their hearts, <hi>I am afraid this poor sinner
will never be recovered; I am afraid he
will be a firebrand in Hell,</hi> may now
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:63001:257"/>
rejoice with you when they see you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home, and may meet you as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
himself doth meet his prodigal chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and weep over you for joy, as they
were wont to do in sorrow. You would
ease our hearts of abundance of sad
thoughts, if we could but perceive you
once <hi>Resolved,</hi> and see you come home.
Now you think our preaching harsh to
you, because we tell you so much of
sinne and of damnation: and you think
our discipline more harsh, when we
refuse to have communion with you. But
if you would once Resolve and Turn,
how gladly should we open our doores
and our hearts to you: and how gladly
should we turn the stream of our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and tell you of nothing but Christ,
and Heaven, and peace, and comfort,
further then your own necessities should
require it. What say you Sirs to this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
request? Will you Resolve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more ado, and ease us of our
grief and fears, and give us <hi>but leave</hi> to
preach more comfortable Doctrine to
you?</p>
               <p>16. Moreover consider, that <hi>you have
much work to do when you are Resolved and
Converted; and a great way to go when you
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:63001:258"/>
have begun your journey towards Heaven:
and till you are Resolved, none of this can
be done.</hi> You can go no further, till Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
have set you in the right way.
Till then, the further you go, the further
you are out of the way. Will you be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved
till the night come on? Shall all
the rest of your work be undone? Will
you begin your race when you should be
at the end. Alas you should be able to say
as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>I have fought a good
fight: I have finished my course: hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
is laid up for me a crown of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
when as you cannot yet say, <hi>I have
begun my course; I am set in the right
way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. Consider also that <hi>Rosolution ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
works easie and successfull.</hi> The <hi>reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi>
Army is seldom couquered.. A <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi>
travailer will go through with his
journy; and it is easier to himself: His
spirits are excited; and doing it with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity,
he findeth less trouble in it. A
slow and lazy pase doth sometime soonest
weary us. A slow motion is most easily
stopt, when a swift one bears down that
which would resist it. A man that Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
sets himself to the Work of God,
and is past any further deliberating of the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:63001:258"/>
matter, and is at a point with all the
world, will make a pleasure of that which
will stop and stall an unresolved profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour.
Resolve therefore for your own
success and ease.</p>
               <p>I tell you, by <hi>Resolving</hi> it is that you
must conquer, and by <hi>conquering,</hi> you
must obtain the Crown. The unresolved
are wavering at every assault, like cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
soldiers, even ready to runne before
they fight. They will not bear the cost or
labour: they are soon aweary: They
cannot say <hi>Nay</hi> to an old Companion,
or a tempting bait. But the Resolved
breaks through all, and treads that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his feet as dirt, which another sells
his Soul for. If he meet with reproaches
and scornes from men, he remembreth
that Christ foretold him this, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
much more of the like before him. If
his friends turn enemies for the Gospel
sake, he saith, <hi>I was told of this before,
even that I must be hated of all men for
Christ.</hi> If he be ticed by lewd and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
company, he saith as <hi>David,</hi> Psal.
119. 115. <hi>Depart from me ye evill doers,
for I will keep the Commandements of my
God.</hi> If he be tempted with rewards and
honours in the world, he will not stand

wavering and longing after it, as <hi>Balaam;</hi>
but he will say as the same <hi>Balaam</hi> was
<hi>forced</hi> to do: <hi>If you will give me a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of Gold and Silver, I cannot go beyond
the Word of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>let their money
perish with them, that think all the Gold
in the world, worth the peace of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and the favour of God.</hi> If he be
threathened by men, to move him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
his duty, he saith, <hi>Whether it be better
to obey God or man, judge ye?</hi> If he heare
seducers, he is rooted in the Spirit, and
the infallible Word, and is not <hi>shaken by
every wind.</hi> If he see never so many fall
off by backsliding; he saith; <hi>It was not
only for their company that I chose the holy
way; God is still the same; and Heaven
is the same; and Scripture is the same; and
therefore I am Resolved to be the same.</hi> If
God afflict him by poverty, sickness, or
other tryals, he saith; <hi>I did not become a
Christian to scape affliction, but to scape
damnation! If he kill me yet will I trust
in him: Shall I receive good at the hands
of God, and not evill: Naked came I out
of my mothers wombe, and naked must I
return to dust: the Lord giveth, the Lord
taketh away: blessed be his name.</hi> If op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
enemies insult over him, he can
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:63001:259"/>
say as <hi>Mic. 7. 8, 9. Rejoice not against me
O mine enemy: when I fall I shall arise:
when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a
light to me: I will bear the Indignation of
the Lord, because I have sinned against
him, untill he plead my cause, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Judgment for me: He will bring me
forth to the light, and I shall behold his
Righteousness.</hi> If the wicked cast in his
teeth his profession, and the name of his
God, he <hi>rejoiceth that he is counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to suffer for that Name,</hi> and yet he
<hi>will hope to see the goodness of the Lord in
the Land of the living.</hi> And if he must go
to Heaven through poverty, and a mean
estate, he hath <hi>learned to want, as well as
to abound, and in what estate soever he be,
therewith to be contented.</hi> And so in the
work of Conversion it self, for want of
Resolution, many stick long in the birth,
and they are hanging so long between
Heaven and Hell, that it's a wonder of
Mercy that God doth not cut them off
and let them perish. But the well Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Soul doth deal more faithfully with
the light that is revealed to him, and
doth not stand strugling so long against
it, nor hold Christ and his Spirit so long
in hand; but is glad to make sure work in
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:63001:260"/>
so great a business, and take so good a
match while it is offered: And being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
once, he <hi>is firm as Mount Zion,
that cannot be moved. Resolve</hi> therefore
that your work may be the more easy,
and successfull; and conquer by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving.</p>
               <p>18. <hi>I suppose you dare not Resolve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Conversion, and a Heavenly life!
And why then will you not Resolve for it?</hi>
What purpose you to do for the time to
come? Is it your Resolution to live and
die as you are? Have you not purposes
in your mind to Repent hereafter? Dare
you say, I am Resolved never to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted?
Some may be so desperate; but
I think it is but few even of the ungodly.
Why this shews that there is a secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
in your consciences; O do not
stifle it: Neutrality never saved Soul. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you dare not Resolve <hi>against it,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
<hi>for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>19. Consider I beseech you, <hi>how much
it doth concern your selves, to have this
question well and speedily Resolved.</hi> God
asketh you, whether you will be Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and Sanctisied or not? Resolve this
question, and you Resolve your selves of
a great many more that depend upon it.
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:63001:260"/>
The answer to this, must be the answer to
the rest. If the question were, <hi>whether you
will be pardoned or no? Whether you will
live in Heaven or Hell for ever?</hi> Whether
you will dwell with God and Angels, or
with Devils? You would not be long in
answering this. You would Resolve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an hours delay. Why? <hi>this is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi>
Sirs: but the answer to it, must be
the answer to the first question: For
without Sanctification, there is no Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
If you <hi>will</hi> not be Converted, you
<hi>shall</hi> be condemned whether you will or
no: For God hath Resolved of this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and there is no resisting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of God. The true state of the
question is, <hi>Whether you will Turn, or
burn:</hi> choose you whether; for it must
be one. O therefore if you will but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
Christ and us this one question, that
you will be Converted, Christ will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
you the principal questions, that
concern you in the world, even whether
you shall be pardoned or saved, and
where, and with whom, you must live
for ever.</p>
               <p>20. Lastly consider, that if <hi>you stay till
you receive the sentence of death, it's two
to one but that will force you to Resolve:
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:63001:261"/>
But a forced Resolution will not serve turn:</hi>
and then it will be very hard for you to
discern whether it be any better then
meerly from your fears. You put off all
till sickness come, and you see once that
you must die; there's no Remedy; and
then you will cry, <hi>O if the Lord would
but recover me, and try me once againe
with life, I would delay no longer, but I
would become a new man, and live a Holy,
and Heavenly life; I am resolved of it by the
Grace of God.</hi> Yea; but who knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these last Resolutions be sincere?
We heare abundance speak this in their
sickness, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ver turn when they come
to health, but forget all, and live in a
manner as they did before. Is it not most
likely to be only the fear of death that
makes you take up these Resolutions? If
it be so, they will never save you if you
die, nor hold you to your promises if
you live: For it is not bare Fear that is
true Conversion; but it's a changed
heart, that is fallen in Love with God and
Holiness, and into a setled hatred of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sins. No late Repentance and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
but these, will be any thing worth
as to the saving of your Souls: And
therefore if you should have true Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:63001:261"/>
at the last (which is too rare) you
cannot choose but be much in doubt of
them, when you find so much of fear
upon your spirit, and consider that you
never would Resolve till then. And
therefore if you would have a Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
change, Resolve now in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
before the face of death affright
you to it, and those feares and the late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
do make you question the truth, and
soundness of it, and so deprive you of the
comfort, which you have so much need
of at a dying hour.</p>
               <p>And thus I have given you twenty
Considerations to perswade you, if it
may be, presently to <hi>Resolve.</hi> I am sure
there is truth, and reason, and weight
in them; but what good they will do you
I am not sure, because I know not how
you will receive them.</p>
               <p>IV. And now I come to the last part
of my task; which is to <hi>Direct</hi> you how
to perform the work that I have perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you to. But because it is meerly the
<hi>Determination of the Will,</hi> it is <hi>presuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
that must do more to the work then
<hi>Direction.</hi> And therefore I shall only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:63001:262"/>
you to look back upon the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of sound Resolution, which I before
laid down to you, and then take heed of
the hinderances in your way, and so set
your selves to do your duty.</p>
               <p>Remember that I before told you,
that it it is not a holy, saving Resolution,
unless it be 1. <hi>Entire,</hi> for the matter of
it, comprehending all that is Essential to
Christianity: 2. And unless you Resolve
upon <hi>present</hi> obedience without delay:
3. And also unless it be <hi>Absolute</hi> and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory,
taking Christ for better and
worse, without any reserve: 4. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be <hi>well grounded:</hi> 5. And unless it
be <hi>built on the strength of Christ,</hi> and not
only a carnal confidence of your own:
6. And unless it be <hi>habitual and firm,</hi> and
become your ordinary frame and byas,
and as it were the new Nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of your Souls. By this much
you see already what manner of Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it is that you must have.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, to advise you of the
hinderances that you may avoid them.
1. The principal hinderance of Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is <hi>Secret Vnbelief;</hi> when Everlasting
life is taken but as an uncertainty, or
men have no more but a slight Opinion
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:63001:262"/>
of it. The Cure of this disease, I have
often, and a little before delivered you.</p>
               <p>2. Another thing that hindereth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
is <hi>Inconsideratness,</hi> of which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
I have spoken purposely before.</p>
               <p>3. Another hinderance is a <hi>sleepy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibility;</hi>
when the heart is hardened,
and men are past feeling. We cannot tell
how to awaken these men to be sensible
of the things that should move them to
Resolve. Of this also I have spoken by
it self.</p>
               <p>4. Another great hinderance is the
<hi>naturall strangness and aversness</hi> of the
mind of corrupted man, to these high
and Spiritual things. So that we drive
men by all our Arguments against the
byas of their sinfull habits. And those
habits plead against us more forcibly
without a word of reason, then all the
reason in the world could do. See there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that you keep under changing means
till your hearts be changed; And the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using
of such weighty Arguments as we
offer you, may be of use to the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your hearts: For God useth to
work on the Will, by the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And therefore Light hath an apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to change the Will it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="508" facs="tcp:63001:263"/>
5. Moreover, <hi>the rooted Interest of
this world,</hi> doth much hinder men from
Resolving to turn: It's alwaies drawing
them another way, or putting objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and eavils into their minds; and if
they will needs Resolve, it is this that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
enticeth them to reserves, and to
resign themselves to God but with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and exceptions; and so makes
them Hypocrites when they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Converts; and cheats them with a
halfe deceitfull Resolution, instead of one
that is absolute and firm. Against this
impediment also I have spoken before.</p>
               <p>6. Another hinderance is, <hi>The neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of fleshly enticing objects.</hi> When the
Covetous man <hi>seeth</hi> his houses and lands,
his goods and money, the very sight of
them breaks the heart of all his better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions.
The drunkard seems to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
till he <hi>sees</hi> the cup, and then his
Resolution is broken. The Whoremong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
seemeth to be Resolved, till the bait
is brought <hi>neer</hi> him, and then he goes as
an Oxe to the slaughter, and as a fool to
the correction of the stocks. Certainly
if these Resolutions were sound, they
would either cause men to fly from the
bait, and not come neere it, or else to
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:63001:263"/>
refuse it when it is presented them: In
the course of their lives their Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
would govern them, if they were
sincere.</p>
               <p>7. And Satan himself will do all that
he can to hinder you when he sees you
ready to Resolve. He knows that he must
bestirre him now or never. You never
put him to it indeed till you are Resolving
to forsake him. One block or other he
will be sure then to cast in your way; Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he tels you, it is but folly and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
to trouble your self with these
matters: or that you may be saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all this ado: or that God is more
mercifull then to cast away all that be not
Sanctified: or that Godliness doth but
trouble and distract people: and that the
professours of it are secretly no better
then others; and that it is but Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
for them to make such a stir with their
Religion; and that we must be moderate
in our Godliness, and take heed of being
Godly over much: A hundred such
foolish suggestions as these, the Devil
hath at hand to cast in your way, when
he seeth you ready to Resolve.</p>
               <p>If these will not serve, he will set
some of his wicked Disciples on rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:63001:264"/>
or deriding you! And perhaps some
cunning fool a caveling with you, to see
if they can overwit you, and draw you
back.</p>
               <p>If that will not do, perhaps he will
open the falls of professours to you, and
labour to perswade you that <hi>all are such:</hi>
Or he will shew you what divisions and
differences are among them; or he will
take advantage of some difficulties in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or some controversies in which
he sees you already engaged to a party;
or he will tell you of some false doctrine
that some forward professours may be
tainted with, to make them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
Godliness it self more odious,
or at least suspected to you. If all this
will not do, he will endeavour to set your
very parents, or natural kindred against
you; that those that should most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
your Salvation, and on whom your
livelyhood much dependeth, shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
your enemies, and hate you for
offering to give up your selves to Christ:
If that will not do, he will endeavour to
entice you with the baits of fleshly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or of preferments, or much busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or merry company, or some great
matters that you may hope for in the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:63001:264"/>
world. And usually this snare is the
strongest of all. Or else he will tell you
that if needs you wll Resolve it is time
enough hereafter: You may yet take
more of your pleasure or commodity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you leave it: Yet you may suck the
brests of the world a little dryer, and
then turn to God and cast it off. If all
this will not prevail with you, he will tell
you it is now too late; you have sinned
so long, or such haynous sinnes that God
will not have mercy on you: he will
make you believe that God hath utterly
forsaken you, and there is no remedy;
and you may as well spare your thoughts
of Turning now, for Christ will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
or welcome you: and therefore it
is even as good go on, and take up the
rest that the world can afford you, for
there is no hope of better. But the most
desperate temptation of all the rest is, to
put some blasphemous, unbelieving
thoughts into your mind; especially if
you fall into company with infidels, that
will draw you to question the Word of
God, and the Immortality of the Soul,
and the truth of Christianity, or the life
to come, whether there be any such
things or not: Where these once take,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:63001:265"/>
and are received with approbation, the
Soul is in a miserable case: Though I
know many tempted, melancholy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
are haunted with such temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who yet abhorre them, and do well
at last, for all this. Some times also
when he cannot take you off from Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
he will lead you among some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputing
Opinionists, and they shall tise
you to take up with their Opinionative
Religiousness instead of true Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of which I have spoke in the
eighth Direction. By these and many
such wiles as these, doth the old serpent
do all that possibly he can, to hinder you
from sound Resolution and Conversion.
And therefore you must be armed against
his temptations, and meet them with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence;
and if you feel them too hard
for you, go daily to Christ by Faith and
Prayer for renewed strength: and call to
your faithfull friends, and Ministers for
helpe. Open your case to some one that's
able, experienced, and faithfull; that
he may help you with Arguments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
those temptations, which you know
not how your selves to deale with. God
hath appointed Pastours in his Church to
be Spiritual Fathers in the Lord; and
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:63001:265"/>
when they have sowed in you the seed of
eternall life, they watch over it till they
see the blade and fruit: They travaile as
in birth of you, till Christ be formed in
you. It is their offer to help you; and
God giveth to them that are faithfull abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litis
and affections agreeable to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
And therefore lean upon the hand
of your faithfull guides, and think not to
break through temptations alone, and
get to Heaven without the means that
God hath appointed you.</p>
               <p>Having told you the Hinderances, and
what to do against them, I shall add but
these two words more of <hi>Direction.
1. When you are Resolving, give up your
selves to God with a Holy Covenant or
Vow.</hi> I mean not any <hi>rash vow,</hi> nor any
<hi>unnecessary vow;</hi> but the same that you
made in <hi>Baptism,</hi> which your age it self
doth call you to renew, but your sinnes
against it do call you more.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you'l say, that you are not
able to perform it by your own strength,
and you are uncertain of Gods assistance,
and therefore how can you promise or
vow?</p>
               <p>To this I answer: 1. You may be sure
that this Objection is frivolous, because
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:63001:266"/>
it makes against the frequent, express
Commands of God, the practice of his
Church in all ages, and the nature of
Christianity it self: God hath in all Ages
been pleased to receive men into his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Church in a Covenant way; and
<hi>Baptism</hi> it self is our solemn Covenanting
with him: and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for a solemn renewing of it. And
indeed it is implicitly and virtually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
by a true Christian every day of
his life. In every duty he gives up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to God: And if he should cease this
Heart-covenant, he would cease to be a
Christian: For the very essence of his
Christianity consisteth in it. It is his
Faith it self.</p>
               <p>2. And when you covenant for the
time to come, you do not take on you
to <hi>foretell</hi> infallibly your own perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
but you <hi>Profess</hi> your present <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
to be Christ's, and to continue his,
and you engage your selves thereto. And
should you not choose the strictest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements:
1. Where there is the
greatest need of them, because of the
loosness of the heart, and the strength of
temptations, that would draw us away;
and 2. Where there is the most absolute
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:63001:266"/>
necessity, because if we miscarry we are
undone: 3. And where you are already
obliged by Gods Commands whether
you vow or not: 4. And where God
hath made your consent to the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of necessity to Salvation. He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to keep Covenant, and knows that
he must keep it, or be condemned; hath
little reason to be loath to make it.</p>
               <p>3. And for Gods assistance, you have
much more cause to expect it in the way
of Covenanting, which himself hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
you, then in the neglect of his
appointed means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But if I did it in Baptism, what
need I do it again?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I told you the Covenant must
be continued and renewed through the
whole course of our lives, but especially
after a notorious violation of your former
promise: You once gave up your selves
to God, and you have proved false to
him, and it is a wonder of Mercy that
ever he will trust you more, or enter
any more into Covenant with you: and
will you draw back from such Mercy, and
such a duty as this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But I am afraid of breaking
my vows again, and it is better to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:63001:267"/>
them, then not to perform them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This Reason makes as much
against the inward Vow and Resoluion of
the heart; so that by this rule you would
never be Christians for fear of falling
away, and being worse. 2. There is an
absolute necessity of your Resolving, and
Covenanting, and of Keeping your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
and Covenants: And when it
<hi>must be kept,</hi> or you are utterly undone;
it's but a madness to refuse to <hi>make</hi> the
Covenant for fear of breaking it: For
that is but to make choice of an easier
place in Hell, for fear of having a worse,
if you should resolve for Heaven: When
as Heaven is set open before you, and you
thus wilfully cast away your hopes. Nay
your place in Hell is not like to be the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,
when you thus deliberately, and
wilfully refuse the Covenant. 3. Your
Resolutions and Holy Vows, are means
of Gods appointment to keep you from
breaking his imposed Covenant. Is not
a Resolved, Engaged, Devoted Cristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
liker to be accepted, and to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
then a waverer that saith, I dare
not vow, for fear lest I performe not.</p>
               <p>In unnecessary matters I had rather
you were too backward to vow. Some
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:63001:267"/>
will vow poverty, and some a single life,
and some will vow that they will never
drink wine or strong drink more; such
vows as these may be good for some, in
cases of special necessity, as the last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
of a dangerous disease; but they
are not for <hi>all,</hi> nor <hi>rashly</hi> to be made.
But the Resolution and vow of cleaving
unto God in Faith and Holy Obedience,
and of renouncing the flesh, the world,
and the Devil; this is for all, and must
be made and kept by all that will be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Direct. And as I would have
you second your Resolution by a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God, so would advise you
(ordinarily) to go further and</hi> openly
Profess the Resolution and Covenant that
you have made. <hi>For as</hi> with the heart
men believe unto Righteousness, so with
the mouth Confession is made unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Rom. 10. 10. Christ will confess
those that confess him, and disown, and
be ashamed of those that are ashamed of
him. When you have escaped the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
misery in the world, and obtained the
greatest Mercy in the world, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it calleth you to acknowledg it,
and give Glory to God. Go to your
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:63001:268"/>
old Companions in sinne, and tell them
what God hath revealed to you and done
for you! Tell them,</hi> O Sirs, I see now that
which I never saw before: I wonder how I
could venture so madly upon sinne! and
how I could make light of God, of Christ,
of death, of Judgment, and Everlasting
life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have been hitherto your Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in sinne, but I would not take the same
course again for all the world: I see now
there is a better portion hereafter to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
which I was mindless of: I see
now we were all this while making merry
at the brink of Hell, and there was but a
step between us and death: Now I see, that
the course that we have taken is wicked and
deceitfull, and will not serve turn: If I
serve the flesh, it will reward me but with
rottonness: I will therefore hereafter serve
that God, that will certainly reward me
with Evorlasting life. I beseech you Sirs,
come away with me, and see and try what
I have seen and tryed: I have lived with
you in sinne, O now let us joyn together in
Repentance, and a Holy life: I shall be
glad of your company to Heaven: but if
you will not do it, take your course: For
my part I am Resolved; by the Grace of
God I am fully Resolved to be from this day
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:63001:268"/>
forward a New man, and never to joyn
with you more in a fleshly and ungodly life.
Never tempt me or perswade me to it; for
I am Resolved.</p>
               <p>Thus if you will declare your Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to others, and seek to win them,
you may possibly do them good; but
however you will be the deeper engaged
to God your selves.</p>
               <p>Yea, though I would have no ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Conversion, nothing done <hi>rashly
in publike,</hi> nor <hi>without the advice of a
faithfull Minister beforehand;</hi> yet <hi>with
these Cautions,</hi> I must say, that it's a
shame that we hear no more in publike of
the Conversion of sinners. As <hi>Baptism</hi>
is to be in publike, that the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may witness your engagement, and
pray for you, and rejoice at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of a member; So the solemn renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the same Covenant by Repentance
after a wicked life, should ordinarily be
in publike, to give warning to others to
avoid the sinne, and to give God the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and to have the Prayers of the
Church, and to satisfy them of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
that they may have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with us. The <hi>Papists</hi> do more offend
(of the two) in so much confining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:63001:269"/>
and Penitence, to the Priests eare
in secret, and not bringing it before the
Church, then they do in making a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of it. I wonder that people
should every day thrust into our hands
their requests to pray for them when they
are sick, and that it is so rare a matter
to have any desire our Prayers, for the
pardon of all the sinnes of their natural,
unconverted state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I would here seriously advise all those
that it concerneth that when God hath
shewed them so great a Mercy as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them, and make them New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they would go to their faithfull
Minister, and by his advice, put up such
a bill as this,</hi> Such a man of this parish,
having long lived in blindness, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and ungodliness, (and name the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
sinnes, if they were publickly
known,) and being by the great Mercy of
God convinced of his sinne, and misery;
and sustained with some hopes of Mercy by
the Blood and Merits of Jesus Christ, and
being now Resolved by the Grace of God, to
forsake this fleshly, worldly life, and to
give up himself to Christ and Holiness,
doth earnestly intreat the Church to pray
for him, that his many, and hainous sins
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:63001:269"/>
may be all forgiven, and that God would
againe receive him into Mercy, and that
he may hold on in Faith and Holiness to
the last, and never turn again to the course
of his iniquity.</p>
               <p>And if the Minister think it meet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
not to make your selves an open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of your former life of sinne and
misery, and to Profess openly your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to walk with God for the time
to come.</p>
               <p>This course should be more ordinary
with us: and if Convers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion it self were
not so rare, or else so defective, that it
doth too little quicken men to a sence of
duty, and sinne, and Mercy, or so
doubtfull, and by slow degrees, that it
is scarce discerned by many that have it;
were it not for some of these; more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
would it be, to the great rejoycing
and benefit of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Conclusion,</hi> And now I have given
you Directions in the most great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
business in this world; They are
such as I received of God, and if Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
practised will put your Salvation
past all hazard. But what they have
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:63001:270"/>
done, or what they will do, I cannot
tell; but must leave the Issue to God and
you. Its pitty eternall Glory should be
lost, for want of yielding to so holy, and
sweet, and reasonable a course. It is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
to observe, what ignorant, base,
unworthy thoughts the most have of the
very Office of the holy Ghost, who is
the sanctifier of all that God will save.
The very <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Regeneration and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi>
is not understood by some,
and is but matter of derision to others;
and the most think that it is another kind
of matter then indeed it is. To be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
and come to Church, and to say
some cold and heartless Prayers, and to
forbeare some gross disgracefull sins, is all
the Sanctification that most are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with: (and all have not this:) And
thus they debase the work of the holy
Ghost. If a Prince have built a sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Pallace, and you will shew men a
Swine-stie, and say, <hi>[This is the Pallace
that the Prince hath bin so long a building]</hi>
were not this to abuse him by contempt?
If he build a Navy, and you shew a man
two or three pig-troughs and say, <hi>[These
are the Kings ships]</hi> would he not take
it for a scorn? Take heed of such dealing
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:63001:270"/>
with the holy Ghost. Remember what
it is to believe in the name of the Father,
Son, and holy Ghost; and remember
that you were Baptized into the name of
the Father, Son, and holy Ghost? And
do you not yet know why? nor know
the meaning of your Baptismall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
It is not only to believe that there
are three Persons in the Trinity, but to
consent to the Relations and duty to
them, in respect to their several Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the Father had not
Created you, how could you have been
men? The Lord of nature must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
as the <hi>End</hi> and the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of nature, and accordingly obeyed.
And this is to believe and be Baptized into
the Name of God the Father. If the
Son had not Redeemed you, you had bin
as the Divels were, forsaken and given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to dispaire. The Purchaser, Procurer,
and Author of Grace, of Pardon, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
must be acknoledged to be such, and
himself and his Salvation accordingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
and his terms submitted to. And
this is to believe in the name of the Son,
and in baptisme we make profession
hereof. And certainly the work of the
holy Ghost is as necessary to your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:63001:271"/>
Without the sanctifying work of
the Spirit, you could never be delivered
from sin and Satan, nor restored to Gods
Image, and consepuently could never be
the Members of Christ, nor have any
saving benefit by his Sufferings. Would
you not think him unworthy to live, that
would reproach the <hi>Fathers work of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and say that the whole Creation is
but some poor contemptible work? And
would you not think him unworthy the
name of a Christian that had contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thoughts of the <hi>Sons Redemption,</hi> as
if we could be saved as well without a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
or as if it were but some poor and
triviall commodity that Christ had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
us? I know you would confess
the mistery of that man, that believeth
no better in the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> And
how comes it to pass that you think not
of your own misery, that believe no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the <hi>holy Ghost?</hi> Do not you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base
the <hi>Sanctifying</hi> office of the holy
Spirit, when you shew us your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
and parts and outward duties and
civility, and tell us that <hi>these</hi> are the work
of sanctification? What? is Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but such a thing as this? Why? <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
is a new Life and Spirit in us:</hi> and
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:63001:271"/>
these that you talk of are but a few flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that are stickt upon a Corps to keep
it a while from stinking among men,
till death convey it to a buriall in Hell.
O Sirs, <hi>Sanctification</hi> is another kind of
matter, then the forsaking of some of
your fouler vices, and speaking well of a
Godly life. It is not the patching up of
the <hi>Old</hi> man, <hi>but</hi> the Creating of a <hi>New</hi>
man. I give you warning therefore from
God that you think not basely of the
work of the holy Ghost; and that you
think no more to be saved without the
<hi>Sanctifying work of the Spirit,</hi> then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>redeeming work of the Son,</hi> or
<hi>Creation, Government, or Love of the
Father.</hi> Sanctification must turn the
very bent and stream of heart and life to
God, to Christ, to Heaven; it must
mortifie Carnall <hi>Self,</hi> and the world to
you; it must make you a people Devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Consecrated, and Resigned up to
God, with all that you have: it must
make all sin odious to you, and make
God the Love and Desire of your Souls;
so that it must give you a new Heart, a
new End, a new Master, a new Law, and
a new Conversation. This is that noble
Heavenly work which the holy Ghost
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:63001:272"/>
hath vouchsafed to make the business of
his office: To slight and despise this, is
to slight and despise the holy Ghost: To
refuse this, is to refuse the holy Ghost, and
not to believe in him: to be without this
work, is to be without the holy Ghost: &amp;
<hi>if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, the
same is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. The <hi>holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church,</hi> is composed of all through
the world that have this work upon them,
and therefore it is called Holy. The <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints,</hi> is the blessed Vitall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of these <hi>Sanctified</hi> Ones: For <hi>these</hi>
only is the <hi>Resurrection</hi> unto blessedness,
&amp; the <hi>life everlasting</hi> with the Lord of life:
for all others is the Resurrection of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
&amp; the everlasting punishment.</p>
               <p>But if the other two Articles of our
Faith, have been so denied by the blind,
it is less wonder if this be so. Some He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
denied God to be the Creatour of
the world; and because they saw so much
evill in the world, they said that it was
made by Devils or evill Angels (who
indeed made the sin, but not the world,)
So dealt the Jewes by the <hi>Son,</hi> and the
<hi>Second</hi> Article of our Faith: The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of Bulls and Goats, and such Beasts,
was all the Sacrifice for sin that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:63001:272"/>
in. And thus deale the multitude
of the <hi>ungodly</hi> by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Indeed
they know not themselves sufficiently to
know the need and worth of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They are too whole to value the
skill and care of Christ or the holy Ghost.
The insensibility of spirituall death and
misery, and thinking too lightly of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Corruption, and too well of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
nature, is both the cause of many
of the Heresies of the learned, and of the
common contempt of Christ, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and recovering grace, in all the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.
For it is not possible that men
should have any deeper sence of the need
or worth of the remedy, then they have
of the greatness of their sinne and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>
               <p>O Sirs, did we not come upon this great
disadvantage to you, that we speak to
dead men, that have indeed a naturall
life, which doth but take pleasure in their
spirituall death; how confidently should
we expect to prevaile with you all. But
while you think lightly of your disease, we
can expect no better, but that you think as
lightly of Christ and holiness, and all the
meanes that tend to your recovery, and
think of the new man, as the Poets fabled
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:63001:273"/>
of the Promethean race, that it grows out
of the earth (of your own poor, sorry
purposes and performances) like ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
plants.</p>
               <p>Truly Sirs, I have led you even as farre
as I can; and what more to say to you,
or what more to do for you to procure
your Conversion I do not know. If
it had been in my power to have shewed
you Heaven and Hell it self, that you
might better have known the matters that
we speak of, I think I should have done
it. But God will not have men live by
sense in this life, but by Faith. If I could
but help you all to such a knowledge and
apprehension of these in visible things,
as the worst of you shall have as soon as
you are dead, then I should make but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
doubt of your Conversion and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Sure if you had but such a sight,
the force of it would so work upon you,
that before I went out of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you would all cry out that you are
<hi>resolved</hi> to be new Creatures. But though
this be beyond my power, and though
I cannot shew you your great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
things that every eye here must
shortly see; yet I come not to you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>glass</hi> of Gods own making, and in
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:63001:273"/>
that <hi>glass</hi> you may see them. <hi>There</hi> if
you have but an eye of Faith, you may
see that God that you have so long of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
and that now so earnestly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
you to return: There you may see
that Crucified Christ that hath opened
you a way for Repentance by his Blood,
and pleadeth that Blood with you for the
melting of your impenitent, obstinate
hearts. There you may see the odious
face of sinne, and the amiable face of
Holiness, which is the Image of God:
There you may see both Heaven and
Hell for all that they are invisible; and
may know what <hi>will</hi> be, and that to all
Eternity, as well as what is.</p>
               <p>And will not such a sight in the glass
of Gods Word, serve turn to move thee
presently to give up the trade of sinning,
and to Resolve before thou stir for God?
I am now come to the End of this part of
my work: if the reading of it have
brought thee to the End of thy ungodly,
careless life, it will be happy for thee,
and I shall so far attain the End of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
I have purposely put this Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Necessity of Resolution in
the last place, that I might leave upon
thy spirit the Reasons for Resolution,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:63001:274"/>
that here I have laid down. And now I
beseech thee Reader whoever thou art;
with all the earnestness that I am able to
use with thee, as ever thou wouldest
scape the fruits of all thy sinne, as ever
thou wouldest see the face of God with
comfort, and have him thy reconciled
Father in Christ; as ever thou wouldest
have a saving part in Christ, and have
him stand thy friend in thy extremities;
as ever thou wouldest have hope in thy
death, and stand on the right hand, and
be justified at Judgment; as ever thou
wouldest scape the day of Vengeance,
prepared for the unconverted, and the
endless misery that will fall upon all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
Souls, as sure as the Heaven is
over thy head: See that thou <hi>Resolve</hi>
and <hi>Turn</hi> to God, and trifle with him
no more. Away with thy old transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
away with thy careless, worldly
life; away with thy ungodly company;
and set thy selfe presently to seek after
thy Salvation with all thy heart, and
mind, and might. I tell thee once more,
that Heaven and Hell are not matters to
be jested with; nor to be carelesly
thought of, or spoken of, or regarded.
The God of Heaven stands over thee now
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:63001:274"/>
while thou art reading all these words,
and he seeth thy heart whether thou art
Resolved to turn or not. Shall he see
thee read such urgent Reasons, and yet
wilt not Resolve? Shall he see thee read
these earnest requests, and yet not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve?
What? not to come home to thy
God, to thy Father, to thy Saviour, to
to thy self, after so long and wilfull sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
What? not to accept of Mercy,
now it is even thrust into thy hands;
when thou hast neglected, and abused
Mercy so long. O let not the Just and
Jealous God stand over thee, and see thee
guilty of such wickedness? If thou be a
Christian shew thy self a Christian, and
use thy belief, and come to God. If thou
be a man, shew thy self a man, and use
thy Reason, and come away to God. I
beseech thee read over and over again
the Reasons that I have here offered thee,
and judge whether a reasonable man
should resist them, and delay an hour to
come in to God. I that am now writing
these lines of Exhortatation to thee, must
shortly meet thee at the barre of Christ.
I do now adjure thee, and charge thee
in the Name of the living God, that thou
do not thy self and me that wrong, as
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:63001:275"/>
to make me lose this labour with thee,
and that thou put me not to come in as a
witness against thee, to thy coufusion
and condemnation. Resolve therefore
presently in the strength of Christ, and
strik an unchangeable Covenant with him:
Get thee to thy knees, and bewaile with
tears thy former life, and deliver up thy
self wholly now to Christ; and never
break this Covenant more.</p>
               <p>If thou lay by the Book, and go away
the same, and no perswasion will do any
good upon thee, but unholy thou wilt
still be, and sensual, and worldly still
thou wilt be; I call thy Conscience to
witness, that thou wast warned of the evill
that is neer thee; and Conscience shall
obey this call, and bear me witness whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou wilt or not: And this Book
which thou hast read, which I intended for
thy Conversion and Salvation, shall be
a witness against thee: Though age or
fire consume the leaves and lines of it,
yet God and Conscience shall bring it to
thy memory, and thou shalt then be the
more confounded to think what Reasons,
and earnest perswasions thou didst reject
in so plain, so great, and necessary a
case.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="533" facs="tcp:63001:275"/>
But if the Holy Ghost will now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
thy tutor, and at once both put
this Book into thy hand, and his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
light into thy understanding, and
his life into thy heart, and effectually
perswade thee to <hi>Resolve</hi> and <hi>Turn,</hi> how
happy wilt thou be to all Eternity?
Make no more words on it; but answer
my request, as thou wouldest do if thou
wert in a burning fire, and I intreated
thee to come out. Thou hast long enough
grieved Christ and his Spirit, and long
enough grieved thy friends and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
Resolve this hour, and Rejoyce
them that thou hast grieved; and now
grieve the Devil, that thou hast hitherto
rejoyced; and hereafter grieve the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and thy own deceitfull flesh, whose
sinfull desires thou hast hitherto follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And if thou also grieve thy self a
little while, by that moderate sorrow
that thy sinne hath made necessary for
thee, it will be but a preparative to thy
endless joyes, and the day is promised,
and coming apace, when Satan that thou
turnost from, shall trouble thee no more,
and God that thou turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st to, shall wipe
away all tears from thy eyes. And if the
reading of this Book, may be but a means
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:63001:276"/>
of so blessed an End, as God shall have

them that do believe,</hi> (2 Thes 1. 10.)
both thou and I shall then partake of the
