            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THou ſhalt not read here any great matter, for there are but toucht two
or three ſtrings of a well tuned Inſtrument, that gives more Sound then
Harmony, yet enough, to judge, whether the ſound be good. We expect a
fundamental reformation in this matter, as well as in other things: For when
the ſeaſon is at its birth, it will come, notwithſtanding the weak contrivances
and oppoſitions of men. Nature her ſelf is weary with furniſhing her matter
to ſuch as are ignorant of its uſe, according to her intentions: For though
ſhe cries, <hi>Trace me, trace me,</hi> yet men are deaf (and ſelf-endedneſs cannot
ſee the Sun it ſelf) although ſhe gives here and there light evident enough.
Therefore at laſt ſhe will ariſe and daſh gainſaiers to confuſion.</p>

            <head>Some kindling Sparks in matters of
PHYSICK.</head>
            <p>A Phyſitian is to be conſidered in his place, as a Miniſter to the
life of Man, as to the health of his Body.</p>
            <p>There are therefore four things to be obſerved here, 1. <hi>Life,
2. Health, 3. Body, 4. Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. What <hi>Life</hi> is. Note, that a Body without Life is cold, hard and
ſtiff, that is, dead: but when it is alive, it is warm, ſoft and nimble.
As for inſtance, The Earth, which is the great World, in Winter is cold,
hard and frozen, that is, dead: But when, in the Spring, the Sun enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
it, then it revives, becoming warm, and yeelding a living motion of
vegitation. So alſo Man, who is accounted the little World, or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm,</hi>
when dead, his Corps is cold, hard and ſtiff, becauſe it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of life: But when Life ſprings up therein, then he quickens and
grows warm, giving in all actions and doings evidence of life.</p>
            <p>Therefore, like as the Sun that revives the <hi>Macracoſm</hi> (or the Earth)
and warms it, is a heavenly Fire, known by his effects: So the life of
Man is a Microcoſmical Sun, <hi>viz.</hi> a Subcoeleſtial Fire, reviving, warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and moving his body, to the end he may be enlightned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Health,</hi> is a cumulative influence of well-being, proceeding from
life, throughout the Body. By the word Cumulative is to be underſtood
a mutual concurrence of life and health in part of the Body, in ſo much
that life and health can never ſubſiſt ſeparately, no more than the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
can ſubſiſt without the Sun it ſelf; and the Sun cannot be without
his ſhining or light: As for Example, When a Man is wounded in his
foot, then health being diſordered, life is alſo weakned.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Body</hi> is the veſſel of life and health, ſo exactly fitted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
(as a Watch) that the leaſt Atome croſſing its Structure, is
able to bring both life and health into a confuſion, yea to total ruine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Man</hi> is (as to his material form) a compound of life and body,
which being well or ill influenced, is healthful or ſickly.</p>
            <p>So having declared, that a Phyſician is a Miniſter to the Life of Man
(as to the health of his body) it appears plainly, whether unto the Life,
Health or Body, he ought to make his applications, when Man is at a
loſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105777:3"/>
As to the Body; If we conſider it either as it was in the beginning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it received life by divine inſpiration, or as it is after the life has left
it: and the applications of a Phyſician thereon were attempted, they
would be as ridiculous as fruitleſs; no leſs than if they were applyed
to an Image of Wood, Braſs or Iron.</p>
            <p>As to the Health (the thing in queſtion) which is loſt and abſent, there
can be made no application; As for inſtance, When a Husbandman has
intruſted a Shepherd with a flock of Sheep, and one of them is gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray,
He for the recovering the loſt Sheep doth not apply himſelf to the
Sheep loſt and abſent, which to the flock is as in a ſtate of privation, but
to the Shepherd, to demand it at his hands.</p>
            <p>To the Life therefore, as to the Shepherd of health, a true Phyſitian,
makes his applications for its recovery, which is <hi>in ſtatu privationis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Life being a fiery principle of Man (as before is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
which enlighteneth the Body, and makes it active, we muſt know,
when ſuch a principle becomes defective, weak and helpleſs, with what
kind of things to ſupply the ſame, which ſupplies are called Medicines,
wherein lies the skill of a Phyſician.</p>
            <p>But that being of a large conſideration, for want of the Adeptive Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which might ſhorten all thoſe many particular preparations; I
ſhall at preſent ſpeak only ſomething in general. And firſt of all, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
my expreſſions to the mean apprehenſions of the unlearned, note
this inſtance; That when thou intendeſt to kindle a Fire, thou doſt not
pour Water upon it, but ſomething of its nature, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome Sparks of its
kind; that is, Fire muſt be kindled with Fire, and not with Water.
And likewiſe, if a Fire be kindled and grows weak, thou uſeſt the ſame
means to encreaſe it, as thou didſt to kindle it, or ſomething homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to it, <hi>viz.</hi> by putting Fewel, as Wood, Coals, Oyl, &amp;c. to it, to
ſtrengthen, feed, and relieve it: But if thou puts thereto Water, Stones
and ſuch like, thou wouldſt ſooner quench, then reſtore thy Fire. Hence
the Maxime is to be underſtood: We are nouriſhed with that, of which
we are made.</p>
            <p>The Heaven, the World (or Earth) and Man correſpond mutually to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
The Sun (taken as) the life of the Heaven, ſhining into the
Water, reflects its own Image, as in a Looking-glaſs, it doth the like on
the Earth, which being not diaphanous, makes it not appear, as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth. Yet the Earth, being the Mother of Corporification, the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
from above, keeps the ſaid Image cloſer, and makes it ſubſtantial,
appearing in a body, as being the earthly Sun, and it is called Gold. In
like manner the Body of Man, being ſo far prepared in the womb, that it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105777:3"/>
is capable of life, then by the all-overpowring Sun (in a moment, as Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
or Spirit of Wine) it conceives Fire, <hi>viz</hi> the Image of the ſaid Sun,
and makes it ſubſtantial to its nature, which then is called <hi>Life,</hi> he thus
being <hi>Lampas vitae.</hi> Hence this Maxime, <hi>Sol &amp; homo generent hominem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus even as the Heaven, the Earth and Man: So the Sun, Gold and
Life are knit together by influence, which may be ſenſibly perceived,
when there happens, either almoſt, or a total Eclipſe of the Sun, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
find themſelves breathleſs, through the obſtruction of the Sun's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.
The Life of Man therefore being either weak or otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
its proper Remedy would be Gold, as to relieve Fire with
Fire: But as is aboveſaid, it cannot eaſily be dealt withall, and muſt be
laid aſide for the <hi>Adepti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So there remains nothing, but Wood, Coals, or the like combuſtible
matter, which however they are in ſome meaſure homogeneal to Life,
yet without a preparation, in the beſt manner, are hardly fit to kindle
or nouriſh Life, in order to conſume or expel diſeaſes from the Body.
But when they are duly prepared, their effects will be the better and
more evident: As for inſtance; When it happens that any body is
taken with a ſudden fright, his Life becomes weak, which may cauſe
him to ſwoon away; then if the Life be furniſhed with ſomething of
its nature, that is, with a fiery Medicine, well prepared (as may be a
good <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or the like) he will recover inſtantly, and what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
then he doth drink, it will not intoxicate him, but it repaireth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
into the chief reſidence of life, to aſſiſt and go along with it. The
ſame may be ſeen in any man, tyred out, for when he drinks a good
draught of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> he gathereth ſtrength again preſently; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ignorantly ſpoken, that it would burn a man, becauſe Fire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
burn Fire; but Fire is refreſhed by Fire, and they increaſe one
another, rejoycing mutually, as being of one nature. But Water and
cold things will quench it, becauſe they have no unity with Fire, nay
they are death to the Fire.</p>
            <p>Therefore the more any Medicine partakes of fiery qualities, the more
it is of the nature of Life, and can ſtrengthen it the better, to expel the
Diſeaſe, and ſettle it again in its own ſeat.</p>
            <p>The Scripture ſaith, that the Life of the Body is in its Blood; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
will try this, muſt anotomize it with Fire, which will manifeſt a moſt
fiery Spirit, or volatile Salt. This Spirit doubtleſs is (in the Blood) the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
of the Life, or at leaſt its food; as Wood for Fire. Now obſerve,
the better every noriſhment is prepared, the fitter it is for digeſtion; as,
raw fleſh would not agree with the Stomack of a Man, but when it is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105777:4"/>
roſted or boyled tender, it is of an eaſie digeſtion: So vulgar Medicines
rawly and roughly wrought and compounded, would hardly be ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
or welcome, as when they are brought to a more ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
by the Spagirical Anotomy of the Fire, coming nearer to the nature
of Life: For the panting Life (in reference to its weakneſs) greedily ſucks
ſuch a Medicine, even as the Load-ſtone attracts Iron to its ſelf: And
being thereby relieved and refreſhed, drives the Diſeaſe out of the Body,
and repaireth to its place.</p>
            <p>And ſuch a Medicine may juſtly be called a Cordial, as refreſhing the
Spirit of Life, which is no ſuch Pottage, as being well ſweetened with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
is termed a Cordial, yet void of admittance into the ſociety of Life,
to corroborate the ſwouning Spirits, as being moſt commonly heterogeneal
to them.</p>
            <p>What kind of Medicines then are the beſt next to that, that could be
wiſhed for out of Gold? Note, that I have ſaid, 1. That the Blood is the
ſeat of Life. 2. That the application ought to be made to the Life. 3. That
the Blood contains a moſt fiery Spirit and a volatile Salt: and 4. That
the food of Life is that moſt fiery Spirit and volatile Salt.</p>
            <p>According to theſe Principles, experience hath taught, that whatſoever
has been done worthy of note, has been effected either by Fiery Spirits
or Volatile Salts, as being ready to joyn preſently with the food of Life,
againſt the Diſtempers; and to get Victory, if the Patient be not paſt
cure.</p>
            <p>All created ſublunary things, are divided into Animals, Vegetables and
Minerals. And we find that the firſt yeelds a Fiery Spirit and Volatile.
Salt, as well in the Urine, as in the Fleſh and Blood, both of an excellent
fiery quality and eminently medicinal.</p>
            <p>In the Vegetables we find nothing more effectual than their Spirits, as
well their eſſential and volatile Salts; And eſpecially when their <hi>Alcaliis</hi>
may be diſcloſed or extracted, and brought unto that prerogative of vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility.</p>
            <p>In the Minerals we find the Sulphurs of Minerals and Mettals, after
they are ſeparated (by Fire) from the crude malignant Mercuriality, who
being then harmleſs, are called Tinctures.</p>
            <p>Now theſe ſulphurous Tinctures, Spirits and Salts do all partake of the
fiery quality, and are apt therefore to joyn with the Life, which is Fire,
againſt the Diſtemper, and root it out of the Body.</p>
            <p>Therefore let no body henceforth be ſo ignorant as to ſay, that a Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
making uſe of thoſe excellent Medicines, doth burn the Patient: when
in the mean time others go about, to feed the Fire of Life with Water, or
rather to quench it totally.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:105777:4"/>
Object. <hi>But what ſhall we do, when a Patient lies in a great burning heat,
ſhall we then put fire to fire?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is indeed the only thing that has hitherto deceived many
Phyſitians, to avoid hot things (as they call them) to be adminiſtred to
ſuch as lie in a hot burning fit. Therefore remember what I have ſaid of
the Life, as being Caeleſtial Fire and Light, moſt natural to the Body,
without which the Body is cold, dark and dead.</p>
            <p>To this take notice of this inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> That when Iron, or the like, is
put into <hi>Aquafortis,</hi> though it feeleth coldiſh, yet preſently it grows hot
and boyls without Fire, in ſo much, that a man with his bare hand can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hold the Veſſel that contains it.</p>
            <p>This burning heat, ſeems unto Man to ariſe from the violent action of
the <hi>Aquafortiſh</hi> Spirit upon the Iron, which the eye may eaſily diſern.
Suppoſe thou wouldſt quench this hot burning Fire, by pouring much
cold Water upon it, as a thing contrary to the Fire; though that boyling
may ſeem to ceaſe, and be as it were quenched, yet in effect it will prove
the ſame, becauſe it will conſume the Iron one way as well as the other
way, however more ſlowly and inſenſibly, when Water is poured upon it.</p>
            <p>Therefore to put cold things to this fire, is not the way to quench it:
But wilt thou do right, then give to the Spirit to eat or devour Salt; thus
he ſhall loſe his ſtrength, be broken and leave boyling with conſuming.
Here appears, that the Salt is not a cold thing, yet able, to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
hot things, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Aquafortis</hi> and the Iron. In like manner, when
ſuch a burning heat riſes in a ſick body, it riſes from a parallel action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two things, working upon one another. And therefore make thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
not with cold things immediately to the hot burning, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
material, but only an accidental quality or ſymptome flowing from
the action of theſe two fighting things aforeſaid upon the Body: But make
thy applications to either of them two, and break its ſtrength, then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the heat will ceaſe; and this may be done with hot things (ſo called) as
well as any other may think to do it with cold ones, which the <hi>Salia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
declared of (although being in their center a meer Fire) will experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and make true, in ſo much, that by the application of them, the
ſaid burning will not only be quenched, but the Spirit of Life mightily
ſtrengthened alſo, and thereby enabled to overpower its enemies, who
endeavour to quarter in its ſtrong-hold.</p>
            <p>The Body of Man is filled every where with Volatile Salt, nay it is
but little elſe than a Volatile Salt throughout, ſave the contents of the
Stomach and its government, whoſe fermental moiſture is acid, parallel
to Vinegar, Spirit of Sulphur, or the like acid Liquors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:105777:5"/>
But acid Liquors, and volatile Salts are enemies, fighting together, to
over-power one another. Hence, when perhaps ſomething acid falls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the ſaid government of the Stomach, then preſently riſes a fight
between the ſaid acid and volatile Salt, in the region of the Blood, where
the ſaid acid is a ſtranger, falling as a Pirate into the Native Countrey
of the volatile Salt, whoſe dominion is in the Blood: of which fight,
flows (as it were) an hot inviſible vapour (like unto the radiant ſhining
of the Sun) throughout the Body, and makes the Phyſician believe that
it is the Diſtemper it ſelf, when in the mean while the very root of the
Diſtemper is hidden from his eyes. Therefore he goes on to quench that
burning heat with cold things (ſo called) by which only he weakeneth
the natural Fire of Life, and for the expectation of having quenched the
ſaid burning heat, he has given to that ſtrange Pirate a large compaſs to
waſte inſenſibly the Garriſon of the Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> the volatile Salt in it;
and ſo being deceived himſelf, he deceiveth his Patient alſo, not of ſet-purpoſe,
but being not perſwaded otherwiſe, and therefore worthy of
compaſſion. When one takes Cochinele (which is like meerly coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
Blood) and diſſolveth it in Water, then poureth <hi>Aquafortis</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
there will preſently appear an action betwixt the ſaid Cochinele
and the Aquafortis: which may ſerve for an Inſtance, whereby the eye
of man may diſcern, as it were demonſtratively, what it effects when
ſuch an acid Gueſt draweth into the Blood.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſomewhat anſwered to that vulgar Objection, which
might have been move enlarged if my intention had been bent to that
purpoſe; yet it may ſuffice to ſuch as can kindle a Fire, although having
nothing elſe but this Tinder Spark.</p>
