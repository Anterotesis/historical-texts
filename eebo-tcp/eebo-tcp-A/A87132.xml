            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>AVID was a man after Gods own heart, yet made the people Judges of what was of God, and that even in matters of Religion; as where he propoſeth unto the Repreſentative, conſiſting of twenty four thouſand, in this manner: <hi>If it ſeem good unto you, and that it be of the Lord our God, let us—bring again the Ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul,</hi> 1 Chro. 13. But men in this Nation blow hot and cold: one main exception which the Prelatical and Presbyterian Sects have againſt Popular Government, is, that as to Religion it will truſt every man unto his own Liberty; and that onely for which the reſt of the Religious Sects apprehend popular Government, is, that the Spirit of the Nation (as they ſay) is not to be truſted with the Liberty of Conſcience, in that it is inclining to perſecute for Religion. What Remedy? Ask the former Sects, or parties different in judgment as to matter of Religion, (for the word ſignifies no more) they tell you a King; ask the latter, they tell you ſome certain or convenient number of Princes, or an Oligarchy: But ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Put not your truſt in Princes.</hi> It doth not any where ſay the like of the <hi>Congregation of the Lord,</hi> or of the people; but rather the contrary, as is implyed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168575:3"/>
already alledged of <hi>Davids</hi> Propoſition unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and is yet plainer in the Propoſition of <hi>Moſes</hi> unto the whole people, even before they were under orders of popular Government; and when they were to introduce ſuch orders, as where he ſaith, <hi>Take unto you wiſe men, and known among your Tribes, and I will make them Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers over you.</hi> Now theſe Rulers thus elected by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were Supreme, both in matter of Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: in which words therefore, both by the Command of God, and the example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> you have the ſpirit of the people truſted with all matters either Civil or Religious. Throughout the Teſtaments, Old and New, (as I have over and over demonſtrated unto you) the proceedings of God, as to the matter of Government, go not beſide the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of humane Prudence the breadth of one hair. Let Saints therefore, or others, be they who or what they will, work otherwiſe in like caſes, or (to ſpeak more particularly unto the preſent ſtate of things) obtrude upon us Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy when they can or dare, they ſhall be, and ſoon confeſs themſelves to be below men, even of natural parts. In the mean while, having thus the free leave and encouragement both of Scripture and Religion, I come unto a farther diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of this point by the card of Reaſon, and the courſe of Prudence.</p>
            <p>In all the Circle of Government, there are but three ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; the ſpirit of a Prince, the ſpirit of the Oligarchy, and the ſpirit of a Free People: wherefore if the ſpirit of a free people be not to be truſted with their Liberty, or, which is all one, with the Government, then muſt it follow of neceſſity; that either the ſpirit of a Prince, or of the Oligarchy, is to be truſted with the Liberty of the people, or with their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>What the ſpirit of a Prince intruſted with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Liberty of the people hath been, we have had large experience; and full enough of the ſpirit of the Oligarchy: for a ſingle Council having both the right of Debate and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, never was nor can be eſteemed a Commonwealth, but ever was and will be known for meer Oligarchy. It is true,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168575:3"/>
that the ſpirit of the people, in different caſes, is as different as that of a man. A man is not of that ſpirit when he is ſick, as when he is well: if you touch a ſick man, you hurt him; if you ſpeak to him, he is froward; he deſpairs of his health; he throws down his medicines: but give him eaſe, he is <hi>debonaire</hi> and thankful; give him a cure, and he bleſſeth you. It is no otherwiſe with the people. A people under a yoke which they have loſt all hopes of breaking, are of a broken, a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, a puſillanimous ſpirit, as the <hi>Paiſant</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under a yoke which they are not out of hopes to break, are of an impatient, of an active, and of a turbulent ſpirit, as the Romans under their Senate for Life, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> under the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (after the ruine of the Nobility) under the late <hi>Monarchy.</hi> A people broken looſe from their ancient and accuſtomed form, and yet unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced unto any other, is of a wilde, a giddy ſpirit; and (as the Politician ſaith) like ſome bird or beaſt, which having been bred in a leaſe or chain, and gotten looſe, can neither prey for it ſelf, nor hath any body to feed it, till (as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes to paſs) it be taken up by the remainder of the broken chain or leaſe, and tyed ſo much the ſhorter; as befell thoſe in <hi>Spain</hi> after the War of the Commonalties, and the Neapolitans after that of <hi>Mazinello.</hi> But a people under orders of popular Government, are of the moſt prudent and ſerene ſpirit, and the voydeſt of inteſtine diſcord or ſedition; as the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Switz,</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore thus we may in no wiſe argue: A Ship with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tackling and Steerage is not to be truſted with any fraight, nor can make any Voyage: therefore a ſhip with Tackling and Steerage is not to be truſted with any fraight, nor can make any Voyage. But to ſay that the people not under fit Orders of popular Government, are not capable of Liberty; therefore the people under fit Orders of popular Government, are not capable of Liberty, is no better: as the former Argument breaketh up all hope of Trade, ſo the latter breaketh up all hopes of popular Government.</p>
            <p>Here lyeth the point. The Mariner truſteth not unto the Sea, but to his Ship. The ſpirit of the people is no wiſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168575:4"/>
to be truſted with their Liberty, but by ſtated Laws or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: ſo the truſt is not in the ſpirit of the people, but in the frame of thoſe Orders, which as they are tite or leaky, are the Ship out of which the people being once imbarqued, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtir, and without which they can have no motion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the Trumpet give an uncertain ſound, who ſhall prepare himſelf unto the Battel?</hi> It is not a multitude that makes an Army, but their Diſcipline, their Arms, the Diſtribution of them into Troops, Companies, Regiments, and Brigades: this for the Van, that for the Rear-ward; &amp; theſe bodies muſt either rout themſelves, which is not their intereſt, or have no motion at all, but ſuch onely as is according unto Orders: If they march, if they alt, if they lodge, if they charge, all is according unto Orders. Wherefore he that giveth the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, truſteth not to the Army, but the Army truſteth him. It is no otherwiſe in the ordering of a Commonwealth. Why ſay we then, that the people are not to be truſted, while cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that in a Commonwealth rightly ordered, they can have no other motion then according unto the Orders of their Commonwealth? Have we not ſeen what difference there may be in an Houſe elected by the Counties onely, and an Houſe elected both by the Boroughs &amp; the Counties? Is this ſo much from the people, as from their Orders? The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Senate for Life, before the inſtitution of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> was dangerous; after the inſtitution of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> was not dangerous. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> before the introduction of their preſent policy, were very tumultuous; ſince the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of the ſame, are the moſt ſerene Commonwealth. Was this from the people who are the ſame, or from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of their Orders? If you will truſt Orders, and not men, you truſt not unto the people, but unto your Orders: ſee then that your Orders be ſecure, and the people fall not.</p>
            <p>You the preſent Rulers of <hi>England,</hi> now the object of Angels and Men, in the fear of God look to it. I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, and the world will ſay to all poſterity, If <hi>England</hi> through the want of Orders be ruined, it was not that you needed to truſt the people, but that the people truſted you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:168575:4"/>
And of what Orders have ſome of you that lay the people ſo low, and think your ſelves onely to be truſted, made offer? Do you not propoſe,</p>
            <p>That they who are or ſhall be intrusted, <hi>(with Power or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority)</hi> be ſuch as ſhall be found to be moſt eminent for Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Faithfulneſs, and Conſtancy to the Good Old Cauſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of theſe Nations?</p>
            <p>Now I beſeech you conſider, if you mean to make your ſelves Judges, without the People or Parliament (in ſuch manner as you <hi>have owned your Commander in Chief)</hi> who are Godly, and what the Intereſt of the Nation is, what kind of Commonwealth this muſt make: Or if you mean to make the People Judges, without which it is impoſſible there ſhould be any well-ordered Commonwealth, whether you can give them any other Rule then according unto <hi>Moſes, Take ye wiſe men, and understanding, and known among your Tribes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider whether thoſe you would indemnifie for ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the late unnatural and diſhonourable Yoak, be eminent for Godlineſs, Faithfulneſs to the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> or for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the Intereſt of theſe Nations; and whether to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch Qualifications as may bring theſe or the like again into power, be the more probable way unto a Free-State, or to leave the People acording unto the Rule of <hi>Moſes,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Judgement in theſe Caſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You propoſe,</hi> That to the end the Legiſlative Authority of this Commonwealth may not by their long ſitting, become bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome or inconvenient, there may be effectual proviſion made for a due ſucceſſion thereof.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you to conſider what Example can be produced of any one Commonwealth wherein the Legiſlative Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was not continually extant or ſitting; and what reaſon there can be that it ſhould poſſibly be otherwiſe, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remaining a Commonwealth. Conſider whether in caſe the two Houſes of Parliament had been heretofore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually ſitting, the Government had not been a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; Whether the intervals of the ſame, were not that in a good part, which cauſed it to be Monarchical?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168575:5"/>
and ſo, whether the Legiſlative Authority in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth being intermitted, muſt not convert the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth into Monarchy, in caſe the intervals be guided by a Single Perſon; or into Oligarchy, in caſe they be guided by a Council. Laſtly, Conſider whether ſuch a Council in the intervals of Parliaments, be not, of all others, that Molehil by which a Tyrant can be moſt conveniently raiſed, for a jump into a Throne, or what there is in this caſe to withſtand him, though <hi>White-hall</hi> ſhould be ſold or pul'd down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, you propoſe,</hi> That the Legiſlative Power be in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative conſisting of an Houſe ſucceſſively choſen by the People, and of a ſelect Senate, co-ordinate in Power.</p>
            <p>Upon which I beſeech you to conſider, Whether there can be any ſafe Repreſentative of the People, not conſtituted of ſuch a number, and by ſuch Rules as muſt take in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the whole People: whether there be not difference between the intereſt which a People can have under Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and the Intereſt which a People ought to have under a Commonwealth: and whether it be a good Argument, that an Aſſembly of four hundred upon intervals, was a ſufficient Repreſentative of the People under Monarchy, or under Lords on whom they depended; therefore the like may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient under a Commonwealth, where they are their own Lords, and have no dependence. I beſeech you to conſider whether it be natural unto any Aſſembly to reſolve other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then according unto the Intereſt of that Aſſembly. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not natural unto the Senate, eſpecially being not elected by the People, but obtruded, and, as I ſuſpect, for life, to Debate according as they intend to Reſolve, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve according to the Intereſt of the Few, or of a Party. Whether it be not unnatural, confuſed and dangerous unto a Repreſentative of the People, rightly conſtituted, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, whether it be not natural to ſuch a Repreſentative to Reſolve according unto the Intereſt of the whole People? Whether the Senate Reſolving according unto the Intereſt of <hi>the Few,</hi> and the Repreſentative Reſolving according to the Intereſt of <hi>the Many,</hi> be not the certain way of creating
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168575:5"/>
feud between the Senate and the people, or of introducing Blood and Civil War. And laſt of all, whether to declare the Senate and the Repreſentative co-ordinate, be not to give unto either Council both the Debate and the Reſult in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, and in that the inavoydable occaſion of ſuch feud.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, you propoſe,</hi> That the Executive Power be in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State.</p>
            <p>Upon which I beſeech you to conſider, whether ever the Prytans in <hi>Athens,</hi> the Colledge in <hi>Venice,</hi> or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State in any Commonwealth, had any Executive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, except in the management perhaps of a War, or Treaty with forraign States.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I beſeech you to conſider whether theſe Propoſitions, and ſuch like, be not contrary unto the whole courſe of popular Prudence in all or any one Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and tending unto the certain deſtruction, or at leaſt intolerable confuſion of the people. Yet are theſe, I ſuppoſe, intended by you as a bar unto Monarchy, and a guard unto the Liberty of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>To the ORDERS of a COMMONWEALTH. The whole Territory is equally divided into fifty Tribes or Shires: in every one of theſe Tribes, the people of each Pariſh elect out of themſelves one man in five to be for that year a Deputy of that Pariſh. I but, they will chooſe Cavalieres or Presbyterians. Well, if that be the worſt, for diſcourſe ſake be it ſo. Theſe Deputies thus choſen in each Pariſh, are upon ſome certain day in their year to aſſemble at the Capital of their Tribe or Shire, and there to elect a few to be Knights or Senators, and a fuller number to be Burgeſſes or Deputies in the Repreſentative of the people. Good: and theſe alſo muſt therefore be ſuch as were their Electors. So the ſoveraign Aſſemblies of the Nation will conſiſt of Presbyterians and Cavalieres: and being thus conſtituted, will either introduce Monarchy, or invade the Liberty of Conſcience, or both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:168575:6"/>
But theſe at their Election take an Oath of Allegiance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Comonwealth. An Oath is nothing. How! not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians? Let us ſee what it hath been among Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. <hi>Brutus</hi> having driven out the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> or Roman Kings, thought the ſpirit of that people not yet fit to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with their Liberty; and for this cauſe gave them an Oath, whereby they abjured Kings; which was then thought and found in that caſe to be enough. But if this would not have ſerved the turn, what could? For <hi>Brutus</hi> to have expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Kings, and yet not to have given the people their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, he well knew was not to have driven forth Monarchy, but to have laid Obligation upon the people to bring it back again in hatred of the Oligarchy; as we in our way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding have felt, and continue ſtill to feel, yet blame the people upon as good grounds as if we ſhould ſay, The people are impatient of truſting Oligarchy with their Liberty; therefore the people are not to be truſted with their Liberty. But ſuppoſing an Oath were as ſlight a matter as indeed in theſe days it is made; theſe Soveraign Aſſemblies, though they ſhould be thus conſtituted of Presbyterians and Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieres onely, yet could in no wiſe either introduce Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, or invade the Liberty of Conſcience, for theſe Reaſons: The natural tendency of every thing, is unto the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it ſelf: but Cavalieres and Presbyterians under theſe Orders are a Commonwealth; therefore their natural tendency muſt be to the preſervation of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. It is not ſo long ſince a Roundhead was made a Prince; did he make a Commonwealth? Or what more reaſon can there be, why if you make Cavalieres and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents a Commonwealth, they ſhould make a King? What experience is there in the world that the greateſt Cavalieres being once brought under the Orders of popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rightly balanced, did not thenceforth deteſt Monarchy? The people of <hi>Rome (Libertatis dulcedine nondum experta)</hi> were the greateſt Cavalieres in the world; for above one hundred years together, they obſtructed their Senate, which would have introduced a Commonwealth, and cauſed them to continue under Monarchy: but from the firſt introduction
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168575:6"/>
of popular Government, continued under perfect deteſtation of the very name.</p>
            <p>Putting the caſe that the Senate could have a will to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it ſelf, and introduce Monarchy, you muſt alſo put the caſe that they may have ſome intereſt to do it: for the will of every Aſſembly ariſeth from the intereſt of the ſame. Now what intereſt can there be in a Senate thus inſtituted, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it ſelf, and ſet up Monarchy?</p>
            <p>The Senate can do nothing but by propoſing unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: it is not poſſible for them to agree unto any thing that can be propoſed, without debating it; nor can any Debate tend unto any ſuch agreement, but in the force of reaſons thereunto conducing. Now what reaſon had ever any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or can any Senate ever have, to incline them unto ſuch an end?</p>
            <p>No man nor Aſſembly can will that which is impoſſible: but where a Commonwealth is rightly balanced, that a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy can there have any Balance, except the Senate can perſwade people to quit three parts in four of the whole Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory unto a Prince, or to a Nobility, is impoſſible. But if the introduction of Monarchy can neither be in the will of the Senate, though that ſhould conſiſt altogether of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valieres and Presbyterians, then much leſs can it be in the will of the Aſſembly of the people, though this alſo ſhould conſiſt altogether of Cavalieres and Presbyterians.</p>
            <p>But while we talk that the people will be ſo raſh in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, we obſerve not that this is but the raſhneſs of the Few, exalting their wiſdom above the wiſdom of the people. If it be not ſeen that a Commonwealth ſo ordered as hath been ſhewn, muſt of neceſſity conſiſt in the Senate of the wiſdom, and in the popular Aſſembly of the intereſt of the whole Nation, after ſuch manner that there can be no Law not invented by the wiſeſt, and enacted by the honeſteſt, what the people under ſuch a Form ſhall do, cannot be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and if this be ſeen, we muſt either believe that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of Monarchy, and the protection of Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, concern not the wiſdom or intereſt of the Nation, in which caſe they are points upon which the preſent power
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168575:7"/>
ought in no wiſe to inſiſt, or that being according unto the wiſdom and intereſt of the Nation, that wiſdom and intereſt ſo collected as hath been ſhewn, muſt be much more able to judge of, obliged to adhere unto, and effectual to proſecute thoſe ends, then any hundred or two hundred men in the world, were they never ſo ſelect and unbyaſſed. Which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs is not ſaid againſt the ways we have to go, but for the end in which we are to acquieſce.</p>
            <p>The diſtinction of Liberty into Civil and Spiritual, is not ancient, but of a latter date; there being indeed no ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction: for the Liberty of Conſcience once granted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from Civil Liberty, Civil Liberty can have no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It was the onely excuſe that the late Tyrant pretended for his Uſurpation, that he coukl ſee no other means to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Liberty of Conſcience. Suppoſe an Oligarchy were like-minded, would it follow that the Tyrant did not, or that the Oligarchy could not uſurp Civil Liberty? Or is not this the onely plauſible way by which they might? What encouragement (except for preſent ends, or ſome ſhort time) hath liberty of Conſcience had to truſt more unto men, then Civil Liberty? Or what became of that Civil Liberty which was at any time truſted unto a Prince, or to the Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy? On the other ſide, where hath that Free State or Commonwealth been ever known, that gave not Liberty of Conſcience?</p>
            <p>In <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the worſt, or when it was ſcarce a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <hi>Paul earneſtly beholding the Council,</hi> that is, the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim, or Senate of the Jews,—<hi>cryed out,—Men and Brethren—of the hope and reſurrection of the dead, I am called in queſtion: and when he had ſo ſaid, there aroſe diſſention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Phariſees and the Sadduces.—For the Sadduces ſay, That there is no reſurrection, neither angel nor ſpirit: but the Phariſees confeſs both,</hi> Act. 23. Howbeit the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> for the reſt adhered unto the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the Old Teſtament, of which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> made little or no account in reſpect of their Oral Law, or traditions. Whence it followeth, that in this <hi>Senate</hi> there were two Religions, and by conſequence that in this Commonwealth there was Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168575:7"/>
and ſo much the rather, in that beſides theſe Sects, and that alſo of the Eſſenes, this Commonwealth conſiſted in a good part of <hi>Proſelytes of the Gates,</hi> who did not at all receive the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but onely the precepts given by God to <hi>Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> (Act 17.) in like manner, <hi>ſeeming to be a ſetter forth of ſtrange gods,</hi> (in the Commonwealth of <hi>Athens) becauſe he preached unto them Jeſus, and the Reſurrection;</hi> and the Athenians, being given to ſpend their time in telling or hearing ſome new thing, <hi>they took him and brought him</hi> (not by application of any violence, but out of curioſitie and delight in novelties) <hi>unto Areopagus,</hi> or unto the famous Senate in <hi>Athens,</hi> called <hi>The Areopagites,</hi> honoured by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> to furniſh an Argument againſt Atheiſts; where he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, That to ſay, <hi>The World is governed without God,</hi> is as if one ſhould ſay, That <hi>the Commonwealth of Athens is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without the Areopagites. Paul</hi> being thus brought unto <hi>Areopagus,</hi> or unto the place (that you may ſee it was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cuſtody) where the Senators uſed to walk, <hi>ſtood in the midſt of Mars-hill,</hi> and preached: now the <hi>Areopagites</hi> or Senators, were ſome Epicureans, who held as the Sadduces; and others Stoicks, who held as the Phariſees: and <hi>when they heard of the reſurrection of the dead, ſome</hi> (that is, the Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans) <hi>mocked, and others</hi> (that is, the Stoicks) ſaid, <hi>We will hear thee again of this matter. And Paul</hi> (for another Argument that he was all this while at his own diſpoſing, &amp; full Freedom) <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from among them. Howbeit, certain men clave unto him, and believed, among which was Dionyſius the Areopagite.</hi> So in the Senate of <hi>Athens</hi> there were now three Religions; the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean, Stoick, and Chriſtian: whence it muſt needs follow, that in the Commonwealth of <hi>Athens,</hi> there was Liberty of Conſcience. Men that are vers'd in Roman Authors will have little Reaſon to doubt, that the Learnedſt of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gave not much credit unto the fabulous Religion that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them was national: among theſe, as is yet apparent by his Writings, was <hi>Cicero,</hi> who nevertheleſs lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168575:8"/>
That he found it eaſier to pull down a Religion, then to ſet up any; yet was neither <hi>Cicero,</hi> nor any man of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for this, leſs capable of being Conſul, or of any other Magiſtracy. All things are not equally clear in every Story, yet ſhall no man give one reaſon or example that it hath been otherwiſe in any Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>It is true, that the Popiſh Commonwealths do not give the Liberty of Conſcience. No man can give that which he hath not: they depend in part, or in the whole, as to Religion, upon the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſo have not the Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to give: but even theſe do not take it away; for there is no Popiſh Commonwealth that indureth any Inquiſition. Now I ſay, If there be no reaſon nor example that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth ever did invade the Liberty of Conſcience, either there muſt be ſome cauſe in Nature, which hath hitherto had no effect, or there is no reaſon why a Commonwealth can invade the Liberty of Conſcience. But the reaſon why it cannot, is apparent: for the power that can invade the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience, can uſurp civil Liberty; and where there is a power that can uſurp civil Liberty, there is no Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. To think otherwiſe, is to meaſure a Commonwealth by the overflowing and boundleſs paſſions of a Multitude, not by thoſe Laws or Orders without which a Free People can no otherwiſe have a courſe, then a free River without the proper Chanel. Yet as far as we in this Nation do yet ſtand from this object, we can perceive a difference between men, and Orders or Laws. A man will truſt the Law for a thouſand pound, nay muſt truſt it with his whole Eſtate. But he will not truſt a man for an hundred pounds; or if he do, he may repent it. They who dare truſt men, do not underſtand men; and they that dare not truſt Laws or Orders, do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a Commonwealth. I told a Story of my Travels to ſome Gentlemen that were pleaſed with it. The Italians are a grave and a prudent Nation, yet in ſome things no leſs extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant then the wildeſt; particularly in their Carnaval or ſports about Shrovetide: in theſe they are all Mummers, not with our Modeſty, in the night, but for divers dayes together,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168575:8"/>
and before the Sun; during which time, one would think by the ſtrangeneſs of their Habit, that <hi>Italy</hi> were once more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verrun by Goths and Vandals, or new peopled with Turks, Moors and Indians, there being at this time ſuch variety of ſhapes &amp; Pageants. Among theſe, at <hi>Rome</hi> I ſaw one which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented a Kitchin, with all the proper Utenſils in uſe and action. The Cooks were all Cats and Kitlings, ſet in ſuch frames, ſo ty'd and ſo ordered, that the poor creatures could make no motion to get looſe, but the ſame cauſed one to turn the ſpit, another to baſte the meat, a third to ſcim the pot, and a fourth to make green-ſauce. If the Frame of your Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth be not ſuch as cauſeth every one to perform his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain function as neceſſarily as this did the Cat to make green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauce, it is not right.</p>
            <p>But what talk we of Frames or Orders? though we have no certain Frame, no fitting Orders, yet in this Balance there are bounds, ſet even by His Hand <hi>who ſtilleth the raging of the Sea, and the madneſs of His People.</hi> Let the more wary <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier,</hi> or the firy <hi>Presbyterian</hi> march up when he may into the Van, he ſhall lead this Nation into a Commonwealth, or into certain perdition. But if the old Officers, men for the greater part of ſmall Fortunes, but all of large Souls, anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Heroes,</hi> that dared to expoſe themſelves unto ruine for their Country, be reſtored unto their moſt deſerved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, this will be done, and done without a bloody noſe, or a cut finger.</p>
            <p>We hope ye are Saints: but if you be men, look with all your might, with all your prudence, above all, with fervent imploration of GOD's gracious Aſſiſtance (who is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly crowning you) unto the well-ordering of your Commonwealth. In the manner conſiſts the main mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Deteſt the baſe itch of the narrow Oligarchy. If your Commonwealth be rightly inſtituted, ſeven years will not paſs, ere you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> cluſters of Parties, Civil and Religious, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, not through any force, as when cold weather kills flies; but by the riſing of greater Light, as when the Sun puts out

Candles. Theſe in the reaſon of the thing are demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but ſuit better with the ſpirit of the preſent times, by way of Propheſie. <hi>England</hi> ſhall raiſe her Head to ancient Glory, the Heavens ſhall be of the old Metal, the Earth no longer Lead, nor ſhall the ſounding Air eternally renounce the Trumpet of Fame.</p>
