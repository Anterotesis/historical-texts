            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A few WORDS to the KING And both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT, VVorthy their Conſideration in a weighty Concern; to wit, the effect of the Execution of the late Act, made againſt Meetings and Conventicles, ſo called; Through which very many of the Innocent People of God have, and do deeply ſuffer.</head>
            <p>AND this is very certain and obſervable (as one deeply concerned in ſuffering by the aforeſaid Act, my mind became exerciſed in a conſideration of the effects thereof) that it ſaddens the hearts of many, yea indeed the generality of all people, to ſee thoſe they know to be honeſt Neighbours, and good Common-wealths peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their Countrey, to have their known truly gotten Goods and Eſtates driven away and ſpoyled, and that for nothing but the tenderneſs of their Conſciences towards God, and for worſhipping him in Spiri<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> their Eſtates, even to the Impoveriſhing many, both Widdows and Fatherleſs; that how can you think <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, if you conclude us to be ſuch? or how can it be like to bring people from a falſe Church, if ſo, to a true? Since it is ſo unagreeable to the Spirits of all civil people, and that eſpecially to the equal principle of God in all.</p>
            <p>And alſo it is obſervable, that the execution of it, is very burthenſome and troubleſome to the executioners; as we ſee by experience, the Conſtables and other Officers all up and down the Countrey cry out, what a trouble it is to them, to make ſuch havack of their Neighbours Goods, ſo that as ſeveral of them ſay, they can neither eat nor ſleep for trouble to drive their Neighbours Horſes and Cattle by droves to the Markets and Fairs, there to ſtand with them, and be as gaſing ſtocks to the people; and then the people gather into Companies, and talk together and ſhake their heads, for very trouble to ſee ſuch cruelty and barbarous work in ſo peaceable a Nation.</p>
            <p>And it is alſo obſervable, that many the Informers and putters on in this work are commonly of the moſt vileſt, and wickedeſt, beggarly, profaineſt ſort of all people, ſuch as have either waſted their own Eſtates, or ſuch as are ſlothful, Idle, Vagrant Fellows, that never had Eſtates, nor will not work; but having this advantage given them, and that by Authority, ſeek and chuſe rather to live upon the Ruines of other me<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Oh! will you conſider, was ever the like advantage given to the very <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of a Nation; to vaunt themſelves as they do, not only over the ſerious, engenious improving part of the Nation; but alſo over the Magiſtrates, if they do not readily execute the Wills of theſe Informers: ſuch is their Impudence they being backed with Authority, as they perceive themſelves to be by the late Act; Oh! how can you think that a Government, or a true Church, or a Nation can any way be advanced by ſuch unequal works and wretched ins;truments, as have neither regard to God nor good Men, nor good Government, but to drive on their own wicked deſign, to mine honeſt mens Eſtates: and ſo, if the Diligent and Laborious People muſt be oppreſſed, that they cannot Improve, and the Idle and Slothful ſort will not Improve, but waſt and deſtroy the work of the Diligent, the World will become like a Wilderneſs.</p>
