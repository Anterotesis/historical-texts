            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>SOME REASONS,</hi> Why the Ministers of Christ in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ought not to be troubled for praying for the KING; And wherefore we cannot in Conſcience omit that Duty.</head>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ſeriouſly pondered, as in his ſight, whoſe ſervants we are, the practiſe of this duty now prohibited; We find, that we may not omit pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer for our King, notwithſtanding of the ſaid Prohibition: And leaſt our practice be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued, as flowing from ignorance or wilfulnes. We ſhall firſt offer to wipe away that aſperſion of pertinacy, and next ſhew the grounds which do fix us to this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the firſt.</hi> Our witneſs is in heaven, and our record on high, that it is not out of any carnal deſign, or ſtubborneſs of ſpirit, that we continue performing this d<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty. It were extream folly needleſly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Power under whoſe hand the Almighty hath put us. If we durſt adviſe with fleſh and blood [spare thy ſelf] would ſound loud in our ears, and quickly preſent Overtures of yeelding; but the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Almighty, and his Oat<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> lying on our conſciences, hold us on to this duty. 2. We conceive that our peaceable and quiet deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our respective charges, doth vindicate us from the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſtubborneſs and ſedition in this our practice. We have been no hinderance to people under our charge, to hear the burthens in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that are laid upon them; Neither have we anywiſe ſtirred them up to tumults and commotions. 3. The way wherein we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52282:3"/>
walked, speaks herein for us; unleſs conſtancy in conſcientious principles be miſconſtructed, and nicknamed Pertinacy. 4. The point is alſo manifeſt to every one who will ſoberly be pleaſed to conſider the Petition, or Petitions which we preſent to God for him; which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are for a ſanctified uſe of the ſad afflictions that lie on him, and preſervation from ſnares; his condition calling for this much at our hands. Shall others in diſtreſs, captivity, and exile be remembred to God in our publick Prayers, and this be accounted a commendable duty: And ought it to be accounted Pertinacy, not to caſt out from the Prayers of Gods Church and People, the diſtreſſed King, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with ſo great difficulties? 5. When we call to mind our publick Prayers for our late King in the midſt of his hoſtility againſt us, We marvel, if any who profeſs reſpect to tender conſciences, will offer to put the Meſſengers of Christ to trouble for a duty bound on their conſciences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo little hurtful to any. Finally, they who do, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear doing out of pertinacy and ſtubborneſs of spirit, can ſhew no juſt and weighty grounds of their acting or forbearance. But we offer theſe enſuing grounds and warrants of conſcience, whereupon we walk in this practice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We look upon this performance as a duty, not only enjoyned in the Word of God, and eſtabliſhed by the Law of the Land, in the Directory for Worſhip, confirmed by Acts of Parliament; but alſo as bound upon our Conſciences with our own conſent, both in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, and Solemn League and Covenant, wherein He alſo hath entred with us; and therein, not only our own conſciences, but alſo the whole world are called on to witneſs with God (to whom the Oath is made) to our reallity, ſincerity, and conſtancy in performing our duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> This Obligation hath a new tie on our conſciences to this individual Perſon, by the Oath ſworn by the Repreſentative of the Land, in our Names, when the Civil Securities unto Religion, and the Intereſts of Chriſt in his Ordinances, were likewiſe confirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, by his Oath, aſwel as by Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As it is a great ſin in any, to countermand that which God hath commanded, And to give order that a precept, which God hath appointed to oblige us alwaies (though not to all times) ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver oblige, And that we ſhall never give obedience thereto; So when ſuch a command is given out, it is then <hi>caſus confeſſionis:</hi> Then to adhere to the Authority of Divine Precepts, is a neceſſary teſtimony to the truth, and doth oblige them more than ever, unleſs we would obey men rather than God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52282:4"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Miniſters of the Gospel are the Ambaſſadors and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Jeſus Chriſt, from whom they have their Commiſſion which may not be l<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mited nor altered by any power on earth: For if in one duty, earthly powers can alter or limit, they may aſwel do it in moe: And if they may prohibit a duty, they may alſo command that which is no duty, and ſo render us the ſervants of men, in matters of God.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat Conceſſion in the beginning of your Paper, <hi>That the Almighty hath put you under the hand of another Power,</hi> is remarkable: But how well this acknowledgment doth accord with that practice of adhering to the Power which the ſame Almighty hand hath removed, is not apparent. The Queſtion is not, Whether you may pray concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, either for or againſt him in a Chriſtian way, as that GOD would ſhew mercy to his Soul, and give him pardon of ſin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance under that ſtupendious guilt of innocent blood which lyes both upon him, and upon his Fathers houſe, (and that in the judgment of your very ſelves) and that GOD would humble him under thoſe dreadfull appearances of God againſt him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting him from reigning over his people: But whether you may pray for him as King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and put up thoſe favourable requeſts on his behalf, which tend to preſerve a precious and religious remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and obſervance of Him in the Peoples minds. This is the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſcope and ſenſe of the Declaration, which he that runs may read.</p>
            <p>Now for this you ſay, <hi>We ſhall firſt offer to wipe away that aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pertinacy, and next ſhew the grounds which do fix us to this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer whereto, we ſhal firſt remove the grounds whereby you labour to prove that this is your duty, and then leave you to wipe off that aſperſion of pertinacy, if any lay it on you, as well as you can. For if the courſe be warrantable; to perſiſt therein is conſtancy: but if it be not warrantable, it muſt needs be called by ſome other name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52282:4"/>Now for the grounds and warrants of Conſcience, whereupon you walk in this practice, you offer four: whereof indeed only the two firſt are arguments to prove the concluſion, that you ought to pray for the man, whom you call King: but the two laſt ſeem rather to be inferences from it, if they be any thing.</p>
            <p>The two firſt are theſe, which we joyn together, becauſe the ſame anſwer fits them both.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>We look upon this performance as a duty, not onely injoyned in the Word of GOD, and eſtabliſhed by the Law of the Land in the Directory for Worſhip, confirmed by Acts of Parliament; but alſo as bound upon our own conſciences, with our own conſent both in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall and Solemn League and Covenant, wherein he alſo hath entred with us, and therein not onely our own conſciences, but alſo the whole world are called on to witneſſe with GOD to whom the Oath is made, to our reality, ſincerity and conſtancy in performing our duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>This obligation hath a new tie on our conſciences to this individual perſon, by the oath ſworn by the repreſentative of the land in our name, when the civil ſecurities unto Religion, and the Intereſts of Chriſt in his Ordinances, were confirmed to us by his Oath as well as by Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe in four words.</p>
            <p>1. Whereas you alledge <hi>the Word of God,</hi> we are moſt intirely willing to ſubmit this whole Controverſie to the alone determination thereof, judging it moſt unmeet, that things of mans making ſhould ſtand cheek by jowl with the Word of God. But becauſe you point us to no place thereof, we wil point you to one or two, wherein that word command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſubjection to, and prayers for the powers that are in being. <hi>Rom. 13 1. Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God.</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 2. <hi>Let prayers be made for Kings, and for all that are in authority.</hi> Wherein he ſeems directly to obviate &amp; prevent any ſcruple that might ariſe about the juſtneſſe of their Titie, by pointing them ſo plainly to the actuall exiſtence of powers. For they all knew that the power which then ruled the world, was ſet up by a world of blood, and <hi>Nero</hi> the preſent Emperour, as wicked a Tyrant as ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but yet to ſubmit to him, and to pray for him, being under his power, was not in the Apoſtles judgement any juſtification of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable acquiſition of his power. And the Jewes are commanded <hi>to pray for the peace of Babylon,</hi> when they were in the hand of the Babylonians. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29 7. But you are in the hand, and under the power of the Parliament, and therefore you ought to pray for them, <hi>for in their peace, you ſhall have peace.</hi> But he whom you call King, is not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52282:5"/>
King. He never exerciſed any kingly power on this ſide the water, and now he exerciſeth none in the other part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> therefore he is not King. If it be ſaid, that by the Word of God he ought to be King, let it be ſhewed where the Word of God hath intayled the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> upon the Family of the <hi>Stuarts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. For <hi>the Law of the Land, and Acts of Parliament for him;</hi> we wonder you ſhould ſpeak of theſe, having been long ſince annulled by the Authority of the Commonwealth. And how an Act of any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can bind and be in force, when there is no authority that wil main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, is to us a riddle. Your Countreyman Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> who was as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous againſt Tyrants as you are for them, and did help the Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers head to the ſame block upon which the late King loſt his: He tels Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that ſhe had no warrant of conſcience to rule the Nation of <hi>England,</hi> neither from her birth, nor from any conſuetude Laws and Ordinances of men; and that if ſhe ſtood upon that, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty would cut her off, but from the providence of GOD, calling her to that place of power, <hi>who ruleth in the Kingdoms of the Earth, and giveth them to whomſoever he will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. For your <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> (to him or to his fathers houſe, for there is the ſame reaſon of both) they were either abſolute, that he ſhould be King whether GOD would continue him or no; or elſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, that you would ſubmit to him, unleſſe and untill the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling wiſdom of God ſhould pul him down, and ſet up another power in his place. If they were conditionall, the obligation is void, becauſe the providence of God hath actually diſpoſſeſſed him. But if they were abſolute, what warrant is there in the Word of God for ſuch Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants? Can you promiſe that any man ſhall have power whether God will or no? All your Oaths and Covenants were conditionall. For ſuch Covenants for the maintaining of any power upon earth, wherein there is no condition neither expreſt nor underſtood, concerning giving way to the all-diſpoſing power and providence of God, are no better then confederacies againſt God, and therefore horrible ſnares, and not to be defended, but repented of, leſt you be found fighters againſt, and reſiſters of the mighty Hand of God.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a quarrell ariſe between me and my neighbor, which of us ſhal be maſter, and he ſaith and ſwears that I ſhall never be his maſter, and I ſay that he ſhall never be mine. If hereupon we fight, till that I have laid him f<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at upon his back, and bound him hand and foot; if now when my ſword is upon his breſt, and his life is at my mercy, if I ſhall ask him, whether he will yeeld now, and he ſhall refuſe, is it not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraleld
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52282:5"/>
piece of pride and ſtubborneſs? But ſuppoſe he ſhal ſay, that his conſcience is ſo tender that he cannot yeeld to me becauſe of his oath, will not every one ſay, that his oath binds no longer but whilſt he was in a capacity to reſiſt, but by my prevailing over him, the obligation ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For now God puts him under me, &amp; ſo determins the caſe on my ſide.</p>
            <p>Therefore, though you have made a Covenant, and bound it with an oath, for your King and againſt the Commonwealth, yet now God hath cut that knot in pieces, by putting you in another capacity from what you were then. And you may remember what ſolemn appeals were made to Heaven, both by you and us, when we came firſt amongſt you, for our moſt juſt and neceſſary defence, wherein the Lord hath been pleaſed to give a gracious and favourable teſtimony to the ſincerity of the deſires of his poor ſervants; and will you not reſt in his arbitriment to whom you have ſo often referred the cauſe? to whoſe determination both you and we did with joynt conſent refer it. And the Lord, that righteous Judge hath been pleaſed to judge between us. Though much may be argued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the works of God, when conſidered ſingly and alone, yet when the works of God are ſuperadded teſtimonies to the truths revealed in his Word, and when they are anſwers of the prayers and appeals of all his people on both ſides, and favourable ſmiles upon the actings of ſome of them following him in untroden paths of difficulty and danger, the ſame diſpenſations being alſo diſtinguiſhing rebukes and frowns upon others, under theſe and the like circumſtances, they will argue very much. And though it is hard for man, and it may be too hard for us to manage this argument, to the compleat conviction of oppoſers and gainſayers, and to improve it to the utmoſt in all the concluſions which it will reach unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet to thoſe who obſerve the Name of God in his works, &amp; are not by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed with the guilt of former actings to this or that intereſt, it will reach to conclude the preſent queſtion, and abundantly praeponderate to the purpoſes and reſolutions of men, if laid in the ballance with them.</p>
            <p>4. Whereas you are pleaſed to mention <hi>The ſecurities which the King gave you for the Intereſt of Chriſt and Religion,</hi> It will be hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to any rationall underſtanding, how there could be any reall ſafety to Religion, in receiving him to reigne with his former principles, and with his unchanged heart amongſt you. The World took notice in your treaties with him at the <hi>Hague,</hi> &amp; here too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how litle truſt you had in him, and how you held him off at firſt, but how you could afterwards, (unleſs a mouthful or two of Court air wil make wiſe men mad) diſpenſe with your conſciences to ſoder with him when you ſaw no reall change of heart and ſelf-abhorrence in him for his former wicked ways, &amp; how
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52282:6"/>
the emitting of a feigned, forced Declaration, upon minatory importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, could be juſt incouragement for the admitting of a blood-thirſty and blood-guilty man (for ſo in that Declaration you have made him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) to reign over you, you will find a time to conſider all theſe things.</p>
            <p>Your 3. ground is this: <hi>As it is a great ſin to countermand that which God hath commanded, and to give order, that a precept of God ſhall not oblige, ſo when ſuch a command is given out, it is then</hi> caſus confeſſionis, <hi>then to adhere to the authority of divine precepts, is a neceſſary reſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the truth.</hi> But if ever theſe words afford a <hi>Ground and Warrant of conſcience to walk in that practice</hi> of praying for the King, your aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption which you ſeem to underſtand and beg, muſt be proved, <hi>viz. That God hath given you ſuch a command to pray for him,</hi> which the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration countermands: but till then, this Propoſition will not reach the Concluſion aimed at: If you be Confeſſors, what truth of Chriſt do you ſuffer for? name it. Is it not this, that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> ought to be King? and will you indeed ſtop your own mouths from preaching the bleſſed Goſpel of Chriſt, rather then be ſilent about that mans intereſt? Wil you not preach Chriſt, unleſs you may preach up <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> alſo? Now the Lord lay not this ſin to your charge. You wil ſuffer upon the loweſt and moſt uncomfortable account that ever men did. For you ſuffer clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Royall intereſt; not for <hi>the teſtimony of</hi> JESUS, not for any truth of Religion, but as witneſſes to the Kings Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Your 4. ground is this: <hi>That Ministers of the Goſpel receive their Commiſsion from Jeſus Chriſt, which earthly powers cannot alter nor limit. For if in one duty, then in more; and if they may prohibite a duty, they may command that which is no duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here ſtill you take it for granted, That it is a duty to pray for that Titular King; but you ſhould have proved, that when you were made Miniſters, Chriſt did put this into your Commiſsion, and then you had ſaid ſomthing. Surely a Popiſh exemption of the Clergy from under the arm of the ſecular power, is not that which you drive at. For then you would never have alledged Statutes and Acts of Parliament as oblieging you in conſcience to the King. But this is certain, that that which formerly was, or which now is a duty, may ceaſe to be a duty, not through any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane prohibition, but through a providentiall alteration of the ſtate of things. <hi>The woman</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is bound by the Law to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſo long as he liveth, but if her husband be dead, ſhe is freed from that Law, Rom.</hi> 7. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. And therfore your ſelves alſo upon this account of the revolutions of providence, do find a preſent freedom of conſcience to deſiſt from ſome former actings, to which you thought your ſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly obliged by the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52282:6"/>And this may ſuffice for the removall of the grounds and pillars of this your practice of praying for the King, whereby you offer to prove that it is your duty. Which being not yet done, we will put you into a way for the future, by cutting out your work for you, and laying open the true ſtate of the controverſie before you in a very few words.</p>
            <p>If ever you wil prove (therefore) that it is your duty to pray for the King, and no duty to pray for the Commonwealth, you muſt prove theſe two things:</p>
            <p>1. That every ſubject ought not only to look at the viſible exiſtence, but to be ſatisfied in his conſcience about the title of the Magiſtrates that rule over him, before he pray for them, or yeeld ſubjection to them.</p>
            <p>But contrary to this, it hath been already proved from the Word of God, that it is warrant enough to any mans conſcience to pray for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and quietly to ſubmit himſelf thereto, if that he hath ſenſible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of his being in the hand thereof. The Apoſtles word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſignifies, <hi>the powers that are in being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſecondly, when you have done this, which in this Paper you do not once attempt, which was a ſtrange overſight, you muſt alſo prove,</p>
            <p>2. That the King hath a juſt title to Authority here, and that the Parliament hath no juſt title.</p>
            <p>Now for this, there are four allegations uſuall. 1. His birth-right. 2. Acts of Parliament for him. 3. The pretended injuſtice of the War againſt him. 4. The Solemn League and Covenant. Theſe are the moſt uſuall weapons of defence in this Cauſe.</p>
            <p>But each of theſe muſt be maintained and made good by that un-er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rule of the written Word of God, before they will overcome the underſtandings, and convince the conſciences of conſcientious men. Therefore if you have any thing to offer from the Word of God for the maintaining of them, <hi>produce your cauſe, ſaith the Lord, bring forth your ſtrong reaſons, ſaith the King of Jacob.</hi> The Lord now calls you to bring it forth; which till it be done, we conceive,</p>
            <p>1. That birth gives no title to Magiſtracy. That every beggars brat in the high-way, upon that ſingle conſideration of his birth, hath as much title to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the children of <hi>Charles Stuart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This conceit of a birth-right unto Magiſtracy (unleſs that God confer a title upon ſuch or ſuch a family, as he did upon <hi>David's</hi>) is one of the blind principles of tyranny, nouriſht in mens conſciences, through Popiſh darkneſs, and now that God is diſcovering the myſtery of Antichriſt, and unravelling that whole web of Iniquity, which is woven and made up of two threeds twiſted together, <hi>viz.</hi> civil and ſpirituall ſlavery: he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52282:7"/>
hath begun to diſcover this alſo. If ſome families in the World had the faculty of begetting wiſe children, and fit for government, there were ſome colour of reaſon, why their birth ſhould give them a right, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it gives them a fitneſſe to govern. But we ſee that wiſe men beget fools.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, <hi>Parliaments may intail the Crown, and give a title to ſuch or ſuch a family, though God by immediate deſignation do not.</hi> But then you muſt prove this. And then we add,</p>
            <p>2. That it may be proved both from the Scriptures, and from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, that it is both unlawful and impoſſible for any Parliament to make ſuch an Act as ſhall bind the hands of their ſucceſſors. And the reaſon is this, Becauſe that no Humane wiſdom is able to foreſee all the future Inconveniences that may ariſe; and therfore no Humane Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution can be, or ought to be unalterable. The next Power may diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul it. Therefore the King hath no title upon this accompt: For the Commonwealth hath repealed thoſe Acts. But if you ſay, The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth doth not lawfully ſucceed your Parliaments; then</p>
            <p>3. You fall upon the buſineſs of the War; which if you will undertake, you have many difficult things to prove, and that under the heavy diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a contrary teſtimony from Heaven; whereof one is this, that that man had ſome rights in <hi>England.</hi> For this was part of the quarrell, whereas we know that he had no Rights there, neither by the Word of God, nor by the Laws of our Land. And therefore the War was juſt. For the Engliſh Army did not march a ſtep againſt you, though there were other juſt provocations, till your Commiſsioners had patcht up the buſineſſe with him at the <hi>Hague,</hi> aſſerting I know not what pretended Rights of his in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 4. If you will needs be tryed by the Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, a weapon at which you ſeem to be very expert, we muſt then cut you out ſome more work, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. To prove that your ſenſe is the true ſenſe of it. 2. If you prove that, then you muſt prove that the Covenant it ſelf was a lawfull thing; when you have juſtified your diſobedience to Authority, by the Covenant, you muſt then juſtifie the Covenant it ſelf by the Word of God.</p>
            <p>We perceive, that many who talk much of the Covenant, underſtand it no better than thoſe <hi>Highlanders,</hi> who having ſummoned a Caſtle, and being asked in whoſe name they ſummoned it: they anſwered, In the Name of the Solemn League and Covenant. And truly they ſeem to us to underſtand it little better, who ſay, We are tied by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reſiſt the Power that ruleth over us, to inforce your Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52282:7"/>
way upon the whole Nation of <hi>England,</hi> to preſerve from juſtice that grand Delinquent, who ſlew with the edge of the ſword ſo many thouſand innocent perſons. <hi>For he ſhed innocent blood very much, till he had filled the ſtreets of Jeruſalem from one end to another,</hi> and the whole Land therewith in all the Cities and Coaſts thereof, <hi>beſides his ſin in building up again the high places, &amp; in rearing up altars for Baalim</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by this time you ſee your work, and what you muſt prove, if every you will juſtiſie your preſent wayes before God or men. And yet we muſt tell you once more, That when you have proved all the reſt, you have proved nothing, if you leave out the firſt, as you have done in this your Paper.</p>
            <p>And now to proceed to the reſt of it. That one paſſage only ſeems worthy of moſt particular Animadverſion where you think fit to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your <hi>peaceable and quiet deportment, and that you have in no wiſe ſtirred up the people to tumults and ſeditions;</hi> which, if it be a true and ſincere profeſſion, fame hath done you very much wrong. But are not prayers for the King, under that name and notion of King, under ſuch deſignations of him, and in ſuch expreſſions and petitions for him, as may inſinuate your reſpect towards him, to the people, (for elſe, why did you alleadge your Oaths and Covenants, which you ſay, bind you to him as your King, if you put up only ſuch modeſt and innocent petitions for him as may ſuit any wicked man in affliction?) And are not complaints of a ſtrange power in your prayers to God, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the people, are theſe no wayes nor means of diſquieting and ſtirring up the people? We commend unto you that of <hi>David: Lord, lead me in a way of plainneſs, becauſe of them that obſerve me. Pſa.</hi> 27. 11. And the primitive Church, in <hi>Acts 2. 46. walked in ſimplicity and ſingleneſs of heart.</hi> But if your future deportment ſhall atteſt and make good the truth of this your profeſſion, that which is paſt will be forgotten and forgiven. But for men of reputation to relinquiſh and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon that Intereſt, we are apprehenſive how much it may reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their honor and wiſdom in tampering with it ſo long, in complying with it, and cleaving to it at the firſt; and we have ſeen Conſcience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when ſuch an Intereſt hath layn at the bottom, which is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. From which, as alſo from pertinacy in your way, there is no better way to purge your ſelves, that it may not ſeem to cleave to you, as <hi>Naaman</hi>'s leproſie to <hi>Gehezi</hi> for ever, than by ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Powers that are,</hi> and <hi>ſupplications for the City</hi> wherein you live: <hi>in the peace whereof you ſhall have peace.</hi> For the preſent let us briefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your moſt ſerious thoughts theſe four Conſiderations in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52282:8"/>1. What a fruitleſs and ſad miſtake of the nature of your work it is, to pray and preach up particular intereſts among your people, when you ſhould preach the ſaving truths of the Goſpel to their ſouls. Alas! what profits it to the buſineſs of Faith and Repentance and Spiritual union and communion with the Lord Jeſus, to cry-up the King, or to cry-down the Common-wealth? Will you ceaſe to preach the Goſpel rather than ceaſe to preach up <hi>Charles Stuart?</hi> We mourn for you before the Lord in this thing, and the Lord Jeſus help you in it. Would the Spirit of God thus forſake you, and leave you to ſuch a ſinful and dreadful miſtake, were there not ſomething wherein you have firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him? Now the Lord help you to look into your hearts, and to conſider your wayes, and <hi>to make diligent ſearch.</hi> Sure we are, that you are ſadly and ſtrangely below and beſide the buſineſs, the great buſineſs of Divinity in theſe impertinent ſtrifs about Civil Intereſts. And this is the firſt Conſideration.</p>
            <p>2. That the ſame obligation lies upon our conſciences, to preſerve the peace of the Commonwealth, which, you ſay, doth upon yours to hold up the Intereſt of the King: and with this advantage, that we are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient therein to Him, whoſe Almighty Hand hath actually placed this power over you, and hath not yet born witneſs to the contrary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. For <hi>we will remember the Name of our God,</hi> and his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full works: <hi>we will often make mention of the loving kindneſs of the Lord, and the praiſes of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath beſtowed on us</hi> and done for us, <hi>according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindneſſes.</hi> And indeed, it is a matter of conſcience with us, not to betray, nor to wrong, or weaken that Cauſe through over much indulgence, to which God himſelf hath born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We do beleeve that the preſent Cauſe of the Commonwealth, hath much of the Intereſt of Chriſt wrapt up with it. And, though to tender conſciences, diſſenting from us, we ſhew much favour and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance; yet Conſcience, you know, is not the rule, but the Word of God. And though we hope better things of you, yet there be two ſorts of conſciences, which we conceive are not uſually very tender, <hi>viz.</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical conſciences, and ſeditious conſciences.</p>
            <p>3. Conſider how long a time of tenderneſs and forbearance you have had, ever ſince the Engliſh power firſt prevailed here, and how long God and man hath waited on you; which we think will not be eaſily parallel'd in the Hiſtories of former Ages. We have carried our ſelves towards you, (to the praiſe of his Grace we ſpeak it, becauſe you call us, &amp; compel us to it) not as Victors to conquered Enemies, but as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52282:8"/>
to brethren, for ſo indeed we deſire to look on you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And whatever there is in our power, wherein we may further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you and ſtrengthen your hands in the work of the Miniſtery, we hope we ſhall rejoyce to do it, for His ſake whom you ought to ſerve in the Goſpel of His Son. If the Lord would encline your hearts to know and to do his work; It is our hearts deſire and prayer to God, that His good pleaſure may proſper with you. Wherein, we hope, we ſhall one day praiſe Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when <hi>the envy of Ephraim ſhall depart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may be as good, as holy as you will, you may enjoy all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt in the liberty and purity of the Goſpel, according to your hearts deſire, in your own way, and according to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Which is more than you would have allowed to us. We know nothing but the carkaſs of Church Diſcipline without the life and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of it, yea, a mungrel Diſcipline made up of Civil aſwel as Spiritual power, and ſo no better than a Goſpel Monſter that hath been taken from you: which warming in its bowels a fatal engine of diſobedience to that Civil Government which the Hand of the Almighty hath ſet over you, and which doth plenarily poſſeſs and protect you, it could not with any colour of conſcience or reaſon be any longer ſuffered in that exorbitancy: But if your Diſcipline which hath been wont to be a check to your Parliaments, will hereafter learn to keep within its own channel, you may ſtill practice it, as ſundry godly perſons of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Judgment do at this day in <hi>England.</hi> Therefore, why are <hi>the diſſentions of Brethren like the bars of a Palace?</hi> What ſhall be done for you?</p>
            <p>You ſpeak of burdens: We know not what you mean, unleſs it be the Monthly Aſſeſſment, for there is no other burden laid on you, (but ſome we are ſure are taken off) which yet is no more for all <hi>Scotland,</hi> than for that one County of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster</hi> in <hi>Ireland, viz.</hi> about 8000 l. a month. And you ſay, <hi>you have been no hinderance to the people to bear the burdens in quietneſs that are laid upon them:</hi> For indeed, why ſhould you? Are not you the very men that lay theſe burdens on them? The Aſſeſſment is for the Pay of the Army (though it goes but a little way towards it.) The Army is continued, becauſe the people are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and diſaffected. But who is it that feeds theſe malignant humors, and keeps up this diſaffection of the people? who is it? and what will they anſwer for it in the great day of accompt? Let us reaſon with you before the Lord a little.</p>
            <p>This power which God hath ſet over you for your good, and which the Lord knows hath been favorable and tender over you: What have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52282:9"/>
returns been? Protection requires allegeance by the rule of com<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>mutative juſtice. But have you not made unworthy, unchriſtian returns upon them for that protection, for that love and tenderneſs whereby they have ſought to win you, by being their enemies in heaven &amp; earth? endeavoring to alienate the hearts of the Lords People from them, and denying them that remembrance in your prayers, which they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten begg'd, and which, you know, they would prize far more than that wicked man doth, for whom <hi>you cry, even to the Lord do you cry, but be anſwers you not.</hi> And are there two greater unkindneſſes in the world than theſe? And yet the Lord hath enabled them to forgive, or at leaſt to forbear you hitherto. But take heed, if you perſiſt in your courſe, having had dreadful meetings with God therein, leſt you bring the matter to this paſſe, That God will not forgive though we would. <hi>For thy violence againſt thy brother Jacob, thou ſhalt be cut off for ever, Obad.</hi> 10.

            <p>4. Conſider ſadly, how little benefit and advantage ariſeth to the Intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yea, what real diſ-ſervice you do to Him, by your adhering to that Man, whom the Lord by a mighty Hand hath taken from you, and by diſ-accepting his kindneſs therein, and in caſting forth the branches of that bloody Houſe, which hath been a plague to this Nation from the dayes of your forefathers. If you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept not the Inſtruments who did it, or approve not the manner of their proceedings therein, yet why do you not rejoyce for the thing it ſelf? All the world knows that you were innocent enough about it. We know not any Magiſtracy at this day appearing upon the Earth, to whom the Lord hath given a more abundant and immediate Teſtimony, and for whoſe eſtabliſhment he hath more gloriouſly revealed &amp; made bare his own Arm from Heaven, and who have further engaged in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting and promoting the Intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt in the world, then this which you reſiſt, and whoſe hands you labour to weaken. But will you be the men of al others, who hinder the Kingdom of God from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? God forbid. As for this Man, Heaven and Earth are witneſſes, that you have don your duty to him, (if ſo you cal it) even to the utmoſt; both day and night have ſeen it. You have wept over his grave long enough. Therefore we leave with you, beſeeching Him to ſet it home upon your hearts, that which the Lord ſaid to <hi>Samuel, (1 Sam. 16) How long wile thou mourn for</hi> Saul, <hi>whom I have rejected from reigning over Iſrael.</hi>
