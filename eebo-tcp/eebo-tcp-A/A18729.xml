         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of good will, and wisheth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of worthy fame.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
(right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
to continue in
youre fauour and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
I deuised sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
ways to giue you
some cause of recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
amid the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of youre graue studies, and weightie
affayres, and knowing that no one thing is
more welcome to a worthy witte, than the
vnderstanding of matter, wherein the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of good subiectes is expressed, and the
greatnesse of good minds is made manifest,
<pb facs="tcp:5233:3"/>
I haue presented you with a little Booke,
that makes not only report of the noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
of the Queenes Maiestie into
<hi>Suffolke</hi> and <hi>Norffolke,</hi> but also of the
good order, great cheere, and charges that
hir highnesse subiectes were at, during hir
abode in those parties. And bycause I sawe
most of it, or heard it so credibly rehearsed,
as I know it to be true, I meane to make it a
mirror and shining glasse, that al the whole
land may loke into, or vse it for an example
in all places (where the Prince commeth)
to our posteritie heereafter for euer. For
in very deede, if the dutifull vsage of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi>
and <hi>Norffolke</hi> had not surmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted
in greatnesse &amp; goodnesse any fiue Sheeres
in England, for hospitalitie, brauerie, and
franke dealing, I had not made mention of
these causes, nor writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so large a discourse
of their behauioures, and bountifull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of dutie: but finding these two Sheeres
so well furnished of Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and so flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,
<pb facs="tcp:5233:3"/>
and ready to attend in time of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
on hir that is oure triumph and
earthly felicitie, I can do no lesse, but with
immortall fame, sounde their prayses, and
vse my penne to their greate glorye and
thankes, as a guerdon due for their worthy
&amp; honest dezerts, hoping that euery other
Sheere, where the Queenes highnesse hath
not bin, will rather striue to follow this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
when occasion is offered, than any
way thinke me affectionate, or that I haue
partially proceeded in this exercise of pen.
And nowe righte Worshipfull, if you muse
why I do enterlard this discourse with some
suche wordes or sentences, as may seeme to
degresse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my purposed cause, I pray you
conceyue, both for varietie, and the vertue
of the matter, that my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is carried
by circumstances, to treate at large those
things, that shortnesse of speeche will not
suffer, and that my cunning can not aptly
place euery thing in his order: but yet as I
<pb facs="tcp:5233:4"/>
may (vnder your correction) I will boldly
hold on my matter which I haue penned, for
those people that dwell farre off the Court,
that they may see with what maiestie a
Prince raigneth, and with what obedience
and loue good Subiectes do receiue hir: not
that I thinke, but al the Sheeres of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
are most willing to do their duties to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
of their powers: but that in deede
the like of this entertayneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hath not bin
seene: I haue presumed to sette out these
things, and namely, bycause at <hi>Norwich</hi>
I was employed to sette forth some shewes,
which heere I haue imprinted, as well those
that hir Highnesse sawe not, by meanes of
euill weather, as those she sawe and heard,
and gaue gratious thankes for. And as I
mind to wrighte what truely happeneth in
my memorie, so meane I to touche a little,
the manner and inclination of the common
people, whose ciuill sorte and curtesie is
greatly to be commended. Withall, I haue
<pb facs="tcp:5233:4"/>
placed at the end of this discourse, a feawe
verses, in the honoring of good mindes, and
trauelling bodyes, meaning thereby Sir
<hi>Humfrey Gilbert,</hi> Maister <hi>Henry
Knolles,</hi> and others, right worthy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Gentlemen, presently passed towards
a happy voyage as I hope. These paynes
and purposes of myne, proceede onely on
the good will I beare to al vertuous actions,
and so I trust you will take them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
my small Booke a little countenance
(if it so stande with youre pleasure) I shall
find my selfe greatly bound vnto you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and among the rest that speaketh well
(which are not a few) of your vprighte go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernemente
of life, I will not bee the last
shall yeeld you deserued laude, as knoweth
God, who encrease his grace and good
giftes in you, and make your end as
honorable, as your dayes
haue bin blessed.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I shoulde not good
Reader as vvell shevve
thee some matter of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
as publishe to the
vvorld these penned dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
thy vvits vvould
vvaxe a vveery of my
friuolous vvordes, and
I should gaine but little
frute by my labour and
trauell: and greater delight can not be presented,
than heere to shevv thee the good disposition of
some people, bredde vp, and nourished out of
the bovvels of thine ovvne nation. And albeit it
seemeth strange, that people nurtured farre from
Courte, shoulde vse muche courtesie, yet vvill I
prooue by the humblenesse of the common
people, vvhere lately the Prince hath passed, that
if in a manner all ciuilitie vvere vtterly decayed, it
might haue bin found freshly florishing in many
of those parties and places specifyed before: for
so soone as the presence of the Prince vvas en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
in their boundes, by a meere motion of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and fealty, a generall consent of duetie and
obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vvas seene thorough the vvhole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and vvell vvere they that might first find oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
by any meanes to vvelcome a Courtier,
<pb facs="tcp:5233:6"/>
and not vvith feyned ceremonies, but vvith frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
entertaynemente. And although it be a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
and most laudable manner for the poore
commons to runne in flockes to see their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
yet there, as me thought, their desire vvas
so greate, that they hadde neuer ynough of the
sight so long vvished and desired: and such reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and humilitie they vsed tovvardes all the
trayne, vvheresoeuer they encountred anye of
them, that the invvarde affections of the people
vvas playnely expressed by their outvvard appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and manifest curtesies: in so much, that the
meanest persons that follovved the Court, stood
maruellously contented vvith that they savv, and
vvondered at the rare &amp; good maner of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
especially in Norvvich, vvhere the entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
vvas so greate, that all degrees, from the
highest to the lovvest, vvere had in such admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it seemed another vvorlde to beholde:
vvhich nevve kinde of reuerence, and comely cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the Countrey (as it may be properly
applyed) makes the old haughtinesse, and stiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked
behauiour of some places, to blushe, and
become odious, yea in soyles, that the Prince ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
keepeth hir residence, &amp; most abode in,
vvhere proude people vvill passe by many of the
Nobilitie, vvithoute mouing eyther cappe or
knee, a stubborne stoutenesse, and an vnmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:5233:6"/>
disordered boldnesse, bredde vp and fostered
on the long familiaritie had vvith the noble mens
seruants, and dayly vievv of their maisters, vvith
vvhiche sighte they are so cloyed and vveeryed,
that theyr duetie is forgotten, and vtterly reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that ought to be ashamed of abuse, and
shoulde vse more reuerente manners. If they
vvould (to leaue off thys audacious fashion) but
looke on dyuers Sheeres in this lande, as Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casheere,
Chesheere, Shropsheere, and other
Sheeres farre from the Court, they might soone
bee learned to clappe on more comelynesse,
and vse lesse obstinacie. And if they thynke
scorne to bee taughte at home of oure ovvne
people, it vvere good they vvere Shipped into
Fraunce or Flaunders, oure neere neyboures,
vvhere the meaner sorte are not onely knovven
by theyr garmentes and goyng, but perceyued
by theyr gestures, and humblenesse of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce
and speeche. Novve gentle Reader,
thynke no other of thys my discourse in the
commendation of courtesie, but that I reioyce
to see suche auntiente humilitie as yet helde vp
and mainteyned in Englande, vvhen pride and
vayneglory vvoulde ouerthrovve the good
dispositions of the people, and breede both
to GOD and Man a common contempte.
And, as I haue rehearsed a peece of those
<pb facs="tcp:5233:7"/>
thinges I savve in Suffolke and Norffolke, to
further thy delight tovvards the reading of my
simple Booke, so looke for presentlye at my
handes the rest of that Progresse vvhiche I am
truely instructed of, or may come to my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.
Thus committing to thy handes and

The troth is, albeit they hadde but small warning cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynely
to build vpon, of the comming of the Quéenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
into both those Shéeres, the Gentlemen had made suche
ready prouision, that all the veluets and silkes were taken vp
that might be layde hand on, and bought for any money, and
soone conuerted to such garments and sutes of roabes, that the
shew thereof might haue beautifyed the greatest triumph that
was in <hi>Englande</hi> these many yeares: for (as I hearde) there
were two hundred yong Gentlemen, cladde all in white vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet,
and thrée hundred of the grauer sorte apparelled in blacke
veluet coates, and faire chaynes, all ready at one instant and
place, with fiftéene hundred seruing men more on Horsebacke,
well and brauely mounted in good order, ready to receyue the
Quéenes highnesse into <hi>Suffolke,</hi> which surely was a comely
troupe, and a noble sight to beholde: and all these waited on
the Sheriffe Sir <hi>William Spring,</hi> during the Quéenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
abode in those parties, and to the very con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ynes of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke.</hi>
But before hir highnesse passed to <hi>Norffolke,</hi> there was
<pb facs="tcp:5233:8"/>
in <hi>Suffolke</hi> such sumptuous feasting and bankets, as seldome
in any part of the world hath bin séene before. The maister of
the rolles, Sir <hi>William Cordall,</hi> was one of the firste that
beganne this great feasting, and did lighte suche a Candle to
the rest of the Shéere, that many were glad bountifully and
franckly to follow the same example, with such charges and
cost, as the whole trayne were in some sort pleased therewith.
And néere <hi>Bury,</hi> Sir <hi>William Drury</hi> for his part at his house,
made the Queenes highnesse a costly and delicat dinner, and
Sir <hi>Robert Iermyne</hi> of <hi>Roeshbroke</hi> feasted the French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadoures
two seuerall times, with whiche charges and
courtesie they stood maruellously contented. The Sheriffe Sir
<hi>William Spring,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Kidson,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Higham,</hi> &amp;
diuers other of worship, kept great houses, and sundry eyther
at the Quéenes comming, or returne, solemnely feasted hir
highnesse, yea and deffrayed the whole charges for a day or
twayne, presented giftes, made suche triumphes and deuises,
as in déede was most noble to beholde, and very thankefully
accepted. The <hi>Norffolke</hi> Gentlemen hearing how dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
their neybours had receyued the Prince, prepared in lyke
sort to shewe themselues dutifull, and so in most gallantest
maner, assembled and set forward with fiue and twenty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horsemen, whereof as some affirme, were sixe hundreth

               </gap>n, so brauely attired, and mounted, as in déede was
worthy the noting, which goodly company wayted on theyr
Sheriffe a long season: but in good sooth (as I haue heard cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
spoken) the bankets and feastes began héere afresh, and
all kind of triumphes that might be deuised, were put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
and proofe. The earle of <hi>Surrey</hi> did shewe most sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Gentlemen, whose names I haue not, were no whit behinde
to the vttermost of their abilities, in all that mighte be done
and deuised. But when the Quéenes highnesse came to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
the substance of the whole Triumph and feasting, was
in a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to dinner and supper, during the space of those sixe
dayes: which order was well and wisely obserued, and gayned
their Citie more same and credite, than they wot of: for that
courtesie of theirs shall remayne in perpetuall memorie,
whiles the walles of their Citie standeth. Besides the money
they bestowed on diuers of the trayne, and those that tooke
paynes for them (albeit my selfe but slenderly considered) will
be a witnesse of theyr well doyng and good will, whiles the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of these things may be called to remembrance. I can not

they haue taughte and learned all the Townes and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

            <p>Nowe to returne to the Shewes and purposed matter pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

gratious inclination is suche, as will not haue anye

hir Highnesse standing at a windowe, and (as I knowe,) the

came, passed away, at whose Coatch the people (that had sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

for it had horsses to drawe it finely paynted as winged, to as
great shewe and order of that it presented, as witte mighte i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine:
the Coatchman sutable to the same: and a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter
in righte good garmentes, as decente for that purpose as
coulde be deuised. But the Coatche was made and framed on
such a fashion, as few men haue séene: the whole wherof was
couered with Birdes, and naked Sprites hanging by the hée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
in the aire and cloudes, cunningly painted out, as thoughe

iewels, in the top whereof was placed a faire plume of whyte

<hi>MERCVRIE</hi> himself in blew Satin lined with cloth of gold,
his garmentes cutte and slasshed on the finest manner, a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
hatte of the same coloure, as though it should cutte and

and wings on his héeles lykewise. And on his golden rodde
were little wings also, aboute the whiche rodde, were two
wriggling or scrawling Serpentes, whiche séemed to haue
life when the rodde was moued or shaken. So in this sorte

in déede at such a season, as a great number looked not for any
shew, nor things were ready, as some thoughte, to performe
that was necessary and expected. Yet happe was so good, and
the gracious fauour of the Prince, that all was well taken,

dutifully to presente hir with some Shewe.
Then knowing whiche way the Quéene
woulde ride (by coniecture and instructions giuen) I caused a
place to be made and digged for the Nymphes of the water,
the manner and proportion whereof, was in this forme and
fashion. Firste, there was measure taken for thréescore foote
of grounde euery way, the hole to be made déepe and foure
square, whiche ground was couered with a Canuas paynted
gréene like the grasse, and at euery side on the Canuas, ranne
a string through Curtayne rings, whiche string might easily
be drawen any kinde of way, by reason of two great poales
that lay along in the grounde, and aunswered the Curtayne

And in the same caue was a noble noyse of Musicke of al kind

at one time they shoulde be sounded all togither, that mighte
serue for a consorte of broken Musicke. And in the same caue

that it was to be wondered at, besides the strangenesse of the

then shoulde haue come into the place a dolefull song for the
death of <hi>Manhood, Fauour,</hi> and <hi>Dezartes,</hi> and so the Shewe
should haue ended. But now note what befell after this great
businesse and preparation, for as the Quéenes highnesse was
appoynted to come to hir Coatch, and the Lords and Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

Citie troubled with many causes, and some
séeking to do seruice like my selfe, moued me
to doe somewhat of my selfe, bycause myne
aydes (as many tunes they were before) were
drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, each one about his owne bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
and I lefte to mine owne inuentions and policie, at
whiche erigente, or casuall things of Fortune, I drewe my
Boyes vnto me, that were the Nymphes on the water, and
so departed the Citie, with such garments and stuffe necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
as fitted my purpose and the matter I went about. Then
chose I a ground, by the which the Quéene must passe, enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
my company in the corner of a field, being defenced with
high and thicke bushes, and there some parts I made, whych
the Boyes mighte misse, bycause the time was short for the
learning of those parts. But I being resolued to do some what
might make the Quéene laugh, appointed that seauen Boyes
of twelue, should passe through a hedge from the place of oure
abode (which was gallantly trimmed) and deliuer seauen spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
whiche followe in the next leafe. And these Boyes (you
must vnderstand) were dressed like Nimphes of the water,
and were to play by a deuice and degrées the <hi>Phayries,</hi> and
to daunce (as néere as could be ymagined) like the <hi>Phayries.</hi>
Their attire, and comming so strangely out, I know made
the Quéenes highnesse smyle and laugh withall. And I hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this good hope, being apparelled like a water Sprite,
beganne to sounde a Timbrell, and the rest with me, all the
twelue Nymphes togither (when the seauen had repayred in)
sounded Timbrels likewise. And although I had no greate
harting, yet as I durst, I ledde the yong foolishe <hi>Phayries</hi> a
daunce, which boldnesse of mine bredde no disgrace, and as I
heard said, was well taken. The Quéene vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our retiring in,

            <l>That dovvne is layde on quiet Coutch,</l>
            <l>a little ease to take:</l>

And many matters and noble Histories make mention, that
one mans happe, courage and conduite, is farre better (at some
