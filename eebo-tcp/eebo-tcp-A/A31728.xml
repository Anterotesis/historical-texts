         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

like <hi>Infection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which would yet be more Apprehended, if they could have either
the <hi>Prudence,</hi> or <hi>leiſure</hi> to Reflect, How many perſons that in a private
Station were <hi>Honeſt, Juſt</hi> and <hi>Reſolute Patriots,</hi> when once preferred
to the Misfortune of being <hi>Great,</hi> have Abandoned all thoughts of the
publique-weal: their Integrity Retired to give place to their <hi>Fortune,</hi>
too Rank <hi>preferment</hi> ſtiffled their <hi>Honeſty,</hi> and thence forward they aim'd
only to Advance their own <hi>narrow Intereſt,</hi> and blow ſhort-liv'd <hi>Sparks</hi>
to warm their <hi>private fingers</hi> out of the <hi>Publique Aſhes</hi> of their Ruined
Country.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Innocency</hi> laſts ſcarce ſo long at Court, as the firſt man's did in
the <hi>Terreſtrtal Paradice.</hi> Though they were not <hi>wicked</hi> before, yet they
believe they ought to become <hi>So,</hi> and therefore as the Fooliſh <hi>Wiſeman</hi>
of old flung all his <hi>Goods into the Sea,</hi> that he might more freely <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize:</hi>
They reſolve to rid themſelves of their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> that with leſs
<hi>Encumbrance</hi> they may Manage the Affaires of State. They Conceit
<hi>pride</hi> neceſſary to ſupport their Dignity, and that ſhould they not ſwell
and look <hi>Big,</hi> their Condition would be nothing Chang'd, that Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
would Reduce them to that <hi>Equality,</hi> whence they had fore'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with ſo much trouble; to avoid <hi>Contempt,</hi> not being able to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
themſelves <hi>Reſpected,</hi> they ſtudy to make themſelves <hi>feared.</hi> They
eſteem, that there is no way left to blot out the memory of their former
Qualitie, but by the preſent Objects of their Tyranny, and that they
ſhall not hinder the people from <hi>Laughing</hi> at their Infirmities, but by
Imploying them to <hi>weep</hi> for their own <hi>Miſeries,</hi> and complain of their
Cruelties.</p>
            <p>One would think it <hi>Bedlam-Folly,</hi> that men not unacquainted with
<hi>History,</hi> and ſufficiently warned by <hi>Experiences</hi> of their own times,
ſhould adventure on the very <hi>ſame Precipices,</hi> on which, All that went
before them <hi>broke their Necks;</hi> But we muſt remember, that <hi>Ambition</hi> is
as <hi>Blind</hi> as <hi>Love:</hi> They (like the famous <hi>fond Philoſopher</hi>) are gazing
at <hi>Stars</hi> till they tumble into the <hi>Ditch:</hi> Their Eyes are alwaies fixt on
the <hi>Glittering Vanities</hi> above, ſuggeſted by a deluded Imagination, ſo
they never look down on the <hi>Wrecks</hi> and <hi>Shattered Fortunes,</hi> and <hi>diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Bodies</hi> and <hi>forfeited Heads,</hi> and <hi>Infamous Memories</hi> of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.
For few have the Wiſdom to foreſee, how hard it is in Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103773:3"/>
to purſue <hi>Honest</hi> and <hi>Safe</hi> Maxims, what Reſolution is required for
the Potent to be <hi>Innocent,</hi> what for did Intereſts they are fore'd to Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe,
and by what <hi>Inſenſible Degrees</hi> they are brought at laſt to ſwallow
thoſe Actions and Compliances without Reluctancy, which at firſt they
look'd upon with Deteſtation; What long ſince was obſerved of <hi>Seja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
holds true of many latter <hi>Tympanies of Grandeur,</hi> that their <hi>favour</hi>
is not to be purchaſed without ſome notable <hi>Crime;</hi> You muſt part with
your <hi>Honour,</hi> nay your <hi>Soul,</hi> if you expect promotion from ſuch Spirits:
If this were ſufficiently weighed, we may juſtly preſume, ſuch as have
a ſtricct Regard to <hi>Honeſty,</hi> would not ſo precipitate themſelves into <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs,</hi> and ſtand gaping like <hi>greedy Camelions</hi> to be puffed up with
the tainted Air of <hi>Haughty and Luxurious Courts,</hi> where Intereſt can
ſcarcely be preſerved (unleſs by Miracle) without a ſhipwrack of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (to make our approaches a little nearer) If it be ſo <hi>tickliſh</hi> a thing
for even a <hi>good man</hi> to abide long in Honour, without becoming like <hi>the
Beaſt that periſbeth,</hi> and acting Diſhonourable things, What then ſhall
we ſay of thoſe <hi>Portentous Meteors,</hi> that ſome times <hi>Blaze</hi> in that ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Orbe, noxious <hi>Exhalations</hi> drawn up by the <hi>wanton Beams</hi> of Favour,
from the <hi>ſlime and filth</hi> of the World, and which preſage more <hi>Calamities,</hi>
than a <hi>Comet,</hi> to thoſe Nations in which they appear? <hi>Inſolent Giants</hi> I
that Combate with diſplaied Colours, the Authority of the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Laws,</hi> and all methods of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> who in the Government of a State
produce a Deſign formed for <hi>its Ruin,</hi> who grow <hi>fat and Burly</hi> from the
juice and ſubſtance of Exhauſted Provinces, who build their own
Houſes with the <hi>Wrack</hi> and diſſipation of a whole Kingdom. Princes
and <hi>Great</hi> men would be happy, If without <hi>dying</hi> by <hi>Proxy,</hi> they could
<hi>live in Perſon;</hi> They are born oft timos with excellent Qualities, and
are <hi>Calm Seas,</hi> filled with Riches and Power, that might do good to all
the World, if the <hi>Winds</hi> would but let them flow gently according to
their own Nature. But as Extraordinary <hi>Beauties</hi> are Courted by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of Lovers, ſo ſuch <hi>Exalted Conditions</hi> rarely want a ſwarm of <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi>
meer <hi>Inſects</hi> bred out of putrifaction by the warmth of <hi>Royal Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine,</hi>
that under the umbrage of <hi>Adorers,</hi> make themſelves <hi>Maſters,</hi> and
by a colour of Service, exerciſe an <hi>Empire</hi> even over thoſe that think
they Command the <hi>Univerſe;</hi> whole <hi>ſacred Names</hi> in ſuch a Caſe
become but a <hi>Paſs-Port</hi> to Miſchiefs; Their <hi>Authority</hi> a Sanctuary to
<hi>Crimes;</hi> their <hi>Revenues</hi> but <hi>Tinder</hi> to Debauchery and ſupplies for <hi>Riot;</hi>
Their Power an Inſtrument of <hi>Revenge,</hi> and a ſcourge and plague to thoſe
very people whom it ought to cheriſh and protect.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we ſay of theſe <hi>Inſufferable Grandees,</hi> who reck their <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Spleens,</hi> with the <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> of their Maſter? Who declare
all thoſe guilty of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> who do not fall proſtrate before them?
who by <hi>Fatal Wars</hi> and diſhonourable <hi>Treaties</hi> of Peace, by abandoning
the <hi>true Intereſt</hi> of their Country, and playing the <hi>Mountebanks</hi> with
the <hi>Body Politick,</hi> till they caſt it at once into a <hi>Feavour,</hi> and a
<hi>Conſumption</hi> endeavour all they can to bring the people into <hi>Deſpair,</hi>
and would gladly Reduce the honeſter ſort of men to ſo
miſerable a Condition, as to be unable to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but in a <hi>Revolt;</hi> That ſo they may palliate their <hi>own Villanies</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:103773:4"/>
by others <hi>forc'd Diſobedience,</hi> and trip off with the ſpoils of a Nation in a
<hi>General Combuſtion</hi> of their own Kindling?</p>
            <p>Obſerve them in <hi>Ancient Hiſtory</hi> (for meddle not with our Times)
They firſt Ruin the people, and then, if not themſelves, their Maſters,
and many times bring Deſtruction on all three. Their Courſes are all
Violent and Domineering, they own no Laws but Will and Pleaſure,
their pace is always <hi>Full-ſpeed,</hi> they whip and ſlaſh like Maſters of a <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
rather than perſons intruſted with the Governance of Free-men.
All to them is plunder, all is <hi>Prey:</hi> They cannot feed but on <hi>dead Bodies,</hi>
they firſt <hi>Rifle the Ship</hi> they Sail in, and then wilfully <hi>ſtrand Her,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
their own <hi>Robberies:</hi> Though they came only out of the <hi>Dirt,</hi> and
to ſpeak truly, are of <hi>Kin</hi> to no Body, yet they believe themſelves the
Heirs of all the World; There is no <hi>Officer</hi> of the Crown, no <hi>Governour</hi>
of a Place, whoſe Succeſſion they do not pretend unto; They think they
are not in ſafety, ſo long as there is any man in Credit or Authority, that
is not a <hi>Creature</hi> of their own Raiſing.</p>
            <p>Such people commonly introduce themſelves by <hi>Low means,</hi> and for
the moſt part, ſuch as are <hi>diſhonest and Vile;</hi> they not ſeldom owe the
Commencement of their Fortune to a <hi>well-Danc'd Saraband,</hi> to Agility
of Body, to the <hi>Beauty</hi> of their face, or the intereſt of a <hi>Strumpet:</hi> They
make themſelves valued by <hi>ſhameful ſecret Services,</hi> whoſe payment is
not publickly to be demanded. In a word, though wiſe Antiquity allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no Entrance into the Temple of <hi>Honour,</hi> but through that of <hi>Virtue,</hi>
yet theſe croud themſelves into <hi>Credit</hi> by the Recommendation of <hi>Vice,</hi>
their crimes which truly deſerve the <hi>Halter</hi> and the <hi>Ax,</hi> are the <hi>ſole Roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
whereby they mount the Ladder of <hi>Towring preferment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is their <hi>progreſs</hi> unſuitable to their Riſe, Their deſign being only
to make complaiſant propoſitions, they enquire not whether they <hi>profit</hi>
or Incommode; If they do but <hi>pleaſe</hi> 'tis enough. They inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into their Maſters Favour, by the Intelligence they endeavour to
keep with his <hi>Paſſions.</hi> And having once poſſeſt themſelves of his mind,
they ſeize on all the <hi>Avenues,</hi> and leave not ſo much as an entrance for
his <hi>Great</hi> or <hi>Privy Councel,</hi> nay, ſcarce for his <hi>Confeſſor:</hi> How weak and
tender ſoever his inclinations may be to <hi>Evil,</hi> they water and Cultivate
them with ſo much Art and Diligence, that preſently there ſprings up
a <hi>great-Tree</hi> from a little <hi>Seed,</hi> and a violent and Opinionated <hi>Habit,</hi> from
a light Diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the <hi>Petroniuſſes</hi> and the <hi>Tigillinuſſes</hi> about <hi>Nero;</hi> Theſe are
the <hi>Advocates of Voluptouſneſs,</hi> the Peſt of a Realm, and the <hi>Evil Genii</hi> of
Kings.</p>
            <p>'Tis Incredible to think how many <hi>Charms</hi> they uſe, without Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe of Magick (of which yet the people forbear not to Accuſe them.)
How Ingenious are they to invent new pleaſures to a <hi>Sated</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted
Soul, and with what <hi>pungent ſharpneſſes</hi> do they awaken the <hi>ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Luſts,</hi> which Languiſh and can no more?</p>
            <p>Yet do they not at the firſt onſet become <hi>abſolute Conquerours,</hi> but for a
time diſpute with Virtue, which ſhall gain the Aſcendent in the Court of
a Prince of <hi>Eighteen;</hi> Sometimes ſhe gets the better, ſometimes is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd,</hi>
ſo that for a ſhort ſeaſon there is a divided or Alternate <hi>Empire</hi>
over his Affections; A king of Twylight between Good and Ill, juſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103773:4"/>
and Tyranny <hi>party perpale.</hi> Projects brave and good, are <hi>Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
upon, but before they can come to <hi>Execution,</hi> the Humour is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
good Councels are <hi>given,</hi> but e're they take <hi>Impreſſion</hi> on his mind,
a <hi>Debauch</hi> is contriv'd, which daſhes them out of his <hi>Memory,</hi> and they
are thought of no more. Honeſt <hi>Burrhus</hi> is <hi>hearkned</hi> to perhaps, but
theſe <hi>Court-Earwigs</hi> will take care, he never ſhall be <hi>beleived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However thus far, they are like <hi>Seneca's Ballance,</hi> and things are not
yet grown deſperate, but at laſt, they carry away <hi>all before them:</hi> The
<hi>Epicure</hi> deſtroys as much in three days, as the <hi>Stoick</hi> built in five Years:
Having undermined or ſtormed the <hi>Fortreſs,</hi> they by peicemeals diſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
it, and undo the whole Frame: They aſſault their <hi>Maſters</hi> good
parts one after another, from petty <hi>Sallies</hi> of Humour and <hi>Sociable Revels,</hi>
and a <hi>refreſhing Glaſs</hi> and <hi>bluſhing Gallantries,</hi> they lead him on <hi>ſtep by ſtep</hi>
to the utmoſt degrees of <hi>Debauchery, Adulteries, Perjuries, Cruelty</hi> and
<hi>Tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At firſt they content themſelves to breath in his Ears, that it is not
neceſſary for a <hi>Prince</hi> to be ſo <hi>preciſely Religious,</hi> ſo <hi>ſtrictly Juſt,</hi> ſo <hi>nicely
Temperate,</hi> or ſo very <hi>much an honeſt Man.</hi> That it's ſufficient, if he is
<hi>not Wicked,</hi> that <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> were deſigned to ſweeten the toils of
Empire, and the <hi>Fair</hi> created on purpoſe for the diverſion of the <hi>Great.</hi>
That he would put himſelf to too much trouble to make himſelf beloved,
that he only ought to prevent his being <hi>Hated:</hi> Or if that cannot be,
to render himſelf <hi>Feared</hi> will do as well. That ſolid and perpetual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity
is too <hi>heavy</hi> and too difficult, ſince its <hi>Umbrage</hi> and Counterfeit,
hath no leſs ſplendor than the Original, and produceth the <hi>ſame Effects;</hi>
that a vertuous action or two, <hi>kind and popular,</hi> (which is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of coſt,) being <hi>fitly</hi> performed, may ſerve to entertain his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
nor will they leave him in ſo <hi>fair away,</hi> After having made him
eſteem good, as an <hi>Indifferent</hi> thing, they make him approve <hi>Ill</hi> as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
and afford <hi>Vice</hi> the colour of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and repreſent thoſe things
which are the <hi>ſhame</hi> of all the reſt of mankind, as peculiar <hi>Ornaments</hi> of
<hi>Majesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To authorize his <hi>worſt Actions,</hi> great Examples ſhall not be wanting,
they tell him, it is not in <hi>Turkey</hi> and amongſt <hi>Barbarians</hi> that he is to look
for <hi>Precedents,</hi> that all things are <hi>lawful to the Powerful,</hi> or at leaſt any
thing may be made appear to be ſo to the <hi>Simple.</hi> God's own people,
the <hi>Holy Nation</hi> (ſay they) Sir, will furniſh you with Inſtances more
than enough. That very King that built the <hi>Temple,</hi> was alſo the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of a <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and we at this day ſee at <hi>Conſtantiople</hi> but a Copy of
what was formerly to be ſeen at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> you content your ſelf even
in the heat of full veins and vigour of youth with half a ſcore or Forty
or Fifty Women only, whereas he that was the <hi>wiſeſt Prince</hi> the Earth
could ever boaſt of, even the ſuperlative <hi>Salomon,</hi> in his old Age had <hi>ſix
hundred,</hi> which the holy Scripture implies to be <hi>Legitimate Wives,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reckoning thoſe which were his Concubines; And have you not
heard of the <hi>laſt will</hi> of his Father <hi>David,</hi> and of thoſe <hi>Gallant</hi> things he
commanded by his Teſtament? We ſhall not Exaggerate them, only
beſeech you to conſider, by how <hi>many Deaths</hi> he counſelled his Son to
ſecure his <hi>own Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay Sir, ſince the Law of Grace, and amongſt <hi>Chriſtian Princes,</hi> you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103773:5"/>
cannot find more <hi>Sweetneſs;</hi> you are nice perhaps to abandon
a <hi>Child,</hi> or ſtagger to expoſe a <hi>Son</hi> that never diſobliged you.
But (to omit the practiſe of Mahumetans, and the modern Example of
the moſt Catholick King in the unfortunate <hi>Don Carlos</hi>) The great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi>
that moſt <hi>Holy, moſt Religious, and moſt Divine</hi> Emperour (as
he hath been called by the mouth of <hi>Councils</hi>) did much more than this,
For he cauſed his <hi>own Son</hi> to be put to death upon the <hi>firſt Suſpition,</hi>
which was <hi>falſly ſuggeſted</hi> to him. 'Tis true, he regreted his Execution
and acknowledged his <hi>Innocency,</hi> but this acknowledgment came too
late, and his Regret laſted but <hi>four and twenty hours;</hi> He thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
quit by cauſing a <hi>Statue</hi> to be erected in memory of the <hi>Deceaſed;</hi> with
this Inſcription, <hi>To my Son Chriſpus, whom I cauſed to die
Hujuſtly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you reſerve your <hi>abſolute</hi> Authority? will you always ſtand upon
<hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Title,</hi> and vain punctilio's of <hi>Equity?</hi> Dare you not uſe <hi>Force,</hi>
when the good of your Affaires requires it? The Example of the Mighty
<hi>Charlemaign,</hi> who is one of the <hi>Saints</hi> of the Church, as well as one of the
<hi>Nine Worthies,</hi> may ſecure you againſt all the <hi>Scruples</hi> your Conſclence
can make, he knew neither a <hi>better,</hi> nor <hi>greater</hi> Right, than that of
<hi>Arms,</hi> the <hi>l'ommel</hi> of his Sword ſerved him for his <hi>Seal</hi> and <hi>Signet.</hi> To
this day there are Priviledges found granted, and Donations of Lands
made, by that Good and <hi>Orthodox</hi> Emperour, <hi>Rowland</hi> and <hi>Oliver</hi> being
preſent, ſealed with the <hi>Pommel,</hi> and which he ſwore he would warrant
with the <hi>Edge</hi> of the ſame <hi>Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would you rule Abſolutely? At your pleaſure leavy <hi>Taxes,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of both the <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> of your Subjects? you ſhall therein do
nothing <hi>New</hi> or <hi>Extraordinary.</hi> All the Mighty <hi>Monarchs</hi> of the <hi>East,</hi>
have done it theſe many hundred <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ears. And the <hi>moſt Chriſtian King</hi>
practiſes it at this day. Diſcover not ſo much weakneſs, as to regard
the <hi>Sighs and Groans</hi> of your People, who are but animated Durt, prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Beaſts, Creatures deſign'd to be <hi>Slaves,</hi> as well by <hi>Nature</hi> as <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;</hi>
What elſe were they <hi>Born</hi> for, what elſe are they <hi>good</hi> for, but to
be <hi>Instruments</hi> of your <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> and Sacrifices to your <hi>Glory?</hi> The only
way to preſerve your Authority, is to Curb the <hi>Vermine</hi> and keep them
Miſerable, do they <hi>Wince</hi> under your <hi>Rods,</hi> then ſcourge them with Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions.
Are they not your Vaſtals? Why then do they Complain? ſhall
Slaves be allowed to <hi>Murmur</hi> and Capitulate? If their <hi>Tears</hi> grow trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome,
waſh them away with their <hi>Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There have been <hi>Favorites</hi> mentioned in Hiſtories that have Inſtructed
Princes, in theſe and the like <hi>Pernicious Leſſons,</hi> and being at laſt tyred
out with defending Crimes, with precedents, To excuſe ſome new <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd</hi>
Extravagance, they freely have told their Prince, that when
there was <hi>no Example</hi> to be found, he might make one. That what had
formerly been <hi>Unheard of,</hi> would, being done, ceaſe to be ſo: That it
would be <hi>ſhameful</hi> for the <hi>Soveraign Authority</hi> to give an Account of any
thing it Commands, and Misbecome him, who hath <hi>Armies</hi> and
<hi>Fleets</hi> to maintain his Actions, to ſeek <hi>Words or Pretences</hi> either to diſguiſe
or Juſtify them.</p>
            <p>There is not a man (this is the Language of the <hi>Sejanuſſes</hi> and the
<hi>Plautuſſes</hi>) Innocent in all the parts of his Life, and who in his Soul
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103773:5"/>
               <hi>Envies</hi> not his Superiours, and whom they Envy, they Hate. Therefore
the Prince cannot but Condemn the <hi>Guilty,</hi> nor ſtrike <hi>any</hi> but <hi>his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi>
conſequently he gratifies him, whom he bereaves only of his <hi>Goods.</hi>
in that he takes not away his Honour and leaves him his Life. <hi>Honesty</hi>
and <hi>Juſtice</hi> are virtues proper for <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> not for Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes;
That to be <hi>Slaves</hi> to their words, is to Depoſe themſelves, and
abandon their Prerogatives, that even in Heaven (if there be any ſuch
place above a Ladies Lap) the <hi>Oaths</hi> of Princes are put in the ſame Scales
with thoſe of Lovers. That <hi>Jupiter</hi> Commands them to be thrown into
the <hi>Wind,</hi> as things of no Obligation, and never to be regarded further
than preſent Intereſt requires.</p>
            <p>Thus in a way of <hi>fooling</hi> and telling of <hi>Fables,</hi> they perſwade the
Prince, that he is not obliged by his promiſes, nor ought to hearken to
the <hi>Fancies</hi> of Preachers, or <hi>Dotages</hi> of Legiſlators, but ſtands Exempted
by his <hi>Quality</hi> from all Laws <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane,</hi> nor is obliged by ties of
Juſtice or Prudence: And that it belongs to him <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> to define
unto men, what is <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Ill,</hi> to declare unto the world, what for the
furture he will <hi>have</hi> to be <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>unjuſt,</hi> as well in <hi>Morality,</hi> as <hi>Policy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus are <hi>Tyrants</hi> made, from this Stock <hi>Monſters</hi> are engendred, from
ſuch Commencements, we come to ſet <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, to <hi>Butcher</hi> the
<hi>Senate,</hi> to diſhonour <hi>Nature</hi> with Debauches, and declare War againſt
it by <hi>Parricides.</hi> Theſe wheedling Whiſperers are the firſt <hi>Cauſes</hi> of ſo
many <hi>Miſeries,</hi> and did not theſe winds Blow, we ſhould be ſenſible of
none of theſe <hi>Tempeſts</hi> and <hi>Hurricanes,</hi> able to diſcompoſe the Harmony of
the beſt <hi>ſetled Governments</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, ſince in the whole Bulk of ſublunary Beings, there is no
<hi>Good</hi> of ſo great uſe, and which ſo univerſally Communicates it ſelf as a
<hi>Good Prince,</hi> nor any <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which diſperſeth it ſelf further, or is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
than a <hi>bad one:</hi> Can there be any puniſhments great enough in all
the extent of Humane Juſtice, for thoſe who <hi>Change</hi> this Good into Ill;
Who corrupt ſo <hi>Salutiferous</hi> and ſo excellent a thing? They had far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
have poiſoned all the <hi>Wells</hi> and all the <hi>Fountains</hi> in their Countries;
nay ſhould they infect the <hi>Rivers</hi> themſelves, Water might be gotten
from elſe where, even Heaven would ſtill furniſh us with ſome <hi>refreſhing
Drops:</hi> But here of neceſſity we muſt either <hi>Choak,</hi> or drink <hi>Poiſon;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
theſe Domeſtick Ills, we are not permitted to uſe <hi>Foreign</hi> Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
We are obliged to continue <hi>Miſerable</hi> by the Laws of our <hi>Religion,</hi>
and to obey <hi>Furies</hi> and <hi>Madmen,</hi> not only out of <hi>Fear,</hi> but alſo for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
ſake.</p>
            <p>For which cauſe, ſince the perſons of Princes <hi>whatſoever they be,</hi> ought
to be Inviolabel and <hi>Sacred,</hi> and that the <hi>Characters</hi> of Gods finger makes
an Impreſſion, which we are to Reverence, on what <hi>matter</hi> ſoever it
be Engraven, no wonder, if <hi>Subjects</hi> turn all their hatred againſt theſe
<hi>Flatterers,</hi> which caſt them into thoſe miſeries without Redemption:
If they purſue with all manner of <hi>Execrations</hi> theſe evil Councellors
which give them <hi>Ill Princes,</hi> which provoke Innocents to <hi>Murther,</hi> and
good natures to Barbarous Cruelties: 'Tis their pernitious Advice,
which occaſions all fatal Reſolutions. Their maxims of <hi>Fire and Blood</hi>
aſſure and fortify Malice, when it is as yet timerous and doubtful, they
<hi>ſharpen</hi> what cuts, they precipitate what is falling, they encourage the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103773:6"/>
               <hi>Violent</hi> to run after the prey, they inflame the deſires of the Avaricious
to Invade their peoples <hi>Goods,</hi> and thoſe of the Laſcivious to <hi>Debauch</hi> their
Daughters and <hi>raviſh</hi> their Wives.</p>
            <p>But if they meet with Natures, which are not ſuſceptible of thoſe
<hi>strong Paſſions,</hi> and vvhich by their Complexions are in an equal degree
diſtant from Vice and Virtue, if they light on thoſe <hi>ſoft Princes,</hi> who are
without ſting or Spirit, and have ſmall Inclinations to great and mighty
Evils, but rather propenſe to <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Fffeminate</hi> delights, ſuch as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
their time between the <hi>Cup and the Bed,</hi> and are more intent at the
<hi>Theatre</hi> than the Councel Chamber. 'Tis ſtill ſo much the <hi>Worſe</hi> for
thoſe people, vvho live under them, for abuſing the ſimplicity of their
<hi>pliant Maſter,</hi> and taking the Advantage, vvhich their Spirit hath over
his, they themſelves <hi>Reign</hi> openly, and their unjuſt Dominion adds to
the vveight of Tyranny, the <hi>ſhame</hi> that occurs from ſuffering it from a
particular private Perſon and <hi>fellow Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You cannot Imagin the <hi>Wiles</hi> and <hi>Artifices</hi> they uſe to attain hereunto,
and totally to ſubject to themſelves the Prince. Their method is to ſpur
him vvith Glory in the Eſtabliſhment of their Fortune. They give him
to underſtand through ſeveral <hi>Trunks,</hi> that his Predeceſſors, vvho vvere
nothing more powerful than He, made ſome far <hi>greater Creatures</hi> of their
own, that'tis more ſafe to raiſe up <hi>New people,</hi> vvho have no dependance,
and vvho ſhall only hold from his Majeſty, than to uſe perſons of <hi>Ancient
Birth,</hi> and of known Probity, vvhoſe Affections and party may be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
made; That it concerns his <hi>Honour</hi> not to leave his vvorks <hi>Imperfect,</hi>
but to labour for their Embelliſhment, after he has Eſtabliſhed their <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</hi>
That he ought to put them in a Condition, that they may not be
Ruin'd, but by themſelves. That if he yields to the deſires of his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Nobility,</hi> vvho vvill indure no Companions; or if he conſents to
the Complaints and <hi>Petitions of his People,</hi> vvho are ever Enemies to all
<hi>Growing Greatneſs,</hi> he vvill not for the future have the power to <hi>reward a
Servant,</hi> or to gratify thoſe that oblige him. But muſt live a <hi>Praecarious
King,</hi> a meer <hi>Duke of Venice, a ſhadow of Royalty,</hi> and be fore'd to call an
Aſſembly of the <hi>States,</hi> to diſpoſe of the leaſt Office in the Kingdom;
Beſides, they Repreſent, that he cannot Abandon a perſon vvho hath
been ſo dear unto him, vvithout condemning the Conduct of <hi>many Years,</hi>
and rendring a publick teſtimony either of <hi>paſt Blindneſs,</hi> or preſent fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Nor wants this Argument its force, for'tis certain, that having begun
to love any object for the <hi>Love of it ſelf,</hi> time preſently adds our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
to the merit of the thing, the deſire that we have that all the
World ſhould believe, that our Election was good, makes the action of
neceſſity, which before was <hi>Voluntary,</hi> ſo that what hath been done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Reaſon, being not to be Juſtified, but by an <hi>headſtrong Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
we never think that we have done enough, and upon this fond
conceit, though never ſo much <hi>Reaſon</hi> be offered to diſcontinue our
Affection, yet it ſeems, we are obliged in point of Honour, to defend
our <hi>Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if theſe <hi>Temptations</hi> can ſhake ſtable minds, and ſometimes
make <hi>Wiſe men</hi> fail, we need not be Aſtoniſht, if they eaſily overthrow
<hi>Weak Princes,</hi> who make uſe only of <hi>borrowed Reaſon,</hi> and who will yield
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103773:6"/>
themſelves to be perſwaded by a very mean Eloquence, ſo it but ſuits
with their already biaſled Inclination.</p>
            <p>And when once a Prince is Engaged in the making of this Subject
(whom as much without Merit, as beyond Meaſure he dotes upon)
<hi>Great,</hi> He ſpeaks of him no more, but as his Enterprize, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Effort of his <hi>Prerogative</hi> and creative Power, and ſo goes on in a
blind Zeal, till without minding it, he even Adores what he hath made,
like the Statuaries of <hi>Athens,</hi> who from their own handy-work choſe
their <hi>Gods;</hi> His thoughts which ſhould be imployed for <hi>Glory,</hi> and the
publick good of his Realm, and have no other Object, but the <hi>ſafety</hi>
and <hi>wellfare</hi> of his people, are all at an end in this pitiful deſign, in blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up a <hi>gaudy bubble</hi> of Honour, as <hi>vain and trivial,</hi> and yet no leſs <hi>Gay,</hi>
than that which Children raiſe with a <hi>Quil</hi> from <hi>water and Soap;</hi> He o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to him all his <hi>Coffers,</hi> and pours out treaſures on him as much in
deſpight of others, as to benefit him; And at laſt when he hath confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on him all the <hi>Offices</hi> of the Kingdom, and all the <hi>Ornaments</hi> of his
Crown, and has nothing left to give him but his own <hi>perſon,</hi> he ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that too with ſo abſolute and ſo total a Reſignation, that in the very
<hi>Monaſteries,</hi> there is not an Example of a will more <hi>Subjected</hi> and more
perfectly Renouncing it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Hence forwards he appears <hi>at Councill,</hi> but when his preſence is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to Authorize ſome Extravagant prereſolv'd deſign, in the debate
of which he never bore a part, and is content to ſhew himſelf for no other
purpoſe, but to juſtify what thoſe that adviſed him to it, are both <hi>affraid</hi>
and <hi>aſhamed</hi> to own; He is amuzed with petty Divertiſements unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his <hi>Condition</hi> and of his <hi>Age;</hi> They take from about him all that
dare ſpeak <hi>Truth,</hi> they Ruin under ſeveral pretences all that's <hi>Eminent</hi>
and <hi>Virtuous</hi> in the State, and he Imagins becauſe they tell him ſo, that
all this is abſolutely <hi>neceſſary for his Service,</hi> and the ſupport of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
Thus <hi>Seneca</hi> muſt be <hi>Butcher'd</hi> before <hi>Nero</hi> could turn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Monſter, and <hi>Boctius</hi> baniſht by <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> at the perſwaſion of
his three fatal Favourites, becauſe that good and wiſe Stateſmen was an
obſtacle to their lewd deſigns.</p>
            <p>To ruin honeſt <hi>Patriots</hi> that would ſtop the unhappy Torrent, ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are raiſed, and <hi>Calumnies</hi> advane'd, and falſe informations Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
they are ſeized, on general Rumours without ſpecifying their
Crime, and condemned unheard as Enemies to <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>State:</hi>
Thoſe that are Rich and peaceable are Entrapp'd by <hi>Informers</hi> and penal
Edicts let looſe upon them: Thoſe whoſe <hi>paſt Services</hi> and undoubted
<hi>Loyalty</hi> maintain them in repute, and whoſe <hi>fidelity</hi> is without Reproach,
are employed in Chargeable, or put upon hazardous Attempts and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Offices, either that they may loſe their <hi>Repntation</hi> or <hi>themſelves.</hi>
Some are driven away by an abſolute Command to Retire, others Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<hi>Baniſht</hi> by an Embaſſy, and in the room of all theſe, the ambitious
<hi>domineering Cabal</hi> place perſons at their own Devotion, who never look
farther than their Benefactors, and ſtop at the next Cauſe of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and therefore ſtudy to ſerve and advance their Intereſts, who
raiſed them, not the Prince's though ſtill they call themſelves his Servants,
and would be thought the greateſt <hi>Zealots</hi> for his Honour.</p>
            <p>Thus may an <hi>unfortunate Prince,</hi> come to be at the Mercy and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103773:7"/>
of his <hi>Favorite,</hi> he ſhall not caſt a look, but preſently a ſpy ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the other an Account, nor utter one word, but what is told him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
ſo that in the midſt of his own Court, and amongſt all his <hi>Guards,</hi>
he ſhall be Invironed with none but <hi>Savages,</hi> that prey upon him, not
having one <hi>faithful Tongue</hi> about him, that dare truly repreſent his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Sufferings, nor one <hi>honeſt Ear</hi> to whom he may tell his own: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
he quickly becomes ſo far Engag'd, that there is no way for him to
releaſe himſelf, the other making all the World his <hi>Real</hi> Enemies, or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
for ſuch, that he may have none but him to truſt: And by having
long had the poſſeſſion of Affairs, which he Communicates with none,
he alone underſtanding all, and knowing the <hi>State,</hi> he at laſt becomes a
<hi>neceſſary Evil,</hi> vvhich neither can the Prince be cured of, but by a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Remedy.</p>
            <p>After this manner, in an abſolute <hi>Peace,</hi> being at amity with his
Neighbours, no Foreign Enemy appearing on the <hi>Frontiers,</hi> without
ſtriking a Stroke, or having ventured farther than from the <hi>Palace</hi> to
the <hi>Theatre,</hi> may a Prince inſenſibly fall into <hi>another Mans power,</hi> which
after the defeat of an Army, is the worſt thing that could happen; And
to ſpeak home, the Battel of <hi>Pavia,</hi> was not ſo fatal to <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt,
nor the taking of <hi>Rome</hi> to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh; For if their <hi>diſgrace</hi>
was great, it was not <hi>Voluntary,</hi> if they loſt their Liberty, they in their
Afflictions preſerved the Glory of their <hi>Courage,</hi> and if they were taken
<hi>Priſoners,</hi> 'twas by a great Emperour, who was their Enemy, and not
by one of their <hi>Petty Subjects;</hi> There is no Captivity ſo miſerable, ſo
baſe, nor ſo Infamous, as that of a Prince who ſuffers himſelf to be
<hi>ſhackled</hi> in his Cabinet, and by one of his own, he can never Exerciſe a
more Cowardly patience, nor be more ſhamefully happy. Suppoſe a
King ſhould Eat his people to the very Bones, and live in his own State
as in an Enemies Country, he would not ſo far eſtrange himſelf from
the duty of his place, as when he obeys another; There is 'tis true, a
vaſt difference betwixt <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Royalty,</hi> yet the former reſembles
the latter a great deal more than <hi>Servitude.</hi> It's at leaſt ſome kind of
Government, and one way of Commanding men, although a very ill
one. But for a Soveraign to give up himſelf as a prey to three or four
<hi>Petty Fellows,</hi> in the knowledge and Conduct of all his Affairs, certainly
there cannot be a more miſerable <hi>Interregnum,</hi> than ſuch a Prince's Life,
during which he doth <hi>nothing,</hi> and yet doth all thoſe Evils which may
happen to the People.</p>
            <p>In this Condition he is civilly Dead, and hath as it were <hi>Depoſed</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
it is only his Effigies, which is uſed in publick, which out of cuſtom,
and for a ſhow hath ſome Homages paid, and uſeleſs <hi>Congees</hi> made to it.
But in effect Royalty is forſaken, and Favour only Courted, and a civil
Idolatry committed: For as ſome <hi>ſuperſtitious Bigots</hi> ſay ten <hi>Ave-Maria's</hi>
to one <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> and call an hundred times oftner upon St. <hi>Francis,</hi>
than on our Saviour, ſo in this caſe, where one addreſſes himſelf to the
King, forty ſuiters apply themſelves to the Favorite; For indeed to go
to the Prince without his mediation, would be a certain courſe to <hi>ſpoil
your Buſineſs,</hi> though never ſo juſt in it ſelf, or advantagious to the
Publick.</p>
            <p>What a brave thing it was in former times, to ſee a King of <hi>Castile</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:103773:7"/>
who durſt not walk abroad, nor put on a <hi>new Suite,</hi> without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of <hi>Alvares DeLuna;</hi> all favours which others demanded of his
Majeſty, he himſelf was obliged to obtain from him. The moſt he
could do was to recommend <hi>their Petitions</hi> to his Favourite, and to do
good Offices with him, for thoſe whom he loved. How prepoſterous
would it be to ſee ſuch a Courtier, as he was, who revoked the Elections
of his Prince, turn'd thoſe out of their places, to whom his <hi>Maſter</hi> had
granted them, nay proceeded to that height of Inſolence, that he took it
very ill, that his Maſter ſhould <hi>once in his Life</hi> offer to read a paper,
which he preſented him to <hi>Sign,</hi> and complained that this was to <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
his Fidelity,</hi> and forget his paſt Services.</p>
            <p>But there are <hi>Shee-favourites</hi> as well as <hi>Bearded-ones;</hi> and though, this
be the <hi>weaker-Sex,</hi> yet both their <hi>paſſions</hi> and <hi>Enchantments</hi> are the ſtronger
of the two. <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> were not the only <hi>Hero's</hi> that truckled
to the Diſtaff: <hi>Love</hi> has often govern'd the <hi>Politicks,</hi> and the fortune of
a whole Kingdom become the paſtime of a <hi>debauched Woman;</hi> For it's
too true, that ſuch perſons have ſtrangely derided the authority of the
Laws, and the Majeſty of Empire; More than once, they have tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
underfoot Crowns and Scepters, they have taken pleaſure, and
ſported themſelves with the Violation of Juſtice, and Gloried in their
cruel Pride, in Afflicting and Rendring Humane kind Miſerable: 'Tis not
long ſince there appeared one of theſe <hi>Heroina's</hi> who was riſen to ſo
high a degree of <hi>Inſolency,</hi> that having been ſollicited about a certain
Affair, which had been repreſented unto her, as <hi>just and facile</hi> to be
done, that ſhe might the more <hi>willingly Imploy</hi> her ſelf therein, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
with a fierceneſs worthy of her Sex and profeſſion, <hi>That ſhe uſed
not her Credit ſo laviſbly, that another might ſerve in ſo ſlight</hi> an occaſion,
to do <hi>juſt and poſſible things,</hi> for her part. ſhe accuſtomed her ſelf only to
undertake thoſe which were <hi>Unjust and Impoſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many Miſchiefs do you think follow ſuch an one, how many Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences
are committed under the ſhadow of theſe fatal <hi>overgrown Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers?</hi>
ſuch a <hi>puffed up Succuba</hi> hath not a Groom or a Lackey, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
it not to be his Right and Priviledg to abuſe at his pleaſure any
other Subject, and by alledging only that he belongs to ſuch a <hi>agreat Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
commits all Outrages with <hi>Impunity,</hi> affronts Juſtice, and dares
tell you to your teeth, after he has <hi>Cheated</hi> and abuſed you never ſo
grievouſly, that you are obliged, and ought to thank him for his <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
that he did not <hi>Murther</hi> you.</p>
            <p>All this while, you will ſay, what is this to the Prince? And yet
with all deference be it ſpoken, he cannot be ſaid to be wholly <hi>Innocent</hi> of
the miſcarriages: His Ignorance is not <hi>Unblameable,</hi> his <hi>Patience</hi> herein
is not <hi>Virtue,</hi> and the Diſorders which either he <hi>knows not of,</hi> or which
he <hi>Suffers,</hi> are imputed to him before God, even as if himſelf had done
them, and therefore that Prince who was according to Gods own heart,
in expreſs terms deſires him, and that in the fervency of his moſt ardent
Prayers, that he would <hi>Cleanſe him from ſeret faults, and acquit him from
the ſins of others;</hi> which laſt word Intimates, that Kings ought not to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103773:8"/>
content themſelves with a <hi>perſonal Innocency,</hi> that it is not enough for
them to be Juſt, if they loſe themſelves, and deſtroy their people by the
<hi>Injuſtice</hi> of their Miniſters, which becomes their own, becauſe they
<hi>tolerate</hi> it, and <hi>Countenance</hi> it, by Conniving and not puniſhing it with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.
<hi>Qui non prohibet, quum potest, Jubet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to multiply Examples: Can King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> be juſtified, who in
a moment abandoned to the Vengeance of a <hi>pernicious Haman,</hi> ſo many
thouſand innocent Lives, and thoſe too of the <hi>Solect people of God,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
inquiring into their Crimes, or making any Reflection on what he
granted: He had doubtleſs no bloody deſign, nor any Imagination whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that inhumane Commiſſion he ſo readily delivered with his <hi>Royal
Signet,</hi> would tend, and his ordinary idleneſs, or over conceit of the
Juſtice and Prudence of his Favourite, ſuffered him not to take any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cognizance of it, which rendred him <hi>doubly Culpable,</hi> to permit ſo
many <hi>Murthers,</hi> and yet to be ignorant of it. For ſo, no leſs wittily, than
judiciouſly, <hi>Seneca</hi> brings in <hi>Claudius</hi> in the other World, and ſome men
Reproaching him with abundance of <hi>Murthers,</hi> done under his Name,
who pleaded not Guilty, and proteſted he did not ſo much as know
what they meant, nor ever heard of thoſe ſufferers <hi>Names</hi> before, upon
which the Ghoſt of <hi>Augustius</hi> roſe up, and ſaid, <hi>Thou Miſcreant, we talk
not here of the ſlaghters thou haſt committed, but of thoſe thou haſt not known:
For it is a more ſhameful thing to a King to be Ignorant of the Evil that paſſes
in his Kingdom, than to act it. Turpius ignoraſti, quam occidiſti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great <hi>Events</hi> are not always produced by <hi>great Cauſes.</hi> The Springs
are hid which move theſe <hi>vaſt Machines</hi> of State, that externally appear,
and when <hi>thoſe Springs</hi> happen to be truly diſcovered, we are aſtoniſht
to ſee them ſo <hi>ſmall</hi> and ſo <hi>weak,</hi> and half aſhamed of the high opinion
we had before conceived of them. A fit of <hi>Jealouſie</hi> in an amorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
between two particular perſons, hath more than once been the
cauſe of a general War. A little <hi>reflective Joak</hi> uttered in a gay Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
an Affront to a <hi>Page,</hi> a <hi>Whiſper</hi> and a <hi>Nod,</hi> a <hi>Tale</hi> told at the Kings
going to Bed, is in appearance nothing, and yet this nothing, hath
been the beginning of <hi>Tragedies,</hi> wherein a Sea of Blood hath been ſhed,
and an hundred <hi>heads</hi> made fly. 'Tis but a <hi>Cloud</hi> which paſſes, a ſmall
ſtain in the corner of the Air, which vaniſhes rather than abides, and
yet'tis this <hi>light Vapour,</hi> this almoſt imperceptible Cloud, which raiſeth
the moſt <hi>fatal Tempeſts,</hi> which ſhake almoſt the foundations of the
Earth. The people when ever War is proclaimed, think it their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes
Intereſt, that 'tis to Revenge ſome inſufferable Affronts, or
have <hi>Reparations</hi> of vaſt damages ſuſtained, that 'tis to prevent an <hi>Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
or ſecure their Tranquility, to encreaſe <hi>Traffick</hi> or force by Arms
the neceſſary Conveniences of Peace: When in truth, perhaps all this
<hi>Buſſle</hi> and <hi>hazard,</hi> this Blood and Treaſure conſum'd, proceeds only
from the <hi>Capricio</hi>'s of two or three <hi>Penſionary Courtiers,</hi> that are content
to hazard the Ruin of their <hi>own Maſter and Country</hi> to advance the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of ſome <hi>powerful Neighbour,</hi> that underhand feeds them with <hi>Gold;</hi>
Or from ſome other unthought of <hi>whim,</hi> if not altogether ſo baſe, more

I doubt not, but the <hi>mighty Zerxes</hi> made moſt ſpecious pretences to
juſtifie his Arms, when he made his Inroad upon <hi>Greece,</hi> and his <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

told wonders of his Intentions; he had received (I'le warrant you)
<hi>Injuries,</hi> which he was bound to <hi>Chaſtiſe,</hi> and had a <hi>Right</hi> which he
was obliged to aſſert, ſo that he could not without <hi>diminution to his Glory</hi>
refrain the Expedition; he forgot not to tell them, that he laboured for
the <hi>Repoſe</hi> of the World, and to unite <hi>Europe</hi> with <hi>Aſia,</hi> that he, the
mighty Monarch of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> came to Chaſtiſe the <hi>petty Tyrants,</hi> and that
he came purely out of Compaſſion to the people, and offered them a
rich Glorious Liberty, inſtead of a poor and ſhameful Servitude; There
is no doubt, but he <hi>Falſified</hi> his deſign ſeveral ways, and perhaps ſwore,
that it was immediately Inſpir'd him from the <hi>Immortal Gods,</hi> and that the
<hi>Sun</hi> himſelf was the Author of his <hi>March;</hi> Yet not withſtanding all this
<hi>Parade</hi> and colours of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> the bottom of the buſineſs was
in truth only this, a <hi>Greck Phyſician,</hi> the Queens Domeſtick, having a
mind to review the Port of <hi>Pyraeum,</hi> and taſte the <hi>figs of Athens,</hi> put this
fancy of War into his <hi>Miſtreſſe</hi>'s head, and got her to engage her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in the Attempt. So that the King of Kings, the <hi>Puiſſant Redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Zerxes,</hi> rai<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed an Army of three hundred thouſand Combatants,
levell'd the Mountains, drank up Rivers, and overburden'd the Sea,
&amp;c. only to bring back a <hi>Mountebank</hi> into his own Countrey. Surely,
ſurely the <hi>Quack</hi> might have gone the Journey with leſs expence and a
ſmaller <hi>Equipage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Greek Hiſtory affords us another notable Example in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> Long before the Birth of King <hi>Philip,</hi> there happen'd
a famous Conſpiracy, which of <hi>one State</hi> made two, and divided the
Court, the Towns and the Families, upon the moſt trivial occaſion
imaginable; One <hi>Maleagar,</hi> Governour of a frontier-Town, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the <hi>Cavalry,</hi> having an handſome Wife, and withall ſo good
<hi>Natur'd,</hi> as ſeldom ſuffer'd any of her Lovers to die of deſpair. The
King hearing of her <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Gallantry,</hi> had a mind to give her a viſit
in private, but finding her no ſuch exquiſite <hi>Beauty,</hi> as Fame had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
her to his fancy, he at firſt ſight betrayed his <hi>Diſguſt,</hi> and preſently
went away in a Huff, which Affront our <hi>ſtately Dame,</hi> (who had no ill
opinion of her own Merit,) reſented ſo briskly, that from that very
hour ſhe vow'd <hi>Revenge:</hi> And not being able to effect it better, than
by corrupting her Husbands fidelity, and debauching him from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of his Maſter, ſhe imployed all her <hi>Charms</hi> to that purpoſe, till at
laſt by the continual Croakings of this <hi>Night-Raven,</hi> the poor man had
loſt his Reaſon, and forgot his <hi>Duty,</hi> and by this <hi>boſome Cockatrice</hi> became
ſo Impoiſon'd, that he quitted the ſervice of his King, and imbark'd
himſelf in the party of a Tyrant, without knowing truly, what motion
drove him, nor what paſſion he Reveng'd; He acted a part he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
not, and was but his <hi>Wives Soldier,</hi> when he thought he was the
head of the Revolt.</p>
            <p>'Tis undoubtedly a truth, that Kings cannot Reign without <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi>
and ſcarce leſs Certain, that they cannot live without <hi>Favourites:</hi>
The wiſeſt Princes in the World, the <hi>Auguſtuſſe</hi>'s, and the <hi>Antonines,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:103773:9"/>
the <hi>Conſtantines,</hi> and the <hi>Theodoſiuſſe</hi>'s, if they ſhould <hi>Revive,</hi> would
once again, as vvell as formerly, give teſtimonies of <hi>Humane Affection,</hi>
and might with reaſon love one man (<hi>Caeterisparibus</hi>) rather than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
For virtue is not ſo auſtere and Savage as to deſtroy <hi>Nature,</hi>
nor do the <hi>Politicks</hi> oblige a Prince to diveſt himſelf of Humanity, his
motions need only be <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>well Regulared;</hi> Let him ſhew his bounty
and his <hi>Kindneſs</hi> to particular perſons, let him enjoy his diverſions,
his Complacences, and his Friendſhips too, but ſtill it were to be wiſht
he would obſerve a <hi>proportion</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> in the diſtribution of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
Let not <hi>Nero</hi> make his Horſe a <hi>Conſul,</hi> nor every Fidler a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of State;</hi> Let not a mighty Monarch Debauch <hi>Nobility</hi> (the Screen
of Majeſty,) by conferring Honours on the <hi>Sons of Earth,</hi> and little peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as void of <hi>Quality,</hi> as <hi>Merit;</hi> Let him not encourage Villany by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
the proper <hi>Dowry</hi> of Virtue; nor impoveriſh the Publick, to
make one man unmeaſurably Rich. Let there be a man (the dictates
both of Religion and Reaſon allow it) who is the <hi>Princes Confident,</hi> and
on whom he may like the Sun, more peculiarly dart down his Beams,
but let there not be any, who Day and Night <hi>beſiegeth</hi> the King, who by a
violent Uſurpation (the moſt <hi>abhorrible Monopoly</hi> in Nature) appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
him to himſelf: For he who <hi>Impales</hi> a Good which ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the publick; attempts the ſame <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> as if he hid the <hi>Sun</hi>
from all the World.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that recommends a Prince's <hi>Judgment,</hi> or that is of
more Importance to his <hi>ſafety,</hi> than a diſcreet <hi>Choice</hi> of his Miniſters;
A man cannot conduct a <hi>Boat,</hi> nor guide a <hi>Chariot,</hi> nor manage an <hi>Horſe,</hi>
without making uſe of Addreſs and Method, and ſhall thoſe who are to
direct Mankind, jump into the Imploy, without any preparatory Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline?
We come to the knowledg of Affaries, and the dexterity of
ordering them, by <hi>Experience</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> a <hi>place</hi> does not preſently make
a man wiſer than he was before; nor are we to expect <hi>Revelations,</hi> nor
think Heaven obliged to endow a Prince's Miniſters with the <hi>Spirit of
well Governing,</hi> and render his precipitate Election valid and <hi>ſuccesful</hi> by a
ſudden Illumination; Courtiers are the <hi>matter,</hi> and the Prince is the
<hi>Artist,</hi> who can eaſily render this matter <hi>Fairer</hi> but not better than it is,
he can add to it Colours and ſhape on the outſide, but cannot give it
any interiour Goodneſs. He can beſtow the <hi>Office</hi> and the <hi>Title,</hi> but he
cannot confer <hi>Qualifications,</hi> The knowledg of things paſt, the penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into things to come: That Light which diſembroils the intrigues
of the Court, the Science of making War, and the dexterity of treating
Peace. In a word, he may make an <hi>Idol,</hi> but he can neither make a
<hi>Spirit</hi> of it, nor an <hi>Able man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet even in Chriſtendom <hi>ſuch Idols</hi> are to be ſeen, there have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
unworthy perſons happy; <hi>Monkies</hi> careſſed in Kings Cabinets,
and apparell'd in <hi>Cloth of Gold;</hi> There often happens an Authority,
which is <hi>Blind and Dumb,</hi> which neither knows nor underſtands, which
appears only and Dazles, <hi>pure refin'd</hi> Authority you may call it, for it
has not any <hi>mixture</hi> of <hi>Virtue or Reaſon.</hi> There are Grandees, who are
only remarkable by their <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> and their Greatneſs is all without
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103773:9"/>
them, They reſemble certain <hi>fruitleſs Mountains</hi> in ſome parts of the
World, which produce neither <hi>Herb,</hi> nor <hi>Plant,</hi> they ſeem to touch
Heaven with their ſtately tops, yet ſerve the Earth for no <hi>Uſe,</hi> and
therefore their Sterility makes their height <hi>accurſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Princes therefore ſhould make a ſtrict inquiry into the Abilities and
virtues of thoſe they Imploy, they ſhould not ſuffer themſelves to be led
by <hi>occaſion,</hi> but take for their Inſtruments ſuch as are able, not ſuch as
<hi>ſtand next,</hi> or firſt <hi>offer</hi> themſelves, wherein too, they ſhould regard
not only a General <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> but a particular fitneſs for diſcharging
thoſe Charges in which they place them; They muſt not think an expert
<hi>Souldier,</hi> that hath ſignalized himſelf in divers Battels, is therefore
qualified to be ſent on an <hi>Embaſſy,</hi> nor make an old <hi>Prodigal</hi> Lord, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,
and ſubmit the <hi>Exchequer</hi> to his diſpoſe, becauſe having in his
youth profus'd away all his own Eſtate, he now ſpeaks admirably well
of <hi>Frugality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor ſhould a Prince preſently thruſt into his <hi>Council</hi> all thoſe whoſe
<hi>Converſation</hi> is grateful to him; we ought to make a difference betwixt
perſons who <hi>delight</hi> us, and thoſe who are <hi>profitable</hi> to us; betwixt the
Recreations of the mind, and the <hi>neceſſities</hi> of the State; and if a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
take not ſpecial care in this <hi>Examen,</hi> he will commit irremediable
Errours, and ſuch whereby he may render not only his <hi>own Reign</hi> miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but alſo his memory accurſed and reproached in Ages to come.
He therefore ought not to follow his own <hi>private</hi> Affections or Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but abandon all <hi>Capricio's</hi> and fantaſies in this matter: Let him in
other things <hi>Sport</hi> and div<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rt himſelf as he pleaſeth, but in a choice of
ſo high Concernment, he muſt uſe the <hi>ſeuerity of his Judgment,</hi> and at

of Reaſon,</hi> freed and diſpoil'd of <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Hate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Miſchiefs ariſing from ill Miniſters are no leſs fatal, than <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi>
part of which we have already Recounted, and to ſum them up

its Intereſt for <hi>Money.</hi> If they are men of <hi>ill Principles,</hi> they blow up
their Prince to <hi>Vanity</hi> by Flatteries, and baniſh Truth from the Palace.
They put him upon extravagant Deſigns, or endeavour to drown him
in Voluptuouſneſs; They exhauſt the Royal <hi>Treaſury</hi> by their profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſtrip poor People to the very Skin to feed their inſatiable <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice;</hi>
they rob the Prince of his nobleſt and moſt ſtable <hi>Throne,</hi> the <hi>hearts
of his Subjects,</hi> by creating fears and mutual Jealouſies between them;
and whilſt with vain pretences and endeavours, no leſs impracticable,
than <hi>Unjuſt,</hi> they would ſeem to make him more abſolute than his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
they render him leſs Conſiderable at home, and conſequently
leſs <hi>Rever'd</hi> abroad, than any of his Anceſtors, they manage Affairs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their private Fancies, and hate <hi>publick Councils;</hi> having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Extravagances that render them liable to Juſtice, the reſt of their
life is ſpent not to ſerve their Maſter, but to <hi>ſave their own Necks,</hi> So that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103773:10"/>
in all their following Councils they conſult not his <hi>Advantage,</hi> but their
<hi>own Defence,</hi> and make his Intereſts ſtoop to their Conveniences; what
care they how much the people be provoked, they had rather their
Country ſhould be involv'd in all the miſeries and deſolations of a <hi>Civil
War,</hi> or be made a Prey to a <hi>Foreign Invader,</hi> than they themſelves
brought to an Account before an <hi>Impartial Tribunal;</hi> ſince in the <hi>firſt</hi> Caſe,
they hope to ſhift amongſt the <hi>Croud,</hi> but in the <hi>ſecond,</hi> can expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but certain Ruin, for their <hi>Conſcious fears</hi> preſage what will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen;
they know well enough, the <hi>ills</hi> they have done muſt be defended
with greater, and if the <hi>Law</hi> live, they muſt die; wherefore theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Courſes, and that the <hi>Plague</hi> cauſes not ſo great a deſolation,
as one of theſe <hi>accurſed Favourites,</hi> it might be wiſht, that this Prayer
might be added to all the publick Litanies of Chriſtians, <hi>Lord turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from all States an Evil, which is the cauſe of ſo many other Evils: Deny
not Soveraign Princes the Spirit of Conduct, which is fit for them to Govern
by: Give them underſtanding enough to Council themſelves well, and to Chuſe
their Counſellors as they ought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Conclude, As the firſt advances of Ill Court-Favourites are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>ſhameful,</hi> their progreſs <hi>Vile,</hi> wicked and deſtructive,
their ſhort Continuances attended with <hi>Hazards</hi> and Anxieties, ſo their
<hi>Eclipſes</hi> are ever more fatal, and their falls deſperate, they are Generally
ſurprized with Ruin, and their defeat is like that of <hi>Forlorn Troops,</hi> cut in
peices before they can Rally, or be reinforc'd. Private men oftimes
fall upon their <hi>Leggs</hi> and find Friends to releive, at leaſt to <hi>Commiſerate</hi>
them, and <hi>Bankrupt</hi> Merchants, are daily ſeen to riſe again like <hi>Phoenixes</hi>
out of their own duſt, but with <hi>Courtiers</hi> and <hi>Satesmen</hi> there are no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Misfortune; Thoſe <hi>Ladders</hi> they clamber'd up with ſo much
Sweat, addreſs and difficulty, upon the ſmalleſt miſs-ſtep, ſerve but to
render their precipitation more notorious; when they are hurl'd down
from all thoſe <hi>bubled Glories,</hi> their beſt comfort is not to <hi>Survive</hi> their
deſtiny, and their greateſt miſery is, when they outlive themſelves, to
ſee their Families <hi>Buried</hi> in their Ruins, and all the advantages of their
Honour and Fortune turn'd againſt them, like an Army diſſipated with
the fury of its own <hi>Cannon;</hi> Then too late, they find themſelves forſaken
of all thoſe <hi>Alliances,</hi> which they had with ſo much ſubtilty contracted,
vainly Imagining to have laid a Foundation of everlaſting Greatneſs:
Their <hi>Cobweb policies</hi> are unravel'd in a moment, for no ſooner do they
begin to decline, but their moſt <hi>obliged Creatures</hi> ſhun them moſt, and
like <hi>Haman's</hi> Wife are the <hi>firſt Harbingers</hi> of their Ruin. Thoſe that
were <hi>raiſed</hi> by their Countenance, not daring to <hi>own</hi> any Love or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to their perſons, leſt they ſhould be involv'd in their Ruin, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at leaſt ſuſpected, as concern'd in their Crimes; their own <hi>Servants</hi>
conclude it but <hi>Justice,</hi> as well as <hi>Prudence,</hi> to expoſe their faults; Their
<hi>Enemies</hi> triumph over them, and even their <hi>Friends</hi> think it Charity
enough to afford them an inſulting <hi>Pity,</hi> and the <hi>people,</hi> who with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
univerſally hated, but <hi>feared</hi> them <hi>before,</hi> are now priviledg'd to
<hi>Curſe</hi> them; nay the Prince himſelf, in whoſe ſervice perhaps they
wounded their Conſciences, and for whoſe pleaſures they <hi>Bleed,</hi> uſes them
but as the <hi>skreen of Envy,</hi> and hoping with their Ruin to gratify <hi>many,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:103773:10"/>
and pleaſe <hi>all,</hi> gives them up, when he cannot in prudence longer <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>
them, as a <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> to the enraged Multitude, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
as inexorable to their <hi>Petitions,</hi> as they had been formerly to the
more <hi>juſt Requeſts</hi> of others in diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>In fine, having long ſince forfeited their <hi>Innocency</hi> (the ſweet retreat
of oppreſſed Virtue) they at laſt find no <hi>Sanctuary</hi> ſufficient to protect
them, but are precipitated out of the World, loaded with <hi>Guilt</hi> and
<hi>ſhame,</hi> and the <hi>Ruins</hi> of Nations, and the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of their <hi>Maſters,</hi> and
the <hi>Execrations</hi> of all Mankind.</p>
