         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">An Humble PETITION on the behalf of many Thouſands of <hi>Quakers, Fifth-Monarchy men, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi>
&amp;c.</head>
            <opener>Humbly Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat your Petitioners are deeply ſenſible though not of their ſins, and the diſpleaſure of God, yet of their unhappineſs, and your Honours diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
and of the woeful effects of it towards them: That they do with ſad hearts remember a time, when by their crafty inſinuations, and
dexterous compliances, they had ſcrued themſelves into the generallity of Places of Power and Truſt in the State, Army and Navy, whereby
their Bowels were refreſhed, their Backs cloathed, their (otherwiſe contemptible) ſelves, rendred conſiderable, and in a capacity to gratifie
their Friends, and tread their Enemies under their feet: That they do unfeignedly repent of their late great declination, and fall from the height
of their hopes, and of the fatal miſcarriage of their renowned General the Lord <hi>Lambert,</hi> and the Diſſipation of his Forces, whereby ſo it is
(may it pleaſe your Honours) that your Petitioners are caſt out of their places like an abhominable branch, are reduced to their firſt nothing,
expoſed to the ſcorn and contempt of the wicked world, and the danger of the Law, which they never underſtood nor regarded.</p>
            <p>In conſideration of the premiſes and diverſe following conſiderations, your Petitioners make their humble Application to you, that they may once more enjoy the
Sun ſhine of your honours favour, and may be reſtored unto their former capacity, and may be for ever ſecured in the poſſeſſion of all their liberties, Civil and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious;
wherein they deſire to be rightly underſtood; By Civil Liberties they mean, not only that they may enjoy their common Rights as Engliſh men, but that
they may have a Monopoly of all places of command or advantage in the Nation, and that none, but ſuch as they approve of, may have a ſhare in them: And by
Religious Liberty, they underſtand not only a liberty from perſecution themſelves, but a power to perſecute others, to pull down Tithes, Miniſters, and all ſuch as
ſhall not ſuit with their Principles, and comply with their deſires: And that you would pleaſe to forſake all other Parties and Intereſts in the Nation, and caſt your
ſelf wholly upon them for your ſupport, and defence.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe your Petitioners being but few in number, and for the moſt part inconſiderable in Eſtate, and Intereſt, and generally odious to this and all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l argue a ſingular degree of generoſity, and confidence, and valour, and ſelf-denyal to rely upon them.</p>
            <p>2. It is a point o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> higheſt Juſtice, and abſolute neceſſity, that you ſhould confer places of profit upon ſuch as cannot live without them, and that you ſhould beſtow
places of truſt upon ſuch as have been ſo long accuſtomed to command that really they know not how to obey.</p>
            <p>3. It is moſt reaſonable that your Petitioners ſhould enjoy ſuch Liberty in their ſence, becauſe they are ſo tender of the liberties of others, having by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Actings, and late Petition delivered to your Lordſhip's Honours, <hi>Feb.</hi> 9. expreſſed their deſires, that none may enjoy any place of Truſt or Profit either in Church
or State, but ſuch as ſhall ſubſcribe the Oath of Abjuration, and ſuch as are againſt all Coercive power in matters of Religion, whereby they do very well underſtand that the
generality of ſober and conſciencious men, Miniſters and others, will be kept out of all power, put under your Petitioners Feet, and they, and their Families undone, and
brought to utter ruine. Now, may it pleaſe your Honours, for as much as the generallity of the ſober party of the Nation will hereby be deprived of their liberty both Civil
and Religious if your Petitioners ſhould not enjoy ſuch liberty (as they have expreſſed) there would be no liberty left in the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>4. Becauſe your Petitioners have been the unfortunate inſtruments of pulling you out of the Houſe two ſeveral times, the one under the late Tyrant
<hi>Oliver,</hi> when they ſet up a Mock-Parliament in oppoſition to you, the other under the ever to be honoured <hi>John Lambert,</hi> when they ſtrongly hoped and indeavoured
to keep you for ever out of doors. Now having, through their own folly and cowardize, neglected the improvement of ſo great and Goodly opportunities; they
humbly crave that you would once more put them into a capacity of turning you out of doors, and they promiſe to manage it the next time to better advantage.</p>
            <p>5. Becauſe you ought to mete out to men as they would meaſure out to others, which is a part of juſtice; And therefore we may expect your gracious pardon of
our late defection, and that you would make us the objects of your clemency, becauſe as we have formerly deſired, ſo we do not yet ceaſe to call upon you, and cry
out for your ſevereſt juſtice and greateſt rigour towards Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and all his adherents, who yet never were guilty of ſo deſperate a deſign as we were to
overthrow the Government of the Nation by Parliaments.</p>
            <p>6. Becauſe it will be an act of meer grace and goodneſs to ſhew any favour to us, ſuch as is no way by us deſerved, and to ſay the truth cannot in any reaſon be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and that whether you look upon us for the time paſt, preſent, or to come; for the time paſt, becauſe we have given ſuch proof of our perfidiouſneſs, that
we deſerve never to be truſted more; for the preſent, becauſe it is not our choice or inclination, but our neceſſity that brings us to you, having no other ſtring to
our Bow: for the future, becauſe you will thereby be engaged to ſettle the Nation in the way of a faction, and ſo neceſſitate your ſelves to the perpetration of
Armies and Taxes, and other Burdens, and render your ſelves uncapable of ſetling a Free State, by reaſon of thoſe everlaſting heart burnings, which hereby you will
create and foment, ſo that if you ſhall pleaſe to gratifie us in our requeſt, and bring us into play again, you will do an act of unparallell'd grace and favour, and ſuch as
all the world will wonder at, and you will make us laugh in our ſleeves.</p>
            <p>7. How ever you may ſuſpect, that we only diſſemble with you for the preſent, for our own ends (as we have often done formerly) and that our principles at
preſent are not right and real to you; we deſire you to hope that we ſhall grow better, becauſe we never uſe to hold our principles long: And if you think (as well
you may) that there is ſome ſecret engagement between us and Lambert, that we ſhall joyn with him when ever he ſhall lift up his head and hold up his finger (for
doing of which we ſhall be enabled by your granting of our petition) we intreat you to give no credit to it, becauſe it is notoriouſly known that our conſciences are
of ſuch a make, that no Engagements, nor Oathes, nor Covenants with God or men, could ever hold us, when our Intereſt obliged us to break them, and we have left
freſh Inſtances of late memory, that although we received Commiſſions from your honours (to our great advantage, and the grief of the whole Nation) and though
ſome of us profeſſed great repentance for our former defection from you, and though we ſolemnly promiſed ſubjection and faithfulneſs to you, yet as ſoon as ever
we ſaw a dore open <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or the better promoting of our own intereſt (which is the Good Old Cauſe) we unanimouſly deſerted you and puld you out of the houſe, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at your dowfal, and it was not our fault that ever you returned again to your power.</p>
            <p>8. That we may not be tedious (as we uſe alwayes to be in all our writings and diſcourſes;) we deſire you to conſider with your ſelves how hopefull and likly a way
this is to bring us to ſettlement, (which all people do ſo earneſtly pant after.) For ſeeing there is ſo great a ſympathy between State and Chnrch, that they laugh,
and weep, live and dye together, it cannot be otherwiſe, but that we who are ſuch known friends to order and eſtabliſhment in the Church, ſhould be the Authors
and Promoters o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

beſides our troubleſome reſtleſneſs will make all People the more deſirous of reſt, and ſo we ſhall prove the happy occaſions of the eſtabliſhing of the publick Peace.
Upon which conſiderations, we humbly lay our deſires at your Honours Feet. And (becauſe many of us cannot fight)</p>
