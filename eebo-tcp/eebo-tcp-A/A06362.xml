            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

An other not ſo faithfull as my ſelfe, might fill all <hi>France,</hi> with his complaints: But my perpetuall deuotion to the place of my Natiuitie, and to my King, doe reſtraine and bridle my Tongue, and maketh me to ſeeke rather in mine owne incapacitie, then in any other conſideration, the cauſe of ſo great an alteration.</p>
            <p>In one onely point is my ſpirit impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently tormented: that is; Of that more then abſolute reſolution of <hi>your Maieſtie,</hi> to vrge me to take money in recompence for my Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies: Not that I doe not ſufficiently iudge how neceſſarie this courſe is, for the good of your ſeruice: But on the other ſide, it is to my ſelfe ſo preiudicall, and ſo contrarie to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that whatſoeuer power I haue ouer my ſelfe to content you, yet haue I not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to accept it. But contrariwiſe (<hi>MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAME</hi>) I am forced to refuſe it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to my dutie in this occaſion, to preferre my particular Intereſt, before that of your Maieſtie: of all the meanes prouided to wade through this buſines, this muſt néedes be to me the moſt odious: and indeed I doe abhorre
<pb facs="tcp:9292:10"/>
it, and holde it as proceeding not from your goodneſſe, but from the malice of mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>For (<hi>MADAME</hi>) wherefore doe they not rather laye this pretence vpon my ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wild humour, an incompatible eſtrangement from all gratification of whatſoeuer ſocietie, and diſſimulation, vpon the weake order that I may paradueture haue taken in the affaires of my Offices: vpon my bad Huſbandrie, in matter of the Treazurie: vpon the euils that haue procéeded of ſuch ſtrong intelligences as I haue practized, as well within as without the Realme: and vpon ſuch extreame care as I tooke to eſtabliſh my ſelfe in the preſeruation of my Fortunes: Wherefore (I ſay <hi>Madam</hi>) haue they not rather choſen this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather then any other: neither ſo faire in ſhewe, and yet farre more vnlikely? For, ſo publiſh or giue out, that I neuer craued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other recompence, then for my Office of the Treaſurie, neither yet any other reward then the Office of a Marſhal of <hi>France.</hi> It is a matter that cannot bee truely maintained; The impudencie of mine Enemies, and the complaint of ſome of my Friendes, ſhall neuer be of force ſufficient, otherwiſe to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it.</p>
            <p>But if your <hi>Maieſtie</hi> doe accuſe me, that of my ſelfe I haue offered you all that I did poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, I confeſſe it: Neither doe I denie, but that many times I haue aſſured your <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,</hi> that all that was mine depended vpon you; yea, euen my very life it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9292:11"/>But ſurely (<hi>MADAME</hi>) I will alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uow, that at that time I could not imagine that ſuch Offers to a mans Soueraigne, could be offence ſufficient to be therefore depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and put from his Dignities. So as if now you doe ſo take it, it is a principle in my opinion, very new: Yet ſhall not this nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie neuertheles euer make me to repent that I haue done my dutie.</p>
            <p>But contrarywiſe (<hi>MADAME</hi>) at this preſent, I doe againe offer to <hi>your Maiſtie,</hi> not onely my honors, my goods, but alſo my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life, with the liues of my Children: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I preſent them vnto you vppon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny condition, but to vſe them according to your pleaſure; Yea, euen to honour my very Enemies with them, if to take them from me ſimplie be not matter of content.</p>
            <p>If my paſſed Actions haue tended to the aduancement of this Crowne, I will alſo that my obedience ſhall bee the firſt to ſhewe the meanes to preſsrue it. And whatſoeuer my Enemies doe publiſh of my loue to that I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, or whatſoeuer other mens humors may helpe to bréede beliefe, yet is it true (<hi>MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAME</hi>) that I will abandon all that my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices haue purchaſed me, with more conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, yea, with a thouſand times more reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, then an other ſhall poſſeſſe them with pleaſure. It ſhall ſuffize me in my ſolitarines, to learne how your <hi>Maieſtie</hi> doth daily make your Scepter to flouriſh, and preferring in theſe Affaires a goodly Order, and in your Coffers Treaſure ſufficient to ſupport this Eſtate, which principally ſubſiſteth vppon the ſupport of theſe two Pillers.</p>
            <p>This is it wherein I will moſt quietly
