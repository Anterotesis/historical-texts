            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>AS Long Parliaments have been heretofore the great miſchief &amp; ruin of the Free-born Engliſh man's Liberty, which this Nation in general began to he very ſenſible of, by the abundant Evils that had like to have befallen the good people of <hi>England,</hi> even almoſt to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all Propriety and Priviledges, as well as Religion, which the All-wiſe God, out of pity to this Nation, hath how at laſt put an end unto, by an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected hand of Providence: So did there lately ſeem to threaten as great an Evil by burdening the Counties with the Choice of too frequent Parliaments; and the Cauſe of this Fear did not ariſe in the hearts of wiſe men without ſome Cauſe; for Drinking and Revelling, being grown into both Faſhion and Cuſtom in many places of this Kingdom, both Burroughs and Counties, as neceſſary Qualifications to make a wiſe Repreſentative, Gentlemen indeed, thoſe that are really ſuch in their ſober deportment and carriage, began to grow weary; though they could not but ſee, that nothing but utter deſtruction muſt at laſt moſt certainly ſwallow up both them and their Poſterity, in ſome ſhort time, in caſe perſons were Choſen; as only obtained their Elections by Drinking and Feaſting the Country. For wiſe men well know that ſuch exceſſive Charges was ſo unreaſonable a thing to be born by any honeſt perſon, that hath no other end than his Countries good, that it could not but be imagined long ſince that thoſe perſons that got ſuch their Elections by thoſe waies and means, had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end in it, and deſigned repayment again in a private and unjuſt way out
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96467:2"/>
of the peoples pockets, by ſelling their Votes at a dear rate for the raiſing of money, and in other matters of great moment.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſome perſons, and not a few, to the eternal Infamy of both them that paid, and them that received ſuch wages of unrighteouſneſs, were grown to that exceſs after they were ſent up Members to the late Long Parliament, that they received yearly more money for ſelling their Country, than it coſt them to be ſo elected; ſo that at laſt to be once got a Parliament man, was grown a ſure way both of profit and honour, though purchaſed out of the poor peoples hearts blood; for thoſe men to have good places, or large Penſions, would and did as eaſily part with their Countries Liberty, and the Peoples Freedom and Right, as well as their money; and, which may eaſily appear, if we conſider their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering over their Equals, and deſpiſing Law, and longing for Seats in the late Long Parliament, to be continued to them and their Heirs for ever.</p>
            <p>But not to trouble you further with their ill Proceedings at this time, ſince we have yet room for hopes that we ſhall have once more an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that will look into ſuch miſcarriages, and give a due reward to ſuch Offenders in the late Long Parliament, who either for Places or Penſions, ſold their Votes and their Country at a cheaper rate than <hi>Eſau</hi> did his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
            <p>But as to the Gallantry and Nobleneſs of divers of the Gentry of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as well as the whole body of the Freeholders, there take this ſhort Narrative; The Writ being directed for the Choice of two Knights for the Shire, <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt, the 12th. of this Inſlant <hi>Auguſt</hi> was appointed the Day, being the firſt County-Court; And whereas Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Mildmay</hi> were former Members in the laſt good Parliament. Collonel <hi>Mildmay</hi> did ſometime before the Day of Election intimate to Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey</hi> his intentions to ſtand to be one of the Knights of the Shire; and that as they had been both choſen before, he believed the Country would now do the like freely; but though the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels Intereſt in the County was looked upon by all to be that which brought them both to be ſo eaſily Elected before; yet Sir <hi>Eliab</hi> (as is believed) truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either to his own Intereſt, or the Intereſt of the Duke of <hi>Albemarle.</hi> and ſome other of the Gentry. did abſolutely refuſe to joyn himſelf with Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Mildmay;</hi> but on the contrary, was reſolved to ſland alone, that now his Intereſt with the Duke, and ſome of the Gentry, and Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> was ſufficient not only to be Choſen Knights of the Shire himſelf; but a<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſo wholly to lay aſide and diſappoint the Collonel of his intentions; and in effect under hand to oppoſe his Election, which was thought to be more eaſily done, becauſe the Collonel, like the old Engliſh-man, was reſolved not to be at any coſt or charges in the obtaining his Election, thinking, as indeed it is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſufficient to ſerve their Country as their Member, and not vainly to throw away his Eſtate, as well as his labour to be their Servant too; for that his Noble Spirit well knew, that he that ſerved his Country faithfully, deſerved the Thanks of his Country, without ſpending his Eſtate to be Choſen: but ſome were not idle all this time, ſince the Diſſolution of the laſt Parliament, to reproach, vilifie and abuſe that Worthy Perſon, Collonel <hi>Mildmay;</hi> yet the ſumme of all their malice could reach no higher, after all, but to reproach him for a Phanatick, a name too common in the mouths of our half Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and ſo little underſtood by them; but too too grateful to the Papiſts, by which they have moſt maliciouſly branded every ſober perſon in <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96467:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with that name; nay, a man can hardly paſs through the Streets with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in his face, but he is branded for a Phanatick; and by ſome that would make us believe they are Proteſtants themſelves; but if Phanatick does denote a mad man, as I have underſtood it alwaies did, till within the compaſs of twenty years laſt paſt, then I am ſure it is as falſe an aſperſion caſt on that Worthy Perſon, as that was which was caſt upon the Apoſtles, that they were mad-men for Preaching the Reſurrection from the dead, and Judgment Day to come; but let ſuch, whoever they are, know, it is a thouſand times more honourable to be called by them <hi>Phanaticks</hi> than <hi>good Chriſtians,</hi> a thing I fear they are very little acquainted with more than the Name: But there we leave them where they moſt delight, and proceed to tell you, that ſome of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> both before and at this Election were very zealous, againſt this worrthy perſon Coll. <hi>Mildmay;</hi> for one of them ſtanding by a Papiſt, that Voted againſt the Collonel, cryed, well done, he did not doubt but that they ſhould agree well enough in the main, though not in all points. Some ſent their Paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellet to all their Neighbourhood, and eſpecially to their own Club of the Long Robe, and did incourage and threaten them upon their obedience to their Dioceſſian, that they ſhould not fail, but make all the Intereſt poſſibly they could, that Collonel <hi>Mildmay</hi> might not be Choſen, but all hands for Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Middleton,</hi> whom they knew would never fail their Cauſe, nor their Church, which was all thoſe Gallions cared for, no matter what became of their Country; it was the Liberties and Saucineſs of the Lay-men they hated; and they muſt be brought into blind obedience to them, and pin their Faith on their ſleeves, or elſe all was undone, and the King and Country loſt; this was their cry and exhortation; and my Lord Duke ſuppoſing his Intereſt in the Country to be made greater by ſlanding up againſt Collonel <hi>Mildmay,</hi> with all his power and might, both in his perſon and friends, engages all againſt the Collonel, and muſters up all to come and give their Vote for <hi>Middleton</hi> againſt <hi>Mildmay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the day being come, the Roads were every where filled round <hi>Chelms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> with vaſt numbers of Gentry and Freeholders, the night before there not being room enough in that Town for Lodging, and in the Morning by Seven of the clock Coll. <hi>Mildmay</hi> came from his houſe to the place near the Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, with about 1000 Gentlemen and Free-holders, where met him my Lord <hi>Shandiſh</hi> with about 1000 more, all on horſe back, crying out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>A Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may, a Mildmay,</hi> with many vollies of Acclamations; preſently after the ever noble and renowned Lord <hi>Gray</hi> met the Collonel in a moſt ſumptuous habit, with his led Horſes in rich Trappings, and about 2000 Horſe attending him; then the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> with the Collonel began to march into the Town, where they were met with near 2000 Horſe more, and ſo paſſing through the Towm into the Field in very good order, with their mouths loudly hollowing for <hi>A Mildmay</hi> only, and crying out. God bleſs my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> they there reſted for about an hour, while they drew up in a poſture to be viewed, and being then all got together, was not eſteemed leſs than 6000 men. Not long after came into the Town Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> with about 150 or 200 Horſe-men, and my Lord Duke and Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey</hi> with about 400 men more, accounting their Servants and Attendants; and Sir <hi>Eliab</hi> came into the Field near to Coll. <hi>Mildmay:</hi> but the Collonels men being angry that Sir <hi>Eliab</hi> ſhould eſpouſe another intereſt, and not joyn with the Collonel, reſolved unanimouſly as one man, that they would only give one Voyce for the Collonel, and Reſerve the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96467:3"/>
other for ſuch a perſon as the Collonel ſhould pleaſe to nominate to them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: which being reſolved, the Collonel with his company drew out of the Field to the Town-houſe, and riding ſeveral times about it, with an incredible ſhout for a <hi>Mildmay,</hi> a <hi>Mildmay,</hi> that ſcarce the like was ever ſeen at any Election; and the hour being come for the Writ to be read, the Collonel goes to the Town-Hall, and being told the High Sheriff was ready, made a ſhort Speech to the people to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen and Friends, ſince I ſee you judge me worthy to ſerve you as a Member in this next Parliament, I promiſe you, according to the beſt of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, faithfully to diſcharge that truſt you ſo unanimouſly intend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in me; and ſince you judge me a fit Perſon, I hope you may give ſome cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to my recommendation of another Perſon to joyn with me in that Service, which I ſhall name with your leave, and if you approve of, and judge him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy alſo, though he be not here, yet he may ſoon be ſent for to come among you:</hi> To which all the People gave a great ſhout, and cryed, <hi>Name him, name him;</hi> which then the Collonel did, and told them, <hi>John Lomott Honeywood,</hi> Eſq; a Perſon <hi>of a very good Eſtate in this County,</hi> was in his Judgment a very honeſt and worthy Perſon, and one that he did verily believe would ſerve them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: Which the people liking, immediately with a great ſhout cried, <hi>Send for him, a</hi> Honeywood, <hi>and a</hi> Mildmay, <hi>and none elſe;</hi> and ſo the word being given out among the Free-holders, and the Collonel with them ſurrounding the Market-places two or three times, that the people might be all informed of the ſecond perſon, every man at laſt (which was within the compaſs of half an hour) cryed out as much a <hi>Honeywood</hi> as a <hi>Mildmay;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Honeywood</hi> being come up to the Company, he and the Collonel, with Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thö<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Middleton</hi> went into Court, where the Sheriff was ready, and the <hi>Noble Lord Gray</hi> did the Collonel and Mr. <hi>Honeywood</hi> the Honour to enter into the Court with them, to ſee matters fairly carryed, which otherwiſe might not have been: The Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi> on the other ſide, and ſome of the Gentry were pleaſed to be in Court alſo; and the Writ being read about Ten of the clock at the High Sheriffs command, <hi>who in all the occurrences of the whole action carryed himſelf like a worthy Gentleman, and did endeavour as much as could be to prevent any diſorders in the Election:</hi> The Writ being read, and demand being made who they would chuſe for their Knights of the Shire, was immediately anſwered by the whole people with loud cryes. <hi>A</hi> Mildmay, <hi>a</hi> Mildmay, <hi>and no Courtier nor Penſioner;</hi> and then ſilence being made again, and demanded who they would have for the other perſon, they did as unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly cry out, <hi>A</hi> Honeywood, <hi>a</hi> Honeywood, <hi>a good Proteſtant;</hi> and it could hardly be perceived, that any there preſent of the Electors were of an other mind, or took ſo much as notice of Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey,</hi> or Sir <hi>Thomas Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> (except their Servants, and thoſe that came along with the Duke, and his Attendants) but notwithſtanding the great inequality both in the Field and the place of Elections, as it is before expreſſed, yet Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> demanded the Poll; and before the beginning of the Poll. Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey</hi> was pleaſed to tell the people, that Coll. <hi>Mildmay</hi> had broke his promiſe with him; but in what, was not then underſtood, otherwiſe than it was ſuſpected he meant, that Coll. <hi>Mildmay</hi> ought not to have joyned with any other Perſon but him, but the Collonel giving ear to what was ſaid by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> declared to the people, That he never was in the leaſt guilty of leaving Sir <hi>Eliabs</hi> intereſt, or deſigning ſo to doe, or under any promiſe to joyn with

            <p>Theſe words paſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Poll was begun, and each Perſon that ſtood had his Clark to take the Poll, which began about Eleven a clock that day, where was ſuch exceſſive thronging of the Free-holders, being eager to be polled; that the Court was fain to adjourn ſeveral times that day to eaſe themſelves; the tumult being great, and the Countreymen fearing ſome trick might be put upon them, would not leave the place at no rate, crying out. It was a ſhame that any Gentleman ſhould offer to ſtand a Poll at ſo vaſt a diſproportion, ſince the whole Countrey was for <hi>Mildmay</hi> and <hi>Honeywood,</hi> and wondred that Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> and the Duke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would oppoſe the Countrey, who was all but as one man; but Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey</hi> in reply to Coll. <hi>Mildmay</hi> then told the people, That now he did declare he would joyn with Sir <hi>Tho. Middleton;</hi> but after a little ſpace, when he was informed that Coll. <hi>Mildmay</hi> had never joyned with any man till he came to the place of Election, and ſaw him joyn with Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> then Sir <hi>Eliab Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> very worthily told the people, he would not at all concern himſelf in joyning with any man whatſoever. And no ſooner was the Poll begun, but ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that would be thought both to be Gentlemen, and the wiſeſt Juſtices in the County, in oppoſition, and as it then ſhould ſeem to warrant no other than to breed a diſturbance, firſt on the Bench gave Coll. <hi>Mildmay</hi> and his party very reviling Language, as pitiful inconſiderable Phanaticks, and the like, and ſuch words as only befitted a railing perſon in his Pulpit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a drunken God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damme, telling them they had none but a company of Clowns, and that the Collonel had never a Gentleman among them, nor any perſon that was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman would offer to ſet up ſuch perſons to be Parliament-men, and the like: which proceedings did enrage the Free-holders, and made them cry out, they were better men than themſelves; and all their abuſes and tricks could not perſwade nor affright them from ſtanding up for their Countreys good; and then told them, None but Papiſts and Half-Proteſtants would abuſe ſuch men. But thoſe of Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi>'s party, and ſuch eſpecially as polled for him, were not content with giving ill language of the baſeſt ſort, but upon the Bench did all they could to make diſturbances, by violences offered to the Collonels perſon, one of them having the Impudence (who calls himſelf a Knight) to take him by the Hair or the Noſe, to provoke the Collonel to ſtrike, that ſo there might be a quarrel, ſo as to make a diſturbance and evacuate the Election, or at leaſt prolong the Poll, which was aimed at on purpoſe to tire out the Countrey-people, it being Harveſt-time, and alſo they hoping, that they bearing their own coſt and charges, would ſend them home the ſooner; ſo that by delaying the Poll, they might at laſt be in ſome equality with the Collonel, and when the Collonel well anſwered that Perſon, and they ſaw that would not doe, and that the Noble Lord <hi>Gray</hi> began now to be ſenſible of their abuſes and deſigns, the next thing they undertook, was to quarrel with the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> himſelf; but the perſon that did that being a Peer, and the Noble
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96467:4"/>
Lord <hi>Gray</hi> vindicating his Honour with that Peer, and giving him an anſwer ſuitable to a Challenge ſaid to be ſent him. I ſhall not further repeat that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But when that would not do their work neither, then ſome of the Juſtices of the Peace (as they pretended themſelves) for the promoting their cauſe, fell upon the Clark that took the Poll for Coll. <hi>Mildmay,</hi> and a wrathful Fellow, to ſhew his kindneſs to his Friend the Duke, and the other perſons that ſtood againſt the Collonel, in his abundant Wiſdom, Juſtice and Manhood, aſſaulted the ſaid Clark, and ſtruck him ſeveral times, upon pretence the Clark did not doe his duty by ſtanding bare to his Worſhip, though then the Court was ſhut, (and the Sheriff not there, which only made the Court) and committed the perſon into cuſtody for calling the Clergy-men <hi>Prieſts;</hi> although he could not but well know, it is a Title they all own, and would fain be termed ſuch; and the Clark muſt be carried to Priſon, and the Books he had taken the Poll in muſt by all means be taken from him, which was indeed thought to be the deſign of the quarrel, to get the Books from him: Then a worthy perſon which did only intimate his miſlike of theſe things, by interpoſing himſelf, was abuſed. But theſe proceedings, though very prejudicial to the perſons that bore them, yet were no advantage to their own party, for the worthy Free-holders were the more incenſed againſt them; And if the Wiſdom of my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> the Sheriff and the Collonel, had not been great, theſe proceedings might have cauſed great miſchiefs; but the Countrey-men were ſo ſenſible of the brave courage and gallantry of my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> that no ſooner was he, the Collonel and Mr. <hi>Honeywood</hi> leaving the Court to go to their Lodgings at all times, but they all as one man, attended them with great ſhouts, crying, <hi>God bleſs my Lord</hi> Gray <hi>for ſtanding for the Countrey-men;</hi> and then crying out, <hi>A Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may, a Honeywood:</hi> but when the other party went from the Court, there was ſilence enough. Thus the Poll continued from Tueſday about Eleven a clock till about nine on the Friday following: where in all that whole time the Freeholders Zeal was ſo great. that they never abated of their Courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and like Noble Engliſh men, worthy Eternal Honour, lay in Town at their own coſt and charges, and ſcorned to put their Members to two pence charge; but divers of them did help and aſſiſt one another, and with that willingneſs and chearfulneſs, that it is beyond expreſſion, which other Counties having ſo good an Example, I hope will take pattern by, and ſcorn to be treated by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers they chuſe, but will bear their own charges, and not diſcourage honeſt men, which would ſerve them, were it not for the exceſſive charges, as well as burden.</p>
            <p>Theſe worthy Freeholders would often ſay, That it was the high way to make men Penſioners and Knaves, to put them to charges to be Choſen; and ſo conſtant were theſe men in their reſolutions of Chuſing thoſe worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they would call out to the Court oft times when they were ſo thronged, and almoſt ſtifled to death, That they would not be tired out not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the diſcouragements they met with ſometimes from the Court in preferring other perſons that came in freſh to be Polled before them. And they would often ſay, if we ſtay this month we will not be tired out, and other times cryed out moſt bitterly in the Streets againſt the Penſioners in the late Long Parliament, that had almoſt ſold them for ſlaves: And at other times when they were told they would loſe their Corn on the ground if they ſtayed longer, they made this bold Anſwer, <hi>That they would rather trust God with <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eir Corn, than trust the Devil to chuſetheir Parliament-men.</hi> For that they

did now clearly ſee that all was at ſtake, and that they had too long pinn'd their Faith on other perſons ſleeves; with a multitude of ſuch other hearty expreſſions, too tedious here to be related.</p>
            <p>But on <hi>Friday</hi> morning, about ſeven of the Clock, no perſon almoſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Poll againſt the Collonel, and Proclamation being made three times, that all perſons ſhould come in to Poll, or elſe the Poll would be ſhut up; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight of the Clock all being Polled that appeared, the Poll was ſhut, and the Court adjourned till One that day, till the Books were caſt up, which was done by that time, in preſence of divers perſons appointed by the Sheriff to ſee the ſame fairly done; but the Duke, with Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey</hi> withdrawing from the Court after the Poll was ſhut up, it was thought fit to ſend to them to be preſent at the caſting up of the ſame; but Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey</hi> immediately left the Town, and Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> did not appear himſelf, but ſent a perſon to inſpect the Poll; but no ſooner was the Poll cloſed, but news was brought there were about 500 came to the Town on purpoſe to be Polled for Collonel <hi>Mildmay</hi> and <hi>Honeywood,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds more that day came in for that purpoſe. It was given out over night that the Poll would be continued ſeveral daies longer, and ſo divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons went home and returned as occaſion offered; but the Poll being call up, was found to be one thouſand five hundred ninety two for Coll <hi>Mildmay,</hi> 1517 for Mr <hi>Honeywood,</hi> ſix hundred ſixty nine, for Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey,</hi> 754 for Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Middleton,</hi> among which were ſome perſons that were convicted Papiſts, and above 200 of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> ſome of which, to the diſhonour of their Profeſſion behaved themſelves, to ſay no worſe of them, not like ſober men, there being ſo much good Liquor in the Town, and the generoſity of thoſe they took part with, being too much abuſed by them: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the two Knights men; were nobly kept and entertained, and no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Entertainment given by the other ſide; yet the difference was ſo great, and would have been as much more, had the Poll continued longer; but the Poll continued for the two Knights to the laſt man.</p>
            <p>But the Sheriff returning to the Court at the time according to cuſtom, proclaimed Collonel <hi>Mildmay,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Honeywood</hi> duely Elected, and then Indentures were ſealed in Court; after which the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> calling to the Freeholders in a very handſom Speech to this effect delivered himſelf.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Gentlemen, your zeal you have ſhown for your Liberties; and the Countries good at this Election, and your gallant Carriage and Behaviour, is never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſufficiently to be commended; and that which more highly commends you, beſides the pains you have taken in attending the hardſhips that have been put on you, is that you have born your own Charges of this Election your ſelves, and have not been chargeable to the Gentlemen you have Choſen, but have wiſely conſidered; that ſuch as make it a Trade to bear the Counties Charge, and feaſt them to be Choſen, do fetch the ſame out of the Country mens pockets another way, which tends to the ruin of your Eſtates and Liberties: And I hope this good Preſident will be imitated by our Neighbouring Counties; therefore I ſhall ſay no more to you at this time, but wiſh you still to continue your Zeal and Courage for the maintaining your Liberties, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion.</p>

At which the Freeholders gave a great ſhout, crying out, <hi>God bleſs your Honour, and all good Engliſh-men that will ſtand up for the Peoples Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> and then the Knights in two Chairs were carried round the Town, and brought to their Lodgings with an innumerable company of people ſhouting and crying. <hi>A Mildmay and Honeywood;</hi> which being done, my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and the Sheriff dined at the Collonel's Chamber, with ſome other of his friends, and the People attended on Horſe-back to wait on my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and the Collonel, and Mr. <hi>Honeywood</hi> out of Town, which was done about five of the clock, with near five hundred Horſe; But I muſt not forget to relate one Paſſage which was committed by a perſon that was againſt the Collonel, and one that call'd himſelf a Gentleman,) that while my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and the reſt were at Dinner, a little before they were taking Horſe to go out of Town, a poor Country-man going along the Streets, by the Door where the Oppoſites lodged, and crying out, <hi>A Mildmay and Honeywood,</hi> he ſeeing the Country-man's Zeal, knock'd him down, and broke the Country-man's Legg, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fled to the Inn for ſhelter; but the Country-man's friends acquainted the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and the Collonel with the action, they immediately ordered the perſon that did the fact to be ſeized, which was done, and he committed to Goal, and ordered the poor man to be carefully lookt after; which ill Action ought not to be laid to the charge of any but malicious perſons; and indeed ſo much of malice did appear by the words and actions of thoſe that Polled againſt the Collonel, that a ſober man would bluſh to hear; and among the reſt was given out, That no Gentleman, or like a Gentleman, would appear on the Collonel's ſide, which was ſo notoriouſly falſe, that by the very. Book wherein their names were entered, can teſtifie there were as many Gentlemen of Eſtates, and men of quality appeared for the Collonel, as they had, and rather more, except Clergy, my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> with Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey</hi> himſelf, and divers other Lords and Gentlemen, making up the numbers of Freeholders on the Collonel's ſide.</p>
            <p>This being the true Account, though not dreſt up in Terms of Art, or varniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a florid ſtile, is hoped will be acceptable to thoſe honeſt Freeholders; and when other Countries ſhall ſee the brave Courage and Wiſdom of this County of <hi>Eſsex,</hi> in the Choice of two ſuch worthy Men, in ſpight of all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that they will imitate their Pattern, and no more ſuffer themſelves to be feaſted, and drunk out of their reaſon, which is the reaſon that Ill men are too often Repreſentatives in Parliament, which never deſigned by their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments given to the County, but to be doubly and trebly reimburſt out of their Electors pockets, which way doth inevitably indanger the Loſs and Liberty of the whole Nation in general.</p>
            <p>And now good Country-men, do but conſider nothing can ſo ſoon enſlave you and your Poſterity, as the Choice of ill Members in Parliament; for to have your Throats cut in the face of Law, is a thouſand times worſe than the the Force of Arms; and aſſure your ſelves, they are worſe than the Papiſts, or at leaſt no better, that would go about to perſwade you to ſubmit to any thing ſhort of your juſt Rights and Liberties.</p>
