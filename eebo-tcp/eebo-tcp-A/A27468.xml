            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Perfect Narrative of what paſſages I obſerved from Lieut. Col. <hi>Joh. Lilburn,</hi> and others, touching him in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>bout the beginning of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1652. I was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the behalf of this Common-wealth into <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and landing at <hi>Oct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,</hi> I found a number of very deſperate enemies of all ſorts to this Commonwealth, with whom I obſerved Lieut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> C. <hi>Lilburn</hi> much to aſſociate; and having obſerved before his reſtleſneſs of ſpirit, and that his late actïons had rendred him ſo obnoxious to this Common-wealth, that incurred an Act of Baniſhment upon himſelf; I therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed my ſelf to find out what his endeavours at preſent drove at: And to this purpoſe it was not long before I found that Lieut. Col. <hi>Lilburn</hi> had been very converſant with Cap. <hi>Ioh. Bartlet,</hi> and to whom he had imparted ſeverall ſecrets, as he himſelf called them, the ſaid Cap. <hi>Iohn Bartlet</hi> who told me, that there were many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents and Cavaliers of dangerous conſequence that eſcaped out of <hi>England</hi> to that Town of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> whom L. C. <hi>Lilburn</hi> no ſooner heard of, but came to them, and in as groſs a manner as he could, did endeavour to leſſen the Juſtice, Honor, and power of this Commonwealth, and this in ſo vile and ſcurilous language, as produc'd rather a wonder than an affection in its chiefeſt adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as was ſeveral times confeſſed to me by ſeveral of them with whom he convers'd. Cap. <hi>Bartlet</hi> as well as ſeveral others further told me that L. C. <hi>Iohn Lilburn</hi> kept great correſpondencies with ſeveral people in <hi>England,</hi> and that one <hi>Sanctly</hi> Mr. <hi>Prinns</hi> man he conceived did ſend away his letters, for which purpoſe the Lie. Col. every Saturday came from <hi>Bruges</hi> to <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and having wrote them, on the Monday following he returned, as I my ſelf often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103257:3"/>
him to do. Not long after I heard Col. <hi>Charls Lloid,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called Sir <hi>Charls Lloid,</hi> Engineer General, and Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter General to the late King, Cap. <hi>Luke Whitington,</hi> Agent to <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> Cap. <hi>Iohn Tytus,</hi> Cap. <hi>Ioh. Bartlet</hi> ſay that L. C. <hi>Iohn Lilburn</hi> had propoſed ſeveral times, ſometimes to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> ſometimes to Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> ſometimes call'd the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> and ſometimes to Col. <hi>Charls Lloid</hi> aforeſaid, and ſeveral others, That if any of the forenamed perſons would procure him 10000l. he would deſtroy the Lord General <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> the Parliament, and the Council of State that now ſitteth at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and ſettle <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> (King of <hi>England</hi> as he called him) in his Throne in <hi>England,</hi> or he would have a piece of him nayl'd upon every poſt in <hi>Bruges.</hi> In anſwer to which, Sir <hi>Charls Lloid</hi> as aforeſaid told me, that if he thought the L. Col. could perform what he propoſed to them, it would be hard but they would procure ſo much money upon ſo good a ſcore. I obſerved further from L. C. <hi>Iohn Lilburn,</hi> and others who told me of his actions, that the L. Col. did not only move with much violence and earneſtneſs, ſhewing which way he would bring this his propoſed deſign about, but went from perſon to perſon whoſe reputation he thought could procure ſo much as he propoſed for (for the advancement of this his declared deſign) and whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and opinions were moſt ſuitable to further him in ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
            <p>Not long after this L. C. <hi>Lilburn</hi> took up a preſumtion that I was imployed by the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred he was certified of by ſeveral of his friends (and named one <hi>Col. Layton</hi> as one of his friends, who now ſtands exil'd from this Commonwealth, and was Secretary to the Council of Warr to <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>) The L. C. hereupon went to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> as aforeſaid, <hi>Col. Charls Lloid</hi> as aforeſaid, Major General <hi>Diol</hi> a <hi>Scotchman</hi> that came and invaded <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> and had lately broke out of the Tower, Dr. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> Judge of the Admiralty court in <hi>Dunkirk</hi> for <hi>Charls Stuart, Cap. Luke Whitington</hi> Agent for <hi>Charls Stuart, Cap. Iohn Tytus,</hi> brother to <hi>Cap. Tytus</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Enemie of this Commonwealth, <hi>Cap.

               </gap> of <hi>England,</hi> and warned them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103257:3"/>
of me. For he had already ſpoiled two of the Parliament Spyes, and would in a ſhort time ruin me alſo. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (as <hi>Cap. Tytus</hi> and ſeveral others afterwards told me) the Li. Col. went to <hi>Placingdol,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Col. Layton,</hi> where they way-laid me an hour and a half to have ruined me, as L. C. <hi>Lil.</hi> often ſaid he would, though it pleaſed God in his Mercy not to let me come that day from <hi>Oſtend,</hi> when I knew nothing of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt me. Not long after this X converſed with ſome of the L. C. his Aſſociats, and told them I wondred much why <hi>L. C. Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> ſhould offer thus to abuſe his own Country-man in another Nation, in ſo high a Nature as he had done me, ſince I never did him hurt, and repeating what I had heard from others, that <hi>L. C. Lilburn</hi> ſhould ſay of me; It was ſoon told the <hi>L. Col.</hi> again, who preſently preſumed that it was <hi>Cap. Bartlet</hi> that had told me, and from that time forward he ſought with more violence than before to have me murdered, as too plainly appeared by his after-acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by two witneſſes that I examined by order, who gave it under their hands, and offered to depoſe it, That one of the <hi>L. C.</hi> his Conſpirators againſt me, often told them, that the <hi>L. C.</hi> and this other Conſpirator had hired a man to have ſtabb'd me, becauſe I was employed an Intelligencer for the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> and had not I eſcaped ſpeedily away, their buſineſs had been effected upon me. But I underſtanding the <hi>L. C.</hi> his practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againſt me, reſolved on my voyage for <hi>England;</hi> which being underſtood by the Lieut. Col. ſome more men beſides himſelf with weapons way-laid me and <hi>Cap. Bartlet</hi> (as we were to take boat for <hi>Oſtend</hi>) that ſo he might have executed what he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſpoke againſt me, which was for this purpoſe (as ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confeſſed to me, who had it from his own mouth) that his carriages in <hi>Flanders</hi> ſhould not be declared to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> for ſaid he, as they have baniſhed my perſon, ſo they will ſequeſter my eſtate. But it pleaſed Almighty God this ſecond time by his providence to protect me, in giving me a reſolution not to go till the morrow, which the <hi>L. C.</hi> perceiving, ſuppoſed himſelf to be diſcovered, and returned into the Town, And ſuddenly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon came on <hi>Cap. Bret</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebell to inquire for <hi>Cap. Bart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> with the ſaid <hi>Cap. Whitington,</hi> who were both privy to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and diſcovered it, after God in his mercy had prevented them. By this time it was noyſed up and down the City, inſomuch that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103257:4"/>
ſome of the Citizens offered me their aſſiſtance, which ſome of them afterwards gave me, and brought me to the boat the next day; at which time the Lieut. C. with ſome more of his Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators lay behind a hedge, near the way that I was to paſſe, and thus bleſſed be God I eſcaped his hands.</p>
            <p>A little before the Lieut. C. had diſcovered that Captain <hi>Bart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> informed me of whatſoever the Lieut. C. told him, Capt. <hi>Bartlet</hi> ſaid that he had told him that he the Lieut. C. had much intercourſe and correſpondency with <hi>Holland,</hi> by which means, he would ruin me, in cauſing me to be apprehended, becauſe (as he ſaid) I was a Spy for the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> which Capt. <hi>Bartlet</hi> giving me timely notice of, hindred my journey, and ſo a third time I eſcaped his malice, which was not againſt me any further, than as he ſaid I was a Spy for the Common-wealth of <hi>England.</hi>

            <head>The Examination of Capt. <hi>John Tytus,</hi> concerning Lieut. Col. <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> Sept. 22. 1652.</head>
            <p>THis Examinant ſaith, that the ſaid Lieut. C. <hi>John Lilburn</hi> propoſed to the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> that if he would procure him ten thouſand pounds, he would deſtroy the Common-wealth of <hi>England</hi> in ſix moneths, or he would have a piece of him naild upon every Poſt in <hi>Bruges.</hi> The Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> told the ſaid <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> that it could not be ſo facile a thing, though he believed it would be done, but not in ſo ſhort time; to which the ſaid <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> replyed, My Lord, Ile ſhew you how it ſhall be done; give me but the monies that I propoſe for, and Ile have my Agents (for I have enough of them) that ſhall give me a continual account of all the Commonwealth of <hi>Englands</hi> Proceedings: And by thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents I will ſpread My Papers abroad, that ſhall inſtigate the people againſt the Parliament, and ſo by that Power I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that Power that My Agents ſhall make by working upon the people, I will deſtroy this Parliament, the Councill of State, and the Lord General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> in half an hour.</p>
            <p>This Examinant further ſaith, that <hi>George Villers,</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> ſent for the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> to inquire which way he might make his addreſſes to the Parliament for his Peace; But
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103257:4"/>
the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> adviſed the <hi>Duke</hi> from it, for that the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Cromwell</hi> and the Parliament were ſo falſe a Company of Rogues, that it was not ſafe for the ſaid <hi>Duke</hi> to put his life into their hands: And further ſaid, that if the King (to wit <hi>Charles Stuart</hi>) would but obſerve what he the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> had ſet down in ſome Papers, which ſhew the reaſon why the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> would not be a Cavalier, and reform but them, he might eaſily do his buſineſſe and ſit in his chair. But the ſaid <hi>Duke</hi> ſpurr'd him the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> on to his firſt requeſt of adviſing him which way he might make his peace with the Parliament. But the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> would not hear of that, but adviſed the ſaid <hi>Duke</hi> to the contrary, and further telling him the ſaid Duke, that they had hitherto (naming his Excellency the Lord General <hi>Cromwell</hi> and the Parliament) broken all their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and particularly the Lord General, to me, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed with all the Proteſtations in the world, and by what ever elſe was ſacred, that ſo ſoon as the General had done his buſineſs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he would then anſwer all their expectations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires (meaning the deſires of that party which are called <hi>Levellers</hi>) and further promiſed that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> ſhould be ſet on foot, and all the privileges of the people fully anſwered, according as they the ſaid <hi>Levellers</hi> had in ſeveral papers of theirs propoſed.</p>
            <p>But the ſaid Duke ſtill drove the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> off, deſiring him the ſaid <hi>Lilburn,</hi> that if he had any intereſt or party in <hi>England</hi> (as he the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> boaſted much of) that he would uſe it on the Dukes behalf; for, ſaid the ſaid Duke, could I procure a paſs to day to come into my native Country, I would fling my ſelf into the Lord General and Parliaments hands to morrow; For ſaid he the ſaid Duke, ſo far as I have aſſiſted the King hitherto, hath been but to quit my ſelf of ingratitude, ſince my Family hath been raiſed by the King and his Anceſtors. To which the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> replyed, My Lord, ſince you are ſo reſolved, I would advice you not to ſtir in ſuch things as yet, for that there is expected a New Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, at which time he the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> doubted not but he ſhould be able to do him the ſaid Duke ſervice, for he the ſaid <hi>Lil.</hi> ſhould then be as powerful as any in the Repreſentative. But the ſaid Duke deſired that if he the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> had any Intereſt that he would uſe it forthwith, for that he had a deſire to be reconciled to his Country. To which the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> replyed, My Lord, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103257:5"/>
General and the Parliament are ſo falſe a company of Rogues, that it cannot be ſafe for you to put your ſelf in their hands.</p>
            <p>This Examinant further ſaith, that at this ſame time the ſaid <hi>Lil.</hi> propoſed to the ſaid Duke, that if he the ſaid Duke could but procure him 10000l. he the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> would have a piece of him nailed upon every poſt in <hi>Bruges,</hi> if he the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> did not overthrow and deſtroy thoſe damnable Villains in <hi>England,</hi> I mean ſaid he the ſaid <hi>Lilburn,</hi> the Lord General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the Parliament, and that Monſtrous Councill of State. To which the ſaid Duke replyed, I pray you Sir let me hear which way you will do this. The ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> replyed, My Lord, Ile tell you how; Firſt Ile ſet my Preſſe on work (for which purpoſe I have bought one with a Letter at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which coſt me thirty pounds) and then Ile ſend my papers over into <hi>England,</hi> which by my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents ſhall be ſpread all over the Nation, and by my Agents (for I have enough) my papers ſhall be brought into the Army there, (where I have double Intereſt) and now every Trooper begins to underſtand his own privilege, and ſo ſoon as theſe papers are ſpread theyl fly in the faces of their Officers, ſo that with the help of my particular intereſt, the Souldiery ſhall do all themſelves, and Ile do nothing but ſit in my chair and uſe my pen. To which the Duke replyed, Sir, you may obſerve that in all your attempts the General out-witted you, and broke your buſineſs in the bud; beſides, you may ſee that on all occaſions the Souldiery hath been obedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Officer, ſo diſcreetly hath the Generall ordered his Army. Why then, ſaith the ſaid <hi>Lilburn,</hi> I perceive you take the General for a wiſe man. Yes ſaid the Duke, let the world read his Stories and theyl find him ſo. No, ſaid the ſaid <hi>Lilburn,</hi> I know him to be otherwiſe, for heretofore all his Buſineſs was mannaged by <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and is ſince by others; And for the Generall himſelf, he is as falſe a perfidious falſe-hearted Rogue as ever lived in the world. And I know no reaſon why I ſhould not vy with <hi>Cromwell,</hi> ſince I had once as great a power as he had, and greater too, and am as good a Gentleman, and of as good a family. To this the ſaid Duke replyed, Sir, if you have any Intereſt in <hi>England</hi> (as you ſay you have) I pray you to uſe it for me, for I have a great deſire to be reconciled to my native Country. Then the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving he could not moove the ſaid Duke to any thing in relation to his the ſaid <hi>Lilburns</hi> propoſalls and perſwaſions, he the ſaid
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103257:5"/>
               <hi>Lilburn</hi> promiſed to uſe his intereſt in <hi>England</hi> on the ſaid Dukes behalf; to which purpoſe the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> wrote to ſome in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but to whom this Examinant knoweth not. But with all the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> adviſed the ſaid Duke not to ſtir in it yet.</p>
            <p>This Examinant further ſaith, that the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> ſaid that there was one <hi>Rogers</hi> that was a Rogue, for that he was a Spy for the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore he the ſaid <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> would ruin and deſtroy him; And that he the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> had diſcovered ſeveral that were imployd in that way before. And after this apprehending the ſaid <hi>Rogers</hi> was to come towards <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> lay an hour and a half waiting for the ſaid <hi>Rogers</hi> his coming, at <hi>Placingdoll,</hi> three Engliſh miles from <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend,</hi> which was his way to <hi>Bruges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Examinant further ſaith, that there was one Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> (a man that keeps much company with the ſaid <hi>Lilburn,</hi> who took the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> his houſe for him in <hi>Bruges,</hi>) that ſaid that Lieut. C. <hi>Lilburn</hi> told him the ſaid <hi>Lambert,</hi> that he the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> had found a Rogue out, one <hi>Rogers,</hi> that was a Spy for the Common-wealth of <hi>England.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Lambert</hi> further ſaid with another Papiſt (commonly called by the name of <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>) as he the ſaid <hi>Lambert</hi> was, that if the ſaid <hi>Rogers</hi> had ſtaid two daies longer in the Town, he the ſaid <hi>Rogers</hi> ſhould never have gone thence alive, for that they would have him the ſaid <hi>Rogers</hi> knocked on the head.</p>
            <p>This Examinant further ſaith, that the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> ſaid, that the Lord General had abuſed Major General <hi>Lambert,</hi> who when time ſerv'd, would berevenged on the General.</p>

perſons, would procure him ten thouſand pounds, he the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> would ſettle the King in his Throne (to wit <hi>Charles Stuart</hi>) in <hi>England.</hi> And this Examinant further ſaith, that at the ſame time the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> ſaid, that the King (to wit <hi>Charles Stuart</hi>) ſhould never come into his Throne, but by his the ſaid <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burns</hi> means, And that he further ſaid, the ſaid <hi>Lilburn</hi> did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the late Kings death more than any man in <hi>England</hi> beſides, then durſt do.

            </p>
            <p>This Examinant further ſaith, that there was a Rumor in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> that his Excellency the Lord General <hi>Cromwell</hi> was made Lord Admiral of the Seas, and that he was to go to Sea in the Ship called the Soveraign, the which when Lieut.

Then the ſaid <hi>Whittington</hi> being in company ſaid, I am glad with all my heart you went not down, for the perſons were <hi>Lilburn,</hi> &amp;c. who were all well furniſhed for this purpoſe. With that the ſaid <hi>Brett</hi> ſaid, Gentlemen, you aremy witneſſes that I diſcovered them not.

Few daies after I came into <hi>England,</hi> and about 7 weeks or 2 moneths ſince returning there again he told me that his wife had been there, and that he had ſent her into <hi>England</hi> with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> a Copy of which he gave me in print, and that he expected a paſs to go into <hi>England,</hi> he would not ſtay a day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it came, though he hired a boat of purpoſe; then one <hi>Parker</hi> a Cavalier taking his leave of him, askt if he might not write to him, he anſwered, no, I will receive no letters from Mr. <hi>Parker;</hi> then he askt if not by another name, to that he aſſented.
