            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>LEt me beg thee not to cavil with the name of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> ſince the nature of it is not to reflect on any perticular perſon; and therefore it is expected that you will be leſs offended at any thing herein contained, than at the late <hi>Theatrical Entertainments,</hi> which are the ſevere <hi>Anatomies</hi> of theſe licentious <hi>Times,</hi> and the harſh characters of the follies of ſome Janties, who (one would think) ſhould be deterred from the Commiſſion of them, if for no other reaſon than to avoyd the hard cenſure of this <hi>o're critical Age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well obſerved by the <hi>Remarker of the Humours and Converſation of the Town,</hi> that all are content to be taken in pieces at a <hi>Playhouſe,</hi> and to be exhibited for divertiſement on the <hi>Stage.</hi> I hope theſe my Reflections may be accompanied with as little exception, or diſpleaſure My intent herein was not grounded on private revenge, occaſioned by any animoſity to one or more perſons, but following the juſt Laws of Writing, I have inſiſted on thoſe errours and fopperies, which may convey inſiru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and admonition to others. I have only laſht the debauchery of a <hi>Fop-Jaunty Suburbian;</hi> it being indeed a ſhame the <hi>City</hi> ſhould be made by every <hi>Cap'ring Fancy,</hi> the continual Subject of inſufferable abuſes.</p>
            <p>I will ſtep ere long into the Country, aed obſerve what vices are there moſt predominant, whether they are communicated from us to them, or have their derivation from their own ſourſes and Fontinels. I queſtion whether there be among them that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence</hi> in affairs and paſtime, which is pretended; but that under every <hi>Hedge</hi> and <hi>little Village, Vice</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> walk as bare faced as in <hi>Holborn, Strand,</hi> &amp;c. But I only promiſe you this <hi>Deſcription</hi> with this proviſo, that you like my preſent <hi>Diſcovery.</hi> It was pen'd laſt long <hi>Vacation,</hi> when all I had to do, was to hide my ſelf from the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of my cruel Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; for which purpoſe I lodg'd in <hi>Ram-alley</hi> for the benefit of
<pb facs="tcp:53878:3"/>the <hi>Temple Walks,</hi> which I call the <hi>Rum Stampers under the Blowers,</hi> and for the daily converſe of ſuch as were equally indigent and indebted as my ſelf: In which place to divert my ſelf and boon aſſociates, I formed this ſuppoſed Voyage from <hi>Lambeth</hi> to the Bridge on one ſide, and back again the other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting all remarkables between the two Shores; the one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (on the City ſide) I call the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> on <hi>Southwark</hi> ſide the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> or <hi>Barbarian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards <hi>Cape-verd</hi> (or <hi>Greens-wharſe</hi> near <hi>Chairing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs</hi>) I have ſomewhat ſharply cenſur'd the idle humors of ſome; but I proteſt none but ſuch who deſerve the ſevereſt cenſure: Men that are ſo onely in appearance, and Gentlemen by their gaudy apparel; who having little to live on but their ſhifts, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all the time they can ſpare from Drinking and Whoring, in racking their Wits to indulge their ſenſuality by any means whatever. Coming to <hi>Ramallia</hi> (which I call <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> becauſe there is a place ſo named in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which is a <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi> to all perſons whatſoever) I ſay coming thither under the pretence of deſcribing the nature of the Inhabitants of that famous Kingdom, (which is now different from what it was) I give an account of the <hi>Condition</hi> of a poor <hi>Debtor,</hi> and what ſhifts he is forced to uſe to preſerve his <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for their <hi>Laws</hi> (which I have comprehended in ſome few caſes) I hope none will <hi>cavil at,</hi> ſince they were never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>cavil'd with;</hi> and he that ſhall put himſelf under the adminiſtration of them, ſhall (I hope) reap loud laughter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of long vexation: in ſhort, if this meets with a total diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, very ſhortly I ſhall endeavour to pleaſe you better,</p>

            <p>This <hi>Speech</hi> was generally approved of, <hi>nemine contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente;</hi> and thereupon many hands were ſet at work for the fitting out theſe Ships for the <hi>Diſcovery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Winter Seaſon being over, and the Spring advancing, we got all things in a readineſs; and on Munday, being the firſt of <hi>March</hi> (and S <hi>David</hi>'s Day) the Wind at Weſt South-Weſt, we Sailed fron <hi>Lambethana,</hi> keeping our Courſe Eaſt and by North: we Sailed few Leagues, before the Weather grew hazie, at length the Air became very thick and foggy, inſomuch that the <hi>Pinnace</hi> loſt ſight of the <hi>Admiral,</hi> and could not have recovered her, but for a <hi>Leek</hi> that was placed in her Stern, in the place of the Lanthorn, by the ſent whereof the <hi>Pinnace</hi> recovered ſight of her again by break of day the next morning.</p>
            <p>The Second day the weather was very variable, and ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; this day we met with a <hi>Weſtern Brigantine</hi> who kept us company in peaceful manner, till by an unhappy accident, the <hi>Fleet</hi> had like to have been utterly ruined, and thus it was.</p>
            <p>One of our Ships Crew was a Welch-man, who in honor of his Country and S. <hi>David</hi> (whoſe Feſtival was the day before) told many wonderful, and incredible things, in praiſe of his heroick Country-men: but more eſpecially he averred that the <hi>Welch</hi> (the antient <hi>Brittiſh Stock</hi>) were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conquered by the <hi>Romans;</hi> tis true (ſaid an unlucky <hi>Crack</hi>) but you may thank your policy for that; for when <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſlain the major part of the flower of your youth, and ſtill purſuing his Conqueſts; and that you ſaw no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but that the reſt of you muſt likewiſe fall into his hands, ye then raiſed a long <hi>Bulwark,</hi> not ſo much to oppoſe, as to ſurprize him, for ye took a vaſt number of your long bearded Goats, and faſtned them at a convenient diſtance, cauſing nothing to appear above the Rampire, but their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53878:5"/>heads and beards, and then retired your ſelves into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; <hi>Caeſar</hi> about to make an aſſault, was hindred by the diſmal cry of the poor Goats, one ecchoing to the other <hi>Baw, baw;</hi> whereupon that valiant Commander withdrew, ſaying, let it ſuffice we have ſlain the Youth, and let us not fall on their old doting Grandſires, who now cry to us for mercy:</p>
            <p>This ſtory did not create ſo great a laughter in us, as it did fury in the <hi>Weſtern Brigantines,</hi> who thinking we had cry'd <hi>baw</hi> in deriſion to them, diſcharged upon us a broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of ſtones, repeated ſo often, that had we not been excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sailers, we had not eſcaped without conſiderable loſs.</p>
            <p>The third and fourth day we ſpoon'd onward for moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and met with ſeveral <hi>Fiſher-men,</hi> but not an <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> among them, <hi>it ſeems they have other fiſh to fry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth day about eight a Clock we met with a floating <hi>Hulk</hi> without a man in her; we boarded her, but for our lives we could not rummage her Hold, as we would; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we made a ſhift to carry off ſome Eels, but no other fiſh, though there was variety and plenty, which freſh proviſion was a great refreſhment to our ſickly <hi>Landmen.</hi> The <hi>Enemy</hi> from the <hi>Turkiſh ſhore</hi> perceiving this, made out to us, but their Oars came ſhort of our Sails.</p>
            <p>The next morning about ten a clock, my <hi>Pylot</hi> (which formerly had been a <hi>Spectacle-maker</hi>) deſcryed a Sail making towards us; coming up, we vilely ſuſpected him by his flag to be the <hi>Water Cannibal</hi> of <hi>Troy-novant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon I called a Council aboard, to conſider what was to be done in this imminent extremity. Some adviſed, that it was moſt fit to make to Land, if any knew where to touch without-hazard: Others of more undaunted Spirits, and higher reſolution, adviſed to run the risk of an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to draw our number out of ſight into the Hold, the more to encourage the <hi>Enemy</hi> to a nearer approach; which opinion was generally approved of, and allowed.</p>
            <p>Preſently I gave order for the Sublimation of every <hi>Spark</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53878:6"/>aboard, and for the exhilerating their Spirits, that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary allowance be made inſtantly; <hi>viz.</hi> That one ounce of Tobacco be divided between every two; and as for liquors, let every man that hath them drink what he pleaſe out of his own Guarde Vines.</p>
            <p>Looking about me, not without ſome fear, rais'd by the apprehenſions of danger, a <hi>Taylor</hi> (who had formerly been a Creature of mine) addreſt himſelf to me, whoſe Conſcience being more tender than his Stomach, would needs be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in two points concerning his Souls health, before the fight ſhould begin.</p>
            <p>The firſt was, whether the Cauſe, and Quarrel they were to undertake, were juſtifiable or not, ſince that he ever held <hi>Ludgate,</hi> more worthy than <hi>Newgate,</hi> in divers reſpects?</p>
            <p>And the next was, whether (in caſe he ſhould miſcarry in the action) <hi>Limbus Patrum &amp; Infantum</hi> were not under his own <hi>Shop-board?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Chaplain</hi> over-hearing the <hi>Taylors</hi> conſcientious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions (although he was formerly a Vinegar man, yet ſtill a fellow of excellent <hi>ſharp</hi> apprehenſion) and ſtraining to anſwer theſe Scruples, he could not be heard for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable noiſe of a <hi>Confectioner,</hi> and <hi>Sugar-baker,</hi> who no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bawled up and down (to the great diſheartning of our men) <hi>Sweet meet muſt have ſour ſauce, I ſee;</hi> whereupon to ſtill their clamouring. I was forced to command <hi>Buſhel</hi> (the <hi>Meal-man</hi>) to ſow them up in two ſacks, and to let them breath no otherwiſe, than through the holes the Rats had eaten, and ſo keep them Priſoners till the Fight was ended.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Enemy</hi> approaching nearer and nearer, every one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to his charge; and now juſt as the <hi>Maſter-Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> was ready to let fly (I do not mean for fear) we percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our ſuppoſed <hi>Aſſailant</hi> to be a friend, coming from the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and bound for <hi>Fox-hall;</hi> the men were all very jolly, though ſome of them a little Sea-ſick; they need not hang out any <hi>Colours,</hi> what was in their Faces was ſufficient
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53878:6"/>to declare them what they were: whether they arrived ſafe to their intended Port I know not, and indeed it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for all of us judged the Veſſel to be over <hi>laden,</hi> of which they themſelves were not inſenſible, for we perceived them ever and anon to <hi>caſt over board.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leaving this <hi>Canary-man,</hi> we ſtood away ſtill to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but night coming on, and our <hi>Pilot</hi> careleſs, it hapned that the <hi>Excuſe</hi> was <hi>Stranded:</hi> whereupon the whole <hi>Fleet</hi> was forced to wait upon her till the next Tide, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of which ſhe got off, with greater fear than damage.</p>
            <p>Having again doubled the former allowance (for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter encouraging our men) we ſailed onwards, and in two Watches we diſcerned <hi>Firm land,</hi> lying upon the <hi>Savoyans</hi> Eaſtward from <hi>Lambethana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I immediately man'd out my Long-boat and ſent it aſhore, who in a little time return'd, and inform'd me, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it a ſpacious <hi>Continent,</hi> fit for <hi>Plantation</hi> at four de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees Weſtward from <hi>Terra del Templo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon I reſolved to take moſt of my men with me, and make a further <hi>Diſcovery;</hi> I ſoon found the nature of the climate, it being very temperate, &amp; all accommodations moſt excellent, as long as we had Silver to barter for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, of which they had plenty of all ſorts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Inhabitants</hi> little differ from <hi>Europeans,</hi> and are (like them) very covetous, being over greedy of Silver and Guin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gold, for which we might purchaſe any thing neceſſary, or deſireable, either on the Coaſt, or brought down from the Up land Countries.</p>
            <p>The Palace is a very ſtately Fabrick, and hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly employed for charitable uſes, and ſtill ſerves as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Refuge,</hi> and <hi>Sanctuary</hi> for ſuch, who are either forced by baniſhment, or voluntary Exile, to deſert their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or long lov'd habitations, where they may live obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet take their pleaſure abroad in the Countries round about, by the means of thoſe ſeveral convenient Avenues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> for ſporting on a brave River, the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53878:7"/>Stairs; for the Land, the Great Gate butting Norwards and ſeperated but by a very ſmall Channel from <hi>Exceſtria.</hi> To the Eaſtward there is an outlet which leadeth two ways, the one on the left into the <hi>Dutchy,</hi> the other turning a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on the right, into <hi>Somerſetania;</hi> by the firſt you have a conveyance into the Country called <hi>Maypolia,</hi> and ſo have the whole Country before you to make choice of, by the laſt a ſafe paſſage by water, or a conduct ſhort and commodious through the Provinces of <hi>White-Hart</hi> into <hi>Hortenſia</hi> (vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly called <hi>Covent-Garden</hi>) from whence you may travail through the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Slavonian-women</hi> ſupplied us with Fiſh, and fruits of all ſort, which they bring down in abundance from the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Countries;</hi> in ſo much that we could not fear want of <hi>Proviſion,</hi> ſo long as we had <hi>Money;</hi> nor queſtion our <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,</hi> whilſt we did put our ſelves under the Protection of this place, or of the <hi>Dutchy Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There have been ſome private aſſaults to infringe the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent priviledges hereof, but the <hi>Enemy</hi> moſt commonly came off with conſiderable loſs; ſome hardly eſcaping with their Ears.</p>
            <p>Some have endeavoured to ſurprize the place by a Special <hi>Warrant</hi> and a <hi>Staff,</hi> under the pretence of detecting <hi>Fellons, Traytors,</hi> &amp;c. but when it hath been diſcovered, that this was only a ſtratagem to betray a poor <hi>Debtor,</hi> into the mercileſs hands of his cruel <hi>Creditor,</hi> the <hi>Beacons</hi> have been inſtantly fired, and by only ſaying, an <hi>Arreſt;</hi> the whole Country hath been alarm'd, and the treacherous undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this Countries antient Priviledges have been all ſhamefully put to flight:</p>
            <p>I cannot but commend the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> for ſo doing, they acting herein both charitably and Chriſtianly; although ſome conceited Zealots may accuſe them of Heatheniſm, for imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ethnick cuſtoms in the ſtrange elevation of a May-pole, which ſay they, is the ſame with thoſe antient Wooden Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids dedicated to the honour of the Goddeſs <hi>Flora.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53878:7"/>
            <p>Here among the <hi>Savoyans</hi> we left, <hi>Humfrey Holland, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Draper,</hi> and <hi>Luke Vander-Gooſe, Taylor,</hi> with ſeveral others, to Winter it, and the reſt returned aboard with me; Hereupon I preſently order'd our Anchors to be weighed, having before given notice, by looſing my fore-topſail, that I intended to depart ſpeedily: here we were in a little time under a freſh Gale of Wind, Steering due Eaſt; but the wind chopt about in our teeth, which made us alter our courſe for <hi>Cape-verd,</hi> or <hi>Greens Wharfe,</hi> where landing we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged it quite through on both ſides.</p>
            <p>This Country is very pleaſant; the Inhabitants near the Shore, are a boriſh clowniſh fort of people, having few ſparks of Civility among them, and yet but a little way from them, their Neighbours I may call them, are great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to good breeding.</p>
            <p>Now ſince I have toucht in general on the Character of the Inhabitants, give me leave to diſcourſe in particular, their Humors, Natures, and Diſpoſitions.</p>
            <p>My ſtay being not long in this place, I ſhall lay down my obſervations as brief as I can, and therefore the firſt thing I ſhall acquaint you with is, As ſome of them are over affected with faſhions, and fine cloaths, ſo they are extraordinary conceited of their own ingenuity. In the ſpeculation of their own good parts (as well Male, as Female) every thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to them, ſeems far better then it is, like a <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope</hi> multiplying any minute thing to forty times its bigneſ; ſo opinionative they are, that where ever they appear, they conceive all mens thoughts very idle, that are not buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them: in ſhort, they know themſelves ſo well, that they do not know themſelves at all. They are great pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to wit, nothing being now more <hi>a la mode,</hi> than to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ingenious, if for no other reaſon, than that this <hi>Age</hi> hath out-done all former <hi>Ages</hi> in producing a <hi>Society of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſi;</hi> and yet for all this, they look not on learning as the fewel to the fire of that wit they pretend to, and ſo having but a little, ſpend upon the main ſtock, and in a little time become <hi>Bankrupts.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:53878:8"/>
            <p>They are hugely addicted to quibbling, and will dart out on a ſudden, that which if taken, whilſt warm, may be laught at; but if ſuffer'd to cool, worth nothing.</p>
            <p>Some of them when they have arrived to the height of writing a Song, or Poem (I ſpeak of the Women, as well as the Men, for in this witty Age, womens wit doth peſter too the Stage) I ſay if their fancy ſore ſo high, as to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a meaſur'd line, they never go without it, and in all Companies read it, as if they were inſpired or raptured; then rail at the ignorance and foppery of ſome late ingenious drammatick Writers; and although they can give no reaſon for their Cenſure, yet they think it commendable enough they have done it, and thereby have added much to their own reputation.</p>
            <p>I obſerved among theſe witty men, that nothing muſt ſtop a Jeſt when it is coming, nor friend nor danger, but out it muſt, though their bloods follow after. In ſhort, they think their life is but to <hi>laugh,</hi> and I think to be <hi>laughed at,</hi> being <hi>Wits</hi> in <hi>Jeſt,</hi> and <hi>Fools</hi> in <hi>Earneſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another ſort there are, whoſe whole delight conſiſts in Whoring, Drinking, and Dancing: if any miſchief eſcape theſe men, it is not their fault, for they laid as fair for it as they could. They think that day miſ-ſpent, in which they go ſober to bed; and if they have not made ſome new bawdy diſcovery that day, they can give no account on't.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that they hate more than a ſerious, or a melancholly thought, and if at any time it ſeiſe them, it ſends them to be drunk again, delighting in no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany but Wine, Wenches, and Chyrurgeons.</p>
            <p>Another ſort of people I obſerved, whoſe ſoul and its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties conſiſted in rigging or dreſſing themſelves to the beſt advantage; and that they might not loſe either the benefit of nature or their extraordinary labour, they omit no opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to viſit ſuch publick or private places, where a good ſhape and habit is beſt ſhown: the pointing of their diſcourſe is new ſtudied Oaths, being as curious of them as their faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53878:8"/>their talk is generally of Ladies, and ſuch like pretty Toys, and do take a wonderful delight in repeating ſome paſſages in Plays, which with a grace they utter, even to <hi>ſelf-admiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wonder theſe people are not deafned with the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al noiſe of Coaches, the dead of night being not exempted from their confuſed rattling; ſince I have read that the fall of <hi>Nile</hi> (called the <hi>Cataracts</hi>) deafens with its noiſe the people ſeven miles round: theſe Coaches are almoſt as nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as the people. But they have another way of carriage called a <hi>Sedan,</hi> which I ſhould highly commend for its eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, were I as Gouty and Pocky as their firſt <hi>Founders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not detain you with more Characters, onely I will tell you how afrighted I was upon my firſt coming aſhore, meeting with a thing in glorious habit but with a face as black as Hell; I took her to be ſome <hi>She-Devil</hi> had loſt her infernal <hi>Sweet-heart,</hi> and thought to have found him here in ſome <hi>carnal diſguiſe;</hi> had ſhe cry'd bough as I came near her, ſhe had undoubtedly frightned my wits from making theſe diſcoveries; but let us leave her with a ſoul as black within, as her face is without, ſhrowded by that Diabolical invention the <hi>Vizard-mask,</hi> the abſolute Pimp to her ſecret leacherous contrivances.</p>
            <p>Laſtly you are to take notice, that this place (beſides other goodly beaſts of all ſorts) is famous for <hi>Harts,</hi> whoſe horns are of the comlieſt branch and ſpreading that can be; whoſe dimenſion and extenſion is unfathomable, ſo that in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them, we agreed to call the lower part of this Country <hi>Harts born Alley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To give this place its laſt encomium, let me tell you, that the conſtitution of the Air agreeth beſt with ſuch that are in a ſingle condition: the youth here have an unlimited free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, eſpecially ſuch who are known and try'd to be men of <hi>great natural parts,</hi> although they have but <hi>ſlender under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings:</hi> whereby ſome of them can afford to ſpend five hundred pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> although their whole genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53878:9"/>before them never ſaw ſo many ſhillings of their own: and that their ſtrength may be throughly diſcovered, and their native vigour known before they are admitted as <hi>Meni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi> for venerial Service, ſome <hi>Chamber-maid</hi> muſt take them to task, who ſhall make report what meer Nature hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, without the help of jellies, or any ſuch like provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe before they are admitted into this lulling, yet labouring employ, Tobacco, and frequent Drunkenneſs is abſolutely forbidden by their Miſtreſſes, they well knowing how much the one exhauſts the radical moiſture, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weakens and debilitates the ſtrongeſt conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Men that are married live here very well too, provided they have obtain'd the gift of ſeeing, and not ſeeing when they pleaſe; and ſuch who give the greateſt freedom to their wives to be courted <hi>abroad,</hi> ſhall have at home the greater <hi>in-some.</hi> This is held as a Maxim among them, the handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the wife, the greater trade, and if ſhe be a grain too light, with prudence and good management, it will add weight to her husbands concerns, And therefore an handſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtanding at the door, will attract more Cuſtomers than a gaudy gilded ſign, fetter'd with a Tun of Iron, which coſt the value of a riſing <hi>Scavenger</hi>'s whole Eſtate.</p>
            <p>But we have dwelt too long upon this ſubject, and in this place, and therefore it is time to give you a farther account of our <hi>Voyage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Cape-Verd</hi> we ſailed, keeping our Courſe due South, and about four days after our departure, we made Land, but could not tell what part of the world it belonged unto, at length we eſpied floating Timber, with deal boards piled on the <hi>Bank-ſide,</hi> which made ſome of us conclude it was <hi>Norway;</hi> but that opinion was ſoon blown away by the ſight of a monſirous tall bulky thing, which ſeem'd to us to wave his hat about his head, and that way induce us to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore; whilſt from his guts proceeded a confuſed hideous noiſe, but from the found we could not underſtand a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53878:9"/>the more we ſtared hereon, the more did our admiration en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; fear made us ſtand at a diſtance, and yet we were ſo near that we could look into his very entrals, his belly being wide open, and could perceive a very ſtrange motion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whilſt his arms were continually agitated circularly, we knew not what to think, but at length it was agreed on all hands, that this Country muſt be <hi>Denmark,</hi> and that this monſtrous creature was one of the Iſſue of the Giant <hi>Colbron,</hi> who there ſtood with his arms abroad, bidding defiance to all that paſt that way.</p>
            <p>Fear did ſo wing our flight, and the wind ſo largely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed its aſſiſtance, that in a little time we found our ſelves not in a condition to be harm'd or prejudiced by that Gigant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Scare-crow: had we had as much valour as there was in <hi>Don-Quixot,</hi> one aſſault would have prov'd him a meer <hi>airy flaſh,</hi> and could do nothing but cry, <hi>ſaw, ſaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were no ſooner freed from this ſight, but we encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred another, which appeared no leſs terrible than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer at firſt ſight; but approaching ſomewhat nearer, ſome of our men having ſeen it before, knew it to be a floating Iſland, called the Summer Iſland, or <hi>Scoti Moria;</hi> it is an Iſland not ſo great, but that in leſs than four and twenty hours we ſail'd it round; it is much longer than it is broad, but how many leagues the length may be, I cannot tell, for I took not its dimenſion: it lies in the midſt of <hi>Golpho de Thame-Iſis:</hi> The <hi>Chriſtian-ſhore</hi> lying to the <hi>Norward,</hi> and the <hi>Turkiſh-ſhore</hi> to the <hi>Southward,</hi> bounded to the <hi>Eaſtward</hi> with <hi>Pont-Troynovant,</hi> but to the <hi>Weſtward</hi> thereof, you may ſail up the <hi>Streights</hi> till you go as far as <hi>Maiden-head,</hi> and farther, croſſing the <hi>Equinoctial-line.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our circumferating this <hi>Floating Summer-Iſland,</hi> we took ſpecial notice of its ingreſſes, but with our ſtricteſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagation we could find but two, one lying to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the other to the Weſtward, for the more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient reception of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Barbarian Amazons,</hi> who in the Summer time conſtantly repair thither, to meet with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53878:10"/>their <hi>Bully-Huffs</hi> and <hi>Hectors</hi> to generate withall.</p>
            <p>A Council was held to conſult which <hi>Port</hi> was ſafeſt to land at; the one we found guarded with <hi>Knights of the Blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apron,</hi> with <hi>Pet-guns</hi> mounted, and charged, and their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes like Linſtocks were ready to fire them; hereupon we ſtood off, and made to the other <hi>Port,</hi> whereupon we eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a white Apron, as a <hi>Flag of Truce,</hi> diſplaying it ſelf over the belly of a delicate woman, who came thither <hi>Procreandi cauſâ;</hi> that colour we looked on as the Emblem of Peace, and thereupon hoiſting out my Long-boat, I ſelected ſome of my principal men aboard, and went aſhore, where I was received with all demonſtrations of Civility and Reſpect.</p>
            <p>Their Language, I and my Company underſtood very well, for it was the <hi>Lingua Franck</hi> which they ſpoke.</p>
            <p>The greateſt thing that I wondred at was, that inſtead of treading on the ſurface of their Earth, we immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into the bowels of their Country; it ſomwhat ſtartled us to think where we were going, and now I thought of <hi>Aeneas</hi> his deſcent to Hell, and wiſht we might eſcape but half as well.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Myrmidons</hi> followed me cloſe at heels, but Oh how we ſhook when we heard the <hi>Thunder</hi> from above, and we had lightning too before we went from thence.</p>
            <p>I askt them the reaſon of this ſudden thundring noiſe, hearing not the leaſt without? Sir, ſaid one, The <hi>Naides</hi> are above playing at Nine-pins, and you may make one if you pleaſe: I in modeſty refuſed, as thinking my ſelf unfit company for Gods and Goddeſſes.</p>
            <p>Looking about me I ſaw a lovely face, and every thing (to outward view) thereunto correſponding, I preſently imagined her one of the <hi>Cyprian Dames waiting Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who had given her <hi>Lady</hi> the ſlip, to injoy her greater liberty and freedome; upon which ſuggeſtion I accoſted her, and found her pliable beyond expectation, and therefore gave her an invitation into my <hi>Tent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I askt her divers queſtions, amongſt the reſt, whether ſhe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53878:10"/>were an <hi>Inhabitant</hi> of this <hi>Iſle?</hi> ſhe anſwered no, but a <hi>Weſtmonaſterian;</hi> the reſolution of my queſtion made me more inquiſitive than before, to know what this <hi>Monaſteria</hi> was, and where it lay: but according to the Cuſtome of <hi>Lambethana,</hi> I thought it civility firſt to drink, before we entred further into Diſcourſe; whereupon I called one of the baſer ſort of people to me, and bid him procure me ſome of the beſt Liquors of their Country, if they would take <hi>Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Carolina</hi> in Exchange; gladly, gladly, ſaid this <hi>Scoti Morian,</hi> and in a trice brought me a Liquor, that differ'd not at all in taſte, from what is brewed at <hi>Lambethana,</hi> and every whit as ſmall: the <hi>Vice Roy</hi> of the <hi>Iſle</hi> condeſcended ſo low, as to bring me (<hi>propria perſonâ)</hi> a Bottle of <hi>Red ſtuff;</hi> when I taſted it, methought I could have ſworn it was Claret, <hi>that's flat:</hi> I bad him bring me ſome other Wine, which he did, but I found it was a <hi>Spaniard rack'd to death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſoon gather'd from this pittiful pimping <hi>Vice Roy,</hi> that his whole Country could not afford one drop of ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, but what was imported to him at extraordinary rates, by Merchants of other Countries; nay, he had ſcarce any Water in his whole <hi>Dominion,</hi> but what flowed about it; for which cauſe he had concav'd his whole Iſle, and turn'd it, as I may ſay, into a Cellar to contain what comfortable Liquors, and other things ſhould be brought him: What Commodities he returns in exchange I know not; for I ſaw none, but what were wrapt up in Silken petticoats, which like a Pig in a Poke you muſt buy, or not at all.</p>
            <p>Well the Inhabitants are a lazy ſort of people, and not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Tillage; and yet ſometimes they will <hi>plow with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Heifer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are to be commended for Lovers of <hi>Paſture,</hi> and yet you ſhall not ſee a <hi>green ſpot</hi> in their whole <hi>Land,</hi> but what covers the belly of the <hi>Vice Roy's Lady,</hi> or his <hi>Billiard-Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, they are a wicked people, delighting in, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on the ſins of others; ſo lazy, that they will not work;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53878:11"/>their whole employment is drinking; <hi>Tobacco</hi> ſerves to air them after a waſhing, and is their only <hi>breath</hi> and <hi>breathing while.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The entertainment of the place I liked not, and therefore I reſolved to haſten from thence, only I firſt deſired to be ſatisfied as to the Country aforeſaid, called <hi>Weſtmonaſteria;</hi> whereupon I demanded of this <hi>Lady Errant</hi> an information herein.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid ſhe, It lyeth to the Weſtward of <hi>Pallatium Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale,</hi> which place is too ſplendent for common eyes to behold, and too virtuous for vulgar breath to prophane.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Weſtmonaſteria</hi> (although the place of my nativity) I cannot deſcribe perfectly, only I can tell you, it pleads great antiquity, and is very famous for a wonderful ſtructure once called the <hi>Temple of Apoll,</hi> beſides it is beautified with the ſtately ſtructures of many <hi>Noble-Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Gentry</hi> live in all manner of pleaſure imaginable, but the <hi>Plebeians</hi> delight is very uncertain, being always upon the extreams, having either too much buſineſs to do, or too little.</p>
            <p>For there are four <hi>Seaſons of the Year,</hi> which are as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Marts</hi> for the <hi>Weſtmonaſterians;</hi> the chiefeſt <hi>Commodity</hi> that then is ſold there, is only <hi>Words,</hi> only the <hi>Buyers</hi> and <hi>Sellers</hi> beſtow their Money now and then in ſomewhat that is more ſubſtantial, to keep out the wind.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Seaſons</hi> are called <hi>Terms,</hi> at which times there is great reſort of people coming from all parts of that great and glorious Kingdom, called formerly by the name of <hi>Druina,</hi> of which <hi>Troynovant</hi> is the Metropolis.</p>
            <p>Theſe people repair to a great and famous ſtructure, called <hi>Aula Weſtmonaſterienſis,</hi> and are diſtinguiſhed by ſeveral names and titles: Their habit is as ſtrange as their Speech, and both concur to amuze, and amaze the people.</p>
            <p>They are very litigious, and never better pleaſed than in a hurly burly of cavils and diſſentions: ever more delighting to fiſh in troubled Waters.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53878:11"/>
            <p>One would think that there is a great analogy between the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of theſe men, and a <hi>Taylor;</hi> for they are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at <hi>making Suits,</hi> which ſome after endeavouring to mend, mar them quite: ſome know how to <hi>begin a Suit,</hi> but are ignorant how to <hi>finiſh it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or they may in ſome reſpect be compared to the <hi>Camelion,</hi> ſince no creature lives more by the air than they; for as there are a ſort of people (according to report) which can ſell a wind to a Sailer; ſo theſe men will not part with their breath without a reward.</p>
            <p>Having bauld themſelves out of breath, and half ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd to death, ſome of them withdraw into <hi>Hell,</hi> there to cool and refreſh themſelves; one would think it a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper place for that purpoſe, and yet 'tis true, where ſuch good entertainment is to be had, that this <hi>Hell</hi> hath ever had a greater eſtimation than its neighbouring <hi>Heaven;</hi> I have been in 60th, and had rather eat <hi>Barley-broath</hi> in the one, than drink <hi>Canary</hi> in the other.</p>
            <p>She would have proceeded but that this <hi>Amazon</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away, and ſo we loſt the benefit of a further <hi>Diſcovery:</hi> having paid the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of this <hi>Floating Summer-Iſland,</hi> we departed: I call it a <hi>Summer-Iſland,</hi> becauſe it is never ſeen in this <hi>Golpho de Thamiſis</hi> in the <hi>Winter;</hi> for cold froſty weather will be the ruine of it, and therefore as Swallows and Cuckoos are never ſeen in this Country, but in <hi>Summer,</hi> ſo this <hi>Iſland</hi> always takes its choice of the Summer ſeaſon for its appearance.</p>
            <p>And as ſome fiſhes retire into the Concaves of rocks, upon the approach of cold weather, ſo this <hi>Scoti Moria</hi> abſconds or hides it ſelf within ſome narrow gut of the <hi>Inland-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and crawls out again in fair and warm weather.</p>
            <p>Not long after our departure, the Air ſerene and clear, and the wind at <hi>Weſt,</hi> we deſcried a <hi>Sail;</hi> hereupon I ordered the <hi>Decks</hi> to be clear'd, and the <hi>Hammocks</hi> to be cut down; and having quarter'd my men moſt advantagiouſly for fight, we bore up to this ſuppoſed <hi>Man of War,</hi> and hail'd her; at
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53878:12"/>firſt they return'd us very rough language, but in fine, they told us they were a people called <hi>Sanguinarii,</hi> and came from <hi>Holbornia,</hi> and were bound for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſina,</hi> called by the Natives the <hi>Bear Garden,</hi> in <hi>Barbary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being deſirous to make farther Diſcoveries, we agreed to bear this Ship Company to this ſtrange Land: by the way we askt them what they intended to do with thoſe <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieldian Lyons</hi> they carried with them; they told us, that it was cuſtomary for the <hi>Vice Roy</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſina</hi> frequently to iſſue out his <hi>Proclamations,</hi> ſummoning, or inviting all ſtrangers whatſoever to come freely into his <hi>Territories,</hi> and there participate with him in ſuch ſports, as he hath appointed for the Recreation of the People.</p>
            <p>This report incouraged us to proceed, and having a fair wind and a freſh gale, we quickly arrived at our intended <hi>Port.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Landing, we forth with directed our courſe to the famous <hi>Vrſina,</hi> in our way we overtook great droves of <hi>forreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> reſorting to this place to act their parts with <hi>Staff and Tayl;</hi> here were the <hi>Barriers</hi> of <hi>Holbornia,</hi> and <hi>Chapel Blanck;</hi> the <hi>Sanguinaries</hi> of the <hi>Forum</hi> near <hi>Nova Janua</hi> (by ſome called the <hi>Whit</hi>) and of the <hi>Forum</hi> near <hi>Via Lactea,</hi> commonly called <hi>Milk-ſtreet:</hi> hither alſo repaired the <hi>People of Cheap Orient,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Smithfieldians,</hi> and <hi>Fieldlanians,</hi> with <hi>Ruffins,</hi> and <hi>Ragga-Muffins,</hi> all which, or moſt, are ſubjects unto a <hi>Slavenian King,</hi> called <hi>Brute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We had not travel'd far, before we eſpied a <hi>Larg Flag</hi> to give notice to ſtrangers, where the <hi>Games</hi> were to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated; coming to the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Vrſina,</hi> we could not get entrance, till we had paid the <hi>Tribute</hi> the <hi>Vice Roy</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to demand.</p>
            <p>It ſeems this <hi>Vice Roy</hi> hath little other revenue, than what comes in by this <hi>Tax</hi> or <hi>Tribute;</hi> and therefore, not ſo much for ſport, as profit, he often publiſheth his <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> to congregate the People, and ſo <hi>concur</hi> with him in his <hi>Beſtial Entertainments.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:53878:12"/>
            <p>Before the Sport begins, the <hi>Vice Roy</hi> treats at their own charge, whoſoever will come into his Cellar, where the <hi>charge</hi> and <hi>ſhot</hi> of five ſhillings is as quickly diſpatcht, as the <hi>diſcharge</hi> of a <hi>Piſtol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>People</hi> being all placed in this <hi>Amphitheatre,</hi> as many almoſt, and as ſtrange Beaſts are let out promiſcuouſly, as were formerly in the <hi>Ark.</hi> There was a great and ſtrong beaſt called by the name of one of the <hi>Signs</hi> of the <hi>Zodiack, Taurus;</hi> a creature far more terrible than the <hi>Colcheſter Bull</hi> of old: for as he ſtately walkt defying all opponents with his horns, ſo on a ſudden came an cruption of fire from his ſide, with a report, as if his <hi>Ribs</hi> had been converted into <hi>Carbines: Phalaris</hi> his <hi>Bull</hi> was never half ſo hot as this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, to all the Spectators admiration; at the ſame time two <hi>Creatures</hi> (which borrowed their names from two <hi>Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Vrſa Major,</hi> and <hi>Vrſa Minor</hi>) to avoid the fire, ran full drive at two <hi>Cornucopians</hi> (vulgarly Staggs) who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſhun by flight the approaching danger of theſe ill ſhapen, terrible <hi>Creatures,</hi> had like to have diſmounted <hi>Monſieur Simea,</hi> that little dapper Gentleman, who was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly acting his <hi>Buffoonries</hi> in this <hi>Amphitheatre;</hi> his Horſe having more underſtanding than himſelf (and being very apprehenſive of the danger) did preſently riſe before, and yerking out his hinder leggs to keep off the <hi>Cornucopians</hi> from goring his ſides, gave poor <hi>Tom Dove</hi> ſuch a bang on the Ribs, that he roar'd like the <hi>Lyons</hi> in the <hi>Tower:</hi> this noiſe alarm'd the <hi>Canes</hi> and <hi>Caniculi,</hi> (a ſort of dogs whoſe names I cannot well remember) who came running in, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking what's the matter, fell in <hi>tooth</hi> and <hi>nail; Luponi</hi> ſeeing this, was at his wits ends, not knowing what to do, or whither to fly; but <hi>Vulpone</hi> being the craftier of the two, skulkt into a by Corner, keeping himſelf out of harms way, nor could any means remove him from his reſolved Station. The <hi>Vrſinians,</hi> with <hi>Bear-herds</hi> and others, did now begin to beſtir themſelves, being as much buſied as their Beaſts, and every whit in as ſtinking a condition: after a great Cry
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53878:13"/>and little Wool, with a great noiſe to little purpoſe, the Company was diſmiſt, and every man had permiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to his own Country, excepting only ſuch as were reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a <hi>Prey,</hi> for the great <hi>White Lyon,</hi> belonging to the <hi>King of Marſhelſia;</hi> the cruelty of which Tyrant we had ſufficiently heard of, which made us with greater ſpeed to remove out of his <hi>Territories:</hi> whereupon we all went on board, not miſſing a man, and ſtanding away to the <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> we ſailed ſo far, till we came to a <hi>Ne plus ultra,</hi> and by the great fall and hideous noiſe of the Waters, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded we were arrived near that <hi>Gulph,</hi> which Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> ſhot, when he went to viſit the <hi>Antipodes:</hi> as for my part I had not finiſht my buſineſs in this <hi>World,</hi> and till that was done, I had no mind to viſit another.</p>
            <p>All under my command were of the ſame opinion, and therefore we reſolved to return; and to favour our deſign, the Wind veerd about to <hi>South</hi> and by <hi>Eaſt;</hi> hereupon we ſhaped our courſe <hi>Norwards,</hi> without diſcovering any thing remarkable for a great while, only we met with by the way ſome <hi>Turks</hi> coming from <hi>Jetland,</hi> and bound for <hi>Cole-Harbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The nineteenth of <hi>June</hi> we met with ſeveral <hi>Men-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids,</hi> ſwiming and ſporting up and down: We were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that they are <hi>Amphibii,</hi> and will live both on the land, and in the Water.</p>
            <p>Here we only ſaw the Males of theſe <hi>Sea-wonders,</hi> but up higher in the <hi>Straits mouth,</hi> there are <hi>Female Mermaids,</hi> which take their opportunities to delight themſelves in ſwiming, but are mighty ſhie, and therefore chooſe the night for their paſtime.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I was in a ſerious contemplation of theſe Creatures, one of our men cry'd out, <hi>Land,</hi> at which we were all over joy'd: and that we might be certainly aſſured hereof, our <hi>Pilot</hi> (the aforeſaid <hi>Spectacle-maker</hi>) drew out his <hi>Perſpective,</hi> with which he confirmed our joys.</p>
            <p>Hereupon we directed our courſe to this <hi>Land,</hi> and in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53878:13"/>three Watches we came to an Anchor in <hi>White-Fryars Bay,</hi> and ſoon after landed, and were very civily received by the Inhabitants, who attended us on the ſhore.</p>
            <p>We askt them the name of the <hi>Country,</hi> who told us that formerly it had been called <hi>Lupania,</hi> or by ſome <hi>Vulpinia,</hi> but its later and trueſt appellation was <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> or <hi>Ramallia;</hi> but the Dutch-men call it <hi>Ramy-kins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The grumbling of our diſſatisfied guts, would not permit us to ask more queſtions, and indeed if we had, we ſhould not have been heard for their croaking noiſe; which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants underſtanding without more ceremony conducted us to their <hi>Metropolis</hi> or chiefe City, where by the <hi>Governor</hi> and his <hi>Aſſiſtants,</hi> we were very well entertain'd.</p>
            <p>The next day we were ſhown the Antiquities, Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and ſtrength of this <hi>City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now give me leave to acquaint you with my Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> or <hi>Ramallia,</hi> lyeth contiguous to <hi>Terra del Templo,</hi> the <hi>Fleta</hi> lying at ſome diſtance thereof to the <hi>North-Eaſt:</hi> In the Deſcription of this <hi>Ramallia,</hi> I muſt look into <hi>Terra del Templo,</hi> but ſhall not pry into its <hi>Court,</hi> nor any the ſtanding houſes, the <hi>Houſe-keepers</hi> lodging nor into the menial precincts of the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> farther, than they ſtand for <hi>Refuge</hi> and <hi>Relief</hi> of the neighbouring <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> about them.</p>
            <p>And indeed (ſince the general purgation by fire) the firſt, and chiefeſt of all, which for advantage of ground; for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, for <hi>Water works, Poſterns, Paſſages, Supplies,</hi> and proviſions by land, or otherwiſe, is that ſo far fam'd and ſo fitly nam'd <hi>Ramallia:</hi> In it are ſeveral Garriſons of old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, every one of the which is able to lead a whole Army of Younger Debtors.</p>
            <p>They call their Muſter-role in the <hi>Round Church,</hi> which might more properly be called their <hi>Corps du Guard;</hi> then they draw them out into the <hi>Cloyſters,</hi> and either exerciſe them there, or in the <hi>Garden,</hi> which is an excellent <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Spot</hi> for that purpoſe; but under the <hi>Blowers</hi> in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53878:14"/>
               <hi>Rum Stampers</hi> (called the <hi>Kings Bench walks</hi>) they pitch their ſet Battles, where every evening that ground (which was liſted in, and level'd for their uſe) is fil'd with men of deſperate or undaunted reſolution.</p>
            <p>The firſt work in <hi>Ramallia,</hi> is rais'd and contrived in the form of a <hi>Ram;</hi> there is no other reaſon I can render for it, but that <hi>Rams</hi> were of great uſe in the <hi>Jewiſh Diſcipline,</hi> for Batteries, as you may read in <hi>Joſephus his Hiſtory</hi> more at large.</p>
            <p>This work is of reaſonable ſtrength; in former times it had a watch Tower in the ſimilitude of a Coblers ſhop ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, from whence all the forces about are called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon the leaſt approach of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>There is another, called the <hi>Maiden-head,</hi> and is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, where the Enemy dares not come within ſhot, and is the neareſt to the confines of <hi>Terra del Templo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are other pretty contrived Platforms, as <hi>Teſte Royal,</hi> the <hi>Falcon, Mitre, &amp;c.</hi> and theſe in the faſhion and form of Cook-ſhops; where if a <hi>Setter</hi> or Spy chance to peep in at them (though very dark) they will make him pay for the roaſt, before he depart.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Ramallia,</hi> or <hi>Ramy-kins,</hi> belongs a very great Fleet, conſiſting of many Sail, well man'd, and are a great preſervation to the <hi>Ramy-kins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This place, according to the late Geographieal Map, as well as the report of antient Writers, cannot poſſibly be ſo beſieged, but that they within may go in and out at their pleaſure, without impeachment; for at the <hi>Middle-Temple</hi> Gate, they iſſue in ſpight of the Devil; at the <hi>Inner-Temple</hi> Gate, they fear no colours in the Rain-bow; and at the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern of the <hi>Ramy-kins,</hi> in caſe they cannot make over to <hi>Fetter-lane,</hi> but diſcover Ambuſcado's, they need only draw their bodies within guard of Pike, turn faces about, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat through the <hi>Mitre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now admit they ſtand for <hi>Rio del Plata</hi> (commonly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Fleet ſtreet</hi>) and be ſo intercepted that they cannot reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53878:14"/>the <hi>Ramy-kins,</hi> all that is required in that caſe, is but to mend their March; fall downward, as if they gave way, ſuddenly diſcharge their right-hand file, and fall eaſily into Sergeants Inn; where by antient Treaty had between this famous place, and <hi>Terra del Templo,</hi> it was agreed, That the parties in ſuch diſtreſs might (paying a ſmall Fee) have convoy and conveyance without the re-hazzard of any of their perſons.</p>
            <p>If at any time they had a mind to Forrage, they are no ſooner out of the <hi>Middle Temple</hi> Gate, but there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold way to defend them; the <hi>Bell</hi>-Inn, the <hi>Bar</hi> Gate, and <hi>Shire</hi>-lane. The paſſage through the <hi>Rum Stampers</hi> under the <hi>Blowers,</hi> is a moſt excellent ſafe way for cloſe contriving and retriving: neither is the Gardners Wharſage (as the Tide may ſerve) any ways inconſiderable.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak the truth, the nature of <hi>Ramallia</hi> is much alter'd in few years, neither is the place ſo much frequented as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by Forreigners for Refuge, the Inhabitants ſlighting or being careleſs in the preſervation of their antient Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
            <p>This place in former time was very populous, in ſuch ſort, that they were forced to ſend their people abroad into For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Plantations, of which they had, and have ſtill ſome very conſiderable, for Example, <hi>Milford-lane, Fulwoods Rents, Baldwins-Garden, Great St. Bartholomews,</hi> the <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Mountague-cleſe,</hi> with divers others; I ſhall thus run them over, as I have nam'd them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Milford-lane</hi> was at firſt taken by indigent Officers and their Companies, who coming hither and liking the ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, did there erect divers works, both to the Land and Water ſide, for their ſecurity.</p>
            <p>As they came in by conqueſt, ſo they hold it by the ſword, and not withſtanding their title hath been much diſputed heretofore, yet they have now commuted the matter, prov'd Plantation, and have withal reduced it to a moſt abſolute Hance and free Town of it ſelf, without dependency.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53878:15"/>
            <p>The chiefeſt benefit they have for ſecuring their perſons, is by Water, for to the land there is little ſafety, when they are once without their works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fulwoods Rents</hi> I could never well approve of for a place of Refuge, it lies ſo on the Main Continent, and therefore requires the ſtricter watch, and yet with the greateſt care cannot lie ſafe.</p>
            <p>At the upper end of theſe Rents, and at the very Portall of <hi>Purpool</hi> Palace weſtward, was a moſt excellent piece of work begun, which had it not been interrupted by thoſe that <hi>Play'd</hi> upon it from <hi>Above;</hi> queſtionleſs it had been the ſtrongeſt and ſureſt Hold that ever was raiſed within the Continent for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Back-gate into <hi>Graies-Inn lane,</hi> with the benefit of <hi>Bauldwins</hi> Gardens is of excellent uſe; but the paſſages through certain Inns on the Field-ſide, are not attempted without hazard, by reaſon of the ſtraggling Troops of the Enemy, who lie Purdue in every Ale-houſe thereabouts.</p>
            <p>The ſafeſt way of Sally, is that through the Walks, from whence the Red-Lyon in <hi>Graies-Inn-lane</hi> receives them with good quartering, and paſſes them through the back way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Main Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bauldwins</hi> Gardens is a Fortreſs of conſiderable ſtrength, being much embelliſht of late, and the Pavement near the Battlements is renewed, ſo that the Defendants may march much more commodiouſly to the Breaſt-works; the <hi>Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls</hi> or <hi>Tenter-hooks</hi> have made ſeveral attempts to ſtorm this Fortreſs, but have commonly come off with conſiderable loſs, and though notable Shavers have not come off ſo trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that they were forced to make their eſcape through the <hi>Bog-houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a famous Cittadel belonging to the <hi>Ramy-kins,</hi> but long ſince ſurprized and taken in by the Enemy, it ſtill retains the name of <hi>Great St. Bartholomews,</hi> upon whoſe Platform a whole Army of Borrowers and Book-men might have been muſtred and drawn out in length, or into what
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53878:15"/>form or figure it had pleaſed them to caſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>What works, yea what variety of Art and Workmanſhip was within it? What an excellent half-Moon was there caſt up without it, for defence to the Eaſtward? What excellent Sconces, in the faſhion of Tobacco-ſhops and Ale-houſes in all parts of it.</p>
            <p>But alas theſe are demoliſht, for the moſt part, the old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers diſcharg'd, and all delivered up into the hand of the Enemy upon compoſition.</p>
            <p>The frequent aſſaults that have been made upon St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> have rendred the place incapable of holding out longer, ſo that the band of Borrowers there billeted are disbanded and diſmiſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fryers Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Cruciate,</hi> Black, White and Gray, had all their Cowls pull'd or'e their heads, and were for the moſt part led into the City captive, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to this day.</p>
            <p>It is believed by moſt of the Sword-men thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that theſe places had ne'r been loſt, had they not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd thoſe of the freedom to dwell among them, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and multiplyed after that wonderful manner, that by their general planting, they ſupplanted the Nobility and Gentry which upheld their Liberties, and in the end engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the power of Office, Truſt and Authority into their hands, and thereby did ſet open the Gates to let the Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men of the Mace to enter and ſurprize all.</p>
            <p>The Commanders of the City were only content upon Treaty, to article and agree with thoſe of the <hi>Black-Fryers,</hi> that not withſtanding they ſo entred upon Conqueſt, yet the old Companions, eſpecially the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Feather makers, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Taylors, and the <hi>French</hi> Shoo-makers, with ſome Forreign Forces, ſhould enjoy their antient priviledges without moleſtation or interruption, or any other that will manfully fight for their antient rights and cuſtoms.</p>
            <p>To the Northward of the <hi>Black-Friers,</hi> lies a very ſtrong and formidable Cittadel belonging to the Enemy, ſtanding
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53878:16"/>on the brow of an Hill, which ſcours all the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about.</p>
            <p>This Cittadel is guarded like <hi>Marſelles</hi> wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This place is ſo remarkable I cannot paſs it by without a ſmall deſcription.</p>
            <p>It is much like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> better for ſight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out than in; Its who<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e proſpect from within, are Iron grates, where through every Tranſen, the forlorn Captives may take a view of the Iron <hi>Age;</hi> there is one ſingle entrance, which like Hells Gate, lets many in, but few out, turn once the Ward— <hi>Et veſtigia nulla retrorſum.</hi> The Cimmerians in their dwellings reſemble theſe in their lodgings, only their lights are different; thoſe receive ſome ſcatter'd beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings by their Mountain Crannies; theſe by their diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late loopholes:</p>
            <p>Yet from above, the Inhabitants may take a view of all thoſe places which club'd to their reſtraint: and be remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the loſs of time which brought them thither. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour here of is careleſs whence they come, but infinitely cautious how they go away; and if they go away without his favour, they are in great danger to break their necks for their labour.</p>
            <p>This place holds as much as the world; all its inhabitants are either good or bad; here is a good Priſoner, and he makes contemplation his refection; nothing can confine him, becauſe he finds nothing fit to entertain him which Earth can afford him: here is a fat ſenſual Priſoner, who is content with any place that may belul his clowdy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in a careleſs ſleep, freedom and bondage are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently equal to his fruitleſs pilgrimage; here is the lean Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, who one would think had procured ſuch a divorce from his fleſh, as if he had only enter'd into covenant with his ſpirit; whoſe weak exhauſted feature proceeding from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective reverſions of a trencher, merits pity, bearing the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53878:16"/>of his renury in the dying colours of his Phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. To be out at Elbows here is to be in faſhion, it being a great indecorum not to be thread-bare.</p>
            <p>Every man ſhews here like ſo many wracks on the Sea, here the ribs of five hundred pound, here the relick of a ſhop well furniſhed, and a good portion with his Wife. The Company one with the other, is but a vying of complaints, and the cauſes they have to rail at fortune &amp; fool themſelves, and there is a great deal of good fellowſhip in this. The mirth of this place is but feigned, where over a large doſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep themſelves from themſelves, and ſo drown the torment of thinking what they have been. They huddle up their lives as a thing of no uſe, and wear it out like an old ſuit, the faſter the better; and he that deceives the time beſt, beſt ſpends it.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I ſhould ſpeak ſom what of <hi>Mountagues cloſe,</hi> but that I think it doth not properly belong to the <hi>Ramy-kins,</hi> and therefore I ſhall deſiſt, and give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what the nature and diſpoſition of theſe people are which appertain to <hi>Ramallia,</hi> or the <hi>Ramy-kins,</hi> with the Territories thereunto belonging, as alſo what thoſe people are that fight againſt them.</p>

                  <hi>The manners and diſpoſitions of the</hi> Ramallians, <hi>with their</hi> Religion, Laws, <hi>and</hi> Cuſtoms.</head>
               <p>THey are a wandring ſort of people who like the <hi>Tartars,</hi> never abide long in a place, but remove often, carrying all that they have about them.</p>
               <p>They are very fearful and cautelous, and dangerous to be dealt withall; and you cannot affront them worſe, than to bring any Mace by way of barter, for they hate it worſe than a <hi>Jew</hi> Swines fleſh.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53878:17"/>
               <p>You may know them from any other people by theſe marks following.</p>
               <p>If any of them have occaſion to walk into the Imperial City, to be ſure at the lanes end he looks behind him, and after he hath turned out of ſight he mends his pace in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary degree of footmanſhip, till he hath gain'd ſome ground of the followers; and then he makes another ſtand, to take notice whether any of them have arrived thither with more than ordinary ſpeed, or precipitate himſelf at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about at the Lanes end, which he knows to be the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign of the Enemies beſetting him.</p>
               <p>He loves variety of apparel, and hates (if he have it) to be known long in a Suit; ask him the queſtion, and he will give you an account of all the Taverns with back-doors, eſpecially ſuch which lead to the water ſide; and envies the encreaſe of the Moon more then the decreaſe of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
               <p>He is a great enemy to idleneſs, for he loves not to ſee one leaning on a Stall, or looking about him, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure whiſtling after Candle light.</p>
               <p>They may be paralel'd with the Jews, who are a mixt people born in ſeveral places, yet coming from one ſtock, and are as much Inhdels occaſioned by the Infidelity of others.</p>
               <p>They pray not in common form, but that the Commons may meet in form aſoreſaid; and no ſin ſticks ſo cloſe to their Conſciences, as that they ever paid any thing to their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors in part.</p>
               <p>As for their Religion I can ſpeak little of it; only this, they believe liberty to be Heaven, Money the Guardian An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel that conducts them thither: They hold there is a local Hell, which is placed in the Center of a Priſon, and their Creditors the Devils which torment them; they believe there are ſeveral Purgatories, the principal whereof do lie in <hi>Woodſtreet</hi> and in <hi>Grocers</hi> Alley, where Paying inſtead of Praying gives deliverance.</p>

               <p>And now it is high time to relate who are the Enemies to theſe <hi>Ramy-kins</hi> or <hi>Ramallians,</hi> who implacably aſſault them upon all occaſions.</p>
               <p>Within <hi>London</hi> there are two Regiments of <hi>Macemen,</hi> the one is encamped in the <hi>Poultry,</hi> the other in <hi>Woodſtreet;</hi> at both which places there are great numbers attending their Colours, where they are ever ready to ſally upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm or ſignal given; others of them guard their Colonels perſon by turns; the reſt are appointed and expoſed as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>Some of the beſt able and moſt truſty of the Cavalry (as their ſervice requires, and eſpecially in Term time) are planted at <hi>Teſte Royal,</hi> near <hi>Chancery lane</hi> end, to make good that place, and to cut off ſuch as iſſue out of the works on the other ſide, or come down from other parts to put themſelves under the protection of <hi>Terra del Templo,</hi> and the places thereunto nearly adjacent.</p>
               <p>Of theſe <hi>Chancery</hi>-lane-end men, (if the deſign do deſerve it) ſome two or three of them are drawn out to defeat the paſſage between the <hi>Middle Temple</hi> and <hi>Bell yard,</hi> or the Bar-gate, but this is upon eſpecial occaſion, and therefore ſeldome attempted, but when they have intelligence of ſome extraordinary booty coming that way.</p>
               <p>Others of them are quarter'd in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> where every Monday, Wedneſday and Friday they ſtand charg'd and cockt, ready to give fire at every poor Butcher in the Grazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers quarrels; and theſe are of their Infantry.</p>
               <p>Others are on every Market day commanded for <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> where they ſerve one day under the Tanner againſt the Shoo-maker, another day under the Butcher againſt the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſometimes the Scrivener againſt both.</p>
               <p>Others are appointed to ſeveral other Markets, where ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than not be employed in ſervice, they will bear arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the very Butter-wives (enough to make their very hearts to melt with the very thought on't) who wont be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without a greaſing in the fiſt.</p>

               <p>The only <hi>Deſperveio's</hi> among them are ſeverally appointed to the ſeveral Gates, where they ſecure and keep clear the paſſage to the Bars being the utmoſt extent of their works.</p>
               <p>For ſtratagems of War they are moſt excellent; to gain a Conqueſt by ſurprize, they ſometimes wear a Porters Frock, and with a pretended Letter effect their purpoſe.</p>

               <p>It may be expected that I ſhould ſay ſomething of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the <hi>Bayliffs,</hi> but to ſay the truth, I hold them not worthy to be diſcourſed of, nor to be ranked with men of the Mace, and therefore, by my good will, I will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with them at any hand.</p>

               <p>As there are ſeveral Schools, ſo there are ſeveral Arts and Sciences ſtudied.</p>
