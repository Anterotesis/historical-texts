            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to determine the Publisher of these

debtor to him for his care of your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
profit and advantage: to which
end these Discourses (delivered in such
plainness (as becomes the truth) and
with such clearness as may capacitate any
amongst you to read, understand, and
gain by them) are set before you. That
of your faithful Monitor, now dead,
might be said (as is in somewhat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
sense said of <hi>Abel,) Being dead, he
yet speaketh, Instruction</hi> unfolding that
which many would else not discern, <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that you avoid what he knew was
dangerous and might prove deadly,
And <hi>Exhortation,</hi> perswading you to
weighty instances of obedience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.
If it be, as doubtless it is, a
Truth that the Legal and <hi>Mosaick</hi> Rites
were the Gospel vailed, this piece de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth
your serious perusal; for it takes
the vail from off the face of <hi>Moses,</hi> and
doth with plainness and brevity explicate
many of those divine Riddles and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Hieroglyphicks, on whose out-side
too many of the <hi>Jews</hi> (like unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

account of the Subjects handled in this
ensuing Treatise, but it is publisht that
your reading might inform you. Nor will
I doubt your readiness to view that with
your eye, which, I believe, much pleased
your ear. And I hope your desires to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by it, wish my Epistle brief, that you
may be taken up with the seasonableness
and pertinency of the Subject. A piece
which, I assure you, doth very particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
express the temper of its Author, who
could have walked abroad (as easily as
most) in a gorgeous dress of rich learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but he was as well versed in this part
of self-denial, and resolved to practice it,
as he was vers'd in Authors, and knew
how to use them. He preacht it to you,
that you might understand it, and his
Son-in-law hath taken care it should be
printed, that you might read and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it. I wish that, among the
many eagerly snatcht occasions men take
to publish their own Conceptions More
would take this course, and print, for the
use of particular places; some of the
choice and profitable Sermons of their
own Ministers, as soon as might be after
their death, when, in all likelihood, the
mourning remembrance of their dead



<pb facs="tcp:99532:4"/>
Minister will enhance the value of his
living Sermons, whilst the sense of their
loss, in the death of his person, would
increase the care (of some at least) that
they lose not his Counsels, Exhortations,
Reproofs and Comforts which (by this
means) do survive him. I know many
are so obstinate in their Vnbelief, and so
unperswadable to Obedience, they will
not promise to believe or obey, unless one
arose from the dead to witness to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and to require their Obedience.
God shew them mercy, opening their
blind eyes, and perswading their hard
hearts! If there be any such among your
Inhabitants of <hi>Mayfield</hi> (and alas! in
so great a Parish there are too too many,)
Behold here is that which of all courses
seemeth to come nearest to such a conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension.
Though your Minister be not
sent from the dead, yet providence
sends (as it were) from his Grave: And
if you will not obey Commands, nor
follow Counsels, nor be warned by Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in his writings, you would not be
perswaded if he came from the dead.
But of you in particular I have no jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,

Look to the truth of your faith, the suitableness

The Law is made a rule of holiness in life, to
those that are justified without works of the Law,
and this by the Authority of Christ, who hath
for us satisfied it as a Covenant, and now ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
it as a Rule to us; we cannot live justified
by it, we must live sanctified to it. The Law as
Covenant of works, useful to Believers, to
humble, awaken, and drive them to seek a
remedy: The Law a Rule useful to believers,
keeping them poor in spirit, in sight of what
they once were, what they still are: It is useful
to quicken and stir them up to greater study of
holiness. Our Redemption no prejudice to the
Law, rather an exalting of it. The peaceable

to each other, is great error of <hi>Antinomians.</hi>
High Presumption to boast of justification by
Faith, and yet be the servants of sin against
the holiness of the Commandment. He is out
of Christ who continues in sin, in contempt of
the Law, and to the abuse of free grace,
which imparteth inherent Righteousness to
sanctification, as it imputeth Christ his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness

Circumcision? As if they had said, this doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine

to the <hi>Messias</hi> to whom they were to seek for
Righteousness, and in whom they were to
believe that they might be justified: They
had Sacrifices prescribed them by the wisdom
of God, as special helps to strengthen their
faith in the perfect Sacrifice of Christ the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;
and therefore they had much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
above the Heathens, if they impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it for their eternal good; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all this, it was as impossible for
them to be justified by their own works and
righteousness, as for the Heathens, and they



<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99532:13"/>
had as much need of Christ and his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for justification as a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ese. In this the
<hi>Iews</hi> had the advantage above the Heathens,
that they had far better means to lead them
unto Christ than the Heathens: Herein they
were both alike, that neither the one nor
the other could be justified and saved by their
own works, but only by Christ and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
Again in this regard, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the obstinate and unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi>
was worse than that of the profane <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
that they sinned against greater light and
means, not improving their priviledges and
advantages but receiving the grace of God in
vain.<note place="margin">Ro. 3. 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> Then followeth another objection,
If mans unrighteousness commendeth the
Righteousness of God, if Gods Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in justifying sinners be the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
manifested by reason of mens wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
how then can it stand with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of God to punish men for sin? and
again, if the glory of God, his rich Grace,
do appear and shine forth so much the more
admirably by the heinousness of peoples sins,
why should any flee from sin, and not rather
add sin to sin, doing evil that good may come,
that Gods grace may be the more manifested
to his glory? The Apostle rejecteth these
with detestation, shewing that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their perverse cavils, they shall find
God a severe judge, and that their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is just: for it doth no way lessen the guilt
of sin that God getteth glory by it; for sin
in its own nature tendeth to the darkning of



<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99532:14"/>
Gods Glory, and men by sinning dishonour
God; but such is the infinite perfection of
God, that as he commanded the light to shine
out of darkness, though darkness be contrary
to the light, so he can work good, and get
himself glory out of the evil of sin, which
in it self tendeth to rob him of his glory.
So in the sixth Chapter of this Epistle, <hi>shall
we continue in sin that grace may abound?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 1. &amp;c.</note>
The Apostle had shewed before that all had
sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> besides the guilt of their
own actual sins, yea, even such as lived before
the Law was given by <hi>Moses;</hi> and that by the
publishing of the Law sin abounded, the
guilt of sin increased: but then withal, he
added, that where sin abounded grace did
much more abound; the free love and favour
of God was gloriously manifested in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sin, thus heightned and aggravated by
the express Law, and in freely justifying sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
condemned by the written Law. Hence
this Question or Objection, to which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
answers with detestation (as before) and
withal sheweth that they who are justified by
the righteousness of Christ, have received the
Spirit, and so dye to sin and live to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and are engaged hereunto by their
Baptisme, and therefore it is in vain for any
to hope for justification, and pardon of sin
through Christ, who yeild themselves up to
the service of sin. So <hi>verse 14th,</hi> he saith to
Believers,<note place="margin">ver. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Ye are not under the Law but under
Grace:</hi> Hence again a Question or Objection
of corrupt nature or carnal reason, <hi>What then?



<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99532:14"/>
Shall we sin because we are not under the Law
but under Grace;</hi> May we not therefore sin
securely if we be free from the Law, if the
Law have no power nor authority over us
to condemn us? The Apostle answereth this
after his usual manner with detestation, and
then more fully, <hi>Know ye not that to whom ye
yeild your selves servants to obey, his servants
ye are to whom ye obey, whether of sin unto
death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</hi>
They that are just<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Law, are the Members of Christ, and
servants of righteousness; but they that sin
securely upon a conceit that they are freed
from the Law, are indeed the servants of sin,
and this service of sin tendeth to everlasting
death.<note place="margin">The General Reason of the point.</note> 
               <hi>The Reason of this in general,</hi> is, the
contrariety of mans nature unto God and his

Texts or passages of holy Scripture, so it

what the Apostle had written to them in his
former Epistle, when speaking of the last
day,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 15, 16, 17.</note> he saith, <hi>This we say unto you by the word
of the Lord, that we which are alive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

he spake by way of supposition, that
if he, and other Believers then living, should

remain to the last day, then they should be thus
translated to Glory; and as he saith elsewhere,
they should not dye, but should be changed

set a certain day, and that within a short time,
that when they saw it did not come to pass

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, by drawing false inferences and
conclusions from some places of Scripture.</hi> So
in the present Text, from that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound doctrine
of the Apostle concerning free justification of
sinners through the righteousness of Christ,
without any respect at all to the works of
the Law, it seemeth some drew this inference
or conclusion, that the Law was made void:
and do not the Antinomians the very same
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t this day? yea, do not many among us
harbour the same conceits in their minds, as
if it were enough only to pray to God to
pardon their sins for Christ his sake; as if they

               </gap>n righteousness and holiness. On the other

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>de,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 3.</note> whereas Christ saith, <hi>Except ye repent

               <hi>Except a man be born

               <hi>he cannot see the Kingdom of God. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Holiness without which no man shall see the
Lord.</hi> From these and the like Scriptures,
some it seemeth draw false conclusions, as if
by repentance, by holiness, by prayers, and
other duties, they might in part satisfie for
their former sins; and as if Repentance, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
Holiness, were not only things
accompanying justification and salvation,
but proper causes: But ye must consider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, that Christ his satisfaction and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is the full, perfect, and only cause of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustification and pardon of sin,</hi> and that no holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
no duties of the persons justified, do



<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99532:17"/>
help any thing at all towards their justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
it is the Righteousness of Christ im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to them, which maketh up the whole
matter of their Righteousness in the sight
of God, and covereth all their sins.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly, on the other side, Regeneration,
Repentance, Holiness, are concomitants, things
accompanying justification and salvation, and
evidences of it:</hi> So that although none can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
pardon of sin, nor justification in the
least degree, by any graces or duties of their
own, yet none can have any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound hope that
their sins are forgiven, or their persons accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God as righteous, without Repentance,
Regeneration, and Holiness; because none
have their sins pardoned, and their persons
justified, but such as receive Christ into their
hearts by Faith. Now Christ alwaies cometh
by water and blood by his holy graces to
wash and sanctifie the Soul, as by his blood
and merit to justifie and procure forgiveness
of sin. As the light of the fire giveth no heat,
and the heat of the fire giveth no light, yet
the heat and light are joyned together in the
fire; so righteousness imputed to the soul
for justification and forgiveness of sin do not
sanctifie, and on the other side, Repentance,
Regeneration, holiness in Believers do not
justifie, yet they are joyned together, and
where one is, there is the other, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is an evidence of the former. I conceive
it is a common case with many to mistake in
this kind, because they want judgement
rightly to draw inferences from Scripture



<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99532:17"/>
gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds: so the Anabaptists, because they read
of persons baptized when they made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of faith and repentance; hereupon
they draw conclusions against Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme:
whereas the case is not alike, for those
examples are of converted Jews or Heathens,
not of such as are born of Christian-parents;
whereas they should rather argue, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Infants born of Church-members
under the old Testament, were circumcised
as Church-members by the Lord command;
therefore Infants born of Church-members
under the new Testament are to be baptized
as Church-members now.</p>

this was the cause why the Jews were
so obstinate in rejecting Christ and his doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
not receiving and obeying him as Christ;
because their carnal minds were forestalled
with conceits of a Messias that should come
in state as an earthly Prince, and erect a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
worldly Kingdom amongst them, and
this prejudice moved them to corrupt the
Prophecies of the old Testament, and to
distaste the doctrines of the New; they liked
not to hear of a crucified Redeemer, the
doctrine of the Cross was to them a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block,
they did not close with a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

not free from this disease, and therefore when
Christ foretold his own sufferings, <hi>Peter</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to rebuke him, and there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
among them for the chiefe place, as if
they expected great worldly honours and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
by following Christ: On the other side,
the <hi>Grecians</hi> were prepossessed with the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
principles of worldly wisdom and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
and so despised the Gospel as foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
though indeed there were such heights
and depths of divine wisdom in the mysteries
of the Gospel, as never came into the head
of the wisest men amongst them. The carnal
<hi>Israelites</hi> were forestalled with an opinion of
their own righteousness, and so rejected the
doctrine of justification by the righteousness
of Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> 
               <hi>For they being ignorant of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,

the fruit of ignorance caused them
to disrelish the Truth of the Gospel.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi>

               <hi>I know that in me, that is,

               </gap>o far there
was no good thing dwelling in him; which

               <hi>First,</hi> an inclination to reject the Remedy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to work the cure, but presently casteth it out.
So do many in the state of corrupt Nature,
they hear the Truths of the Gospel which
the Lord hath appoynted as pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
against that disease, and reject them, cast
them up again, either denying them in the
secret thoughts, not believing them, or not
seriously minding or regarding them. So the
Apostle told the unbelieving <hi>Iews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13. 46<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>it was
necessary that the word of God should first have
been spoken to you, but seeing ye put it from
you, and judge your selves unworthy of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life; Lo we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> He
charged them for putting the word of God
from them. The Apostle had put the word
of God home to them, and they put it from
them; thus it is with many: The Gospel is
tendered to them as necessary physick sent
down from Heaven, and ministred to them
by the Preachers of the word, but they put
it from them; either they do not take it
down, or presently cast it up again.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>there is an inclination in corrupt
Nature, to corrupt the Truths of the Gospel, and
to make them occasions of increasing the disease,</hi>
and so to make the Gospel to become the
servant of death unto death.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16.</note> Corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is apt to make both the law and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
occasions of increasing these diseases of
the soul concerning the Law,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 5,</note> the Apostle
saith, <hi>when we were in the flesh, the motions of
sin which were by the Law, did work in our
members to bring forth fruit unto death:</hi> This
explaineth afterwards as in other passages;



<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99532:20"/>
               <hi>wherefore the Law is holy,</hi>

sinful and unholy, <hi>Was that then which is
good made death unto me? God forbid! But
sin that it might appear sin, working death in me
by that which is good, that sin by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might become exceeding sinful;</hi> such is the
malignity of corrupt Nature, that it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
evil out of good, and maketh the pure
and holy Law of God an occasion of sin, the
more sin is forbidden, reproved, threatned,
condemned by the Law; the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
is the corruption of nature carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sin. So for the Gospel, the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi>
saith, that <hi>Christ preached in the Gospel, is to
them that are disobedient,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>a stone of stumbling
and a rock of offence; when to them which stumble
at the word, being disobedient, whereunto also
they were appointed.</hi> They stumble and take
offence because they like not those terms upon
which Christ is offered to them in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
How dangerous is it then to continue
in this estate of corrupt nature? How ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
should poor souls be with the Lord to
deliver them? The body is in a sad estate
when all both food and physick increaseth
some deadly disease in it. The word and
Gospel of God is both food and physick, and
corrupt Nature is apt to make it an occasion
to increase sin, and aggravate condemnation.
Cry mightily to the Lord to work a through
cure upon your souls, to change and renew



<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99532:20"/>
your natures, to send his spirit along with
his word, that it may overpower the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
of your souls, and be unto you the favour
of life unto life.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Use 2,</note> 
               <hi>This may teach us not to think it
strange, that so many pretious Truths of the
Gospel are denyed and rejected in these days,</hi> so
many parts of Scripture abused with false in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
and corrupt glosses, so many
errors and lyes maintained instead of Truths.
Corrupt nature is a full fountain sufficient to
send forth a multitude of these poysoned
streams. It is a fruitful wombe to conceive
and bring forth abundantly, ignorance, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the sense of Scripture, drawing false
conclusions from the word, filling the mind
with mists and clouds of prejudice against
the Truth, Love of sin, Pride, Corrupt and
inordinate self-love, excessive love of the
world and outward things. These and the
like distempers of corrupt Nature, What
truths may they not corrupt or deny? What
errours and false opinions may they not
breed and cherish?</p>
            <p>Now when Satan the Father of Lyes, either

by his instruments worketh upon corrupt
nature, then followes strong delusion or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy

a multitude into the ditch with himself:
yea, one Heresie may soon over-run a whole

of <hi>Arius</hi> overcome the world, and how
were the Kings and Kingdoms of the earth
made drunk with the cup of the Whore of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> lying drenched and drowned in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
errours, Superstitions and Idolatries; and

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Use 3.</note> upon the same ground, <hi>we may
see the cause of such wicked practices as are used

with the Church; covering their
wolvish natures under sheeps cloathing, while
they were weak and kept under, but casting
off the sheeps skin when once they grew
numerous and strong, and had Emperours

havock of the Church, and exercising
outragious persecution against them? Much
is related also of the fury and cruelty of the
<hi>Circumcellions;</hi> As for the <hi>Papists,</hi> what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in <hi>Europe</hi> almost hath not had experience
more or less of their bloody butcheries? how
many thousands of Saints and Martyrs have
they murdered with fire and sword, and put
to cruel torments in <hi>Italy, Germany, Spain,
France, Netherlands, England</hi> and <hi>Scotland?</hi>
Among the rest the barbarous Massacres acted
upon the <hi>Protestants</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> under
pretence of friendship, and a royal wedding,
and the like cruelty executed in other Cities
of that Kingdome, and the hellish Powder
plot here in <hi>England,</hi> are sufficient evidences
by what spirit they are led: and this latter
is on the one side, I conceive, matter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
infamy and reproach to the Whore of
<hi>Babylon;</hi> and on the other side, an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
monument of the goodness of God, and
his watchful eye over his Church, in disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
this work of darkness, laughing to
scorn the counsels of his Enemies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
deliverance for his people in this
Land, by which means the Gospel and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of God are continued among us to
this day. But by these and the like examples
it may appear, that Satan and the corrupt
nature of man closing together, do both
bring forth dangerous errours, and contrive
wicked means to maintain them. Hence it
is that they have dealt perfidiously with men
to work their own ends, having first dealt



<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99532:22"/>
falsly with God in denying his Truth, and
(as much as lyeth in them) falsifying his
word, putting false constructions upon it,
and drawing false conclusions from it. And
therefore none ought to stumble at the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of errors and false opinions, so as to
question the Truth and certainty of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but rather so much the more to use
means to be established in the Truth, by
searching the Scriptures with diligence, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
praying to the Lord to open their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
to lead them into all Truth, and
confirm them in it, to frame their hearts to
receive the love of the Truth, and to keep
them from being led away with the error of
the wicked.</p>
            <p>But some may question.<note place="margin">Two Questions Answered.</note> If Satan and corrupt
nature are the cause of errours, what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
then, 1. That some of the godly are drawn

are free from Errours, yea, at such times and
in such places where errours and sects abound.
<hi>For answer to the former I conceive.</hi>

               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>Little children,

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99532:22"/>
came these petty Antichrists, even out of
the bosome of the primitive? apostolical
Church; for saith this Apostle, <hi>They went
out from us, but they were not of us: for if they
had been of us, they would no doubt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

their unsoundness by departing from the
faith and Church of Christ, and becoming
open enemies to the Truth, have we not
cause to think that many, who in these days

when they seemed most zealous for the Truth
and wayes of God? And therefore what need
have all to search their hearts, and while they

is no light in them, no light in their doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
so far as it will not endure the trial of
Scripture light; yea, the Apostle speaks very
high in this case, <hi>Though we, or an Angel from

               <hi>preach any other Gospel unto you than

If it were possible for a blessed Angel to

cleave to the Scripture against all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For answer to the Second Question:</hi> In as
much as Satan,<note place="margin">Answ. to 2. Query. Carnal persons may be constant to some truths, and whence.</note> and the corrupt nature of
man, are the cause of Errours and Heresies,
What is the reason that many carnal persons
both such as are of civil conversation, and
fair moral principles, and also such as are loose
and licentious, yea openly profane, are free
from errours in such places and ages, where &amp;
when false doctrines abound; whereas they
are such in whom the corruption of nature
raigneth, and such as are held captive by Satan
according to his will?</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:99532:23"/>
For answer to this I conceive,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> that <hi>some such persons being naturally
quick of apprehension,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Answ. From Natural quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and judicious, <hi>may be
so clearly convinced of some truths, that though
many deny them and oppose them yet they will
stand to them,</hi> especially when there is liberty
for all sides to hold and profess what they
list, and a man may stick to the Truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
loss and danger: in such cases natural
Conscience is a strong tye upon mens spirits,
to cause them not willfully to deny a known
Truth.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Answ. From affectation of a seeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</note> 
               <hi>Some may affect the reputation of
constancy,</hi> being loth to be noted for light
vain and fickle persons; and therefore in as
much as it was their lot to be trained up from
their childhood in the truth, they will cleave
to it, howsoever others cast it off, so long as
they see they may do it with safety. They
account it a childish thing to hearken to every
novelty and vain fancy (as indeed it is) and
therefore not becoming their gravity. It may
be they would have been as obstinate in error
had they happened to have been taught it in
their youth, as now they seem to be constant
in the Truth. Is not this apparent in divers
at this day, who stand firm in doctrinal
truths, and remain perversely stiffe, in old
Ceremonyes and superstitious observances,
which have no footing in the holy Scriptures,
because they have been trained up in both?
On the one side they were trained up under
sound doctrine concerning the main points of
faith: On the other side, they received some



<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99532:24"/>
superstitious observances by tradition, and
therefore they will part with neither,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>I suppose Satan having possession of
carnal persons another way,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Answ. Satan <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, many</hi> carnal persons may <hi>be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged

because some whom they respect,<note place="margin">4. Ans Hoped advantage from those that hold the truth.</note> or upon whom
they depend, or of whom they look for some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
go that way.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, many <hi>carnal persons seem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
in matter of Religion:</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. Answ. From their indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency to opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Religion which keeps them from New ones.</note> They are seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

think it no great matter what men hold or

What a grievous rent was likely to have been

which would have perswaded the believing

carefully suppressed this errour at the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing

had no small dissention and disputation with
them that taught this false doctrine. In the

did it make in the Church, when

So the <hi>Macedonians, Nestorians, Eutichians,

<hi>Pope</hi> the universal Bishop and head of the
whole Church, what a breach hath it made
between the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Churches for
many hundred years? and what is the reason
that there is no reconciliation made all this
while between them and the Protestants, but
because they remain so obstinate in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
Heresies, and Idolatries, against the
manifest light of the holy Scriptures? The
stiffeness of those that are called <hi>Lutherans</hi>
in adhering to their corrupt opinions, hath
made a miserable and lasting breach amongst
the Protestant Churches. But though we
should not look either far back or far off for
examples in this kind, our own Land, and
our present times, may afford us more then
enough. Have we not breach upon breach,
divisions and subdivisions, many rending
themselves from our Churches, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
making new rents among themselves;
and yet when there is an opportunity, to act
mischief against the truth and the Preachers

to carry on wretched designs, as the
<hi>Pharises</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> as also <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>

of faith) which was <hi>once delivered unto
the Saints; for</hi> (saith he) <hi>there are certain men
crept in unawares,</hi> &amp;c. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
gives a strict charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 13, 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>hold fast the

me in faith, and Love which is in Christ Iesus.</hi>
Hold it fast whatsoever means are used to
wrest it from thee, <hi>that good thing which was
committed to thee, keep by the holy Ghost which
dwelleth in us.</hi> Then he addeth this, <hi>thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
that all they which are in Asia be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from me.</hi> I conceive the word <hi>all</hi> is not
to be taken <hi>universally</hi> here for all absolutely,
<hi>but indefinitely,</hi> for the generality of those in
<hi>Asia the lesser;</hi> and therefore <hi>Timothy</hi> being
left at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> a chiefe City of <hi>Asia</hi> was
likely to meet with many Adversaries, and
much contention, in holding fast the form of
sound words; yet the Apostle would not
dispense with him in this case, he must stick
close to the Truth.<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 9, 10, 11, 13.</note> So he telleth <hi>Titus, that
a Minister must hold fast the faithful word as
he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound
doctrine both to exhort and convince the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers,
for there are many unruly and vain talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and deceivers, especially they of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
whose mouthes must be stopped,</hi> &amp;c.
And then he addeth, <hi>wherefore rebuke them
sharply that they may be sound in the faith.</hi> Is it
not very likely that contentions and divisions
would follow hereupon?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Therefore consider that when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi>
and divisions <hi>follow upon the faithful
preaching, professing,</hi> maintaining of <hi>the Truth,</hi>



               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:99532:34"/>
or the right administration of holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>the fault is in those that will not indure
sound doctrine,</hi> but take offence when none
is given, either because their errours are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
or their sinful practices reproved. If
divisions and contentions follow upon the
publishing and asserting the Counsel of God;
they are the cause of it who resist the Truth:
for was not this the case of our Lord Jesus
Christ himself and his Apostles? Many of
the people when they heard Christ, said, <hi>Of a
truth this is the Prophet: others said this is the
Christ:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 7. 41, 42, 43. &amp; 10. 19, 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>but some said shall Christ come out of
Galilee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>so there was a division among
the people because of him. There was a division
therefore again among the Iews because of these
sayings, and many of them said he hath a Devil,
and is mad, Why hear ye him? Others said,
these are not the words of him that hath a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
Can a Devil open the eyes of the blind?</hi>
Yea,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 24, 25, 26.</note> the Lord Christ forewarned his Disciples,
<hi>Think not that I am come to send peace on the
Earth, I am not come to send peace but a sword,</hi>
or (as it is in <hi>Luke) division: For I am come
to set a man at variance against his Father, and
the Daughter against her Mother,</hi>

Christ is the Prince of peace, and his Gospel
is the Gospel of peace, and the proper end
of his coming in the flesh, and the great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
that he undertook was to make peace
between God and men, and so by consequent,
between men and men, and this design took



<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99532:34"/>
effect accordingly in those that savingly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Christ and his Gospel, and yeilded up
their hearts to him; but divisions and stirs
and contentions followed by accident, not
from the Nature of the doctrine delivered
by Christ and his Apostles, But 1. <hi>From the
malice of Satan. 2. From the Corruption,
Blindness, Perverseness of mens Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Divisions from Satans malice. Mans froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> 
               <hi>From the malice of Satan,</hi> who
looked upon the powerful preaching of Christ
his Gospel, as an Engine of battery planted
against his strong-holds. He being the Prince
of darkness, extreamly hateth the Light; and
therefore whereas he possessed all in peace
before, when the light of the Gospel break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth, he betaketh himself to his arms,
standeth upon his guard, striveth to keep pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the hearts and souls of men. Yea,
he is not content to make a defensive War
only, but rageth and laboureth to put out
the light, stirreth up his instruments to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and persecute those that receive the love
of the Truth, and give up their names and
hearts to Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Corruption of mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
the blindness and perverseness of their
spirits is a cause of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e divisions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions.
Their ignorance, errours, lusts,
sinful courses are reproved by the word, yea,
others receiving and obeying it, is a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their unbelief, impenitency, diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
and therefore they are easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
by Satan to oppose and persecute the
Truth, and them that embrace it. So that



<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99532:35"/>
it is from the malignity of their hearts that
divisions follow. I may add yet a third
cause,</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>And that is the weakness of some

               </hi>
but for want of more clear and solid judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               </gap>
Satan and the world took occasion to stir up
contention and cause division, upon occasion
of Christ his coming and preaching: so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
upon the publishing of the Gospel by hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Apostles, and by consequent, by other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Preachers of the Truth. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>

believed: Here was the proper effect o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Christs spirit working in the Gospel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
it made peace between God and men, and
united <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> together, who wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
odious to each other. Now see also the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Satans malice, and the perverseness o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected
against the Brethren.</hi> It seemeth these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
persons then began to kindle the
fire of contention in the breasts of ignorant
persons, but it did not presently flame out.
And therefore in the third verse we find that
these faithful servants of Christ went on in
their work without interruption: <hi>Long time
therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord,



<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99532:35"/>
which gave testimony to the word of his Grace,
and granted signs and wonders to be done by their
hands.</hi> But at length this fire of Hell that
lay smothered under the ashes brake forth,
<hi>the multitude of the City was divided, and part
held with the Iews, and part with the Apostles,
and an assault was made both of the Gentiles
and Iews, People and Rulers, to use them des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitefully
and stone them, so that the Apostles fled
and preached the Gospel elsewhere.</hi> Here it is
as clear as the Sun, that the unbelievers and
enemies of the Truth were the cause of this
division. If we should trace the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> in his travels from place to place, where
shall we find a place free from divisions? not
caused by his preaching, but following occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally
from his preaching, Satan and his
Agents kindling the coals of contention. The
Apostle could not bring men to Christ by his
Ministry, but he must of necessity wrest them
out of the power of Satan, and call them
from the course of the world; and thereupon
Satan and the world were enraged, and so
contentions and divisions followed.</p>
            <p>Second Caution.</p>
            <p>The use of this may be,</p>

               <hi>Saith</hi> Iohn, I beheld and
heard an Angel flying through the midst of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
saying with a loud Voice, Woe, Woe, Woe
to the inhabitants of the Earth by reason of
the other voices of the Trumpet of the three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels



<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99532:36"/>
               <hi>which are yet to sound.</hi> Before we may
read of seven Angels with their seven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
now after four of them had sounded
and sad consequents followed, here is a
solemn preparation made against the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the three last. It seemeth the reaso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
is because the calamities following, should be
more grievous than the former, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
an Angel flying through the midst
of Heaven denounceth three woes to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiters
of the Earth. It is supposed this
Angel was <hi>Gregory</hi> 1. Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> said
to fly through the midst of Heaven, or the
middle space between Heaven and Earth,
because on the one side he came nearer the
heavenly purity of doctrine and worship
than his Successors; but was yet far below
that heavenly purity of the primitive and
Apostolical times, and so declining toward
the earth according to the corrupt times
wherein he lived: who by foretelling that
the King of Pride was at hand, Antichrist
was at hand with an army of Priests follow-him,
gave warning of these woes approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Soon after this warning given, the
fifth Angel sounded, which is the first of
the three woe-bringing Trumpets, (as
they may be called) and the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
following is thus expressed, <hi>And
I saw a Star fall from Heaven unto the
Earth, and to him was given the key of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless
Pit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 9. 1.</note> It is conceived that this Star
noteth out both the <hi>Pope in the West,</hi> and <hi>that
false Prophet Mahomet in the East;</hi> who though



<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99532:36"/>
they differed far from each other in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
way of acting, yet they both promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the main design of the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and therefore may well be represented
by one Star falling from Heaven, and said to
have the Key of the bottomless Pit. They
fell from Heaven, from the heavenly purity
of the true Church often called Heaven in
this Book. About three years after the death
of <hi>Gregory,</hi> his Successor <hi>Boniface</hi> the third,
received of <hi>Phocas</hi> the perfidious Emperor
(who murdered his Master <hi>Mauritius</hi> the
Emperor with his children) the Title of
Universal Bishop, and so a vast power to
work mischief in the Church, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
was put in execution as it followeth,
<hi>And he opened the bottomless-pit, and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
a smoak out of the Pit as a smoak of a
great furnace, and the Sun and the Air were
darkned by reason of the smoak of the Pit:</hi> The
smoak of errours and superstitions like a
most loathsom fogg, came out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless
pit darkning the light of the truth,
and blinding the eyes of men, the efficacy
of errour and strong delusion bewitching
multitudes of poor souls. Besides this, out
of the smoak came locusts upon the earth,
huge multitudes of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryers</hi> like
Locusts overspreading the earth, devouring
the fruits of it. These came out of the smoak
of the bottomless pit, the smoak of errours
and superstitions; for when such doctrines
passed for currant, that men might be saved
by observing vain humane traditions, that



<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99532:37"/>
there was a Treasure in the Church filled up
with the merits of those that had an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus
besides what was needful for themselves,
and that they who were benefactors to the
<hi>Monks</hi> should be partakers of their merits,
how mad was the world in building Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
and giving their Land and goods to
the <hi>Friers,</hi> devoting their children to that
profession? Yea, it seemeth divers noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and some Kings and Queens turning
<hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Nuns.</hi> And as the smoak of the pit
did breed the Locusts, so the Locusts encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the smoak, and made the mists of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
greater and thicker, multiplying errours
and superstitions. If this were one of those
grievous woes, whereof the Angel flying
through the midst of Heaven gave warning
to the world; how should we be humbled
and ashamed in respect of the great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
dulness, senselesness of spirit that is
among us, yea too much in those that have
some love to the Truth, that this great and
woful evil doth so abound with us, and is so
little laid to heart? Should not the very
thought of it startle us, that such thick and
dark vollies of smoak in our days, should
break out of the bottomless pit, and cover
so great a part of our Land, darkning the
Air and Sun, eclipsing the Light of the
truth, and putting out the eyes of many, and
so many Locusts, deceivers, and deceived,
coming out of the smoak of errours? This
ought to be for a Lamentation. But how
many that profess themselves Christians set



<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99532:37"/>
their hearts so much upon their own private
concernments, their business, wealth, ease, and
pleasure, &amp;c. and those that have something
of a publick spirit, yet confine their serious
thoughts to the external good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
that they little or nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
these destructive evils that are of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
nature. If <hi>Gallio</hi> his temper (who
when complaint was made to him about dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
in Religion, slighted them as words
and names, and cared for none of these
things) may be thought tolerably, or at
at least, not much to be marvailed at in an
Heathen, yet doubtless it is shameful and
odious in a Christian. What! a Christian,
and not moved that Christ who is the Truth
is so highly dishonoured, by lyes and falshood
taught and received instead of Truths; that
multitudes of poor souls are in a ready way
to be destroyed by damnable doctrines; that
errours beget errours, and are likely to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow
the Truth, to spread far and wide;
that so many are both infected by them and
alienated from the remedy, shunning the
publick Ordinances where sound doctrine is
taught; that such bleeding wounds and Rents
are made in the Church. Art thou a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and so one that pretendest to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
with the word of Truth, and hast thou
no such principle of contrariety planted in
thee against errours and false doctrines, as
to make them bitter and grievous to thee?
Some may raile at those that are misled, and
others may make a sport of their folly; but



<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99532:38"/>
how small is the number of those who like
Christians mourn for them as dishonourable
to Christ, pernicious to souls? How deeply
was the holy Apostle affected with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
of the <hi>Iews</hi> in their errours, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the ceremonies of the Law above
Christ the Substance; and their own imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
legal righteousness, above the perfect
righteousness of Christ applied by faith. <hi>I
say the truth in Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>I lye not, my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
also bearing me witness in the holy
Ghost, that I have great heaviness and continual
sorrow in my heart: for I could wish that I my
self were accursed from Christ for my Brethren,
my kinsmen, according to the flesh.</hi> How pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately
did he express himself to the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note>
who had once embraced the pure
doctrine of the Gospel, but afterwards suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
themselves to be so deluded by seducers,
as to seek justification by the Law, <hi>My little
children of whom I travel in birth again until
Christ be formed in you.</hi> He felt such sorrow,
such fear, such strong and compassionate
workings of heart towards them, as were
answerable to the pangs of a woman in child-bearing.
Saith the Psalmist, <hi>I beheld the
transgressours and was grieved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 158.</note> 
               <hi>because they
kept not thy word:</hi> This I conceive doth
plainly concern both transgressions in practice
and in doctrine or belief. Both these forts
of transgressiours are guilty of not keeping
Gods word. They that live in a course of
sin, they keep the word in their judgement
and profession, but keep it not in their lives



<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99532:38"/>
and actions. They that go on in errours keep
not the word so much as in judgment and
profession. Besides, how can a man forsake
any truth of God which he hath once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but he must <hi>ipso facto,</hi> in that very act
transgress in point of practise? He trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth
that precept, Prov. 23, <hi>buy the truth
and sell it not:</hi> that of the Apostle, <hi>be no
more children tossed to and fro, and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with every wind of doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. and
that, <hi>hold fast the form of sound words,</hi> &amp;c.
Now the Psalmist beheld those with a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
eye, <hi>I beheld the transgressours and was
grieved,</hi> &amp;c. Is it not a sign of a graceless
heart to behold transgressours without grief?
If we moan not for these things out of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
respects; the Lord may justly make
us mourn for those outward evils that they
may bring upon us. The Divel as he is the
Father of lyes, so he is a murderer. <hi>Spiritus
mendax est homicida;</hi> and they that are led by
a lying spirit, if they can establish their fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and party so as to grow confident of
their power, may soon discover a murtherous
spirit; and then those that are lukewarm and
indifferent in matters of Religion, may feel
their fury as well as they that are most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> 
               <hi>This truth may shame those who
plead for a toleration of all sorts of errours, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
Seducers, false prophets.</hi> It seemeth
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> accounted them intolerable,
when he pronounced them accursed, and
wished them cut off.</p>

matters, and out of simplicity, and carry
themselves humbly and modestly, not troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the peace of the Church: such are to be
tenderly dealt with as Brethren, while they
shew themselves willing to be informed.
Some may agree with the Church in all main
and most substantial points, and differ in
things that seem not clearly laid down in
Scripture: these if they do not proudly and
obstinately reject the truth, I suppose ought
to have much moderation shewed towards
them. Again there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the simple and weak that are misled,
and those that are cunning seducers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
of others. More severity is to be used
towards seducers, than those that are misled
by them: Yet even these are to be heard and
means used to convince them out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to be admonished exhorted, patience
and long suffering to be exercised toward
them. If after all such means used, they
remain obstinate, neither forsaking their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
nor ceasing to draw others from the
truth: How can it suit either with zeal
for Christ, or love to souls, to suffer them to
go on?</p>

may be they will say, They are bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

the Magistrate should think himself

them up as he would do one, who having the

               <note place="margin">Obj. 5.</note> Some it seemeth have found out
a strange conceit, that the examples of those

because they were tyes of Christ,<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 32, 33.</note> who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

1. I am clearly of the same mind, and
I wish some of our Laws were mittigated,
and some other punishment were laid upon
some offences, which among us are made
Capital. But what shall we say to such that
can be content to see men loose their lives
for sheep-stealing and horse-stealing, and
yet cry out upon it as an high degree of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
if Blasphemers, and those that draw
others from the Ordinances of God into
damnable Heresies, should be put to death?
Have we not had such among us, who have
been very tender hearted Patrons of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
not only sparing their lives, but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing
and preferring them; and yet when
any out of principles of Conscience have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
their usurped power, their feet have
been swift to shed blood. 2. I conceive
Magistrates in restraining Heresies ought to
be very wary in taking away life. I wish,
1. They would take them from all publick

Offices of trust and power. 2. Discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
them. 3. Suppress their Meetings.
And if any be obstinate and refractory, there
be other wayes to curb them besides Capital
punishments; as Fines, Banishment, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment.
But for Blasphemers, I know
not what authority under Heaven, hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

a Protection for Hereticks, to preserve them
from the hand of justice, in that Parable of
the Tares, where the Housholder would not
have the Tares rooted up, lest the Wheat
should be plucked up with them, but would
have both grow together until the Harvest.
I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> 1. I see not how this can exempt
Hereticks from punishment, more than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
persons, Theeves, Traitours, Rebels,
Adulterers, Murderers, or other Malefactours,
For what are Tares but all sorts of persons,
that are not Wheat to be gathered into the
Barn. And therefore in the exposition of the
Parable,<note place="margin">v. 41.</note> the Tares are declared to signifie all
things that offend, and them that do Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
And therefore I conceive these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
are not the Magistrates, who are not
forbidden, but commanded to use their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for a Terrour to evil works: but the
Angels whom the Lord will not have to pluck
up all the Tares before the Harvest day, <hi>scil.</hi>
the end of the world. And in the exposition



<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99532:42"/>
of the Parable I find nothing either restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
civil Magistrates, or Church Officers, in
proceeding against notorious and scandalous
offenders. 2. <hi>Parables are not to be pressed
and urged in every particular circumstance: but
the Scope is to be considered.</hi> And I conceive
the Scope and design of this Parable is to
shew that there shall be a mixture of good and
bad in the world until the last day, when the
separation shall be made. And therefore in
the third place, <hi>How earnest should we be in
praying to the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> 
               <hi>to preserve our selves and
others from being led away with the errour
of the wicked,</hi> to reduce those that are
led aside, to open their eyes, and humble
their hearts, that they may acknowledge their
failings, and return to the Truth, to frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
the subtil devices and mischievous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of deceivers, to fill the Magistrates
with a spirit of wisdom, zeal, and courage
to improve their authority for the Lord Jesus

of his Name and Truth, to stir up in
them bowels of compassion towards poor
souls, who are dayly in danger to be insna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

other mischiefs done by false Teachers, I
conceive this one were enough to stir up all
that truly fear God, to desire their restraint,
that they draw many poor creatures from
publick ordinances, from the ordinary means
of knowledge, grace, and salvation: And
how can they do the Divel a more acceptable

with advantage. The Question or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is, <hi>Do we make void the Law thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Faith?</hi> implying that the doctrine delivered
by the Apostle concerning justification by
faith, doth make void the Law, that is, that
by maintaining this doctrine, that they who
receive Christ by a lively faith, applying his
righteousness, obedience, and satisfaction,
to themselves, and relying wholly upon him
for justification and salvation, are accepted of
God as truly righteous, without any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
at all of any works of theirs done
in obedience to the Law; that they hereby
do make void the Law, or take away the use
and authority of it. This the Apostle doth
most strongly deny, by affirming the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,



<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99532:43"/>
               <hi>yea, we establish the Law.</hi> If he had
said no more but this, <hi>we do not make void
the Law through Faith,</hi> it had been a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of that which was objected. But to
add strength to his denyal, he affirms the
contrary, that the doctrine of justification
by faith, is so far from making void the
Law, that it confirmeth and establisheth the
Law. So that the Apostle shews that there
was a double falshood in this Objection:
For if the doctrine objected against, had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made void the Law, nor established it,
it had been false to say, it did make void the
the Law: but to say it made void the Law,
when it was so far from making it void, that
it did establish it, was a double falshood.
Again, it seemeth the objection was made
both against the doctrine, and them that
taught it, <hi>Do we make void the Law through
Faith? scil.</hi> the Apostle and other Gospel-preachers?
And the Answer cleareth both,
<hi>Yea, we establish the Law:</hi> The doctrine
which we preach, and we in preaching this
doctrine, are so far from making void the
Law, that both our doctrine, and we in
teaching it, do establish the Law.</p>
            <p>Hence may be noted this Point,<note place="margin">Doct. 3. Complicated falshood char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged sometimes on truth and the preachers of it.</note> 
               <hi>That such
things have been Objected against the Truth,
and them that stand for the truth, as are doubly
false.</hi> I conceive there is an Objection im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in the speech of our Lord Christ, <hi>Think
not that I am come to destroy the Law or the
Prophets;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>I am not come to destroy but to fulfill.</hi>
It seemeth some either did Object, or were



<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99532:43"/>
inclined to object against the Son of God,
that he came to destroy the Law and the
Prophets. Now he shews that there was a
double falshood in this surmize: for 1. He
did not come to destroy them. 2. He came
to fulfill them in such an exact and perfect
manner and measure, as the best of men that
ever came before him were never able to do.
So when he had cast the Divel out of a dumb
man, that was possessed, so that the dumb
spake,<note place="margin">&amp; Mat. 9. 34.</note> and the multitude marveiled saying,
it was never so seen in <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Luk. 23. 2. with Mat 22. 21</note> the <hi>Pharisees</hi>
said, he casteth out Devils through the Prince
of Devils. There was a double falshood in
this envious and Blasphemous cavil. They
accused him as a confederate of the Devil,
who both by his doctrine and works made it
appear that he came to destroy the works of
the Devil. The Lord Christ having said,
<hi>I am the light of the world:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 13.</note> 
               <hi>he that followeth
me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have
the light of life. The Pharisees said unto him,
Thou bearest record of thy self, thy record is not
true.</hi> This was doubly false; for he is the
truth it self, and neither did nor could speak
any untruth. So when the Lord Jesus
had opened the eyes of one that was born
blind, on the Sabbath day, <hi>Some of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
said, This man is not of God, because he
keepeth not the Sabbath day.</hi> This was doubly
false: If a man be accused for breaking the
Sabbath, when he doth some work of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
which is permitted on the Sabbath
day, though not commanded, it is a false



<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99532:44"/>
accusation: but when he is accused to break
the Sabbath, for such a work as is a work
suitable to the Sabbath; there is a double
falshood in such a charge. Now such was
this, and other miraculous works wrought
by the Lord Christ on the Sabbath. They
were not only things permitted to be done
on that day, but they were special and choice
Sabbath day works; for they were divine
works, works of divine and almighty power,
works tending to prove and confirm his
doctrine: yea, proofs and evidences of that
great doctrine, that he was the Son of God,
the Christ, the Saviour of the world. So
those enemies of the Gospel at <hi>Philippi</hi> fal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly
accused <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and slandered their
doctrine,<note place="margin">Act. 16. 20, 21.</note> saying, <hi>these men being Iews, do
exceedingly trouble our City, and teach customes
which are not lawful for us to receive, neither
to observe, being Romans.</hi> Here was a double
falshood. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was lawful for them to receive and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the things taught by Paul, &amp;c. 2. It
was not only lawful but necessary. They
were bound to receive them as the counsels
and commands of the Lord Jesus, exalted
to the right hand of God, as King of Kings,
and Lord of Lords, to whom every knee
mnst bow, &amp;c. To whose Soveraignty both
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and all other nations of the
world were subject. So the unbelieving
<hi>Iews</hi> of <hi>Thessalonica</hi> cried out against them,<note place="margin">&amp; 17. 6.</note>
               <hi>These that have turned the world upside down,
are come hither also.</hi> Now this had been false,



<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99532:44"/>
if <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> had done neither good nor
harm in the world. But it was doubly false;
For they were so far from turning the world
upside down, that they laboured mightily
to set the world in order: They found the
world wofully disordered, full of confusion,
and as it were turned upside down, by the
subtilty and malice of Satan, and the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of men: the Divel the worst and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of all the creatures raigning over the
World: man at first made after the Image
of God, and Lord of the rest of the creatures,
so far abased as to worship stocks and stones,
yea, the Images of Birds and Beasts, &amp;c.
and inslaved to divers lusts and vile affections.
Now <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and other faithful Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the Gospel, taught such a doctrine
as tended to the remedying and rectifying of
these disorders and confusions, to put the
world into a right posture, to beat down the
strong holds of Satan, to cast him out of his
usurped Throne, to deliver the people of the
world out of his power, to rescue them out
of the slavery of sin, to reconcile them unto
God by Christ, to subject them to his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to restore them to his likeness. So
there was also a double untruth in their other
accusation, <hi>These all do contrary to the decrees
of Caesar.</hi> This had been false if <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c.
had spoken nothing at all either for or against
<hi>Caesars</hi> Authority: But it was a double un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth
to lay such a charge upon them, that
taught obedience and subjection to <hi>Caesar.
Let every soul be subject,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> &amp;c. Yea, and <hi>Paul</hi>

directed <hi>Titus</hi> to teach thus,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Put them in

            <p n="1">1. <hi>From Ignorance</hi> I suppose in some, who
not having their senses exercised in the word
of God,<note place="margin">1. Reason of the Point.</note> do grossely mistake things that are

truth. Such it may be was the case of those
unbelieving <hi>Iews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 17. 18.</note> who complained of <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Silas,</hi> that they turned the world upside

strange Gods, because he preached unto them
Iesus and the Resurrection:</hi> Whereas his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
was to perswade them to renounce
all strange gods, and to turn to the only true
and living God. Others seem to have taken
his speech for vain babling: Whereas I believe
it was the most serious weighty discourse that
ever was uttered within their Walls since the
foundation of their City was laid. But
they were trained up in heathenish blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and ignorance, and therefore no wonder
if they were subject to such gross mistakes:
For saith the Apostle, <hi>we preach Christ Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi>

had stirred up an uproar among the ignorant
people of <hi>Ephesus, Some cried one thing, and
some another, for the assembly was confused,
and the most part knew not wherefore they
were come together.</hi> And yet it seemeth this
rude and ignorant multitude joyned together
to make up the common cry. <hi>All with one
voice about the space of two hours cryed out,
Great is Diana of the Epbesians.</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have made loud clamours against the
truth,<note place="margin">Act. 19. 32, 33.</note> and them that preach and profess it,
upon the false suggestions of others, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
not being able to give a reason for what
they say!</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>I conceive many do this out of malice against
those that maintain the truth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reason 3. From malice.</note> The malignity
of their Spirits is not satisfied with lesser
calumnies than those of a double dye.<note place="margin">Act. 24. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi>
the Oratour was not content to term
the blessed Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> a pestilent fellow,
(as our English hath it,) but a Pest or Plague
as in the original: and then accused him for
a mover of sedition among all the <hi>Iews</hi>
throughout the world, and one that went
about to prophane the Temple: Whereas he
endeavoured to prevent or suppress sedition
or tumults, and endured great afflictions,
and was exposed to extream dangers by the
turbulent and seditious adversaries of the



<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99532:46"/>
truth, and instead of being a Plague, he was
one of the chiefest instruments of good to
the world that ever was, and instead of going
about to Profane the Temple, he shewed spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
regard of the supposed holiness of the
Temple even after the date of it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
that he might not give offence to the
weak: and yet the <hi>Iews</hi> assented to their
Oratour, in these most false suggestions, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that these things were so.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>It seemeth many do this for want
of Arguments to confirm their false opinions, and
overthrow the Truth:</hi> And therefore they lay
on load, heaping up railings instead of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
false and reproachful accusations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of convincing demonstrations; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to disgrace those truths which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
disprove, and to discredit those teachers
the light of whose doctrine they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.
And how ready are the weaker sort to
be scared from the truth, and alienated from
those assemblies where it is taught by such
shifts as these? A bold face and a rolling
tongue pouring out store of opprobrious
language against the truth, goes a great way
with the simple. What an out-cry was
made by the <hi>Iews</hi> of <hi>Asia</hi> against <hi>Paul, Men
of Israel help: This is the man that teacheth
all men every where against the people, and the
Law, and this place: and farther, brought
Greeks also into the Temple, and hath polluted
this holy place. And all the City was moved, and
the people ran together, and they took Paul and
drew him out of the Temple, and went about to



<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99532:46"/>
kill him.</hi> How soon are the multitude stirred
up, and set in a rage by the meer clamours
of those who outragiously exclaim against the
truth, and them that maintain it? Men of
Israel help; as if all were like to be lost, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>Paul</hi> and his doctrine were suppressed.
So when they that disputed with <hi>Stephen,</hi>
were not able to resist the wisdom and the
spirit by which he spake,<note place="margin">Act. 6: 9, 10, 11</note> 
               <hi>Then they suborned
men, which said, we have heard him speak
blasphemous words against Moses, and against
God, and they stirred up the people.</hi> They were
beaten from their arguments, and then sought
to over-bear him with false accusations, and
the ignorant people were ready to hearken
to them.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> 
               <hi>This may teach us not to think it
strange, if the Truth and those that profess it be
evil spoken of in these times;</hi> if things that
are doubly false be objected against it and
them.<note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>There is no new thing
under the Sun:</hi> Certainly this is no new thing,
as ye have heard by divers examples out
of Scripture; it is a practice as antient as
the Apostles dayes. <hi>Paul</hi> and his Ministry
did not escape these envenomed tongues.
Nay, the Lord Christ himself, together with
his doctrine and works, was thus traduced.
Why should it be expected that the servants
should be above their Master, or the truth in
their mouths be more free from false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
than it was in his? If ye hear such
things in these dayes, consider that the Divel
doth but keep his old wont. If the doctrine



<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99532:47"/>
of free justification be slandered as licentious,
and tending to carnal liberty, was it not so
in <hi>Pauls</hi> time? If the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
be called Antichristian, <hi>Baals-Priests,</hi> and
the like, by Hereticks and Sectaries, it is no
wonder; the Divel seeth them to stand in his
way and hinder his work. I think it is easie
to prove that there is a double falshood in this
reproach. For first, they do not promote
the interest and Kingdom of Antichrist ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in regard of discipline, doctrine or
worship. Not in regard of discipline; they
are far from seeking to bring men into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to him as the visible head of the
Church, or to exalt his authority above Kings
and Princes, and above the Laws of Christ.
Nor in doctrine; they teach not Popish o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.
Nor in worship; they are no Patrons
of Idolatry and superstition. But secondly,
They are so far from being Antichristians,
that I am perswaded that they are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and most considerable opposites and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
to Antichrist that are in the world. And
therefore there is a double falshood in this
charge. And I think it very probable that
the Jesuites were either the first instruments of
Satan in broaching this reproach, or else are
very apt to promote it and set it on; that by
crying down the Ministers of the Gospel as
Antichristian, they may make way for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
to get ground amongst us with the
more ease and speed. How easie were it to
demonstrate, that Ministers of the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and the same judgement with those that



<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99532:47"/>
now by foul-mouthed adversaries are bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for Antichristian, have been principally
instrumental under Christ to overthrow Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and to prevent it for recovering its
former strength? For the eminent instruments
in this work were, <hi>Luther, Melanchthon,</hi> and
<hi>Bucer,</hi> and others of <hi>Germany. Calvin, Beza,
Iunius, Chamier</hi> of <hi>France. Zuinglius, Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Bullinger, Grinaeus,</hi> of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
Whitaker</hi> and <hi>Reinolds</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
and divers others. Besides the diligent and
constant endeavours of Ministers in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
clearing, confirming the Truth, and
through the Lords blessing, grounding and
establishing the people in it against Popish
errours and Antichristian corruptions. As
for Sectaries, who are so liberal in bestowing
such Titles upon the Ministers of the Gospel,
have they not occasionally at least given much
advantage to Antichrist, and as it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
a back door at which to let him in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?
1. By seeking to discredit the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the word and their Ministry. 2. By
drawing many people from the Ordinances,
and so preparing them to take such impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as Satan and his instruments are ready
to put upon them, and (if opportunity be)
to receive the mark of the Beast. 3. By
multiplying divisions and factions, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up party against party, and thereby ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a ready course to make Religion ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in the eyes of worldly Politicians, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the minds of the simple with doubting
and amazement, as not knowing which way



<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99532:48"/>
to take. And, 4. Hereupon ministring occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Jesuites and Friers to perswade
the people that there will be no certainty,
no end of divisions, no remedy against sects
and errours, but by uniting themselves to
one visible head the Pope, and returning to
the bosom of the Mother Church of <hi>Rome:</hi>
yea, it is verily thought that many of the
Popes Agents and Emissaries are now very
active among us, disguised under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Sectaries, labouring to encrease
contention among us, for the designs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.
I conceive it is very observable, that
those Sectaries which cry down the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and Professours of the truth as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,
have usually come in the rear, and
a day after the fight as it were; for when they
that are sound in their principles have set
upon the work of reformation, and through
the good hand of God some hopeful begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
have been made, then have crept in
Anabaptists and other Sectaries: So in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
Switzerland, Geneva, England.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
the Divel finding that, upon the bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>king
forth of light, those old errours and corrupt
customes will not be digested; he then stirreth
up some to pretend to reformation, disguising
himself that way, that he may both hinder
the work and blemish it. This it seemeth
was his practice about the time of Christs
coming in the flesh, to raise up false Christs
and deceivers, &amp;c.</p>

            <bibl>Rom. 3. 31.</bibl>
            <p>I Conceive it is clear, that the Apostle, in the
two first Chapters of this Epistle, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of a threefold Law: one of which was
given to mankind in general, both <hi>Gentiles</hi>
and <hi>Israelites;</hi> the other two were peculiarly
delivered to the people of <hi>Israel.</hi> The first
of these, <hi>scil.</hi> that which was given to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in general, is that which is called the
Law of Nature, consisting of those notions
of good and evil, which were left or new
written by the Lord in the minds of men and
women, after that the nature of mankind
was corrupted by sin; which Law, though
it be now imperfect, yet in many things it
sheweth the difference between good and
evil, and hath power over the Conscience to
inform, convince, excuse, and accuse. The
other two delivered peculiarly to the people
of <hi>Israel,</hi> are the Law of Ordinances of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and the Law moral. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
proveth that none of these Laws can
justifie the strictest observers of them: all men
and women being naturally corrupt, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
with principles of opposition against the
purity and perfection of the moral Law:
and those that are renewed by grace, being



<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99532:49"/>
but imperfectly conformed to the Law. As
for the Law of Ceremonies: it is in its own
nature no perfect rule of righteousness, but
consisting of figures and shadows, and such
earthly and carnal observances as had a mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
signification of spiritual and heavenly
things. The Law of nature is comprehended
in the moral Law, delivered in the Scriptures,
first published to <hi>Israel,</hi> and then communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together with the Gospel to the Nations of
the world. So that that which is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
written in the minds of men naturally,
is perfectly declared by the Law written by
the finger of God in Tables of stone, <hi>scil.</hi>
the ten Commandments, and more fully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in other parts of Scripture. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though it was expedient for the Apostle
to speak distinctly of them in the former part
of his discourse, to convince both <hi>Israelites</hi>
and Heathens of their unrighteousness and
g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ilt; yet in this place I conceive, the Law
of nature and the written Law, may well
be comprehended under one, and so I take
the Apostles meaning to be, that by the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
of free justification through the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ, both the Ceremonial and
moral Law are established.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To begin with the former,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note> 
               <hi>observe this
point,</hi> That the Law of Ceremonies is establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the doctrine of the Gospel.<note place="margin">Faith establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law. And how this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</note> 
               <hi>Or thus,</hi> The
doctrine of free justification through the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
of Christ apprehended by faith, establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Ceremonial Law.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:99532:49"/>
For the right understanding of this, we

by the Authority of God himself,</hi> as
parts of his outward worship and figures of

they minded not the Lamb of God, nor
sought after the unleavened bread of sincerity

they looked no farther than the beast that was

so far from this, that when Christ according
to the antient Prophesies and types, had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

the world, they made his death an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of stumbling, and took that to be an
argument that he was not the Christ, which
was one of the main evidences that he was
the Christ. In their legal washings, how
did they rest in the purifying of the flesh,
without any care to wash their hearts from
wickedness? Did not they rest in the High-priest

He-Goats. Though these were more costly,
yet they were more forward in these services
than in moral duties, cleansing their hearts
and hands from sin, &amp;c. Is there not a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
evidence of this in the actings of those
<hi>Iews</hi> who killed the Lord of life?<note place="margin">Joh. 18. 28, 29, 38.</note> They
seemed to be so scrupulous in point of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,<note place="margin">ch. 19. 4.</note>
that they would not enter into the
Court or Judgement-Hall, least they should be
defiled, but that they might eat the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,<note place="margin">ver. 13.</note>
and therefore <hi>Pilate</hi> the Judge was fain
to come out of the Court and wait upon
them to hear what they could say against him,
and it seemeth being wearied with going in
and out, at last he removed and sate upon a
Judgement-Seat without doors: in the mean
time, these wicked murtherers were so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
bent to shed innocent blood, that they
defiled themselves with the guilt of a most
heinous sin, straining at a Gnat, and swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Camel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. They rested on it as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness to Justification.</note> It seemeth they relied upon these
Ceremonies, <hi>or the observation of them,</hi> as a



<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99532:52"/>
part of that righteousness whereby they hoped
to be justified in the sight of God. <hi>The Lord
having planted a Church at</hi> Antioch,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Certain
men which came down from</hi> Iudea, <hi>taught
the Brethren,</hi> Except ye be circumcised after
the manner of Moses ye cannot be saved. <hi>Saith
the Apostle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 3, 4.</note> I testifie again to every man that
is Circumcised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he is a debtor to do the
whole Law. Christ is become of none effect to
you. Whosoever of you are justified by the Law,
ye are fallen from Grace. <hi>Doth not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
that they relied on the Ceremony of
Circumcision, in part for justification, and
under Circumcision I understand other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>I conceive it is very clear, that they
thought these legal Ceremonies were to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
ever unto the end of the world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. They thought these should be perpetuated to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> The Question is, How the Doctrine

doth establish this Law of Ceremonies. <hi>To
this I Answer, 1. Negatively.</hi>

               <hi>This doctrine of the Gospel

but on the contrary, <hi>take it away.</hi> So <hi>Stephen</hi>

               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:99532:52"/>
should change the customes delivered by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
told the <hi>Iews,</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> said unto the
children of <hi>Israel, A Prophet shall the Lord
your God raise up unto you of your Brethren like
unto me, him shall ye hear.</hi> The Lord Christ
was the great Propher, by whose spirit <hi>Moses</hi>
and the rest of the Prophets were inspired.
And as he had directed <hi>Moses</hi> to deliver these
Ceremonial ordinances to <hi>Israel,</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
untill his manifestation in the flesh,
and departure out of the world again: so
now he was to be heard as one of unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
authority, declaring unto the Church
his will and pleasure, concerning the ceasing
of these observances. That passage between
the Lord Christ and the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
is notable to this purpose: He by telling her
of her sinful course, had convinced her thus
far, that she made this acknowledgement,
<hi>Sir I perceive thou art a Prophet,</hi> and therefore
it seemeth thought that he might be able to
resolve a Question of great moment,<note place="margin">Joh. 4. 19, 20. 21.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
she desired satisfaction, and that was this,
<hi>Our Fathers worshipped in this Mountain, and
ye say that in Hierusalem is the place wherein
men out to worship the Father.</hi> I conceive,
the occasion of this controversie between the
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> was this; The <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>
were the posterity of those Heathens
whom <hi>Salmanasser</hi> King of <hi>Assyria</hi> had placed
there instead of the <hi>Israelites</hi> whom he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away Captive, and embraced a corrupt
Religion mixed of Heathenisme and Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme.
Toward the end of the <hi>Persian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,



<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99532:53"/>
               <hi>Manasses</hi> the Brother of <hi>Iaddus</hi> the
High-Priest married the Daughter of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat</hi>
a prime man of <hi>Samaria:</hi> whereupon
he was required of his Brother to lay down
his office, his Marriage being condemned by
the Law. <hi>Manasses</hi> acquainted <hi>Sanballat</hi> with
his loss, and let him know that though he
loved his Daughter, yet he would not for
her sake lose so great a dignity as that of the
Priesthood. <hi>Sanballat</hi> answered him, that if
he would keep his Daughter for his wife, he
would make him an High-priest, and with
the license and consent of <hi>Darius</hi> King of
<hi>Persia</hi> build a Temple upon Mount <hi>Gerizim</hi>
for that purpose. But <hi>Darius</hi> being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
in battel soon after by <hi>Alexander</hi> of
<hi>Macedon,</hi> he made this suit to him, bringing
him eight thousand Souldiers to serve him in
the Wars, and readily obtained his desire.
So that this became a receptacle to divers
fugitive or apostate <hi>Iews,</hi> who were guilty
of breaking the Law by pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aning the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
eating meats forbidden, or the like
crimes. This Temple having stood about
200 years, was ruined by <hi>Hircanus,</hi> about a
hundred years before Christ his coming in
the flesh or more. Now as they that embrace
errours and corrupt inventions of men in
things pertaining to Religion and religious
worship, are obstinate in cleaving to their
fancies: so the <hi>Samaritans</hi> would make
comparisons between their Temple which
was founded without warrant from God,
yea, against his word, and the Temple



<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99532:53"/>
of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> which the Lord owned for the
peculiar place of his worship. Yea, and after
their Temple was laid desolate, they seemed
to please themselves with the imagination
of the holiness of the ground on which it
once stood; and therefore saith the woman,
our Fathers worshipped in this Mountain, &amp;c.
as if Mount <hi>Gerizim</hi> were still an holy
Mount, though the Temple was down: and
so there was great enmity between the <hi>Iews</hi>
and <hi>Samaritans.</hi> But observe the Answer
which the Lord Christ gave her, Jesus saith
unto her, <hi>Woman beleeve me, the hour cometh
when ye shall neither in this Mountain, nor yet
at Hierusalem worship the Father. Ye worship
ye know not what: we know what we worship;
for salvation is of the Iews. But the hour
cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
shall worship the Father in spirit and Truth, for
the Father seeketh such to wrship him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God is
a Spirit, and they that worship him, must wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him in spirit and in Truth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 25. 26.</note> 
               <hi>The woman
saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which
is called Christ: when he is come he will tell us
all things. Iesus saith unto her, I that speak
unto thee am he.</hi> I conceive in this Answer,
the Lord Christ sheweth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That both the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> were
in an errour: for it seemeth both of them
thought that the Lord had confined his most
solemn worship to one certain place through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all ages, as one party said at Mount <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizim,</hi>
the other at <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> and that the
Ceremonies and Sacrifices there used should



<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99532:54"/>
be alwaies continued: Bus the Lord Christ
told the woman, that God had not limited
himself to either of these places, and that
the time was now at hand, when it should
be as free to worship God in any other place,
as in either of these.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He passeth sentence for the <hi>Iews</hi> against
the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in this Controversie. So far
as concerned the present state of things, saith
he, ye <hi>(scil.</hi> ye <hi>Samaritans)</hi> worship ye know
not what: We <hi>(scil.</hi> we <hi>Iews)</hi> know what
we worship, for salvation is of the <hi>Iews.</hi>
Ye <hi>Samaritans</hi> do ye know not what in your
worshipping, ye know not God aright, ye
have no warrant from his word, either for
your Temple, once standing on this Mount,
or for limiting the worship of God to this
place, or for the way of worship; Ye blindly
follow the groundless Traditions of your
Fathers: But we know what we worship,
we follow the directions of God himself, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, both for
the place and manner of Gods worship, for
salvation is of the <hi>Iews.</hi> They are the Church
of God to whom God hath committed his
oracles, teaching the way of Salvation, and
of whom as concerning the flesh, Christ
the Saviour of the world was to come.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He confirmeth and amplifieth the first
part of his Answer, shewing that the Lord
in a short time would set up a more spiritual
way of worship in his Church, more sutable
to his spiritual Nature, to which these carnal
ordinances and Ceremonial ordinances should
give place.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:99532:54"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Affirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> 
               <hi>I Answer affirmatively, that the
doctrine of the Gospel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. shewing how Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies attain'd their proper end.</note> and in particular, this
Gospel-doctrine of free justification through
the righteousness of Christ, doth establish the
Ceremonial Law. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Then is a thing established,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Leading to Christ.</note> 
               <hi>when it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
its proper end.</hi> Now by the Gospel,
the Law of Ceremonies attained its proper
end: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The end of it was,</hi> to be a School-master
<hi>to bring men to Christ.</hi> Circumcision sealed
the righteousness of faith, which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
it self could not give, but was to be
found in Christ: it taught men to look after
the Circumcision of the heart which was to
be had in Christ alone, by union with him,
by faith, and partaking of his spirit. The
Passeover pointed out unto them Christ, the
Lamb of God without spot, which taketh
away the sins of the world. The Sacrifices
directed them to Christ the perfect Sacrifice.
The blood of the Sacrifices led them to the
sprinkling of the blood of Christ, which
alone was sufficient to take away sin. Now
these and other Ceremonies attained their
end in Christ, and in the justification of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
through the blood, death, satisfaction,
righteousness of Christ apprehended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by faith, according to the doctrine of
the Gospel, and so this Law of Ceremonies
was established, and the validity of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
But on the other side, they that
pretend so much zeal for Circumcision and
other Ceremonies of the Law, making it a



<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99532:55"/>
part of the matter of their justification, and
resting in the bare outward observance as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to the Lord in it self did cross the main
end of the Ceremonial Law, and propose
such false ends as were impossible to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Shewing that they were not empty appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, but Types of great things.</note> 
               <hi>The doctrine of the Gospel,</hi> making
Christ the end of the Law for righteousness,
in whom wisdom, righteousness, sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
redemption and salvation alone is to
be had, <hi>sheweth that the Ceremonial Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
were no empty shadowes and vain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,</hi>
like those of the Heathen, <hi>but
significant signs and Types full of deep Mysteries
of exceeding great weight and importance,</hi> point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the person of the Lord Jesus, his office,
his actings, his sufferings, and the fruits and
benefits of these: whereas they that so stiffely
opposed the strict observation of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Law against the doctrine of
Christ delivered in the Gospel, what did they
make of them but begerly elements, empty
appearances without fruit, use or profit? So
that the Preachers of the Gospel did honour
the Ceremonial Law, though they took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the observation of them, by declaring the
substance whereof they were shadowes; and
the observers of the Ceremonies in the times
of the Gospel did greatly disparage them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Illustrating by them it self, and the great Mystery of Christ.</note> 
               <hi>The doctrine of the Gospel doth still esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the Ceremonial Law, as an illustration of the
mystery of Christ in the Gospel,</hi> and sheweth that
great use may still be made of them that way:
for the Ceremonies were as it were visible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies



<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99532:55"/>
of Christ, and the things of Christ.
And as Prophesies are dark before they are
fulfilled, but clear after they are accomplished,
and do much illustrate the events: so these
Ceremonies were obscure resemblances of
Christ; but now since what they signified is
fulfilled, the comparing the Types with the
Antitypes giveth much light.</p>
            <p>The Use which I intend to make of this
point is,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> to compare some of the principal
Ceremonies of the old Testament, with the
Mysteries of the Gospel, that so we may more
clearly see how they are established by Christ,
and that we may improve them for our edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
And first to begin with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Ceremonial Law; and there
in,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Circumcision.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> The institution of this
Sacrament is laid down,<note place="margin">1. Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion instituted.</note> 
               <hi>Genesis</hi> the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenth:
saith the Lord to <hi>Abraham, This is
my Covenant which ye shall keep between me and
you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>and thy seed after thee: every man child
among you shall be Circumcised, and ye shall
Circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it
shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and
you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 10. 16. and what it signified.</note> And elsewhere <hi>Moses</hi> saith to the people
of <hi>Israel, Circumcise the foreskin of your heart
and be no more stiffe-necked.</hi> This sheweth that
the Circumcision of the flesh directed them
to the inward Circumcision of the heart, the
mortification of sinful lusts, inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
and all sorts of corruptions. To
which agreeth that of the Apostle, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
is that of the heart in the spirit, and



<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99532:56"/>
not in the letter, whose praise is not of men
but of God.<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> The same Apostle saith that
<hi>Abraham received the sign of Circumcision and
seal of the righteousness of faith.</hi> These Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
compared together, shew that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
did seal the Covenant of Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and his people: on the one side
confirming the promises of God to them, as
a seal added to the blood of his Covenant,
on the other side engaging them to answer
the ends of the Covenant by Circumcising
their hearts, mortifying their corruptions,
and forsaking their sins. The sum of Gods,
promises sealed by the Sacrament of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
is delivered in these words, <hi>I will
establish my Covenant between me and thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 7. 17.</note> 
               <hi>and
thy seed after thee in their generations for an
everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto thee and
to thy seed after thee.</hi> I conceive this conteineth
as much as all the promises of the Gospel:
For what is there in all the promises concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
pardon of sin, justification, adoption,
the graces of Sanctification, the comforts and
joyes of the holy Ghost, Communion with
God, strength against temptation, protection
against the assaults of Satan and the world,
hearing and answering of prayers, support
under afflictions, victory over death, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life and salvation, and other promises
and priviledges granted to Believers in the
Gospel, I say, what is there in all these
which is not comprehended in this promise,
<hi>I will be their God?</hi> God is all sufficient, he
is all in all, and when he giveth himself he



<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99532:56"/>
giveth all good things and blessings; and this
was sealed by Circumcision: Now this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and Covenant is fulfilled in Christ; for
out of Christ, men and women are both
strangers and Enemies to God, and have no
interest in him. The Lord is so far from
being their God, that he is their Enemy,
saith the Apostle, <hi>When we were Enemies we
were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note>
The best of men and women are in a state of
enmity with God until they are reconciled by
Christ. And that Covenant sealed by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
wherein the Lord promised to be the
God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of his seed was the same
for substance with that where he saith,<note place="margin">Gen. 12. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>I will
bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou
shalt be a blessing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 18.</note> 
               <hi>and I will bless them that
bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee, and
in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</hi>
I conceive the promise of Christ is twice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
here: when it is said, <hi>I will make thee
a blessing;</hi> and again, <hi>in thee shall all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of the earth be blessed. Abraham</hi> was
made a blessing, and the Nations and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of the Earth were blessed in him,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 3, 11.</note> in
this regard, because Christ according to the
flesh or humane nature was to issue out of his
loynes; according to that, in thy seed shall all
the nations of the earth be blessed, that is in
Christ. So that <hi>Abraham</hi> found that in
Christ which was sealed to him by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
<hi>Abraham believed God, and it was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him for righteousness, and he received the
sign of Circumcision, a seal of the righteousness



<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99532:57"/>
of faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised.</hi>
Circumcision attained its end in Christ, and
he was the substance of this shadow: in him
believers are reconciled to God, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
their God, and they are made his
people being justified by his righteousness;
and by his spirit they are circumcised in heart,
their corruptions are mortified, and their
body of sin destroyed, which is an evidence
of their union with Christ, and justification
by him: and this may move us to labour to
be found in Christ, that we may be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in heart, that the power of sin may be
killed in us, that we may be conformed unto
his death,<note place="margin">Cor. 4. 11.</note> our sinful lusts and affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
crucified by virtue of his death on the
Cross, that so as the Apostle saith, <hi>we may
be circumcised with the circumcision made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hands,</hi> in putting off the body of the
sins of the flesh by the Circumcision of
Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In as much as circumcision was a seal
of that Covenant whereby God gave himself
to his people to be their God in Christ, and
a seal of the righteousness of saith, and so
of the pardon of sin and justification through
the righteousness of Christ apprehended by
faith, It is clear, that all the Arguments of
the Anabaptists fall to the ground, which they
build either upon the pretended difference of
Baptisme and circumcision, or of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
sealed by them, or upon the incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Infants: for it is evident that the same
Covenant which is confirmed by Baptisme



<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99532:57"/>
was also sealed by circumcision, and if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
under the old Testament were capable
of circumcision, how are they made uncapable
of Baptism under the Gospel? And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
you may observe how the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
baptisme and circumcision together,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 10, 11, 12.</note>
and sheweth how the latter cometh in place
of the former; for having warned believers
not to hearken to those who would bring
them in bondage unto <hi>Iewish</hi> Ceremonies,
he telleth them, <hi>ye are compleat in hi, (scil.</hi>
in Christ) a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d so need not to observe those
shadows of the Law, <hi>in whom also ye are
circumcised with the circumcision made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hands, in putting off the body of the sins
of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.</hi> So that
they have the same circumcision in Christ w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
their Fathers had under the Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
needed not the outward circumcision:
But lest any should think thus, our faith under
the Gospel needeth outward helps to confirm
it, as well as theirs under the old Testament, he
addeth these words, ver. 12, <hi>Buried with
him in baptisme, wherein also ye are risen with
him through the faith of the operation of God
who hath raised him from the dead:</hi> as if he
had said, instead of Circumcision ye have

was <hi>this,</hi> that every family should
chuse a Lamb, a male of the first year with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
blemish: they were to separate it from
the rest of the flock on the tenth day of the

fourteenth day at even: when it was to be
killed, they were to take of the blood and
strike it upon the two side-posts, and on the
upper door-posts of the houses wherein the
Lambs was to be eaten, and the same night
they were commanded to eat the flesh of the
Lamb roasted with fire, and with unleaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
bread, and bitter herbs: but if any family
were too little for a Lamb, it was to joyne
with the next, and they were to eat it in
hast with their loines girded, their shoes on
their feet, and their staffe in their hand, as
men prepared to travel. The reason that
was given for it is this in effect, that the Lord

in Christ.</p>
            <p>First then,<note place="margin">1. Purity and perfection of Christ.</note> 
               <hi>The Lamb was a figure of Christ</hi>
whom <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> according to his office
pointed out to the people, saying, <hi>Behold the
Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the

               <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 29, 30.</note> and another day, <hi>Behold the Lamb of

God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 7.</note> And the Apostle saith, <hi>Christ our

               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.</note> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Ye were not redeemed with
corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, from
your vain conversation received by tradition from
your Fathers, but with the precious blood of
Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish and
without spot.</hi> As the Lamb appointed for
the Passeover was to be without blemish, so
Christ the Lamb of God was without all

conceived by the divine power of the holy

as the Lamb of the Passeover was taken from
the rest of the flock, so Christ in regard of
his humane Nature was taken from the rest of
mankind, and made one person with the Son
of God, that he might be all-sufficient for
this great end, <hi>scil. to take away the sins of the

righteousness, is to be applied to

in him, and in that sense established.
And in particular, this is declared in the
doctrine of justification through the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

the destroyer: so those souls who by faith

it profited the <hi>Israelites</hi> that the Lamb for the

It is conceived that this Sabbath, or day of
rest, was the first day of unleavened bread,
<hi>scil.</hi> the fifteenth day of the first month, on
whatsoever day of the week it fell, but in
the year wherein Christ suffered, it fell upon
the last day of the week, so that it was a
double Sabbath; the paschal Sabbath and
the weekly Sabbath meeting together upon
the same day. Now the sheaf of first-fruits
was to be waved or offered before the Lord
on the morrow after the Sabbath, which was
the day on which Christ rose from the dead.

and the substance, that the Lord Christ arose
from the dead, the very same day that the

he arose as the first fruits of them that slept,

that as the first fruits being offered to God,
did sanctifie the whole increase of the fruits
of the earth that year; so Christ as the first
fruits of the dead arose from death to eternal
life and glory; and in himself, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
did as it were offer up to God the
dead bodies of all his members, not always
to lye under the power of death and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but to be raised to immortality and

part in the first resurrection, rising with
Christ by virtue of his quickning spirit to
newness of life, that this may be an earnest

This may teach us that none was fit to offer
an offering to the Lord, but only the Lord
Jesus Christ, and those that come to God by
him; for all mankind since the fall were a far

of Christ, there is no coming nigh unto God
but by him, neither in respect of our estate,
nor of our services, but in Christ there is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to be had in both respects. But more
especially,</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> 
               <hi>The burntoffering.</hi> This was called
in Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifieth <hi>ascending</hi>
or <hi>ascension,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Special consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of burntofferings.</note> because <hi>all the flesh of the beast

                  </gap> the meaning of it 1. in its ascension.</note> so the Lord
Jesus Christ when he was here on earth in
the flesh, offered up himself to his father in
heaven; the infinite virtue of his Sacrifice
ascending to the Throne of God, for the
appeasing of his wrath and satisfying of his
justice for sin. This may teach us also that
we should present our whole selves, souls and
bodies, sacrifices living holy acceptable to God,
and that they which will thus present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Lord must be heavenly minded,
their souls and hearts must be raised and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
upward: How many carnal, outward,
dead hearted services are dropped down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, that never ascend upward,
having nothing of heaven nor of Christ his
spirit in them.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. The offerer laid his hand on the head thereof. ver. 4.</note> 
               <hi>He that offered the burntoffering
was to lay his hand upon the head of the creature

by the sacrifice of Christ, must lay hold of
him by the hand of faith.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. The Bullock to be killed and the blood poured out.</note> 
               <hi>The Bullock for the burntoffering
was to be killed, the blood of it to be poured out:</hi>
this, 1. was fulfilled in Christ, according as it



<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99532:65"/>
was Prophesied of him,<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12.</note> He is brought as a

<hi>Daniel</hi> Prophesied that Messiah or Christ
should be cut off or slain,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 26.</note> and without shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of blood there is no remission.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This may move Christians to pitty,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> and
earnestly pray for the poor blinded <hi>Israelites,</hi>
that the Lord would be pleased to take the

to consider that they should make the Cross
and death of Christ a stumbling block,
whereas his death and sufferings are so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
foretold in the Law and the Prophets which
themselves acknowledge to be the word of
God? Yea, all those millions of sacrific<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

slain and offered according to the Lord his
appointment, did clearly foreshew the death
of Christ, and the shedding of his most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
blood for the sins of the world. But
how is man left to the darkness of his own
mind, and blinded by Satan?</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> 
               <hi>See here how odious sin is in the
sight of God which nothing could wash away but
the blood of Christ, figured by the death and
blood of these legal Sacrifices:</hi> for it is not
possible that the blood of Bulls and Goats
should take away sins,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 4.</note> these did signifie the
blood of the Son of God infinitely more
pretious, of sufficient virtue to wash away the
greatest and foulest sins. How should we



<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99532:65"/>
tremble at sin? Should we not look upon
every sin as bloody, as murtherous, either as
slaying the sinner himself, or as killing his
Saviour? either thy sin must be washed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with the blood of Christ, or it will
cost thee more then thy best blood is worth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> 
               <hi>This is for comfort to souls bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
and oppressed with the guilt of sin,</hi> that
that one sacrifice even Christ himself, figured
by so many millions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> sacrifices is offered to
satisfie for sin;<note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> that that blood figured by
the blood of so many offerings is shed to take
away sin; and that God hath purchased his
Church with his own blood: it is the blood
of God because of him who is God and man
in one person,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 7.</note> though not the blood of the
God-head. The blood of Jesus Christ the
Son of God cleanseth from all sin; it is of
infinite value, it is of more virtue then all
the bloody sacrifices of the Law.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Woe unto those wretches that dare to
swear prophanely by this pretious blood, or
by those bleeding wounds of the Son of God.
Is not this to trample under foor the blood

seek pardon of God for their dayly sins and

               <hi>First,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> Here we have an other evidence of
the wonderful abasement of the Lord of
glory; thrust out of the Camp, out of the
City, as an outcast, as an unclean and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thing: so extreamly was he vilified, whom
all the Angels of God worship, and to whom
every knee must bow of those in heaven, &amp;c,
And therefore let us make the same use of it
as was formerly hinted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> In particular, let us make the
use of it which the Apostle points us to;<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 13.</note> Let
us go forth therefore unto him without the
Camp, bearing his reproach. Both <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> conspired together in Crucifying the
Lord Christ, and therefore Believers must
go out of the <hi>Iews</hi> Camp, and out of the
worlds Camp, bearing the reproach of Christ;
they must not joyn with the obstinate <hi>Iews</hi>
in observing legal Ceremonies, nor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to the world, but labour to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to a crucified Saviour, and be content



<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99532:69"/>
to endure scorn, reproach, persecution, for
Christ, following the Lamb whithersoever he
goeth. Many will seem to close with Christ
if they can find him in the Camp, if they
can enjoy their credit, their favour with the
world, their earthly interests: But how few
will go forth to him out of the Camp, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his reproach, so as to be rejected by the
world, and dealt with as outcasts and the
off scouring of all things? For saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>here have we no continuing City, but
we seek one to come.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 14.</note> If Christ suffered without
the Gate of the City, let us not be so affected
as if this world were the place of our rest;
Let us not mind earthly things, let us have
our conversation in Heaven, labouring to
make sure of our interest in that everlasting
inheritance; Let us therefore fear lest a promise
being left us of entring into his rest, any of
you should seem to come short of it. The
Apostle urgeth from this Type of the sin-offering,
that they which would still rest in
the observation of <hi>Iewish</hi> Ceremonies had
no right in Christ,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 1.</note> We have an Altar where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they have no right to eat which serve the
Tabernacle, for the bodies, &amp;c. as before.
The bodies of the sin-offerings were burnt
without the Camp,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 19.</note> and so the Priest did eat
no part of their flesh, whereby was signified
that they who would feed upon Christ, and
partake of the benefit of his sacrifice, must
leave the Tabernacle or Temple, Priesthood,
Sacrifices, Ceremonies of the Law, now that
Christ hath suffered; for thus are all esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished



<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99532:69"/>
by Christ, not so as to be observed
much less to be rested in, but so as to attain
their end in Christ, in whom it appeareth that
they are no empty shadowes, but lively types
of great and weighty Mysteries whereof also
they are useful illustrations.</p>

               <hi>I proceed to somewhat of meat-offerings.</hi>
It seemeth these were sometimes
offered by themselves, and sometimes joyned
with other sacrifices, as they were offered
by themselves, we have them set down <hi>Lev.</hi> 2.
The original word is taken for a <hi>gift</hi> or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:</hi>
so these meat-offerings were to be given
and presented to the Lord, and this offering
was to be <hi>fine flower of the purest part of the

               <note place="margin">Of what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fine flower. Of the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> and so it is conceived to signifie the
<hi>perfect purity of Christ</hi> offering himself to God
for his people, resembled by pure flower with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any mixture of bran. The Lord Christ
is brought in speaking to his Father, <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and offering thou wouldst not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 5, 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>but a body
hast thou prepared me, in burnt offerings and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then
said I, Loe I come (in the volumn of the book
it is written of me) to do thy will O God.</hi> I
conceive here those three sorts of sacrifices
are mentioned, <hi>burnt-offerings, sin-offerings,</hi>
and <hi>meat-offerings,</hi> none of these could satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the justice of God for the sins of men,
and therefore he prepared or fitted a body
for his Son, an humane nature fitted to suffer
for the sins of men, a pure humane nature
(as the pure flower of wheat) by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
operation of the holy Ghost. This



<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99532:70"/>
humane nature united in one person with the
Son of God, was sufficient to make full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to the infinite justice of God, which
all the sacrifices of the Law could not do.
In respect of his body or humane nature,
he was fitted for a sacrifice; in respect of his
God-head, he was an all sufficient sacrifice
of infinite value. Labour then to lay hold
on Christ by faith, and to turn to the Lord
by repentance, that ye may have interest in
this most pretious offering, this compleat and
most perfect sacrifice, every way fitted for
this use; for as Christ is the only Son of
God, he is most nigh unto the Father, the
same God with the Father, and infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of the Father, of infinite worth and
excellency, and so able to make full satisfaction
to his justice: As he is the Son of man, so
he is nigh unto men, their Brother, one of
the seed of that woman who was the Mother
of all living, one of the same nature, and
so of a nature fit to suffer, and therefore he
is able to save them to the uttermost that come
unto God by him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This meat offering of fine flower seemeth

beasts that were unclean under the Law, yet
the Apostle preaching the Gospel to them, and
the holy spirit of Christ working in and with

Where it is manifest that he is both the High-Priest
and the Sacrifice, both the offerer and
the offering; as he is the offering or sacrifice,
so he was figured by such sacrifices as those
formerly spoken of. As he is the offerer or
High-priest, so he is figured by the High-Priest



<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99532:81"/>
of the old Testament. None was worthy to
offer this sacrifice of infinite value but Christ
himself; and the infinite worth of Christ,
God and man, who as the High-Priest or
Sacrificer presented this offering to God the
Father, and the infinite worth of the same
Christ presented as an offering, may assure
the greatest sinners which truly turn to the
Lord and come to him, that there is enough
done to make atonement and reconciliation
between God and them; only take heed least
by neglecting so great salvation, the infinite
worth of the High Priest and sacrifice prove
in the Issue an aggravation of your guilt

and then fire the Incense, that the cloud of

second, <hi>sci.</hi> the most holy place, went the
High priest once every year, not without
blood, which he offered for himself, and for
the errours of the people, but Christ being



<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99532:81"/>
being become an High-Priest of good things
to come, by a greater and more perfect Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
not made with hands, that is to say,
not of this building, neither by the blood of
Goats and Calves, but by his own blood, he
entred once into the holy place having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
eternal Redemption: so that the merit
and virtue of Christ his most precious blood
is always presented before God in Heaven,
in behalf of those that truly lay hold on
Christ. Also the sweet incense put upon the
fire in the Golden Censer, and resting as a
cloud upon the mercy-seat, may teach us that
the sweet incense of Christ his sacrifice and
offering make way for the Persons, Prayers,
and services of Gods people, that so they
may approach to the mercy-seat or gracious
presence of God in Heaven. The blood also
sprinkled upon and before the Mercy-seat,
may note unto us, that the blood of Christ
procures mercy with God for repenting and
believing sinners, and maketh way for them
to draw nigh unto God. And so much for
this eminent Type of Christ. The High-Priest
of the old Testament figuring Christ
the eternal High-Priest.</p>
            <p>In the next place, somewhat might be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the inferiour Priests which were of
the posterity of <hi>Aaron.</hi> These I take to have
been Types of the Members of Christ, of
whom it is said, that Christ hath loved
them,<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 5, 6.</note> and washed them from their sins in his
own blood,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> and made them Kings and Priests
unto God and his Father:<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> to whom also



<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99532:82"/>
               <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Ye are are a chosen generation a royal
Priesthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people.</hi> And
these are first to offer themselves as sacrifices
to God; <hi>I beseech you Brethren by the mercies
of God, that ye present your bodies,</hi> that is
I conceive, taking a part for the whole, their
bodies and souls, their whole selves, a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
living, holy, acceptable unto God. And
therefore all that will approve themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, must look upon themselves as under
a double consecration, as dedicated to God
under a twofold Notion and Respect, both
as Priests and as Sacrifices; How then should
they study, labour, and follow after holiness?
Both Priests and sacrifices under the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were consecrated to God as holy. He
that was unclean was not fit as a Priest to
sacrifice. How should they strive to be holy
as the Lord is holy, who should be both
Priests and Sacrifices? And therefore it is said,
<hi>Be not conformed to this world, but be ye trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the renewing of your mind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that ye
may prove what is that good, that perfect
and acceptable will of God.</hi> As the Priests
were chosen out and separated from other
men, and consecrated as holy to the Lord,
and the sacrifices were chosen out and severed
from the common herds and flocks, to be
offered up to God: so Christians must not be
conformed to this world, nor follow the
common throngs and herds according to the
course of the world, but be transformed,
new framed in conformity to Christ, that
they may be both Priests and sacrifices accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table



<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99532:82"/>
to the Lord. Secondly, as Priests of the
new Testament, they must offer holy services
and duties of obedience as spiritual sacrifices
to the Lord.<note place="margin">Psal. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Offer the sacrifices of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and put your trust in the Lord. The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
of God are a broken spirit: a broken and
a contrite heart O God thou wilt not despise.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 17.</note>
So the Apostle speaking of that contribution
which the <hi>Philippians</hi> sent unto him, being a
Prisoner for the Gospel of Christ, said, <hi>I
have all and abound,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 18.</note> 
               <hi>I am full having received
of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from
you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
well pleasing to the Lord.</hi> It might also
be noted how the Priests and <hi>Levites</hi> were
teachers in <hi>Israel,</hi> as Christ is the great Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
and Prophet of the Church: but I know
not whether herein he be not more lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by the Prophets of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
this belonging to his Prophetical of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
But here by the way, I think it seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to put you in mind that in all the new
Testament, I am confident it cannot be found
that the Ministers of the Gospel are called
Priests in respect of their particular calling
or office. The extraordinary Ministers are
called Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists: the
ordinary are termed Pastors, Teachers, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Bishops or Overseers, Elders or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
never Priests; for a Priest by office
is one that offereth sacrifice for Propitiation,
for appeasing the wrath of God: and so
there is no Priest of the new Testament but
the Lord Jesus Christ: and therefore when



<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99532:83"/>
prophane persons do in scorn call the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the Gospel Priests, they commit a
double sin, and shew double prophaneness:
1. Attributing that name to them which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
proper to Christ. 2. Accounting that Title
of Christ a word of reproach. And therefore
I find not, that Ministers of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are any where called Priests in Scripture,
but only as all other true believers are, which
Christ hath made Kings and Priests to off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

What! know ye not that the body is
the Temple of the holy Ghost which is in

and dedicated to God as his Temple for him
to dwell in by his spirit. The body is as it

and dedicated to the most holy God,
and sanctified to his holy services and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and were to be kept holy free from

and to be kept from all filthiness of flesh

when they are defiled by sin, the Lord is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured

of them more some less, according to their

threatning formerly mentioned, <hi>If any man

As ye desire the salvation of your souls and

take heed of defiling these Temples of God,
make a through search, and cast out all the

and it is as free for an people as for

both was declared to <hi>Peter</hi> by a vision and a

Captain being directed by an Angel to send
for <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 10. 10, 11, &amp;c.</note> the Lord prepared this Apostle

               <hi>wherein were all manner
of four-footed beasts, and wild-beasts, and creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things, and Fowls of the Air; and there
came a voice to him, Rise Peter, kill and eat,
but Peter said, not so Lord, for I have never
eaten any thing common or unclean. And the
voice spake unto him again the second time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
what God hath cleansed, that call not thou
common.</hi> Now when <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>
and his company, <hi>He said unto them,
ye know how that it is an unlawful thing
for a man that is a Iew to keep company,
or come unto one of another Nation, but God
hath shewed me that I should not call any
common or unclean.</hi> The Lord spake of
beasts, &amp;c. <hi>Peter</hi> rightly applyeth it to
men: so that the Lord Christ took away
the difference of clean and unclean that
was under the Ceremonial Law, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
men of several Nations, and between
other Creatures. How should we in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
stir up our selves to be thankful to
the Lord, that he hath reserved us for these
times, wherein it is as free for us descended



<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99532:92"/>
from Heathen Ancestors, to partake of the
Priviledges of God his Covenant, as for the
people of <hi>Israel;</hi> yea, when the <hi>Israelites</hi>
being natural branches are cut off through
unbelief, we may be grafted in by faith.
Let us take heed then least our unbelief,
impenitency, security, deprive us of this
blessed priviledge; for though none now are
unclean, in respect of the Nation whereof
they are, more then others, yet all are unclean
in the sight of God, who remain dead in
trespasses and sins, out of Christ, whose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not renewed and cleansed from their
filthiness.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Observe with thankfulness the liberal
use of the Creatures which God hath given
to his people now under the new Testament
through Christ, above that which he allowed
the people of <hi>Israel</hi> under the old Testament,
for now every Creature of God is good, and
nothing to be refused if it be received with
thanksgiving.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 4.</note> Nothing that is wholesome
for mans body is to be refused as unlawful:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 23.</note>
and so the same Apostle saith, <hi>All things are
lawful for me,</hi> viz. <hi>all sorts of meats,</hi> for of
such things he speaketh in that place; and
therefore whereas blood in particular was
forbidden under the old Testament, it is now
lawful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it hath been objected that blood was
forbidden upon a moral reason,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obj.</note> taken from the
Nature of the the thing forbidden, because
the blood is called the life of the Creature.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
For answer I conceive,<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 4.</note> this is no <hi>moral reason,</hi>



               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:99532:93"/>
but a <hi>natural reason, implying a mystery,</hi> scil.
to shew <hi>that men should abhor cruelty and
bloodshed:</hi> and so I suppose if we did through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand the Natures of all the Creatures
which the <hi>Israelites</hi> were forbidden to eat;
there might be some natural reason given for
it comprehending the Mystery. Again, it
seemeth there was also a farther Mystery in
the prohibition of blood;<note place="margin">Lev. 3. 17.</note> for eating of blood
and fat are both forbidden together; <hi>scil.</hi>
such fat as used to be sacrificed, because the
blood and fat were both in a peculiar manner
to be offered unto God. The blood poured
forth signified the taking away the guilt of
sin by the death of Christ and shedding of his
blood. The burning of the fat (it seemeth)
signified the mortification of sin by the spirit
of Christ; and so they might be forbidden
both the eating the blood and fat, to teach
all not to take to themselves the honour ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their justification or of their sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
but to ascribe it wholly unto
Christ.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be said,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> that blood was forbidden
after Christ his death and resurrection, by the
Apostles and Elders in the Synod of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note>
               <hi>I Answer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was but a temporary decree imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> that they might not
give offence to weak believers among the <hi>Iews</hi>
who were not yet clearly satisfied about the
abolishing of legal Ceremonies, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of that Christian liberty which Christ
had given them.</p>

               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:99532:93"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>

earth:</hi> after ye are thus fitted and enabled
for so great a work, ye shall go over the
large field of the world to bring in mine
Harvest; and accordingly at this feast of
Harvest, the day of Pentecost, the Lord Christ
sent down his spirit upon them, wonderfully
enabling them for this service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Feast.</note> There was a third feast, <hi>scil.</hi> the
Feast of <hi>Ingathering,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 16.</note> at the end of the year,
when they had gathered in their labours out
of the field;<note place="margin">Lev. 23. 34, 39. 40.</note> I conceive when the last of
their fruits, their vintage or Grapes, &amp;c. were
gathered in: This I take to be the same which
is called <hi>the feast of Tabernacles:</hi> This was
to begin on the fifteenth of the seventh month
which seemeth to answer to our <hi>September,</hi>



               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:99532:95"/>
and continued seven days; and again, it is
said to be at the time when they had gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the fruit of the Land; and they were
commanded to take boughs of goodly trees,
branches of Palm-trees, and the boughs of
thick trees,<note place="margin">ver. 42, 43.</note> and willows of the Brook, and
to rejoyce before the Lord their God seven
days; they were also commanded to dwell
in Boothes seven days, that their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
might know that the Lord made the
Children of <hi>Israel</hi> to dwell in Booths when
he brought them out of the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 8. 15, 16.</note>
This feast was solemnly kept after the peoples
return from Captivity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This again may stir up Christians to
thankfulness unto the Lord for all his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
and particularly for the fruits of the
earth as before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This dwelling in Booths and slight
Tents or Tabernacles made of green boughs
in memory of their condition when they
came out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the house of
bondage, may teach Christians often to call
to mind their afflictions and low condition
out of which the Lord hath at any time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
them; especially they that are in Christ
should often and seriously remember that
woful bondage and misery under sin and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and the danger of condemnation, out
of which the Lord Christ hath delivered them,
and labour to be exceedingly thankful for
it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They were to go out of their dwelling houses
to dwell in booths</hi> when they had gathered in



<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99532:95"/>
their fruits, least when their barns and store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses
were plentifully filled they might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
God who gave them all these things, and
set their hearts upon the Creatures, resting
in their outward enjoyments, giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up to voluptuousness, like him spoken
of, Luk. 12. <hi>Soul thou hast goods laid up for
many years, eat, drink and be merry: but God
said unto him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>thou fool this night shall thy
soul be required of thee; then whose shall those
things be which thou hast provided?</hi> Learn then
in the midst of the greatest abundance, to
raise up your hearts above all earthly things,
to make God your portion, to walk with
him in the light of his Countenance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>This dwelling in Booths or Tabernacles may
teach Christians to be affected as strangers here
on earth,</hi> having no continuing City in this
world, their bodies being slight and weak
frames easily dissolved, like summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses
made of green boughs that will sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
wither; labour then to make sure of
a building of God, an house not made with
hands, eternal in the Heavens, purchased by
the blood of Christ for all those that are
sound in him: in as much as ye have no
continuing City here, seek one to come, and
labour for sound evidence to clear your title
to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Besides these three great feasts,
<hi>there was to be a memorial of blowing the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
upon the first of the same seventh month;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 23. 24, 27.</note>
and then upon the tenth day of that month,
a day of Atonement, solemne humiliation,



<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99532:96"/>
repentance, and afflicting the soul: so the
silver Trumpet being sounded in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the word, summons the hearers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
to afflict their souls, to abase and
humble themselves, to turn to the Lord with
all their hearts,<note place="margin">Isa. 58. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Cry aloud, spare not, lift up
thy voice like a Trumpet and shew my people their
transgressions and the house of Iacob their sins.</hi>
This silver Trumpet was sounded by <hi>Iohn</hi>
Baptist preaching in the wilderness of <hi>Iudea,</hi>
and saying,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 1. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Repent ye for the Kingdom of
Heaven is at hand,</hi> for this is he that was spoken
of by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> saying; <hi>The voice of
one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way
of the Lord, make his paths strait.</hi> Yea, the
Lord Christ himself in his own person soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this Silver Trumpet, <hi>From that time
Iesus began to preach and to say Repent for the
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> He who gave
himself for a sacrifice, and poured forth his
blood to make atonement and reconciliation
between God and sinners, did preach repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to them to prepare them for atonement
and reconciliation. It is very lamentable to
consider how many live under the sound of
the Silver Trumpet many years, and yet are
not prepared for atonement and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God through Christ, nor brought to
the beginnings of sound and saving repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
but either are secure, careless, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
minding earthly things, or resting
in outward performances, or openly profane
and wicked. Oh how dreadful will the sound
of that Trumpet be at the last day? <hi>for the



<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99532:96"/>
Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with
a shout, with the voice of the Arch-Angel, and
with the Trumpet of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thes. 4. 16.</note> I say how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
shall the sound of that Trumpet be to
such who go on hardning their hearts in
security and impenitency against the sound
of the Silver Trumpet of the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The day of atonement and humiliation
was about four or five days before the feast
of Tabernacles wherein they were to rejoyce
before the Lord: so sincere humiliation and
repentance make way for sound spiritual
<hi>joy;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Blessed are they that mourn for they
shall be comforted;</hi> godly sorrow maketh
way for heavenly rejoycing: But when a man
goeth on to glut himself with the pleasures
of sins or earthly contents, not afflicting his
soul for sin, he hath no part in this spiritual
feast: to such belongs that sad threatning,
<hi>Wo unto you that laugh now,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 6. 23.</note> 
               <hi>for ye shall mourn
and weep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Consider their manifold washings
with water in divers Cases, to purifie themselves
from legal uncleannesses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 14. 6, 7, 9. &amp; 15. 13.</note> Ceremonial pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
as when any was cleansed from the
Leprosie he was to be sprinkled with water
mingled with blood seven times, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to wash both his cloaths and his body
in water; so they that had running issues
when they were cleansed from them, were
commanded to wash their cloaths and their
bodies in water, and so in divers other Cases.
Now the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> proves that the Lord
<hi>Jesus</hi> is The Christ,<note place="margin">1 Joh, 5. 6, 8. 10.</note> thus, <hi>This is he that



<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99532:97"/>
came by water and blood, even Iesus Christ, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
by water only, but by water and blood, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
is the spirit that beareth witness, because the
spirit is Truth:</hi> whereas there was great use
of water and blood in the Law of Ceremonies,
the blood of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and the water
many wayes used for cleansing and purifying,
it sheweth that all these things were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
in Christ, and attained their end in
him, he performed and fulfilled what was
signified and typified both by water and
blood. His blood was shed as the blood of
the most perfect sacrifice to take away the
guilt of sin, and to justifie sinners and save
them from condemnation; and the sanctifying
spirit and grace of Christ, cleansing his people
from the filth of sin, washing their hearts
from wickedness, and making them holy as
he is holy, and therefore he addeth, <hi>ver. 8,
there are three that bear witness in earth, the
spirit, the water, and the blood.</hi> And <hi>ver. 10,
He that believeth hath the witness in himself;</hi>
He that savingly believeth in Christ, being
united to him by faith, hath this threefold
witness in himself: the spirit of Christ wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing
with his spirit that he is in Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to God by Christ, an adopted child
and Heir of God through Christ the only
begotten Son of God, and Heir of all things:
the blood of Christ cleansing his Conscience
from the guilt of sin; the grace of Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
by water, sanctifying him and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
him to Christ in holiness; so that
such an one hath an evidence in his own



<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99532:97"/>
soul, both that Jesus is the very Christ, and
that he is his Christ; for he findeth that Christ
hath fulfilled that in and upon his soul which
was figured by the blood and water under
the Law of Ceremonies. This is a blessed
and most precious priviledge which all that
are under the Gospel should labour with all
diligence to make their own. Oh, what
an happiness is it for Christians to have this
threefold witness in themselves! <hi>In the mouth
of two or three witnesses shall every word be
established.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 1.</note> Here are three witnesses beyond
exception. A Christian having this three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sold
witness in himself, in the poorest out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
estate, is richer and happier, then all the
treasures of the earth and all the Kingdoms
of the world can make him; but how few
are they that have any other witness of their
interest in Christ but their own fancy? how
few do seriously and diligently seek for any
other? In that great and last day, how will
ye stand in the presence of God when num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless
sins are charged upon you? Will ye
say Christ hath satisfied for your sins, what
shall this profit you unless ye be united unto
Christ? Will ye plead that ye believe in
Christ, and so are made one with him, where
is your witness? Oh take heed of appearing
before the all-seeing God without a witness?
And therefore I beseech you consider seriously
of your condition, and rest not till ye are
in Christ, and until he come into your souls
both by water and blood, and give you the
witness of his spirit.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:99532:98"/>
2. Those frequent washings under the
Law of Ceremonies, may stir up Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to frequent endeavours dayly to
purifie themselves as Christ is pure,<note place="margin">2 Joh. 3. 3.</note> to
cleanse themselves from all filthiness of flesh
and spirit,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1.</note> perfecting holiness in the fear
of God,<note place="margin">Zach. 13. 1.</note> to draw cleansing and sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
virtue from Christ more and more by
faith. They were to wash their bodies and
cloaths, to be sprinkled with water seven
times. There is a fountain opened for
sin and for uncleanness, a fountain of most
precious blood, and water of most So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
virtue: the sufferings of Christ and
the grace of God are to wash away the
guilt of sin, and the uncleanness and pollution
of sin. Do not forsake your own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and neglect so great salvation. It is
sad that when such a precious fountain is
opened, so few are washed and cleansed.
Thus much concerning the Ceremonial Law,
to shew how and in what respects it is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by the doctrine of the Gospel.</p>

         <div n="7" type="chapter">
            <pb n="173" facs="tcp:99532:98"/>
            <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
            <p>THere are two other Laws mentioned by
the Apostle in the former part of this
Epistle, by neither of which men can be
justified in the sight of God: One is the
<hi>Law of Nature,</hi> the other is the <hi>Moral Law,</hi>
written and delivered in the Scriptures. It
was needful for the Apostle to speak distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of both these: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. His great design was to make known
the only way whereby men might be justified
and accepted as righteous in the sight of God,
the righteous judge of all the world, that so
they might be everlastingly blessed and saved;
whether by their own works and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or by the grace and free favour of God,
imputing to them the righteousness of the
Lord Jesus Christ, and working faith in their
hearts by his spirit, thereby enabling them
to receive Christ and apply his righteousness
to themselves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the deciding of this question, or
the determining this controversie: the
hearts, lives, and actions of men were to
be tried and examined by a rule of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which the supream Law-giver had given
unto men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Apostle in this dispute having to
do with two sorts of people: 1. <hi>The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>



               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:99532:99"/>
or such as were strangers to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
or Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> who had no
written Law of divine Authority among
them, he dealeth with them another way,
and goeth about to convince them of their
guiltiness and unrighteousness and sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Law of Nature. 2. The people
of <hi>Israel</hi> who for many hundred years had
been the peculiar Covenant-people or Church
of God, and who had the moral Law of God
written briefly with the finger of God in
Tables of stone, and more largely opened in
other parts of Scripture, by holy men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
and moved by the holy Ghost. These
he trieth by this more full and perfect Law,
and proveth them guilty of sin against the
Law; and so concludes that both <hi>Israelites</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were guilty before God, and
there was none of them righteous by his own
works, no not one: and therefore all of them
were to go out of themselves and to flee
to Christ by faith, that being found in him
they might be freely justified by his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
I conceive therefore that the Ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Objection in this Text being occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
by the Apostles former discourse, doth
concern all those Laws which he mentioned
before, by which he proveth that men could
not be justified, <hi>scil.</hi> the Ceremonial Law,
the Law of Nature, and the moral Law
written; and accordingly the Answer taketh
in all, <hi>Yea we establish the Law.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these two do concern the same things,
forbidding the same sins and commanding



<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99532:99"/>
the same duties; and what is more imperfectly
contained in the Law of Nature, is far more
perfectly declared in the Moral Law written.
I do not hold it so necessary to shew how these
two are severally established by the doctrine
of the Gospel; for if this be made evident
concerning the moral Law written, which
being more large and full comprehendeth the
Law of Nature in it, it will follow that the
Law of Nature is established also. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in as much as the Apostle hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that none can be justified by the light and
Law of Nature, I think fit to speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
briefly of that also, as conceiving it to be
included in this Objection, and the Apostles
Answer to it. The point then which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God hath given to men a light and
Law of Nature:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven men a Law of Nature.</note> This I take to be plainly
expressed in divers passages of the first and
second Chapters of this Epistle, and twice
implyed in this verse:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Objection, <hi>Do we then make void
the Law through faith?</hi> Doth the doctrine of
justification through the righteousness of
Christ applied by faith, excluding all other
ways of justification, make the Law of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
the Law moral, the Light and Law
of Nature (as formerly mentioned) of no
effect, altogether void, of no force or
use?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In the Answer,</hi> We establish the Law;
<hi>and as the Law of Ceremonies, and the Law
moral, so the Law and light of Nature: so



<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99532:100"/>
that the Apostle sheweth according to the
point, that God hath given unto men a light
and Law of Nature.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 19, 20, 21.</note> That which may be known
of God is manifest in them, for God hath
shewed it unto them; for the invisible things
of God are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made, even his eternal power
and Godhead, so that they are without excuse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
because that when they knew God, they glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
him not as God, <hi>&amp;c. Where it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
the Apostle speaks of the Law and light
of Nature common to men in general, even to
those that had no light of Scripture, nor writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Law of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom, 2. 14, 15.</note> For when the Gentiles which
have not the Law, do by nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Law, these having not the Law,
are a Law unto themselves: which shew the work
of the Law written in their hearts; their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
also hearing witness, and their thoughts
the mean while <hi>(or between themselves)</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
or excusing one another. <hi>For the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of this point let us consider,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What this Light or Law of Nature is?
<hi>It may be described thus,</hi> It is the knowledge
which God hath given unto man in their natural
estate since the fall of men,<note place="margin">1. What this Law is.</note> whereby he hath
in some degree made known unto them himself,<note place="margin">Description.</note>
and the good they ought to do, and the evils they
ought to shun.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is given of God:</hi> so in both those places
of Scripture mentioned before, in the one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
is said, <hi>God hath shewed it unto them:</hi>
               <note place="margin">It is given of God.</note> in the
other, <hi>they shew the work of the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in their hearts.</hi> Now who can write



<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99532:100"/>
immediately upon the heart and soul, but
God who is the Father of spirits, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the spirit of man within him, and
therefore I do not call it the Law of Nature
in this sense, as if it were propagated from
<hi>Adam</hi> by natural generation, but because it
is given of God to men as generally, as if it
were born with them. The Prophet shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that God giveth to the Husbandman his
skill and knowledge, for his God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
him unto discretion, and doth teach
him; this also cometh forth from the Lord
who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent
in working. So the Lord saith of <hi>Bezaleel,
I have filled him with the spirit of God in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and in understanding and in knowledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 28. 24. &amp; 26. 28.</note>
               <hi>and in all manner of workmanship, to devise
cunning works, to work in Gold and in Silver,
and in Brass,</hi> &amp;c. So that if God be the giver
of skill and ability for arts and handy-crafts,
we need not doubt but he is the Author of
the light and Law of Nature given unto
man, whereby they see a difference between
truth and falshood, good and evil; and the
Lord may give excellent gifts of this kind
to such men, to whom he giveth no sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
and saving graces.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a knowledge.</hi> So it is said, <hi>they knew
God:</hi> they have a knowledge. So it is said of
Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21.</note> that was the true light which <hi>lighteth
every man that cometh into the world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 9.</note> The Son
of God giveth this common light generally
to men. This light differeth much from that
light of life which Christ giveth to them that



<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99532:101"/>
follow him, whereof he speaketh, Chap. 8.
<hi>I am the light of the world, he that followeth
me shall not walk in darkness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 12.</note> 
               <hi>but shall have the
light of life.</hi> This is meant of a spiritual sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
light leading men to everlasting life,
which is given to none but them that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Christ: but there is a common light and
knowledge which Christ giveth to them that
are strangers to him; yea, to such as are his
enemies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This Light</hi> and Law of Nature,<note place="margin">3. In their natural state.</note> is given
unto men in their natural estate since the fall,
since their nature was corrupted by sin. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fall, while man was in the state of
primitive integrity, as God had created him
in his own likeness after his Image, that is
in wisdom righteousness and true holiness,
the light and Law which God implanted in
man was clear and perfect, man had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Rule imprinted upon his soul to walk by.
But this Rule being defaced by the sin of man,
the Lord gave men some degree of light and
knowledge in this state of corrupt Nature,
which in many things might restrain their
corruptions from breaking out into such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
as Satan and their own lusts might
stir them up to, and whereby they might be
reduced into a more orderly course of life:
and manifest effects of this have been found,
not only in natural persons living under the
Gospel which were strangers to the life of
grace, but also in many Heathens who never
heard the doctrine of salvation; yea, in some
heathen Persecutors of the Church, as <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan,



<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99532:101"/>
Antoninus Philosophus,</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> the
Apostate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It was said in the description that by this
light of Nature God hath in some degree made
known himself unto them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. Hereby they do somewhat know God.</note> So the Apostle saith,
<hi>that which may be known of God is manifest in
them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 19.</note> for <hi>God hath shewed it unto them,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that which may be known
of God, the Apostle meaneth that which
may be known of God without special Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
such as is declared in Scripture; this
was manifest in them by that common general
light of Nature which God had given
them: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They had inward principles of Natural
light. <hi>And,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They had the works of God,</p>
            <p n="1">1. His works of Creation; For the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
things of him from the beginning of
the world are clearly seen,<note place="margin">ver. 20.</note> being understood
by the things that are made, even his eternal
power and Godhead. The Heavens declare
the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth
his handy-work; their line is gone out into
all the earth, and their words unto the end
of the world. The creatures do as it were
speak out the excellency and glory of their
Creator to all the Nations of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>His works of Providence:</hi> God hath
made of one blood all Nations of men for
to dwell on all the face of the earth, and
hath determined the times before appointed,
and the bounds of their habitation, that they
should seek the Lord, if happily they might



<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99532:102"/>
feel after him and find him, though he be not
far from every one of us, for in him we live,
move, and have our being. So the same
Apostle told the Heathens that God in times
past suffered all Nations to walk in their own
waies, not giving them the light of his word
to guide them in the way of salvation, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
(saith he) <hi>He left not himself without
witness in that he did good and gave us rain
from Heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 14. 16, 17,</note> 
               <hi>and fruitful seasons, filling our
hearts with food and gladness:</hi> by his works
of Providence he made some discovery of
himself unto them. I conceive by this light
of Nature within them, and the light which
was held forth unto them by the works of
God from without, they might know that
there was a God, and that this God was of
infinite perfection, eternal, almighty, most
wise, good, righteous, that he was to be
served and worshipped iu such a way as was
pleasing to him, that as the world was made
by him, so both it and all the creatures in it
were under his government, that as a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
judge he would punish evil doers, and
reward the righteous. They might by the
light of reason, conclude that none of the
creatures could make themselves; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can act before it hath a being, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the creatures must receive their beings
from a cause that was before them: hereupon
they might assuredly gather, that there is a
first universal cause of all things, who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
without beginning, of infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
The orderly and perpetual motion



<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99532:102"/>
of the Heavens, Sun, Moon, and Stars: the
continual succession of day and night: the
Spring, Summer, Harvest, Winter: the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
and Harmony that is between
the Creatures, being fitted and suited to each
other; the sun drawing of vapours from the
earth, and waters into the air, there to be
botled up in the Clouds, the Clouds sending
down showers upon the earth, the earth bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth grass, herbs, corn, and other fruits for
the use of men, beasts and fowls; and the
beasts and fowls themselves, fitted for the
use of men; the senses of the body and their
objects fitted and suited to each other: there
are sounds and voices, and an ear to receive
them, there are colours, and there is the
eye fitted to behold them, so of the rest; yea,
how exactly are the several parts of the same
body fitted and suited to each other? These
and many other things discernable by the light
of Nature, might clearly convince men that
there is a God of infinite power and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
who is the cause and Author of all.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. By that light they know somewhat of good and evil.</note> 
               <hi>It was said that by this light and
Law of Nature, God hath given unto men in
some degree to discern the good which they ought
to do, and the evil which they ought to shun.</hi>
So ye heard before, the Apostle saith, <hi>The
Gentiles having not the Law, do by nature the
things contained in the Law;</hi> they do some
things contained in the written Law of God,
though they have not this Law: How? by
Nature, by the Light and Law of Nature;
and in so doing they shew the work of the



<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99532:103"/>
Law written in their hearts. The Heathen
Philosophers have written much in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of moral virtues, and set forth
the odiousness of many vices and dishonest
practices. <hi>Abimelech</hi> King of <hi>Gerar</hi> blamed
<hi>Abraham,</hi> when out of weakness calling his
Wife his Sister, he seemed to lay a snare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and give him occasion to commit
adultery unawares: What hast thou done
unto us? and what have I offended thee that
thou hast brought on me and on my Kingdom
a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me
that ought not to be done. So he said to <hi>Sarah</hi>
concerning her Husband <hi>Abraham, Behold he
is to thee a covering of the eyes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 20. 9, 16.</note> 
               <hi>unto all that
are with thee, and with all other:</hi> thus she
was reproved. Thus much of the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This Law of Nature is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</note> We may consider the imperfection
of this Law and Light of Nature.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In general,<note place="margin">1. Not able to bring to bliss.</note> 
               <hi>It is not sufficient to bring
men to blessedness and salvation.</hi> The Lord
Christ saith,<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 6.</note> 
               <hi>I am the way the truth and the

               <note place="margin">Act. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>no man cometh unto the Father but by me,</hi>
neither is there salvation in any other, for

               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 13, &amp;c</note> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall call on the Name of the Lord

him on whom they have not believed? It
must be a prayer of faith, and where sound
faith is there are other saving graces. And
how shall they believe in him of whom they
have not heard? And how shall they hear



<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99532:103"/>
without a Preacher? so that the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was not sufficient unto salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In special,<note place="margin">2. Particularly defective in,</note> I conceive the Law and
light of Nature was defective and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In it self:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. It self.</note> I suppose it did not make
known unto men the great Mystery of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in unity, three persons in one God, nor
the state of perfection wherein man was
created, nor his woful fall and revolt from
God. Their own experience taught them
that the Nature of man was inclined to evil,
the powers of the soul disordered, the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
misleading the affections, the affections
leading reason captive; but they had no
light to discover to them the first cause of
all this mischief: they were as far to seek
concerning the Remedy. That great depth
of the Incarnation of the Son of God, of God
manifest in the flesh for mans Redemption,
was hidden from them: their own Consciences
accused them and condemned them as guilty,
but they had no light to shew them how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
justice might be satisfied; they knew
not of the blood, righteousness, sacrifice,
satisfaction of Jesus Christ God and man, that
is sufficient to take away sin and to make
peace between God and sinners. The light
of Nature could not enable them to see into
the mystical union between Christ and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
by his spirit and their faith. The
doctrines of free justification by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ imputed, of Regeneration,
Adoption, Sanctification, Communion with



<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99532:104"/>
God, Resnrrection unto glory, are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by the light of Nature. This light
did nor shew them how to walk before God,
unto all pleasing; it did not teach them the
right way of mortifying their lusts, of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the spirit; it did not discover to them
the special institutions of God, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of his worship.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. In the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in which it was.</note> 
               <hi>It was defective and imperfect by
reason of the subject, the soul of man in which
it was:</hi> This light and Law of Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given to men in their corrupt natural e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
is much darkned by the Natural blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
errours, vanities, lusts that are in the
minds and hearts of men; as if a man write
upon fowl and blurred Paper, how much
is lost of that which is written? and how
hardly is it read, sometimes a sentence broken
off in the midst, here and there half words,
one letter mistaken for another: so the light
and Law of Nature being put into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
hearts and souls of men, hath many
defects in it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> 
               <hi>It may be considered of what use
this light and Law of Nature was,</hi> sith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was
defective,<note place="margin">The use of this Law of Nature.</note> and not sufficient to lead men to
salvation. It might be useful,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For the glory of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. For Gods glory.</note> who by this means
had a witness in the hearts and Consciences
of men, of natural men, yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Heathens,
that he loved righteousness and hated wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
their own Consciences pleading for
God against them.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:99532:104"/>
2. <hi>It was of use for the preservation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
societies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. For preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane societies.</note> in families <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

keeping men within some limits of
common honesty, and preventing those out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
which the violence of mens lusts, and
the power of Satan might hurry them
into.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>I conceive it might be useful as a remote
preparative for the receiving of the Gospel in
some to whom the word of salvation was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. A remote preparatory for receiving the Gospel.</note>
for though the pride and prejudice of
mens natural spirits might cause them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the holy Ghost, speaking in the Gospel
preached: yet the light of nature well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
finding nothing in the doctrine of
the Gospel contrary to it, but far above it,
might incline the minds of many to attend
to a far higher and more glorious light, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the doctrine of salvation. I speak
of this but as a remote preparative whereby
ingenuous spirits might be moved to give
heed to the Gospel, but it must be a far
higher cause even the mighty power of
Christ his spirit, that can bring them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Gospel in an effectual and saving
way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> How doth this light and Law of
Nature leave men without excuse?<note place="margin">How doth it leave men without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.</note> 
               <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>Because they did in many things shut
their eyes against the light,</hi> not seeking to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
that light received, by improving their
reason and understandings: as one Candle
lighteth another, so one degree of light im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved



<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99532:105"/>
begetteth another, and so there is
<hi>lumen de lumine,</hi> light (as it were) springing
from light, whereas light smothered endeth
in darkness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because they did not act according to
that light received, nor walk according to
those natural abilities which they had. The
Heathens lived in gross Idolatry against the
light of Nature, whereby they might have
learned that dead Images were utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to represent the living God. Carnal Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
sin against the light of Nature: as in
many other things, so I conceive in not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to that higher light of spiritual My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
so as to receive the love of the Truth
that they may be saved. The use of this may be,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To inform us, <hi>that Acts againt the
Law of Nature are sings against God,</hi> not only
as they are against his written Law,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> but
also as they are against the Law of Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(as the point sheweth) God hath given
unto men this light and Law of Nature: the
impression of this Law of Nature upon the
hearts and souls of men, is one of the acts
of his legislative power. I conceive when
the Prophet saith, <hi>The Lord is our Iudge,
the Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King,
he will save us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 33. 22.</note> he speaketh of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to his Church, to whom he hath a
more peculiar Relation of this kind: He gave
them his Law written in the Scripture, and
he raigneth over them as a King in a special
maner,<note place="margin">Psal. 33. 62.</note> 
               <hi>Blessed is the Nation whose God is the
Lord, and the people whom he hath chosen for



<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99532:105"/>
his own Inheritance:</hi> the Church is the
Lords Inheritance. A King may have an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Kingdom which he maketh greatest
account of, and he may have other tributary
Kingdoms subject to him to which he giveth
Law also. So <hi>David</hi> was King of <hi>Israel</hi> in a
peculiar manner, but he had also the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>Edom, Moa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Ammon, Syria,</hi> &amp;c.
under him. The Lord looketh upon the
Church as his peculiar Kingdom, and to them
he hath given a perfect Law in writing in
the holy Scirptures; but besides that, he
hath a universal soveraignty and Dominion,
the Authority of a Law-giver over all the
Nations of the world,<note place="margin">Psal. 47. 2, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Iews, Turks, Indians,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>The Lord most high is terrible, he is a
great King over all the Earth.</hi> And again,
<hi>God is King of all the Earth.</hi> And so he is a
Law-giver to all the Nations of the Earth:
If he giveth not the light of his word and
his Law written in the Scriptures to many
Nations, yet he giveth to them all the light
and Law of Nature; and therefore the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
of the Law of Nature are sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God. The Apostle saith, <hi>until the Law
sin was in the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 13, 14</note> 
               <hi>but sin is not imputed
where there is no Law: nevertheless death
reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
that had not sinned after tbe similitude of Adams
transgression.</hi> Sin was in the world before
the Law was given on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> But
how can it be just to charge sin upon them
who had no Law against which to sin? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
death raigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi>



               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:99532:106"/>
even over them that had not sinned after the
similitude of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression: Who are
they? Some seem to understand Infants only,
who sinned not actually in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as <hi>Adam</hi> did, yet dying in their infancy,
were guilty of original sin. Others take it
for all that lived between the time of <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Moses</hi> who sinned not after the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression, because they
sinned not against an express Law, given by
revelation from Heaven, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, who
sinned against that express prohibition of
God, forbidding him to eat of the fruit of
the Tree of knowledge of good and evil,
under the pain of certain death and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I conceive this latter sense more probable,
because of that special limitation of time from
<hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses;</hi> for the case of those that
dye in their Infancy, for ought I know, is
the same, whether before or after the time
of <hi>Moses,</hi> before and after the Law written;
but the condition of those that lived between
<hi>Adams</hi> time and that of <hi>Moses</hi> differed from
those that lived after. Now the Apostle
sheweth that death the punishment of sin
fell upon them, so did many other judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the flood destroying the old world,
the showr of fire and brimstone upon <hi>Sodom</hi>
fell within the compass of that time; and
therefore certainly they were guilty of sin,
and justly punished, because these calamities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
were the just judgements of God, who is the
righteous judge of all the world; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
although these sinned not against any



<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99532:106"/>
positive Law of God delivered to them either
by word or writing, yet they sinned against
the light and Law of Nature which God had
given them.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 8.</note> 
               <hi>This may shew us the reason and
the justice of those severe executions of God upon
Heathen Nations, who had no Scripture nor
written Law to sin against.</hi> They sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Light and Law of Nature,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>for the
wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against
all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who
hold the truth in unrighteousness,</hi> because that
which may be known of God is manifest in
them, for God hath shewed it unto them,
&amp;c. The Judgements and Calamities publick,
national, private, personal, brought upon
any of mankind in several ages, are evidences
of Gods wrath and displeasure against them,
and therefore proofs of their sin and guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against God; otherwise the Lord who
is perfectly righteous would not bring these
evils upon them: and among the rest, the
death of the body is a universal declaration
of the wrath of God against mankind for
sin. If any should be free from all other
evils, yet this alone would be a sufficient
proof of their sinfulness; and therefore the
Lord said unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him to each
particular person of his posterity, soon after
he had sinned, and they had sinned in him,
<hi>Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return.
By one man sin entred into the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and
death by sin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and so death passed upon all
men, for that all have sinned.</hi> Euery dead



<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99532:107"/>
Corps, every Funeral that ye see or hear of,
all the persons that have died from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world unto this day, have by
their death manifested the wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sin, and mens guiltiness before the
Lord: for though through the grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God in Christ, the death of a true
believer is turned into a blessing and made
an inlet or entrance into everlasting life, yet
in its own Nature it is a consequent of sin,
and sin was the original of it. In special, the
Heathens who had not the mind of God so
fully revealed to them as those within the
Church, yet had the Light and Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and in sinning against that Light and
Law were justly punished; for they held the
Truth in unrighteousness. This common
Light and Law of Nature was the Truth of
God, und they by opposing their wills and
lusts against it, and so not following the
guidance of it, were found guilty of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against God and crossing that Light which
the Lord had given them, and therefore the
Lord dealt with them as Enemies. So the Lord
punished <hi>Sodom</hi> and the Cities adjoynning
with fire and brimstone. So the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and
<hi>Amorites</hi> were destroyed for their sins against
the Light and Law of Nature,<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 13. 16.</note> and <hi>Israel</hi> was
planted in their Land. The Lord told <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
that his seed should possess it, but not until
after four hundred years, Why? Because the
iniquity of the <hi>Amorites</hi> was not yet full: so
that it was the fullness of their iniquity which
was the cause of their destruction; it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause



<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99532:107"/>
their sin was come to its full height,
that they were rooted out. So the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
forbidden <hi>Israel</hi> the practice of divers
great sins saith, <hi>Defile not your selves in any
of these things, for in all these things the
Nations are defiled which I cast out before
you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 18. 24. 25.</note> 
               <hi>And the Land is defiled, therefore I
do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the
Land it self vomiteth out the Inhabitants.</hi>
The Lord threatned divers grievous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> against many
Heathen Nations,<note place="margin">Amos 1. &amp; 2.</note> 
               <hi>Syria,</hi> the <hi>Philistines, Tyrus,
Edom, Ammon, Moab.</hi> All the miseries of
war brought upon Heathen Nations, what
were they but revelations and reall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of the wrath of God from Heaven
for their sins against the Law and Light of
Nature? The ruining of the Babylonish
Monarchy by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> of the
<hi>Persian</hi> by the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Grecians;</hi> the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> by the <hi>Romans;</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi>
by the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> on the one side and
divers Northern Nations on the other; these
and the like were just Judgements of God
upon Heathens for sins against the Light and
Law of Nature. So I conceive the cruel
<hi>Spaniards</hi> were unjust executioners of the
righteous Judgements of God upon the poor
<hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Americans</hi> for their sins against the
same common Light and Law of Nature: for
the Lord executeth just Judgements by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, yea by Divels, who aime not at all
at the Lords end, but either delight to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their malice and cruelty, or act thus to



<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99532:108"/>
make a ful conquest, and utterly disable a
people to make head again.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> 
               <hi>This may clearly convince us that
the sins of Christians are far more heinous then
the sins of Infidels and Heathens,</hi> because they
sin against the same Law and Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which Heathens did, and beside against
a far clearer Light and more perfect Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to them in the holy Scriptures of the
old and new Testament; for the Light and
Law of Nature though it was given to the
Heathen, yet it was not peculiar to them, it
was not limited to them alone, but was
common to them with others: it is given
also to <hi>Iews</hi> who have the old Testament
also; it is given to Christians who have both
old and new Testament, and therefore their
sins are highly aggravated. So the the Lord
by the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> having threatned hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Judgements against those Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
mentioned before, then turneth his
speech to the people of <hi>Iudah, Thus saith the
Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Am. 2. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>for three transgressions of Iudah and for
four I will not turn away the punishment
thereof, because they have defiled the Law of
the Lord, and have not kept his Commandment,
and their lies caused them to err, after the
which their Fathers have walked; but I will
send a fire upon Iudah and it shall devour
the Palaces of Ierusalem:</hi> they had the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Law and Commandments of God which
the other had not, and therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
and kept not; they had the Truth of
God revealed from Heaven, and delivered



<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99532:108"/>
to them by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
inspired by the holy spirit of God, but
they rather chose to walk in lyes after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of their Fathers,<note place="margin">Amos 2. 4, 5.</note> and therefore their
sins were much more sinful than those of the
Heathens. Then he threatneth <hi>Israel, scil.</hi> the
rest of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Kingdom of the ten Tribes
who followed the sin of <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> charging
them first with barbarous cruelty and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
contrary to common humanity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they sold the righteous for silver, and
the poor for a pair of shoes. I conceive he
speaketh especially against that great sin of
Judges and Magistrates, in perverting justice
for Bribes, and withal against them which
hired such corrupt officers to act unjustly by
giving them rewards; <hi>They sold the righteous
for Silver,</hi> they exposed the innocent to the
lust and will of their Adversaries for mony,
<hi>and the poor for a pair of shooes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 6, &amp;c.</note> either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being once corrupted with some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
gains, they afterward were so har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
in their sins, that they would pervert
justice for a pair of shooes, for a triflle; or
else because they could not get much for giving
sentence against a poor man in his Cause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Adversaries would not offer much
to have their will of them who had little to
loose: these corrupt judges would transgress
for a petty-bribe where no more was to be
had. <hi>That pant after the dust of the earth on
the head of the poor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 7.</note> or as one readeth it, <hi>that
pant or breath after the head of the poor,</hi> that
they may cast it down to the dust of the



<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99532:109"/>
earth: If we take it the former way, the
sense may seem to be this, when they have
overthrown the poor and laid him in the dust,
such is there inhumane cruelty, that they
are not satisfied with his misery, but desire
his utter ruine and destruction. 2. An other
sin was abominable uncleannness, that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Son would lye with the same wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
which is set forth and heightned with
this aggravation, they prophaned the holy
Name of God, pretending to be the people
of God, and yet committing such lewdness:
this highly redounded to the Lords dishonour
above the sins of meer Heathens. 3. Their
wicked glorying and triumphing in their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and prophaning that worship which
themselves had embraced as religious, laying
themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge
by every Altar, keeping the garments of the
poor which they had taken to pledge, and
being so far from restoring them according
to the Law, that they durst lye upon them
by the very Altars, and drink the wine of the
condemned in the house of their God, feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves in the Temple of their God
with the very spoils taken from those whom
they had unjustly condemned, these sins of
<hi>Israel</hi> are aggravated divers ways in the
words following: There <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> are
both joyned together, <hi>Hear this word that the
Lord hath spoken against you O Children of
Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 3. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>against the whole family which I brought
up from the Land of Egypt, saying, You only
have I known of all the families of the earth,



<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99532:109"/>
therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities:</hi>
The Lord had owned them above others,
and made himself known to them above all
other people, and therefore their sin was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than others, and they might expect more
gievous punishments: How much more are
sins of professed Christians more heinous
than those of the Heathens? who have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
light then the people of <hi>Israel</hi> had, having
the new Testament added to the old; who
have the Lord Jesus Christ set forth before
them in the Gospel, not under Types and
shadowes, but clearly, not as to come, but
as already come, actually crucified for sin,
buried, risen again, ascended into Heaven?
The Lord Christ sheweth that the sins of
<hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida</hi> were more heinous
than those of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
would be more intolerable in the
day of Judgement,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 22.</note> because they sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
greater light. The like comparison he
maketh between <hi>Capernaum</hi> and <hi>Sodom.</hi> And
the very Name of Christian is an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the sins of those who profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Christians. This Name was first given
to them that professed the faith of Christ at
<hi>Antioch,</hi> because of the great success of the
Gospel there. <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> a
whole year assembled themselves with the
Church and taught much people,<note place="margin">Act. 11. 26.</note> and the
Disciples were called Christians first at
<hi>Antioch.</hi> The denomination of a Christian
is derived from the blessed and glorious
Name of Christ himself as he is annointed



<pb n="194" facs="tcp:99532:110"/>
of God the Father with the spirit above
measure: What signifieth a Christian then,
but 1. A member of Christ united to him
as the head of the whole mystical body of
the Church? How great is the sin of those

themselves to be led by Satan the enemy of

that is, a member of Christ, to make
himself a member of an Harlot: or for a

her self the member of a fornicatour or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The name of a Christian signifieth one

as the better sort of Heathens abhorred and
scorned? 1. How many living under the
Gospel have nothing in them better then
some of the Heathens; nothing practically
better, no better frame of soul, no better
resolutions and affections, nothing of Christ
his regenerating spirit, nothing of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing

It may be they have some more knowledge
of Christ and his Gospel then Heathens; so
have the Divels: but they have no better
hearts than Heathens. 2. How many such
live in the ordinary practice of such sins
which the wiser sort of Heathens abhorred

by the light of Nature to sober Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,

What discourses have <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> against

         <div n="8" type="chapter">

            <p>I Proceed now to the Moral Law, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which the Apostle saith it is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by the doctrine of Justification through
the Righteousness of Christ apprehended by
faith without any consideration of the works
of the Law performed by the person justified.
By the the Moral Law I understand, the
Law written in the Scripture, whereof we
have a brief sum or Abridgment in the ten
Commandments, which again is contracted
into a narrower compass,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 37, 38, 39.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all
soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first
and greatest Commandment, and the second is
like unto it, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as
thy self.</hi> The Law thus abridged, is largely
unfolded in other parts of Scripture, with
the additions of many threatnings against
disobedience, and promises to obedience.
1. then I intend to propose a general point
of doctrine, and then to point at the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
comprehended in it. The general
doctrine is this,</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:99532:112"/>
               <hi>That the Gospel teaching the free justification
of Believers without consideration of any works
of theirs done in obedience to the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6. Doct. In general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> 
               <hi>but
through the Righteousness of Christ alone, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by faith, doth establish the moral Law.</hi>
So it is shewed in this Text, Through faith the
Law is established. That which I desire to
clear unto you is,<note place="margin">How the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht by faith.</note> how or wherein the moral
Law is established by faith: this may be
shewed.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Negatively.</item>
               <item>2. Affirmatively.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And so we may come to the several bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
or special doctrines comprised in this
general.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 1. Negat.</note> thus, The moral Law is not
established, but declared to be of no use for
the justification of sinners in the sight of God,
by the doctrine of justification through the
Righteousness of Christ imputed of God and
applied by faith: Or, more briefly for help
of Memory thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iustification by faith in Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Particular Doct.</note> 
               <hi>excludeth
justification by the works of the Law.</hi> This ye
may take as a point of doctrine implied in
the Text, if it be compared with the Apostles
foregoing discourse, to which it hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For the Apostle speaketh of it as of a
thing strongly proved and concluded as clear
and certain, that it being declared and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
that none have fulfilled the Law
but all are found guilty of sin against the
Law, therefore none can be justified in the
sight of God by the works of the Law; hence



<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99532:113"/>
it followeth that there is no way remaining
for any of mankind to be justified and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
righteous before God, but only
through the righteousness of Christ imputed
to them of God and applied by faith: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ariseth the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>estion or Objection in the
Text, <hi>Do we then,</hi> &amp;c. and the Answer is,
<hi>Yea, we establish the Law,</hi> that is, it is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in other respects, and for other ends
and uses, but is declared to be void and of
no use at all for the justifying of sinners by
any works which they can perform in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Law. So that as the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Law is declared by the doctrine of the
Gospel to be of no use either for justification
of sinners or for outward observation, and
yet established in other respects as hath been
shewed: so the moral Law by the same doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
of the Gospel, is declared to be of no
force for justification of sinners, and yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
in other respects. For the present
the Negative is to be considered. So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
having spoken of the priviledges of
the people of <hi>Israel</hi> above the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as
in other regards, so chiefly because unto them
were committed the oracles of God, then

               </gap>estion, <hi>What then? Are we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than they? No in no wise: for, we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proved both Iews and Gentiles that they
are all under sin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>as it is written, there is none
righteous no not one.</hi> The <hi>Israelites</hi> though

the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet were no better by Nature

Nature as well as others, and it was as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for them to be justified by their own
righteousness or works of obedience to the
Law, as it was for the Heathen. <hi>Therefore
by the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh
be justified in his sight.</hi> Two things may be
considered here for the opening and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
this point.<note place="margin">ver. 20. The point cleared by, 1. General grounds.</note>
            </p>

concerning Christ, <hi>Thou shalt call his name
Iesus,</hi>

               <hi>for he shall save his people from their
sins.</hi> He shall save them, and therefore their
own works shall not save them. He shall
save them from their sins, and therefore he
found them in their sins, poor, guilty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
creatures, and such as could not be
saved or justified by their own works or
righteousness. The Lord Christ the night
before he died said, <hi>This is my blood of the
new Testament which is shed for many for the
remission of sins.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 28.</note> The Lord Christ did shed
his most pretious blood for the remission or
forgiveness of sins: He by his death and
obedience satisfied the justice of God, for
the sins of those who could not satisfie for
themselves by any works of righteousness of
their own: compare this with that of the
Apostle, <hi>I do not frustrate the grace of God,
for if righteousness come by the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 21.</note>

justification by the righteousness of Christ
and justification by a mans own works per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in obedience to the Law cannot
stand together. Christ died to purchase for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of sins, and justification for his
people; but if any would be justified by



<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99532:118"/>
the Law, they go about to frustrate the grace
of God, as if Christ had died in vain. <hi>Christ
is become of none effect to you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>whosoever of you
are justified by the Law, ye are fallen from
grace:</hi> when he saith, <hi>Whosoever,</hi> &amp;c. he
doth not grant that any are or can be justified
by the Law,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> but <hi>whosoever rely upon the works
of the Law for justification,</hi> hoping to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Law, they loose the benefit of
Christs death and satisfaction. The Lord
Christ is able to save them to the uttermost
that come unto God by him, and therefore
none of them do save themselves, or justifie
themselves in any part.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 11, 12.</note> There is a most clear
place to shew that justification by works, and
justification by faith cannot stand together, that
no man is justified by the Law in the sight of
God is evident, <hi>for the just shall live by
faith,</hi> or, <hi>the just by faith shall live,</hi> and
<hi>the Law is not of faith, but the man that
doth them shall live in them.</hi> Justification,
righteousness, everlasting life and salvation,
is obtained by faith in Christ, applying his
righteousness to the soul; but the Law is
not of faith, but the man that doth them
shall live in them. The Law is a Covenant
of another Nature, the man that doth the
works of the Law shall live in them. There
is no possibility of being justified by the Law,
unless a man could perfectly fulfill it: this
is impossible for any man to do. 1. Because
of the corruption of his Nature which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
way contrary to the Law. 2. Because
all, and far more than all that he can do for



<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99532:119"/>
the time to come is due debt to the justice of
God, and cannot make the least satisfaction
for his sins past, no not for any one of those
numberless sins whereof he was formerly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
3. Because the best mans righteousness
is imperfect, and falleth short of the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Law, &amp; no righteousness can satisfie
the justice of God, but that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and perfect; and therefore the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and performances of the holiest men
are of no account at all in the sight of God
towards their justification.</p>

who deceive themselves with a shadow of
faith, presumptuously fancying to themselves
an interest in Christ, imagining that their
sins are forgiven, and their persons justified
by his death, satisfaction, and righteousness,
but their faith is not sound, it is not such a
faith as truly receiveth Christ into the heart,
whereby Believers are made one with Christ,
possessing him, partaking of his spirit which
stirreth them up to conform themselves to
Christ, to follow him, to bring forth the fruits
of the spirit; and therefore he saith, ver. 20.
<hi>Faith without works is dead.</hi> So it is a working
faith which justifieth, because such a faith
alone doth truly lay hold of Christ and his
righteousness: On the other side, holiness and



<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99532:119"/>
good works do not at all justifie believers
in a proper sense, but evidence the persons
to be justified, because they shew that such
by faith unfeigned are united unto Christ,
whose righteousness alone doth justifie, and
therefore he saith,<note place="margin">ver. 14.</note> 
               <hi>What doth it profit my
Brethren, if a man say he hath faith and
have not works? Can faith save him?</hi> He
speaketh of such as say they have faith, not
of those that have a lively saving faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
So <hi>ver.</hi> 19. he speaketh to such, <hi>Thou
believest that there is one God; thou dost well,
the Divels also believe and tremble.</hi> So that
he sheweth that a dead faith is but such a
faith as the Divels have, which is far from
justifying and saving those that have it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>I conceive his meaning is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that holiness
and the fruits of faith do declare and manifest
true believers to be justified before men.</hi> A man
will say thou hast faith and I have works;
shew me thy faith without thy works,<note place="margin">ver. 18.</note> and I
will shew thee my faith by my works: as if
he had said, Natural life shews it self by the
motions and actings of life: so doth spiritual
life evidence it self by the motions and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of spiritual life. True faith embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Christ and his righteousness for justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
is a principle of spiritual life: Thou
therefore who pretendest to have this faith,
how canst thou make it appear, how canst
thou shew or declare it, when thou puttest
forth no motions or actings of spiritual
life?</p>
            <p>The use of this may be,</p>

he faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33, 34.</note> 
               <hi>It is God that justifieth, who is he that
condemneth?</hi> This sheweth that they that are
justified and accepted as righteous in the sight
of God are not condemned, and so on the
contrary, they that are not justified are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:
All then that are not in Christ are
in the state of condemnation, so it is implied,
ver. 1. <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation
to them which are in Christ Iesus, who walk

their conversations above many other,
and yet the wrath of God may still abide
upon them. In this case it is not enough to
alter your course in some things, but your
state and condition must be altered: nothing

Righteousness, to approve themselves just in
the sight of God, but all was in vain: they

               <hi>It is not the hearing of Christ

none can be justified but by the righteousness

ye are in the same state wherein they were,

your endeavours after righteousness are like

            <p>And therefore in the second place, <hi>See your

ye cannot be justified by your own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or works done in obedience to the Law,
whether ye look upon your selves as ye are
in your selves, or upon the purity, perfection,

justice, holiness or majesty of God; so on
the contrary, Christ and none but Christ is
able to justifie you by his righteousness in all

do not entertain the least thought that way,
as if all that thou hast done or canst do should
make the least satisfaction to the justice of
God for any of thy sins, or any way help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thy justification: In a word, <hi>Take heed
of splitting thy soul against either of these two
Rocks,</hi> either on the one side deceiving thy
self with a dead faith without holiness and
fruits of faith, and so thinking thy sins to be
pardoned, and thy person justified, when it

is nothing so: Or on the other side resting
with any confidence upon any graces or duties.
Labour after these, and look upon them as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of the soundness of thy faith, but lean
not upon them as grounds to support thy
faith. So much for the Negative.</p>
            <p>Let us now consider the Affirmative,<note place="margin">Affirmatively. Sect. 2.</note> whereby
it may appear how and in what regard the moral
Law is declared to be established by the doctrine
of Faith. <hi>I conceive the Law is established
in five respects:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> By that full obedience performed to the
Law by the Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By that full satisfaction which he
made to the Law in bearing the penalty of
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the imputation of his perfect
Righteousness to Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In that he establisheth the Law as
a Rule of obedience for his people.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>In that he conformeth his people to
the Law:</hi> and these may be so many branches
of the general point, and therefore so many
special points of doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Then observe this point,</hi> That the Lord
Iesus Christ did establish the Law by fulfilling
it: <hi>or,</hi> He did perform full and perfect obedience
to the Law, and so establish the Law: <hi>Wherein
you may note two particulars,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That Christ did fulfill the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in fulfilling it he did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the former; So he said, <hi>Think not that
I am come to destroy the Law and the Prophets,



<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99532:124"/>
I am not come to destroy but to fulfill.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17.</note> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this speech was delivered soon after the
Lord Christ began publickly to preach, and
this was seasonable to prevent or remove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
prejudices or mistakes. For besides
that general expectation of the Messias about
that time, the Scepter being departed from
<hi>Iudah,</hi> and they being subject to a Forreign
yoak, there were many extraordinary things
which happened at the Birth of Christ; Then
the Testimony which <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> gave him,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 16, 17.</note>
the Heavens opening, the holy Ghost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
upon him in the visible form of a
Dove, God the Father by an audible voice
from Heaven, proclaiming this is my beloved
Son in whom I am well-pleased; His fasting
forty days and forty nights when he was led
of the spirit into the Wilderness to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Divel;<note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> His wonderful diligence
in preaching in divers places; His glorious
miracles in healing all manner of sickness and
diseases, especially in delivering those that
were possessed with Divels; The great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of people following him from <hi>Galilee,
Decapolis, Hierusalem, Iudea,</hi> and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<hi>Iordan,</hi> in somuch that his fame was
spread abroad suddenly beyond the borders
of the Land of <hi>Israel</hi> throughout all <hi>Syria:</hi>
These and the like things might well raise the
peoples expectation, and give them occasion
to look for some notable change to be wrought
by him: and as men are lead by divers prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
are upon such occasions apt to fancy
some one thing some another; so it is likely



<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99532:124"/>
the most did expect that he should set up an
earthly Kingdom; some might think that
he would take away the Law, which God
delivered to their Fathers by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the
doctrine of the Prophets, and hereupon some
might seek advantage to disparage his person
and his doctrine; others might hope that he
would open a door for carnal liberty, as in
our dayes upon occasion of far lesser changes,
some have embraced strange fancies, as if the
time were come to cast off those ordinances,
which Christ hath appointed to be used until
the end of the world, as if an universal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
must be granted to all corrupt opinions,
Heresies, Blasphemies, under colour of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
tender Consciences. Now the Lord
to remedy these things, telleth plainly that
He came not to destroy, but fulfill the Law
and the Prophets.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He fulfilled</hi> the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> by
<hi>exhibiting the substance of those Types,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing
those things which were signified
and represented by them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He fulfilled the Prophets, verifying their
prophesies,</hi> teaching, doing, and suffering that
which they foretold.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He fulfilled the Moral Law. 1. Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

                  </gap>orrupt interpretations then
received,</hi> and giving the true and full sense of
the Law. 2. <hi>He fulfilled the Law practically,</hi>
by performing full and perfect obedience to
the Law,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 15.</note> which is the thing in hand:<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> So he
said before, <hi>It becometh us to fulfill all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
God sent forth his Son made of a



<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99532:125"/>
woman under the Law,</hi> He was made under
the Law by his own voluntary act, taking
upon him the Nature of man, and the office
of a Mediatour between God and men
(though as God he was the Lawgiver;) and
therefore having put himself into this estate,
he was bound to obey the Law fully in every
particular, and could not have failed in one
jot or tittle without being guilty of sin; and
therefore all those Texts which declare his
perfect Righteousness being compared with
this, do prove that he performed perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Law:<note place="margin">Act. 7. 12.</note> So where <hi>Stephen</hi>
calleth him <hi>the just one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>He

               <hi>scil.</hi> no sin either original or
actual,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 22, 3, 18.</note> either of commission or omission, in
thought word or deed: and <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>He
was a Lamb without blemish and without spot,
who did no sin, neither was guile found in his
mouth:</hi> and that <hi>he suffered for sins the just for
the unjust:</hi> these and the like passages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with that place, prove that he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
perfect obedience to the Law, for being
as was said made under the Law, it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary that he should fulfill it, that
he might approve himself to be the just one,
knowing no sin, a Lamb without blemish and
without spot, &amp;c. because every <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
whatsoever is against the Law is sin, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le of the Law,
whatsoever is defective and falleth short of the
perfect purity of the Law is sin; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in as much as the Lord was made under
the Law, and yet was found to be without



<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99532:125"/>
all spot of sin, when he offered up himself in
sacrifice, and poured forth his blood for the
sins of the world: It is most clear, that he
performed full and perfect obedience to the
Law, and this was necessary:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That he might be a perfect High Priest.</hi>
The Priest in the old Testament being a
Type of Christ, was to be without outward
blemish in his person or body,<note place="margin">Lev. 21. 21.</note> 
               <hi>No man that
hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the Priest,
shall come nigh to offer the offering of the Lord
made by fire:</hi> and in the next Chapter, there
is a severe threatning against any of <hi>Aarons</hi>
posterity,<note place="margin">Chap. 22. 3.</note> if having any legal uncleanness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, they should presume to meddle
with the holy things of the Tabernacle: sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they were polluted with Leprosie, or a
running Issue, or by touching an other that
was unclean, &amp;c. This figured the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
purity and holiness of Christ, the true and
eternal High-Priest, who was to offer up
himself in sacrifice to God, for such an High-Priest
became us,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 26, 27.</note> who is <hi>holy, harmless, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
seperate from sinners, made higher than
the Heavens,</hi> who needeth not dayly as those
High Priests, to offer up Sacrifice, first for his
own sin, and then for the sins of the people,
for this he did once, when he offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
He is an High-Priest, holy, harmless,
undefiled, separate from sinners, and whereas
the High-Priests of the old Testament were
subject to sin, and therefore needed to offer
sacrifice for their own sins, as well as for the
peoples; He being free from sin offered not,



<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99532:126"/>
needed not to offer for any sins of his own:
They offered dayly, often renewing their
offerings, because they were imperfect, and
had respect to the perfect offering of Christ,
but he offered himself once for all for the sins
of his people; His sacrifice being most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and compleat, never to be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It was necessary that the Lord Christ
should perform full and perfect obedience to the
Law, that he might be a pure offering, a spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
sacrifice to take away the sins of his people.</hi>
How much more shall the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> who
through the eternal spirit,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> 
               <hi>offered himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
spot to God, purge your Conscience from
dead works to serve the living God?</hi> That the
vertue and efficacy of Christ's blood might
reach to the inward man, and purge the soul
and Conscience from sin: it was necessary
that he should offer up himself a sacrifice
without spot, as one whom the Law could
not charge with the least aberration or swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
from the perfect purity of it.</p>
            <p>The second particular noted was, that <hi>the
Lord Christ by fulfilling the Law, did establish
it.</hi> Here we may consider,</p>
            <p>First, That <hi>God gave man his Law in the
Creation,</hi> writing a perfect Law of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and true holiness in the mind and
heart of the first man and woman, <hi>God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
man in his own Image,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 27.</note> 
               <hi>in the Image of God
created he him, male and female created he
them.</hi> Now what was this framing of man
in the image of God, but the fashioning of his



<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99532:126"/>
heart and soul according to the wisdom, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
holiness and righteousness of God, which
was the writing and imprinting his Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the sould of man, as he gave to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
natural properties,<note place="margin">See Eph. 4. 24. &amp; Col. 3. 10.</note> and natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts
according to their several kinds, each
of which was a Law unto them, <hi>scil.</hi> the
Law of their Creation. So he imprinted the
likeness of his own wisdom, Righteousness
and holiness upon the first man and woman,
as the Law of their Creation. Now this
likeness of God, his holiness and Righteousness
imprinted upon the souls of our first parents,
was the same for substance with that moral
Law written in the Scriptures; for as the
moral Law written in the Scriptures is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the wisdom, Righteousness and
holiness of God, and a rule of Righteousness
and holiness to men: So was that Image and
likeness of God imprinted upon the souls of
the first man and woman: It was the moral
Law written in their hearts and minds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider that the great mischeivous
design of the Devil,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Was to destroy this Law of God written in
the heart of man,</hi> to deface the likeness of God,
his wisdom, holiness and Righteousness, in
their souls, to make void and abolish the Law
of mans Creation for ever; that none of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
should ever have either knowledge or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
or will to do any thing pleasing unto
God; and therefore the Apostle declaring the
woful ruines of mankind brought upon them
by sin and Satan, and shewing what all are



<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99532:127"/>
by nature, saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 10, 11.</note>

none able to please God, none that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth,

the nature of it, and a Law of death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction

men with darkness, errour, false conceits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
things that concern salvation, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against God, and his Law, with

               </gap>s legislative power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,



<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99532:127"/>
striving to abolish the Law, and to
deface the likeness of God's holiness out of the
minds of all mankind for ever, that God
should have none amongst the children of
men, to serve, obey, and honour him, but
all of them should become slaves and vassals
to the Devils, being led captive by them at
their will. 2. They aimed at the destruction
of mankind, to bring them into the same
condemnation with themselves, by blotting
out the Law written in their minds accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to which they should have walked, and
according to which they shall be judged, and
bringing them under a contrary Law of sin
and death: so then God having written this
Law in the soul, and the Devil having blotted
it out, and brought mankind under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Law of sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the third place let us consider the work of
the Lord Iesus Christ that was to destroy the
works of the Devil.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 8.</note> Saith the Apostle <hi>Iohn,
He that committeth sin is of the Devil, for the
Devil sinneth from the begining; for this purpose
the Son of God was manifested, that he might
destroy the works of the Devil.</hi> He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
sin, he that maketh sin his business,
sinning with the full bent of his will, is of
the Devil; He remaineth in that condition
into which the Devil brought mankind at the
first, subject to the Law and power of sin,
which is quite contrary to that Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and holiness which God imprinted
upon the soul of man in the Creation; for
the Devil sinneth from the beginning, he



<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99532:128"/>
sinned and fell from God, and he drew men
into sin, and still leadeth them on in a course
of sin and disobedience against God. Now
(saith the Apostle) for this purpose the Son
of God was manifested, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the works of the Devil: He doth not
say barely that the Son of God destroyed the
works of the Devil; but for this purpose the
Son of God was manifested, that &amp;c. one
great work of the Devil, as ye heard, was to
deface the likeness of God in the soul of man,
and to bring him under a Law of sin. This
work among others, Christ came to destroy,
where note, 1. That no meer Creature was
able to destroy this work of the Devil.</p>
            <p>It may be some may think that good and
holy Angels might be as able to undo this
evil work,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> as Devils or evil Angels were to
do it.</p>
            <p>But it is not so, the reason is not because
the good Angels have less power than the
Devils,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> but because of the nature of that work
of the Devil, for the work of the Devil was
a destroying work, as hath been shewed; it
was the destroying of the Law of mans Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which was written in his soul, the defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and blotting out of Gods hand-writing,
the likeness of Gods holiness, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
of man to the destroying Law of sin;
it was the taking away of mans spiritual life,
by dividing him from God the fountain of
life. Now to destroy or undo this destructive
work of Satan, is to abolish that Law of sin
and death in man, and to write that contrary



<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99532:128"/>
Law in the soul of man, which Satan had blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out, that is to restore man to the likeness
of God, to fashion him again after the Image
of God, in knowledge, Righteousness, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
to raise man, whom Satan had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
to spiritual life. Now it requireth a
far greater power to repair and restore, then
to destroy, one Murderer may take away
life, all the Angels in Heaven, nor all the men
on earth cannot restore life to the dead: None
but the living God can do it, who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of life: So the Devil, and man yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Devils suggestion, could destroy
spiritual life. The Law written in the heart
of man, that primitive perfection and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of mans Nature framed after the Image
of God, in knowledge, righteousness and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
but no meer Creatures, none but the
Prince of life, the supream Law-giver, by
whom all things were made, could restore
spiritual life, write this primitive Law in the
soul of man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it may be Objected,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obj.</note> That this work
which the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> saith Christ came
into the world to do, is a work of destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>I Answ.<note place="margin">Awsw.</note> We are to consider the object of this
destroying work of Christ, what it was that
Christ destroyed; that was a destructive work
wrought by the Devil that great destroyer and
Murderer: Christ came to destroy that destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which Satan had wrought; &amp; to destroy
destruction is to repair and restore that which
was destroyed, to destroy death is to



<pb n="230" facs="tcp:99532:129"/>
restore life: So the Apostle speaking of the
Resurrection of Believers to glory, saith <hi>When
this corruptible shall have put on incorruption,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 54.</note>
               <hi>and this mortal shall have put on immortality;
then shall be brought to pass the saying that is
written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</hi>
Death had slain thousands of Saints, and
Christ by restoring them to life, raising them
to immortality and everlasting life, shall
swallow up death in victory: So in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of <hi>Hosea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>I will ransome them from the
power of the grave, I will redeem them from
Death, O death I will be thy Plague, O Grave
I will be thy destruction.</hi> The Lord may be
said as it were to kill death, and to destroy or
bury the grave, when he ransometh his people
from death and the grave, and raiseth them
up to everlasting life: So in this case, when
Christ is said to destroy the destructive works
of Satan, ye must understand that he was to
restore that which Satan had ruined. This
no meer Creature in Heaven and Earth was
able to do; and therefore in the second place,
the Son of God undertook it, it was a work
of Almighty power to restore the Law of
mans Creation, spiritual life, the Likeness of
God, his Righteousness and Holiness to any
of <hi>Adams</hi> posterity, to any of the seed of the
woman, and to inable any of them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ull and perfect obedience to the Law:
None but God could do it, and therefore the
Son of God, who is very God performed it.
The Devil seemed for ever to have deprived
mankind of the Image of God, and for ever



<pb n="231" facs="tcp:99532:129"/>
to have disabled all the Sons of men from
fulfilling the Law, but the Son of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
Satan herein, and destroyed this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
work of the Devil, by restoring that
which he had destroyed, by framing one of
<hi>Adams</hi> posterity, one of the seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
after the Image of God in righteousness
and holiness, and inabling him perfectly in
every point to fulfill the Law.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Apostle shews how the Son of
God performed this great work, it was by the
manifestation of himself; For this purpose the
Son of God was manifested,</hi> &amp;c. His manifes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
was his incarnation, his being made
flesh, taking the nature of man into the unity
of his person, for the Son of God in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature is invisible, not manifested, but
when he became Man he was manifested and
made visible, and so framed this humane
nature thus united to his God-head after the
image of God in perfect Righteousness and
holiness, and inabled it to perform full and
compleat obedience to the Law. And thus
the work of Satan was destroyed, one of the
Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> one of the seed of the woman
after the fall of mankind, being inabled to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the Righteousness of the Law.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Ye may note by the way, that I do
not speak of this as the full sense of this Text,</hi>
as it this were all that Christ did in destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the works of the Devil, and in restoring
what he had ruined, but I speak of it as a
part of the Apostles meaning, and a part of
that work of Christ concerning the point in
hand.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:99532:130"/>
Fifthly, <hi>Observe that by this work Christ
established the Law:</hi> For first, <hi>As the Law was
given to man, so the Son of God took upon him
the nature of man, and subjected it to the Law,</hi>
as it is said, he was made under the Law.
2. <hi>He wrote this Law of perfect holiness and
Righteousness upon this humane Soul,</hi> thus u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
to his God-head. 3. <hi>In this nature of
man, He perfectly fulfilled the Law, by all
which he acknowledged the Law to be a perfect
Rule of Righteousness,</hi> which as man, he was
bound to obey, and so did really confirm and
ratifie the Authority of it, whereas on the
contrary, they that taught m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n to seek justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and to approve themselves as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in the sight of God, by their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
works of obedience to the Law, though
they pretended to magnifie the Law, they did
make void the Law, because their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
was far short of what the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
and therefore to profess that they
looked to be justified or found Righteous in
the sight of God by their own imperfect
works done in obedience to the Law, was to
accuse the Law of imperfection, and so to
make void the Law. Saith <hi>David, The Law
of the Lord is perfect,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 7.</note> and therefore none can
be justified by the Law, unless their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
be perfect. Now for sinful men
whose natures are contrary to the Law, whose
sinful omissions and commissions are number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
whose best works are exceedingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
and defective, to profess themselves
justified by the Law, is to deny the perfection



<pb n="233" facs="tcp:99532:130"/>
of the Law, and so to abolish or make void
the Law.</p>
            <p>So much for the first particular point com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in the general doctrine. The
second is this:</p>
            <p>That the Lord Iesus Christ established the Law
by making full satisfaction to the Law:<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> 
               <hi>where
note two particulars:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That Christ did make full satisfaction to
the Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That hereby he did establish it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the former, When Christ was
gloriously transfigured upon a certain moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in the sight of three of his Disciples,<note place="margin">Luk. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9. 30, 31.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
there talked with him two men, which
were <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who appeared in glory
and spake of his decease, which he should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> These two holy men
of God, who many ages before had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of this world, by an extraordinary
dispensation of God, were sent to meet the
Lord Christ upon this Mount; and why
these two? <hi>Moses</hi> was the Lawgiver,
I mean the ministerial Law-giver, the
Minister, Servant, or Instrument of the
Lord, by whom God who is the only au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical,
the supream Law-giver, delivered,
and as it were handed over his Law to the
people of <hi>Israel; Elias</hi> was one of the most
eminent among all the Prophets, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
zealous of the Law,<note place="margin">1 King. 18. 40. &amp; 19. 14, 15, 16, 17.</note> and by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
warrant from God, slew divers
hundreds of false Prophets for Idolatary, and
for teaching the people to transgress the Law,



<pb n="234" facs="tcp:99532:131"/>
and when he complained against <hi>Israel</hi> for
their heinous sins against the Law, the Lord
directed him to annoint <hi>Hazael</hi> to be King
over <hi>Syria, Iehu</hi> to be King over <hi>Israel,</hi> and
<hi>Elisha</hi> to be Prophet in his stead, as so many
executioners of Gods justice upon backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Israel</hi> for their horrible sins against the
Law. It seemeth then that these two were
sent to shew that the Lord Jesus Christ was
he of whom the Law and the Prophets spake,
whom the Ceremonial Law shadowed out by
Types and Figures, who was to perform full
obedience to the Moral Law, and make full
satisfaction for the transgressions of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Law, and to accomplish what was
foretold by the Prophets; and it is said ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
that they spake of his decease, which
he should accomplish at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> They
spake of his death and sufferings, whereby
he should make full satisfaction for the sins
and transgressions of men against the Law,
and fulfill the sayings of the Prophets. It is
not barely said he should dye or suffer death,
but that he should <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> accomplish his
decease, He should fully and compleatly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
such a death as should make full satisfaction
to the Law: He should undergo the full
penalty of the Law, and make full pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the debts which the Law could
charge upon his people. To make this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more clearly, consider these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Lord Iesus Christ was very
God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>in the beginning was the word, and the word



<pb n="235" facs="tcp:99532:131"/>
was with God, and the word was God,</hi> the same
was in the beginning with God, all things
were made by him, and without him was
not any thing made that was made. The Son
of God is called the word, God the Father
manifesting himself by the Son, as a man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
known his mind by his words or speech.
There is the coessential word of God, and
there is the declarative word of God; the
Son of God is the coessential word of God, of
the same essence with God the Father. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative
word of God is that which we have
in the holy Scriptures: So Christ prayed to
his Father for his people, <hi>Sanctifie them

word of God which worketh effectually in you
that believe.</hi> These and the like places shew
the folly of those who seem to hold, that
there is no other word of God but Christ,
whereas it is plain, that the holy Ghost call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the word written in the Scriptures, and
the word preached and taught according to
the Scriptures, the Word of God, <hi>scil.</hi> his
declarative word, but Christ is the coessential
or co substantial word of God: and here it

               </gap> said, He was in the beginning, declaring

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:99532:132"/>
glorifie thou me with thine own self, with the

who are one God and two distinct persons,
then his God-head is expresly asserted. And
the word was God, the same God with the

were Created by him and for him, and he is

<hi>He is before all things, his Almighty

end of the Creation: They were made for
his glory, a clear evidence to prove him to be
very God, the same God with the Father,
for it is the peculiar Prerogative of God to

whom all things were made;<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 36.</note> for of him,

               </gap>. The Apostle shews,
<hi>That Christ being in the form of God, thought
or judged it to be no Robbery to be equal with
God,</hi> in all eternity he was in the form of
God, he was really, properly, essentially
God, and therefore judged it to be no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
to be equal with God. This cutteth off
all cavils, for how could it have been less
then an high degree of robbery or Sacriledge,
for any one that was not as truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
God as the Father, even the same God
with the Father, to judge himself equal with
God, in as much as God the Creator is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
above the most excellent of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>He took upon him the Nature of

               <hi>the word was made flesh.</hi> The eternal
word or Son of God who was before all time,
without beginning of dayes, was pleased in
the fulness of time to be made flesh, not by
transmutation, but by assumption, not by
turning his unchangeable God-head into
flesh, but by taking flesh, that is, a true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, soul and body, into the unity of
his person, so uniting the nature of man to



<pb n="238" facs="tcp:99532:133"/>
his God-head, as to make it properly his own;
to become one person with himself, the God-head
being never separated again from the
manhood, nor confounded with it, both natures
remaining distinct, but never divided from each
other, the same Christ remaining perfect God
and perfect man: so where it is shewed that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the form of God, &amp;c. it followeth,
<hi>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon
him the form of a Servant, and was made in
the likeness of men, and found in fashion as a
man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7, 8.</note> &amp;c. And without controversie great
is the mystery of Godliness, <hi>God was manifest
in the flesh.</hi> This is indeed a great mystery, of
such an height and depth, and far exceedeth
the reach of mens understandings, yet a most
certain and infallible truth to be received by
faith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>and it was necessary the Redeemer of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

Jesus Christ as he was man, suffered death,

he raised his humane nature from the dead.

Secondly, <hi>That the infinite worth and excellency
of his God-head might make his sufferings of

            <p n="1">1. <hi>That he might be subject to the Law;</hi> for
it was impossible that the God-head should be

the Apostle,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note> We see Jesus who was made a

               </gap> this Ceremony, they did as it
were put off the sins of all the people from
the guilty sinners, upon the Sacrifice: So the
Lord Christ, before he suffered for the sins of

guilt of all their sins, for he hath made him

to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we
might be made the righteousness of God in
him,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> the guilt of mens sins was imputed
unto him, and put upon his account, as his
righteousness is imputed to Believers, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

            <p n="4">4. <hi>He subjected himself to the Curse of the
Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10, 13.</note> 
               <hi>due to men for their sins against the Law;</hi>
for it is written, <hi>Cursed is every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth

<hi>ver. 13. Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse
of the Law, being made a Curse for us;</hi> for
it is written, <hi>Cursed is every on that hangeth

flames of divine wrath, which would have
been a consuming fire to a meer Creature:
but as the wood of the Altar for burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was overlaid with Brass that it might not
be devoured by the fire: so his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being united to the God-head, was so
fortified to endure the burning heat of the
wrath and Curse of God, that it was not
consumed by it, but although the God-head
was inseparably united to the manhood, and
did not leave it for a moment, yet it did so
withhold its divine influence from the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
for a time, that it suffered extream and
unconceivable torments in body, but especially
in soul, as appeareth in the holy story; for
though God the Father loved him infinitely
as his Son, and as one that was perfectly holy
and righteous in his own person, yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
his justice upon him to the full, as he



<pb n="242" facs="tcp:99532:135"/>
presented himself before him, burdened with
the guilt of mans sins against the Law. <hi>It
pleased the Lord to bruise him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 53. 10.</note> 
               <hi>he hath put him
to grief.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33.</note> Saith the Apostle, <hi>He spared not
his own Son, but delivered him up for us.</hi> He
spared not his own Son; He found him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to satisfie the Law for the sins of men,
and therefore he executed the severity of the
Law upon him, and spared him not, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him up for us all, saith the Text.
He did as it were deliver him up with his own
hand for sinners, delivering him up by the
hand of his love, towards sinners, to the hand
of his justice, to be punished for their sins: so
that I conceive it may be said that Christ had
judgement without mercy, that through him
mercy might glory over judgment toward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
and believing sinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He actually suffered death; <hi>He did
shed his most precious blood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8.</note> He humbled
himself and became obedient unto death,<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 12.</note> even the
death of the Cross.<note place="margin">Matth. 27. 50.</note> 
               <hi>He poured out his soul
unto death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 19. 33, 34.</note> Iesus when he had cried again
with a loud voice, yeilded up the Ghost. When
they came to Iesus, and saw that he was dead
already, they brake not his leggs, but one of the
Souldiers with his Spear pierced his side,<note place="margin">ver. 41, 42.</note> and
forthwith came thereout blood and water.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>That it might be manifest that the
Prince of life was really dead for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the Law, He suffered his body to be
caried to Prison, to be shut up in the grave, and
held under the power of death untill the third
day. Now in the place where he was crucified



<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99532:135"/>
there was a garden, and in the Garden a new Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,
wherein was never man yet laid, there
laid they Iesus.</hi> Thus ye see the Lord Jesus
Christ satisfied the Law to the full, endured
the rigour, and bare the penalty of it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
by satisfying the Law, and endruing
the severity of it, he established the Law.
I suppose it is not necessary to speak much
of this particular, because the opening of
the former giveth light unto it, breifly thus:
1. The Law required perfect obedience, as
ye heard, the full performance of every branch
and tittle of it. 2. In case of disobedience,
transgression, defect, and failing in obedience,
the Law denounced a grievous penalty, a
Curse,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> death and destruction, as was noted
also, yea the Law given to mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi>
had the sentence of death annexed, <hi>In the day
thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</hi> 3.
Hence it followeth, that if neither the Law be
fulfilled in a way of obedience, nor satisfied
by the inflicting of the punishment, then it
is made void, and declared to be of no force,
to have lost its authority, its vigour, and to
be frustrated of its end. 4. Thereupon we
may infer by the rule of contraries, that the
Lord Jesus Christ having in the nature of
man born the full penalty, severity, and Curse
of the Law, due to the sins of men against
the Law, and by his God-head, to which
his humane nature wherein he suffered is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
united, gave sufficient value and worth
to his sufferings, to make full satisfaction to
the Law, to the uttermost, that the Law in



<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99532:136"/>
its greatest rigour could require: hence it
clearly followeth, that Christ established the
Law. This was a reall and full acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of the Authority of the Law;
the wonderful abasement, the grievous suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of the Son of God, were signal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
infallible demonstrations of the force
and authority of the Law; the Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
appearing in the form of a Servant, to
make way for satisfying the Law: he that is
the brightness of the Fathers glory, enduring
the shame of the Cross, did abundantly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the world the Authority of the Law.
The Lord Jesus Christ spared not his most
precious blood, but freely poured it forth to
satisfie the Law, for the sins of his people,
and thereby ratified and sealed the Authority
of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How should this be improved to stir up poor
souls without delay to turn to the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> 
               <hi>and
flee to Christ?</hi> For in as much as the Lord
Jesus did both perform perfect obedience to
the Law, and bear the full penalty and curse of
the Law, and by both these establish the Law;
it sheweth clearly that the Law standeth in full
force against all that are out of Christ, they
being guilty of sin against the Law, are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Curse of the Law; for being not
found in Christ, they have no part in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
righteousness and full satisfaction, and
therefore are every moment in danger of the
sentence of condemnation denounced by the
the Law. It is true that Christ hath fully
satisfied the Law: But what doth this help



<pb n="245" facs="tcp:99532:136"/>
them that remain in their natural estate of
impenitency and unbelief? That full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which Christ made to the Law, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth
the Authority of the Law, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth
to the world, that the Law spareth
none that are under the Law, and so are
all that are not in Christ, and so under grace;
and therefore rest not one day in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
sin lieth at the door, he avenger of
blood is at thy back, the voice of the Law
is, <hi>pay that thou owest:</hi> It is a groundless plea
to say, Christ hath paid all, if thou remainest
out of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> 
               <hi>If sin were so exceeding grievous
and bitter unto Christ, Oh let it not be sweet and
delightful unto thee!</hi> It sin imputed were such
an unspeakable torment to the Lord Jesus
Christ, What a shame is it for any that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be members of Christ, to make it the
matter of their contentment? Dost thou call
thy self a Christian, and canst thou see the
Son of God abased for sin, put to an open
shame, buffetted, spit upon, crowned with
thorns, and sweating drops of blood, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
afflicted in soul, bleeding and dying
upon the Cross for sin, and yet canst thou
hold up thy head, take a pride in sin, glory in
it, despise reproof, gain by it, thrive by it,
rise by it, get preferment by it, sport and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
thy se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f with it, and still own the name
of a Christian? What is this but to be an
Enemy to the Cross of Christ, harbouring
in thy bosom, that Enemy which fastned and
nailed him to the Cross?</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:99532:137"/>
Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> 
               <hi>Here'is ground of sound comfort
for them that are in Christ,</hi> He hath made full
satisfaction to the Law, he hath paid the
debts of his people, cancelled the bond of
the Law, redeemed them from the Curse,
the Law can exact no satisfaction from them,
he hath fully cleared all accounts, <hi>There is
therefore now no condemnation to them which are
in Christ Iesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> 
               <hi>who walk not after the flesh but
after the Spirit:</hi> But of this somewhat may
be spoken upon the next point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third particular followeth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect 3.</note> viz. That
the Lord Iesus Christ established the Law by
communicating his perfect righteousness to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:
<hi>where, as in the former points there
are two Branches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the perfect righteousness of Christ
is communicated to Believers.<note place="margin">1. Branch.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That hereby the Law is established.
Concerning the former, ye heard before of
the perfect Righteousness of Christ, who both
was a Lamb without spot, knew no sin, and
performed compleat obedience to the Law,
and also did undergo the punishment and
Curse of the Law due to the sins of men and
women, and so made full satisfaction to the
Law. Now that which is to be cleared is
this, That this perfect Righteousness of Christ
is communicated to Believers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How it is received by Believers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What are the effects and consequents of
the righteousness of Christ thus communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
and received.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:99532:137"/>
For the first, 1. <hi>The righteousness of Christ is
communicated to Believers, not by infusion, but
by imputation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> not so as to be inherent in them,
but so as to be imputed to them; so as to
be accounted theirs; for he hath made him
to be sin for us that knew no sin, that we might
be made the righteousness of God in him.
As the sins of men were not infused into
Christ, so as to be inherent in him, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him: so the Righteousness of Christ
is not infused into Believers, so as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in them, but is imputed to them and
accounted theirs. The satisfaction which
Christ hath made to the Law is imputed to
them, that is, reckoned to belong unto them,
as if they had satisfied the Law in their own
persons.<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 22, 23, 24.</note> So it is said of <hi>Abraham, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
unto him for Righteousness. Now it was
not written for his sake alone, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him: but for us also to whom it shall
be imputed, if we believe on him who raised up
Iesus our Lord from the dead.</hi> As if a King
should pardon a great Malefactour for his
Fathers sake, who had done some eminent
service to the State, his Fathers deservings
might be said to be imputed to him, accounted
his, as if they had been his own; and when
a surety payeth anothers debt, the payment
is imputed to the debtour, and accounted as
done by him, and he is as fully discharged
and esteemed out of debt, as if he had paid
it with his own mony: so Believers have no
Righteousness of their own to satisfie the
justice of God, but the Righteousness of Christ



<pb n="248" facs="tcp:99532:138"/>
is imputed to them, that is accounted theirs;
as if they had been perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctly righteous by
performing perfect obedience, and making
full satisfaction in their own persons to the
Law; and here ye may observe who it is
that imputeth the Righteousness of Christ to
Believers 2. Of what nature this act of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is God that imputeth the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ to Believers, saith the Apostle.
<hi>David</hi> describeth the blessedness of the man
unto whom <hi>God imputeth Righteousness without
works;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 6.</note> it is God who imputeth Righteousness
unto justification, and it properly belongeth
to him as the supream Judge; <hi>Who shall lay
any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is
God that justifieth, Who is he that condemneth,
it is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen
again, who is even at the right hand of God,
who also maketh intercession for us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33, 34.</note> Here the
Apostle seemeth to set before us a represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the highest Tribunal or Court of
Judicature, intimating or supposing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
indicted, the Accuser, the Judge, the
Advocate; the Persons indicted or arraigned,
the Elect of God, true believers: the Accuser,
implied in those words <hi>Who shall lay any thing
to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> the Judge, God;
it is God that justifieth, the Advocate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ
who, first died, and so made satisfaction for
the sins of his people. 2. Rose again, and
by this his deliverance, out of the grave the
prison of Death, made it evident that their
debts were fully discharged. 3. He is at



<pb n="249" facs="tcp:99532:138"/>
the right hand of God, which is a sure ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that he is highly in the Judges favour.
4. He improveth his interest in the Judge, by
making intercession for his people, presenting
his merit and Righteousness to his Father,
to be imputed to them, and accounted theirs,
and therein pleading his satisfaction, made in
their stead, for their pardon and justification.
But the thing for which I bring this place at
the present is, to shew that it is God who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth
the righteousness of Christ to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
it is he that justifieth, God is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cause, the Authour of the imputation
of Christ his righteousness to his people, and
so of their justification, <hi>It is one God which
shall justifie the circumcision by faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 30.</note> 
               <hi>and the
uncircumcision through faith, scil.</hi> all sincere
Believers, whether <hi>Israelites</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Now
the works of God toward the Creatures, are
the works of all the three persons of the
God-head, Father, Son, and holy Ghost, and
therefore Christ, as he is Mediator between
God and man, presented his righteousness
unto God, to be imputed to his people for
their justification; as he is God, he imputeth
his righteousness, merit and satisfaction to
them, and justifieth them. 2. Consider of
what nature this act of imputation is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be an act of Justice or of Grace. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this Act of God, imputing the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ to his people, is an act of
grace or free favour, &amp; undeserved love; <hi>Being
justified freely by his grace, through the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is in Christ Iesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 24.</note> 
               <hi>whom God hath set



<pb n="250" facs="tcp:99532:139"/>
forth to be a propitiation through Faith in his
blood.</hi> It is said Believers are justified freely:
and then again, by his grace, the latter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
the former; freely, that is, by his grace
and free favour: for though the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and satisfaction of Christ is of infinite
merit and worth; yet 1. God the Father by
a pure Act of Grace, gave his Son to dye for
sinners: so it is said here, <hi>whom God hath set
forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
blood:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 18.</note> herein is love, not that we loved God,
but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be
the propitiation for our sins. 2. Christ, as he
was man, was freely chosen of God for this
purpose; so God saith concerning him, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
my servant whom I have chosen:</hi> The man
Christ Jesus was freely chosen of God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one person with the Son of God;<note place="margin">Mat: 12. 18.</note> the
Son of <hi>Mary</hi> did not merit to be personally
united to the Son of God, but was freely cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
of God, to be exalted to this incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
dignity, glory and Majesty, far above
all other creatures, Angels and men, and
from this personal union to which he was
freely chosen, proceedeth the greatness and
all-sufficiency of his merit. 3. God in his
Law hath denounced the penalty of death, the
Curse, everlasting destruction, against every
one that was guilty of sin against the Law,
and he was not bound to accept of satisfaction
at the hand of another in their stead, nor to
hold them discharged of the guilt of their
sins, upon the account of anothers sufferings
for sin, and therefore it was an Act of meer



<pb n="251" facs="tcp:99532:139"/>
grace in God, to accept of Christ his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in behalf of sinners, and to impute
his righteousness to them, and to account it
theirs for their justification. And so it was
according to the Covenant and Agreement
which God the Father freely made with
Christ, according to which agreement, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are given to Christ: so he saith to
his Father, I pray for them which thou hast
given me,<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 9.</note> for they are thine: Behold I and
the children which God hath given me,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 13.</note> those
lost sinners whom God gave to Christ, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
and Redeemer, to save them by his
death and satisfaction: to them God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by his grace, that is, freely imputeth the
Righteousness of Christ, &amp; accounteth it theirs,
accepting them as righteous through him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Observe how the Righteousness of
Christ is received by believers,</hi> that is, <hi>by faith
unfeigned:</hi> the Righteousness of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Law is manifested, being witnessed
by the Law and the Prophets,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 21, 22:</note> even the
righteousness of God which is by faith
of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all
that beleive the Righteousness whereby Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are justified, is the Righteousness of
God; it is such a Righteousness as God hath
revealed; as he hath appointed for this end;
as he approveth and accepteth; such a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
as he giveth to Believers, this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
is received and applied by the faith
of Jesus Christ: not by the faith which Christ
hath, but by the faith which Believers have in
Christ, not by the faith whereby Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,



<pb n="252" facs="tcp:99532:140"/>
but by the faith whereby men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ. Believers being united to Christ
by the spirit on the one side, and by faith on
the other. God imputeth the Righteousness
of Christ unto them, and they receive and
apply it to themselves by faith:<note place="margin">ver. 28.</note> So in that
conclusion of the Apostle, <hi>Therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that a man is justified by faith without the
works of the Law.</hi> In these and many other
places, where faith is said to justifie, Divines
understand it to be meant not <hi>meritoriously;</hi>
for so Christ justifieth by his merit, procuring
justification for sinners: <hi>not by way of efficiency,</hi>
for so God justifieth, as the Author of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
as the Judge, imputing Christ his
righteousness to Believers, and so justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them: <hi>not materially,</hi> for so the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ justifieth, as the matter
of justification: <hi>not formally,</hi> for that is by
way of imputation, <hi>but faith justifieth. 1.
Objective,</hi> not by force of its own Act of
believing, but by vertue of its Object, which
it apprehendeth, <hi>scil.</hi> Christ his righteousness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Instrumentally, Faith justifieth</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the righteousness of Christ to the
Believing soul, whereby it is justified.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Observe the effects,</hi> or Consequents of
the righteousness of Christ thus imputed of
God, and received by faith, they are delivered
from the guilt of sin,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 7, 8. &amp; 8. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Blessed are they whose ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not
impute sin.</hi> Christ his righteousness is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
theirs, and so their own sins are no longer



<pb n="253" facs="tcp:99532:140"/>
accounted theirs, and so they are free from
condemnation. <hi>There is now therefore no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
to them which are in Christ Iesus,
who walk not after the flesh but after the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
They are accepted as righteous in the sight
of God, because the perfect righteousness of
Christ is imputed to them, who perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fully suffered the penalty
of the Law, hereby also they have an interest
in everlasting life and salvation,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Whom he
justifieth, them he also glorified.</hi> Again, a
constant consequent of the righteousness of
Christ communicated and imputed to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
for their justification is regeneration,
conversion, sanctification; for the same faith
which applieth the Righteousness of Christ to
Believers for the forgiveness of sin, and for
their justification, doth unite them to Christ,
so that they partake of his spirit and sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
graces.</p>
            <p>The second Branch of the point is,<note place="margin">2. Branch.</note> 
               <hi>That
the Lord Iesus Christ by communicating his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Righteousness to Believers doth establish the
Law.</hi> This clearly followeth upon those
things which have been spoken, for in as
much as the Lord Jesus Christ performed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Law, and suffered the full
penalty of the Law, and then communicated
his perfect Righteousness to Believers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them one with himself, uniting himself
to them by his spirit, and uniting them to
himself by faith, that so himself and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Righteousness might become theirs, and
that hereby they might be justified and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted



<pb n="254" facs="tcp:99532:141"/>
as righteous in the sight of God. This
was an effectual declaration, a real acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the force and Authority of the
Law: for hereby he witnessed that the Law
was such an authentical and indispensable rule
of righteousness, that none could be justified
and accepted as righteous in the sight of God
the supream Lawgiver and Judge, but by
such a Righteousness as was fully answerable
to the Rule of the Law, and therefore because
in this corrupt state of Nature, wherein all
mankind are, since the fall, no man could have
performed perfect obedience to the Law in
his own person, but all must have lain under
the sentence of condemnation, and utterly
perished. The Lord Christ having taken upon
him the Name of Jesus, and the office of a
Saviour and Redeemer, to save his people from
their sins, yet would not save them in an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal
and irregular way, not by his royal
prerogative without respect to the Law, but
by fulfilling the Righteousness of the Law in
his own person, and then communicating his
perfect righteousness to them, investing them
with it, cloathing them with this spotless and
glorious robe of his Righteousness. On the
other side, the contrary doctrine of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the works of the Law, teaching that
men might be delivered from Condemnation,
and approve themselves as righteous in the
sight of God, by their own inherent holiness
and works performed by them in obedience to
the Law, did deny the force, the vigour and
Authority of the Law, because the holiness



<pb n="255" facs="tcp:99532:141"/>
and performances of the best of them did
fall far short of the perfection of the Law.
Now to say that men may be justified by the
works of the Law, whose works did not
answer the righteousness required in the Law,
was to declare the Law to be void, to have
lost its power, to condemn the transgressours,
of the Law. But Christ having fulfilled the
righteousness of the Law, and born the full
punishment of it, and communicated his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
to Believers; hath dearly and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ratified the Authority of the Law, and
so as the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Christ is the end of the
Law for righteousness to every one that believeth.</hi>
The Law attaineth its end in Christ, because
He hath fully answered and satisfied the Law,
and communicateth his perfect righteousness
to his people, that they might be justified and
saved without the least prejudice to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The use of this may be,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> 
               <hi>to stir up Believers
exceedingly to admire and magnifie the Lord
Iesus Christ, who being very God, the supream
Law-giver, from whom the Law received all its
force and Authority, was pleased by a voluntary
Act of his love to become man and so to be made
under the Law;</hi> to subject himself to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and power of the Law, to perform
perfect obedience to the Law, and to bear the
Curse of it, and then as it were to make over,
and communicate to poor guilty condemned
sinners, this his perfect righteousness for their
justification and salvation; and therefore the
Apostle prayed thus for Believers that Christ



<pb n="256" facs="tcp:99532:142"/>
may dwell in their hearts by faith,<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 17, 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>That ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth,

an height and depth which Creatures cannot

Christ,<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 6.</note> and his perfect righteousness, should
labour to view and surveigh it diligently, that
they may see into it more and more, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> 
               <hi>This may take down the natural

               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 27.</note> 
               <hi>By what Law? of works?</hi> nay,
<hi>but by the Law of faith,</hi> that is, by the doctrine
of the Gospel, which declareth that the only
way for men to escape condemnation, and to
appear righteous before God, is to become
poor in spirit, and as wretched, guilty, lost
creatures, to go out of themselves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all hope and confidence in themselves,
and all their own abilities, duties, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
and to flee to Christ alone, that
they may be justified by his righteousness, and
accepted of God in him, to come as poor
naked wretches, that have never a rag of



<pb n="257" facs="tcp:99532:142"/>
their own to cover their shame, and to beg
of Christ white rayment, the spotless cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his righteousness: this doctrine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
boasting, and confoundeth pride, if
there be any thing for which thy heart is apt
to be lifted up, either to think highly of thy
self, or to despise others, remember that if
thou art an unbeliever, thou standest guilty,
and condemned before the Lord, and so hast
cause instead of exalting thy self to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
abased, and to be restless, until thou
be delivered from condemnation, and hast
obtained pardon and justification through
the righteousness of Christ: If thou art a
true believer, remember thou art justified by
a righteousness which was never wrought by
thee in any part, but wholly and only by the
Lord Jesus Christ, and out of the riches of
grace and mercy, communicated and imputed
to thee, whereof thou wast as unworthy as
any of them that lye under the sentence of
condemnation; Hast thou not then a double
cause of humiliation? 1. Because of thine
own guiltiness and unworthiness in thy self.
2. Because so rich a favour was freely bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon thee; for the greater the gift is which
is bestowed upon unworthy persons, the more
cause have they to be low in their own eyes,
the bounty of the giver, and greatness of
the gift, casteth shame upon the unworthiness
of the receiver.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> 
               <hi>This may encourage the worst of men
and women, the chief of sinners, to come to
Christ, and to turn to the Lord.</hi> Here is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect



<pb n="258" facs="tcp:99532:143"/>
Righteousness, a full Satisfaction, here
is a Saviour and Mediator between God and
man, the man Christ Jesus, who hath performed
perfect obedience to the Law, and suffered the
punishment of the Law due to the greatest
sinners, for the greatest sins: and therefore as
was noted before, he is called <hi>Iehovah</hi> our
Righteousness; for though Believers are not
justified by the essential Righteousness of
Christ, as God; yet I conceive the infinite
worth of the infinite <hi>Iehovah,</hi> God the Son,
raiseth that righteousness which he hath
wrought for sinners, to such an unspeakable
value, as is sufficient for the sins of the whole
world: How inexcusable then is their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
who rather lye in their sins, then seek
to Christ? And on the other side, what a
door of hope is opened to them who are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
through the greatness of their sins;
What can hinder thee from receiving pardon
and obtaining full forgiveness? Not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sin, for Christ hath done and suffered
that which is abundantly sufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
all, nothing can hinder thee but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
and unbelieving heart.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> 
               <hi>Let Christians be stirred up ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
to labour after truth of faith, and
strength of faith;</hi> for as the Righteousness of
Christ is that for which Believers are accepted
as righteous with God: so saith is that grace
whereby it is applied to the soul, the Father
of the distressed child cryed out and said with
tears,<note place="margin">Mark 9. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Lord I believe, help mine unbelief:</hi> and
the Apostles said unto the Lord,<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Increase our

Faith.</hi> Pray earnestly for faith, and for
strength and increase of Faith, that ye may
be established in the faith, and confirmed in
the assurance of your interest in Christ, and
his perfect righteousness: this is the Sheild
which quenched the fiery darts of the Devil.
What may Christians expect, that the Devil
should rather aim at, than the destroying or
weakning of their faith, to divide them from
Christ, to dissolve the marriage bond between
him and them, to strip them of their wedding
garment, the robe of Christ's Righteousness?
And what should Christians endeavour more
than the strengthning of their faith?</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Vse 5.</note> 
               <hi>Let all that are in Christ, justified by
the Righteousness of Christ, labour to walk as
becometh those that are partakers of so rich a
blessing.</hi> This was one great end of Christ
his coming into the world, and performing
this glorious work of Redemption, that he
would grant unto us,<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 74, 75.</note> 
               <hi>That we being delivered
out of the hand of our Enemies, might serve him
without fear, in holiness and righteousness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him all the days of our life:</hi> and therefore
the Apostle having spoken at large of this
doctrine of justification by faith in Christ his
Righteousness,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> exhorteth Believers thus, <hi>I
beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of
God, that ye present your bodies as a Sacrifice,
living, holy, acceptable unto God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of him
are ye in Christ Iesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> 
               <hi>who of God is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and redemption:</hi> those to whom Christ is made

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99532:144"/>
he is made sanctification, conforming them
to himself in holiness. Justification and
Sanctification are, 1. Distinct. 2. Unsepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
neither to be confounded together, nor
separated from each other: They are distinct,
Sanctification is no cause nor part of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
No man is justified for his holiness,
but only for the righteousness of Christ. On
the other side, sanctification and holiness is
unseparably joyned with justification; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is justified is also sanctified, when sin
is forgiven, it is also mortified.</p>
            <p>Do not flatter your selves with a perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the pardon of your sins, and the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of your persons, while ye want the
beginning of sanctification. Saith the Apostle,
<hi>Ye are washed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 11.</note> 
               <hi>ye are sanctified, ye are justified
in the name of the Lord Iesus, and by the spirit
of our God.</hi> All that are washed from the
guilt of sin in the name of Christ, and by
the virtue of his blood, being made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of righteousness unto justification, are
also washed by his sanctifying spirit and grace,
from the filth and pollution of sin, and made
partakers of his holiness.</p>
            <p>In the next place, we have the fourth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,<note place="margin">Sect. 4. Doct.</note>
               <hi>That the Lord Iesus Christ established
the Law, by making it a rule of obedience to his
people.</hi> 1. Christ made the Law a rule of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his people. 2. Hereby he establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the former,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17, 18.</note> the Lord Christ
saith, <hi>Think not that I am come to destroy the
Law and the Prophets, I am not come to destroy,



<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99532:144"/>
but to fulfill; for verily I say unto you, till Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in
no wise pass from the Law till all be fulfilled,</hi>
the Law is established as a perpetual rule to
direct Christians in the ordering of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
all the powers of their souls, affections
of their hearts, their thoughts, words, and
actions; and therefore Christ himself in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
passages following, presseth, not only the
outward but also the inward observation of
the Law, a certain man asked Christ this
question,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39. 40.</note> 
               <hi>Which is the great Commandment in
the Law? Iesus said unto him, Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy mind: This is the first
and great Commandment, and the second is like
unto it, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy
self: on these two Commandments hang all the
Law and the Prophets.</hi> I conceive the Lord
Christ in this answer doth clearly confirm the
Law, as a Rule of obedience by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
1. He doth as it were open the bowels
of the Law, and discover the soul and spirit
of it, shewing that it consisteth in two things,
1. Intire, and perfect love to God. 2. As
subordinate hereunto, sincere love to our
Neighbour. 1. Because all things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Law are, either love to God and
man, or such things as love supposeth, as
the knowledge of God, or such affections,
thoughts, words, actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as accompany or
flow from love. 2. All sins of omission or
commission towards God or man, are either
want of love, or such as proceed from the



<pb n="262" facs="tcp:99532:145"/>
want of love. Now in that Christ doth so
highly extol these two Commandments
which comprehend the substance of the Law,
he established the Law as a rule of obedience
for his people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In this speech, he had respect,
not only to the ten Commandments delivered
<hi>Exod.</hi> 20. but also to the doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
throughout the old Testament, saying,
<hi>On these two,</hi> &amp;c. The Prophets opening and
enlarging in particulars, what is generally
comprized in the ten Commandments: and
if we compare this with what we had before,
where he saith, he came to fulfill the Law and
the Prophets; we may gather, that he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
the Law delivered by <hi>Moses,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by the Prophets, as a Rule of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his people. Again, how frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth the spirit of Christ in his Apostles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
the Law, as a rule of obedience for
his people. What are those things which
the Apostles by the Authority of Christ and
his Name, require of Christians but things
commanded in the Law? And what are those
sins which they call upon Christians to shun,
but sins forbidden in the Law? <hi>Let Love be
without dissimulation:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 9.</note> 
               <hi>abhor that which is evil,
cleave to that which is good,</hi> &amp;c. What mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of instances might be given in this
kind,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 5.</note> and therefore saith the Apostle, <hi>The end
of the Commandments is Charity out of a pure
heart, and of a good Conscience, and of faith
unfeigned.</hi> These are things required in the
Law.<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>The grace of God which bringeth salvation



<pb n="263" facs="tcp:99532:145"/>
to all men, hath appeared, teaching us, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
live soberly, righteously and godly in this present
world.</hi> The Gospel and word of grace which
Christ hath revealed to the world, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by his death, teacheth those things
which are the substance of the Law; and
therefore Christ hath established the Law, for a
Rule by which his people are to act and walk,
<hi>As he which hath called you is holy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 15, 16</note>

               <hi>because it is
written, be ye holy for I am holy.</hi> The spirit of
Christ in the Apostle, alledgeth the very word
of the Law as ratified by the Authority of
Christ, as a rule of holiness to which his
people must conform their hearts and lives.
But it may be Objected,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> that divers passages

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> things, consider,
<hi>That the Law may be considered two wayes. 1.
As a Covenant of works, severely requiring full
and exact obedience and perfect righteousness upon
pain of the Curse:</hi> and so Believers being in
Christ, are not under the Law but under
grace. The Lord hath reconciled them to
himself in Christ, received them into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace, discharged them of the curse
of the Law, and sentence of condemnation,



<pb n="264" facs="tcp:99532:146"/>
justified and accepted them as righteous
through the righteousness of Christ, given
them access to his mercy seat, so that the Law
is not made for a righteous man, as a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works. Believers are not to be judged
according to the rigour and severity of the
Law, nor subject to the curse or condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law, and therefore the Apostle
saith, <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse
of the Law, being made a Curse for us:</hi> but
the lawless and disobedient natural persons,
being out of Christ, and standing upon their
own bottom, and so being to answer the
justice of God upon their own account, are
under the Law as a Covenant of works, and
subject to the malediction, Curse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the Law.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> Secondly, <hi>The Law
may be considered as a Rule of life, as a direction
to true Believers, guiding them in the wayes of
God, teaching them how they ought to walk and
to please God,</hi> how to walk answerably to his
saving mercies, and spiritual blessings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to them in Christ: and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Law is established by Christ, for the
use of his people; and so I conceive in this
sense, the Law is so far from being a Covenant
of works, that it becometh a part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace, or a Rule subservient to the
Gospel.<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 2, 3.</note> So the Apostle telleth the believing
<hi>Thessalonians, Ye know what Commandments
we gave you by the Lord Iesus,</hi> the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which he delivered to them were given
by the Lord Jesus, in the Name of the Lord
Jesus Christ, by vertue of his Authority and



<pb n="265" facs="tcp:99532:146"/>
Commission received from him? Now what
Commandments were these? Even the same
that are delivered in the Law, in some of
which the Apostle giveth instance: First in
general, <hi>This is the will of God, even your
sanctification, that ye should be sanctified,</hi> and
so conformed to the Law of God in all things.</p>
            <p>Then in special, <hi>That every one of you should
know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and
honour, not in the lusts of Concupiscence,</hi> &amp;c.
In a word, the Law is of use both unto them
that are out of Christ, and to them that are
in Christ: To the former it discovereth the
contrariety of their Natures, hearts, and
lives, to the mind and will of God, their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
disability to fulfill the Law, and thereupon
makes known unto them their woful estate,
that they lye open to the wrath and Curse of
God, and the danger of everlasting condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and so the Law may be of use: 1. <hi>To take
down the natural pride that is in men and women,</hi>
to cause them to see their own vileness and lost
condition, to renounce all confidence in their
own imaginary righteousness, to abase them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the dust before the Lord,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> 
               <hi>For by the
Law is the knowledge of sin.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The Law
may be of use to such, to drive them out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
to seek after the remedy, to cause them
to flee to Christ, that they may be washed in
his blood from all their sins, justified by his
perfect righteousness, and so redeemed from
the Curse of the Law, and delivered from the
wrath to come. 2. <hi>To true Believers the Law
may be useful.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="266" facs="tcp:99532:147"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To humble them, and make them poor in
spirit, and low in their own eyes.</hi> And that, 1.
<hi>In respect of their state by Nature. 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their present condition,</hi> now that they
are renewed by grace. In the former respect,
they may see in the glass of the pure and holy
Law of God, the woful deformities and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
of their souls, as they were of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
their numberless omissions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,
and being inlightned by the spirit
of Christ, these things are the more manifest
to them. Secondly, <hi>In respect of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
condition, as they are renewed by grace</hi>
though they have the spirit of Christ confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
them in some degree to the Law, yet
by comparing both the frame of their souls,
and their thoughts, words, actings, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
with the pure and spiritual Law of
God; they find themselves far short of the
mark, and that they need daily renewed acts
of grace and free pardon from the mercy
seat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Law is of use to direct them,
to shew them what frame of spirit, what wayes
are pleasing to the Lord, who is the Law-giver,
and Author of the Law.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Law is useful to Believers,</hi> to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
them and stir them up more and more,
to purge themselves from all filthiness of flesh
and spirit, to cleanse their hearts from those
corruptions which are contrary to the Law,
and to labour after an increase and growth in
all holy and sanctifying graces, and to strive
after farther perfection, saith the Apostle,



<pb n="267" facs="tcp:99532:147"/>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13, 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>I count not my self to have apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but this one thing I do, forgetting those things
which are behind, and reaching forth unto those
things which are before, I press toward the mark
for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
Iesus.</hi> It seemeth the Apostle, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that great measure of the spirit of Christ,
which he had received, and the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
made of his Talents, the eminent
services done to the Church, yet looked upon
the mark, as being far before him, a great
way beyond him, that is, that he was far
short of the perfection of holiness and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
which the Law required, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he did reach forth and press forward with
all his might. When the best Christians find
how far they fall short of that height of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which the Law calleth for, <hi>scil.</hi> to love
the Lord their God with all the heart, and
all the mind, and all the soul, and all the
might, &amp;c. May not this be a powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to quicken them, to use all holy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for the perfecting of holiness in the fear
of God?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Lord Christ, by making the
Law a rule of life and holy obedience for his
people hath established the Law.</hi> It is true he
hath redeemed sincere Believers from the
Curse of the Law, but that was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least prejudice to the force and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Law, because himself did bear
the Curse in his own person, and so he did
both save his people from the Curse of the
Law, and yet fully satisfie the Law, but



<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99532:148"/>
herein did Christ put an high degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
upon the Law, that though he had
made full satisfaction to the Law, in behalf of
his people, yet he will have the Law to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
as a Directory and Rule of holiness and
righteousness for those that are appointed hei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
of salvation. He hath made the Law a Rule
for the ordering of his Royal family, of his
spiritual Kingdom. The Lord Christ hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
the Law to a great height of dignity, in
that himself being the Law-giver, and having
united Believers to himself by his spirit, and
ruling in their hearts by his grace, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
them to attend to the Law as the
Rule by which they should regulate and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their hearts and wayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The use of this may be, first to shew the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of those who seem to deny the use of the
Law for Believers in any kind,</hi> as if they were
to bring them in Bondage under a Covenant
of works. How usual is it with men to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the meaning of the holy Scripture, and
in special to take those things as absolutely
meant, which are to be understood only in
some respect. So in this case, because the
Scripture sheweth that Christians are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, therefore they seem to say, they
have nothing to do with the Law, and that
the Law hath not any thing to do with them:
but though they are free from the Curse of
the Law, yet the Law is still of great use to
them, to guide them in such a course of holy
obedience wherein they are to glorifie God,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 18, 19,</note>
and to walk worthy of the Lord to all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.



<pb n="269" facs="tcp:99532:148"/>
The Apostle I conceive speaketh of such
licentious libertines, and <hi>Antinomian</hi> teachers,
who when they speak great swelling words
of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the
flesh, through much wantonness, those that
were clean escaped from them that live in
errour, while they promise them liberty,
they themselves are yet servants of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for of whom a man is overcome, of
the same he is brought in bondage. Is it not
common with many to complain of bondage
under the Law, who on the other side remain
in a miserable bondage under their lusts?</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Vse.</note> 
               <hi>This may open the eyes of those
self-deceivers, who pretend faith in Christ, as if
their sins were pardoned through his satisfaction,</hi>
and their persons justified by his righteousness
without the works of the Law, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
sin securely, not caring to order their hearts
and waye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> according to the Law,</hi> nor to make it
the rule of their lives: The Apostle no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
sheweth the folly of such, for having
proved that Believers are freely pardoned and
justified by the righteousness of Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any consideration of their own works
done in obedience to the Law, insomuch that
he saith, <hi>Where sin abounded, grace did much
more abound:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 20.</note> whereas sin abounded in men,<note place="margin">Chap. 6. 1, 2.</note>
the grace and free love of God did much
more abound, and gloriously manifest it self
through Christ towards Believers, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
their sins, and accepting them as
righteous; thereupon he proposeth a question
or Objection, <hi>What shall I say then? Shall we



<pb n="270" facs="tcp:99532:149"/>
continue in sin that grace may abound?</hi> as if
some licentious person turning the grace of
God into laciviousness, should say, if our best
works be of no force or weight at all towards
our justification on the one side, and the
grace of God on the other side, be gloriously
illustrated by occasion of our sins, why should
we fear to sin against the Law, or be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to walk according to that Rule. The
Apostle answereth by way of detestation,
<hi>God forbid; or, let it not be:</hi> Let not so vile
a thought enter into the heart of any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By way of confutation, How
shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer
therein? know we not that so many of us as
were baptized into Jesus Christ, were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
into his death; therefore we are buried
with him by Baptisme into his death, that like
as Christ was raised up from the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by the
glory of the Father; even so we also should
walk in newness of life, as if he had said, they
that are justified by the righteousness of Christ
applied by faith, are by the same faith united
unto Christ, and therefore dead to sin, as
Christ died for sin; and raised to newness of
life, as Christ rose from the dead; the spirit of
Christ thus manifesting the vertue of Christ
his death, and the power of his Resurrection
in them, and so leading them in the way of
holy obedience according to the rule of the
Law. They therefore that fancy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
pardon of sin, justification, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
through faith in Christ, and give up



<pb n="271" facs="tcp:99532:149"/>
themselves to walk according to their own
lusts, and not according to the Law of God,
do highly dishonour Christ, and delude their
own souls; for the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speaking of
him, <hi>And him hath God exalted with his right
hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give
repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</hi>
The Lord Jesus Christ is exalted to be both a
Prince and a Saviour, to rule and to save as
a Prince, to give repentance whereby men
and women are subjected to his government,
and to his holy Law; and as a Saviour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
for them forgiveness of sin and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
They then who would have their
sins pardoned through Christ, but not their
souls subjected to the will and Law of Christ,
they would have but an half Christ; they
would have Christ the Saviour, but not Christ
the Prince; and this is the way to have no
Christ at all, no portion nor interest in Christ.
I beseech you therefore as you love your souls,
take heed of this soul deceiving fancy; and
as you desire Christ for your Saviour, so obey
Him as your Prince, according to his holy
Law, which He hath established as a Rule
of life for his People.</p>
