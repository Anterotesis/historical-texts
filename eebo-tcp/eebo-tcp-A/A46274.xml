            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Iserable and most deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is the unhappy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and condition of these our present times: And as if Gods vengeance did not fall fast enough upon our heads for our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous crying sinnes, whilest the Almighty speaks peace and plenty unto us, out of the abundance of his rich and most unparallel'd goodnesse: Wee as if wee had surfeted with too much plenty and happinesse,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96872:3"/>
while God smites us not, goe about to smite each other. What can then be expected, without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven avert the judgement, convert and turne our hearts unto him, but that our long enjoyed peace should be turned into a present doubtfull War, and our happy plenty into an unhappy penury and want.</p>
            <p>Who is so blind, as not to fore-see these things at hand? And yet good God, most of us, as if our senses were become even stupid and senslesse, seek not the right way to cause the Almighty to avert these imminent and impendent dangers from falling on us: or I wish I might not more truly say, from suffering our selves to fall into them: For what could the Almighty have done more for Israel then he hath done for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Have not we for many yeares under religious Princes, (the memory of all which ought ever to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant unto us, and cause us out of a just and due gratitude to be ever thankfull unto God) long and happily enjoyed both peace and plenty, flowing, I had almost said even overflowing with the sacred Word of God, as Manna sent from above to feed our hungry soules; flowing again I say with all rich variety of plenty and delight, to afford happy solace and sustentation to our naturall bodies.</p>
            <p>And since our good God will not out of his unfathom'd mercie take them from us, doe not we I feare (I appeale to every ones conscience)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96872:3"/>
betake our selves to such courses as will soon, yea doubtlesse too soone deprive us of them; for with horrour (deare Countrymen of soule I speak it, how much is the King of Heaven and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed our dread Soveraigne here on Earth both at one time neglected? how much and how scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully are sacred Functions and places Prophaned and vilified? how much in a word are the known Lawes of this our Nation most strangely, either wrested, misconstrued or impugned? But no wonder if the Law of GOD which ought to be written in Golden Letters in the tables of our Hearts be so much disregarded, so much dise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, if mans Law be no more reputed, so much contemned. Feare God and honour the King, is the King of Heavens counsell, and how can wee imagine or rather justly assure our selves, that we can give Caesar a due honour, when as our tongues as well as our actions, well scanned, and with a vigilant eye being pryed into, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that we do not cordially and really feare, love, honour, &amp; obey that great Caesar of Caesars.</p>
            <p>O therefore if we would have all things to go well with us (as many fearfull curses fall on his head, who would not) let us make in the first place our atonement and peace with God, that the God of true peace may send his peace to reign amongst us, and this is the speediest and happiest way to avert the Almighties Judgement from falling on us, and to cause his mercies as formerly

they have done, to flow more powerfully upon us, for mistake not deere Countreymen, <hi>For the feare of God is the beginning of wisdome,</hi> as saith Kingly <hi>Solomon</hi>; and I too much feare this feare is not as yet engrafted in our hearts, nay rather I feare it, not at all; for did we truly feare God, wee should be afraid (and justly too) to violate his most just and sacred Law. And you know beloved, I wish you would also practice what you know, 'tis his expresse charge and command, <hi>Give unto</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesars, <hi>honour to whom honour belongeth,</hi> and shall any Mandate from any inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our power, cause any of us to violate the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date of heaven it selfe? me thinkes I heare you all say, as being of one minde with one voice, (justly indeede astonished and amazed) God forbid. O then why contemne ye the power of your <hi>Caesar?</hi> and is not this too frequently by too many of us daily practised? Truly if ever there were a Prince on earth after Gods own heart, such is our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous King CHARLES, as unparaled for his life as he is for his vertues, and what madnesse then were it for us (I say for us) because without wee will consent to our own undoing, heaven as it seemes is vnwilling to deprive us of these his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteimable blessings (I meane peace and plenty) so long, so happily continued amongst us, as if our good King had nothing else but love and mercie lodging in his royall heart, how hath he wooed us to continue in this our peace? first then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging

our own unworthinesse, Let us make our peace with God, and in the next place, not onely remember, but execute Gods Command, by <hi>giving unto</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesars, <hi>Honour to whom honour belongeth</hi>: Thus you shall bring true honour to your selves, whilst you give a due honour to God and the King, and become so many happy instruments, next under God, to settle a firme and most happie peace in these his Majesties Dominions, your native soile and his once (<hi>I</hi> would <hi>I</hi> could but say, and still justly say) most flourishing Kingdome. And <hi>I</hi> beseech him who ruleth the heart of Kings as it best pleaseth him, so to rule the hearts both of him and you all, that his holy law, may be the holy rule by which you may al square all your actions, so shall God be honoured by you, and in a due obedience to his just and imperial commands, our pious and most religious King CHARLES, bee unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously and chearfully obeyed, and if it bee thy heavenly will Lord say Amen, both for thy owne sake, for thy servant our dread Soveraignes sake, for his illustrious Consort, and all their royall off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>springs sake, and lastly for al good peoples sake, who humbly and heartily implore this great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie from thee.</p>
