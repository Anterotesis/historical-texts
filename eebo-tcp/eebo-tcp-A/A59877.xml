            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN obedience to the Order I received
from your Lordship and the Court
of Aldermen, I Present you with
this plain Sermon, the whole Design of
which is, not to debate any thing, nor to
determine on which side the Truth lies, in
those warm Disputes which have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, but to convince all those, who
<hi>Love and Pray for the Peace of
Jerusalem,</hi> how many Controversies
<pb facs="tcp:63387:4"/>
there are, which should be laid aside with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Disputing, and how a little condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to each other, may either happily
Vnite us into oue Communion, or at least
Teach us to Live together in Love and
Charity, notwithstanding some different
Apprehensions of Things; and I hope so
Charitable a Design as this, will raise no
new Disputes and Quarrels among us.</p>
            <p>That GOD would preserve his Church,
restore Peace and Vnity among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
bless this Great and Populous City,
and direct your Lordship in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

SERMON
Preach'd before the
Lord Mayor.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>122 PSALM 6, 7.</bibl>
               <q>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem, they
shall prosper that love Thee, Peace be
within thy Walls, and Prosperity
within thy Palaces.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THough the particular time and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Penning this <hi>Psalm</hi> is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
yet so much is plain, that it
was after <hi>David</hi> had setled the Ark at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
and made that City the place of God's
House, and of Religious Worship, and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63387:5"/>
Seat of Justice and Judgment. There was
the House of God, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. that is, though
the Temple was not yet built, if this <hi>Psalm</hi>
was composed by <hi>David,</hi> as the Title of
it signifies it was, yet there was the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
and the Ark of God, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
was in <hi>Shilo,</hi> and afterwards removed
from one place to another, till <hi>David</hi> setled
it in <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> thither all the Tribes of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
were to resort three times a year to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God before the Ark of the Testimony,
4 <hi>ver.</hi> There was the Imperial Seat, where
<hi>David</hi> had built his Throne and Palace, and
where his Posterity were to dwell and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
<hi>Israel;</hi> and therefore it was the Seat of
Justice too, as that must be, where the Kings
Throne and the House of God was placed.
<hi>There are set thrones of judgment, the thrones
of the house of David,</hi> 5 ver. These were
the peculiar Priviledges of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> above
any other City in <hi>Jury.</hi> This was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of that peculiar affection and passionate
concern, which <hi>David</hi> had himself, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
all others to express for <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
that he greatly rejoyced to go thither, and
to continue there. <hi>I was glad when they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63387:5"/>
said unto me, Let us go into the house of the
Lord, our feet shall stand within thy gates, O
Jerusalem.</hi> That he exhorts all people to
pray for the peace and prosperity of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and promises a Blessing to those who
love it; as it is in my Text, <hi>Pray for the peace
of Jerusalem, they shall prosper that love thee;
peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within
thy palaces.</hi> All this was not for the sake of
the material Buildings, the beauty of the
place, or the convenience of its scituation,
but because it was the Center of Unity;
<hi>Which is builded as a City that is compact to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
whither the Tribes go up, the Tribes of
the Lord, unto the Testimony of Israel, to give
thanks unto the name of the Lord,</hi> 3 &amp; 4 ver.
Which shews in what respect he commends
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that it <hi>is built as a City, which is
compact together;</hi> not with regard to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity
and regular Order and Union of
its material Buildings, but that it was the
Center of a Religious Unity and Order in
Worship, where all the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> met
and united in the same Acts of Worship and
Praise to God. There was the House of
God, there were the set Thrones of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63387:6"/>
So that to Love <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to Pray
for the Peace and Prosperity of it, is to love
the House, the Worship, the Name of God;
to love and pray for the Unity, Happiness,
and Prosperity of the Church, for the flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishing
State of Religion, and the peaceful
Opportunities of Worshipping God in his
Holy Temple, together with the equal and
impartial Administration of Justice, which is
so much for the Publick good, to promote
the Temporal and Eternal Happiness of Men,
that our Love to Mankind, but especially
our Love to the Brethren, as well as our
Zeal for God's Glory and Worship, requires
this of us, <hi>For my Brethren and Companions
sake, I will now say, Peace be within thee:
Because of the House of the LORD our GOD,
I will seek thy good,</hi> v. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you a very plain and
easie Exposition of this whole <hi>Psalm,</hi> and
therein have sufficiently Explained my Text;
I have but one thing more to add, to make
way for my intended Discourse, and that is,
to shew you, that this Exhortation does di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
and not meerly by Accommodation
and Analogie concern Us, as well as it did
the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63387:6"/>
For <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was but a Type of the
Christian Church, as the carnal <hi>Israel,</hi> or the
carnal Seed and Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> were
of true and sincere Christians, who are the
Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by Faith in Christ:
And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly distinguishes
between the earthly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
which descends from above, 4 <hi>Gal.
25, 26. For this Agar is Mount Sinai in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,
and answereth to Jerusalem, which now
is, and is in bondage with her Children; but
Jerusalem which is above,</hi> (or from above,
that is, the Christian Church) <hi>is free, which
is the Mother of us all.</hi> Which in 12 <hi>Heb.
22.</hi> he calls <hi>Mount Sion the city of the living
GOD, the heavenly Jerusalem.</hi> And 3 <hi>Rev.
12.</hi> it is called, <hi>The city of GOD, the new
Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven
from GOD.</hi> And 21 <hi>Rev. 2. The new Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
coming down out of heaven from GOD,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband:</hi>
Which is a Description of the most reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and purified state of the Christian Church
on Earth. So that this Exhortation, To <hi>Pray
for the Peace of Jerusalem,</hi> does most proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belong to Christians, because the Christian
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63387:7"/>
Church is the true <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the new, the
holy <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> descending out of Heaven
from GOD, <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>By this time, I suppose, you understand
the meaning of my Text, and how much we
are concerned in it; and there are two parts
observable in the words: 1. The Duty to
<hi>Pray for the Peace of Jerusalem;</hi> or of the
Christian Church, <hi>Peace be within thy Walls,
and Prosperity within thy Palaces.</hi> 2. The
Encouragement to this, <hi>They shall prosper that
love thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the first of these I shall at present
speak to, The Duty to <hi>Pray for the Peace
of Jerusalem;</hi> wherein I shall consider two
things.</p>
            <p>1. What we must Pray for.</p>
            <p>2. How necessary Prayer is, to obtain the
Blessing.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>What we must for:</hi> Peace <hi>and</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity.
Peace be within thy Walls, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
within thy Palaces.</p>
            <p>Now the Peace of the Church signifies
two things.</p>
            <p>1. The Unity and Agreement of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
among themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63387:7"/>
2. The Preservation of the Church from
external Oppressions and Persecutions.</p>
            <p>1. The Unity and Agreement of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
among themselves: When they profess
the same Faith, and joyn in the same Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
when they love like Brethren, and
have a tender affection and sympathy for
each other, as Members of the same Body:
This all Christians confess to be a great and
necessary Duty, and pretend to lament those
many scandalous Dissensions and Divisions
of the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>This I am sure, that though Divisions and
Dissentions are destructive to all Societies,
yet there is no Society suffers so much by it
as the Christian Church: this destroys Love
and Charity, which is the true Spirit of the
Gospel, and the Badge and Cognizance of
our Profession; <hi>By this shall all men know,
that ye are my Disciples, if ye love one another.</hi>
This turns the Christian Church into a School
of wrangling Disputes, and makes men more
concerned what they believe, than how they
live; this gives great offence to the World,
representing the Christian Faith as very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and uncertain, and Christianity it self as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63387:8"/>
a great Disturber of the Peace of Mankind;
this overthrows all Government and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
in the Church, and makes its Censures
despised and scorned, when the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
Sinners can shelter themselves in a
Schism, and palliate or expiate their other
Crimes by a factious Zeal; and therefore, if
ever we desire to see Christianity flourish, we
must Pray heartily for Peace and Unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians.</p>
            <p>But that we may the better understand
what we are to Pray for, let us briefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
wherein the Unity of the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists;
and that is, in the Unity of Faith, the
Unity of Communion, and the Unity of
Love and Charity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st,</hi> Unity of Faith: Whereby I do not
understand, that all Christians must agree in
all the Opinions and Speculations of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
it would be well if it could be so, but
this can never be, while men have such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Understandings and Abilities, such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Skill and Opportunities of inquiry; but
the Unity of Faith is secured by an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in all the Fundamental Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ion,
though a little varied in some nicer
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63387:8"/>
Speculations, which are like the different
features in mens faces, which distinguish
them from one another, but do not alter
the Humane shape: and this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the Disputes which divide
Papists and Protestants, and the Disputes of
Protestants among themselves: The first sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Foundations of Christian Faith and
Worship, and therefore these Differences
can never be Accommodated and Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
they will not part with their Errours,
and we must not embrace them, if we love
our Souls, for as dear a thing as Peace is, we
must not part with Truth for Peace. But
now the Disputes among all that are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be Protestants, whatever mistakes
there may be on any side, do not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
any necessary Article of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith; and therefore the Unity of the
Faith may be secured amidst all these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes.
Some of these Disputes are only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
Modes of speaking, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is only in Words, when both Parties
really mean the same thing; which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
if all Heat and Passion were laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
would in a great measure appear to be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63387:9"/>
the true State of that Protestant Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
about Justification by Faith alone.
Others are meer Philosophical Disputes, in
which the Christian Faith is not peculiarly
concerned, for they have been, and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed
in all Religions; such as the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
about God's Eternal Decrees, and the
Power and Efficacy of Nature and Grace;
which is only a reviving of that old Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Dispute about Necessity and Fate,
and God's concourse with second Causes to
produce their Effects. And thus it is in
some other Cases; now methinks such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes
as these, which do not properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Christian Faith, should not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Christian Church: let men dispute
about them as Philosophers, but as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
let it suffice them to believe what Christ
and his Apostles have plainly taught us;
that is enough to carry us to Heaven; and
methinks it should be enough to make us
agree in the Way thither.</p>
            <p>As to Explain this more particularly, but
very briefly: There is no good Protestant
but will confess, That we are Justified on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Merits of CHRIST's Death and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63387:9"/>
Sacrifice, as the only Expiation and Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for our sins: that no works of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
which we can do, can make satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to God for our sins, nor merit Eternal
Life, which is the gift of God: that Christ
is our only Saviour, and that he is the Saviour
only of his Body or Church: that we are
incorporated into the Body of Christ, and
put into a state of Justification by Faith and
the Christian Sacraments: that no impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
unreformed sinner, though he do profess
to believe in Christ, and be baptized, shall
be saved by Him; and therefore though
Repentance and a holy life do not merit the
pardon of sin, nor eternal Rewards, yet they
are necessarily required in all those, who
shall be forgiven and saved by Christ. This
I say, all good <hi>Protestants</hi> agree in, and all
this is plainly taught in Scripture; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
believes this, and practises accordingly,
shall certainly be saved: and what need is
there then of reducing all this into artificial
Schemes, wherein Mens Fancies and Conceits
differ? What necessity is there of disputing
what the Office of Faith, or what the Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Works is in our Justification, when
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63387:10"/>
we all agree, that we are saved only by the
Mercy of God, and the Merits of Christ
through Faith in his Bloud, and the Exercise
of Repentance and a holy Life: to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the reason and order of things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
much to the beauty and perfection of
Christian Knowledge; but Men may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and the Peace of the Church better se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
without such particular Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Thus all good <hi>Protestants</hi> agree, that all
God's Works are known to him from the
foundation of the World; that Christ is <hi>the
Lamb slain from the foundation of the world:</hi>
that <hi>God knows who are his,</hi> and always did
so: that <hi>we are predestinated to the adoption
of children by Jesus Christ to himself, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the good pleasure of his will, to the
praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath
made us accepted in the beloved: that we are
predestinated according to the purpose of him,
who worketh all things according to the counsel
of his own will,</hi> 1 Ephes. 5, 6, 11. that when
God comes to judge the World, he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
infinitely just, and good, and merciful:
that bad men shall have no reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63387:10"/>
of God, and that good men shall have
nothing to arrogate to themselves. This se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
the glory of God, of his wisdom, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
justice, power, and soveraignity, and
what need is there to inquire any farther
into the divine Decrees, than the Scripture
has revealed; in the particular explication
of which, when men follow their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
they vastly differ from each other, to
the great disturbance of the peace of the
Church. We are assured by plain testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Scripture, that God desires not the
death of a sinner, but rather that he should
return and live: that our destruction is of
our selves: that all the good we do, is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
owing to the grace of God, <hi>who worketh
in us both to will and to do of his own good
pleasure:</hi> that all the evil we do, is owing to
our selves; that <hi>every man is tempted, when
he is drawn away of his own lust and inticed,
then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth
forth sin; and sin, when it is finished, bringeth
forth death.</hi> This we all agree in, and this
attributes the glory of all the good we do to
God, and the shame of all the evil we do to
our selves; this encourages us to do good
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63387:11"/>
in a confident assurance of the Divine Grace,
and teaches bad men, that they must not
think to excuse their wickedness by charging
it on God: and this is all that is necessary
for us to know, because it is all that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the purposes of Religion, and a holy
life.</p>
            <p>But when men frame this into Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Hypotheses, they then divide as far from
each other, as East and West; and all the
attempts of reconciling them is vain and
fruitless, for there is no Medium to unite
in. The only way to Peace, is to silence all
these Disputes, as matters which Mankind
will never agree about, and wherein Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is no more concerned, than the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Kingdoms or States, and on which
the salvation of our Souls no more depends,
than the conduct of our secular affairs, or the
preservation of this mortal life: for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
about Decrees, Predestination, God's
power over our Wills, how God and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
produce the same effect, what belongs
to God, and what belongs to the Creature in
every action, <hi>(since in him we live and move)</hi>
concerns every thing else as well as Religion;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63387:11"/>
and yet in all other cases, men let Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
dispute these points, and quietly go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their business, and do what is fit to
be done, as if there were no Controversie
about these matters; and I cannot imagine
why they should not do so in Religion too:
Believe what is plainly taught, and do what
is commanded, use the greatest wisdom,
and our utmost diligence in doing good,
and depend upon the succours of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Grace, and leave these Disputes to be
decided at the Day of Judgment, and that
will decide them all. By this means I am
sure most of the Disputes among <hi>Protestants,</hi>
which have given the greatest Disturbance
to the Church, would be for ever silenced,
and Christian Religion would not be clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
nor reproached with such Philosophical
Controversies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> The Unity of Communion: and
that consists in our worshipping God toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
when we resort to the same Church to
offer up our united Prayers and Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
to God, and to partake of that holy
Supper, which is the Sacrament and Symbol
of our Union to Christ, and to each other:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63387:12"/>
and this indeed is true Church-Unity, and it
is greatly to be lamented, that men who
profess the same Faith, and agree in all the
Essentials of Worship, should divide Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and refuse to Pray together, and to
Feast at the same holy Table of our Lord.
We cannot indeed Communicate with the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> because they have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the very Essentials of Christian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Most men do not understand their
Prayers, and therefore cannot joyn in Prayer
with them: they worship Images and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
which is expresly forbidden by the
second Commandment. Instead of praying
to God in the Name of our only Mediator
and Advocate Jesus Christ, they have joyned
other Intercessors with him; pray to Saints
and Angels, and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to pray
for them, and help them. They worship
the Host, which we believe to be nothing
but Bread and Wine as to the substance, and
therefore no Object of Worship, and turn
the Sacramental Feast of Christ's Body and
Bloud into a propitiatory Sacrifice for the
Living and the Dead. Such a Worship as
this we dare not joyn in, because it is Sinful
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63387:12"/>
and Idolatrous. But the case is quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
among <hi>Protestants;</hi> they pray to the
same God, in the only Name of the same
Lord Jesus Christ, put up the same Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
offer the same Thanksgivings and
Praises, observe the same Divine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
without any essential change and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yet cannot worship God toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as if it were an impious thing to put
up the same Prayers, and to offer the same
Praises to God in a pious, and grave, and
well-composed Form of Words, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do, it may be not so well and decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in their conceived Prayers; as if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
of the Communicant in receiving so
inestimable a Blessing as the Sacramental
Body and Bloud of Christ upon his knees,
were a prophanation of that Holy Feast;
as if a white Linnen-Garment, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
underwent any Religious Conjurations,
and is used only as a decent Habit, without
any opinion of its Vertue or Sanctity, were
a just reason to drive men out of the
Church, from the Christian Communion of
Prayers and Sacraments. These would be
surprizing stories to any Christians in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63387:13"/>
World, who had never heard before of such
Disputes among us.</p>
            <p>Pray give me leave to speak my mind
freely upon this occasion. Upon the best
and most impartial Inquiries and Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I can make, I do in my Conscience
believe the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be the
most Apostolical and best Reformed Church
in the World: I see no reason from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things to make any material Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in her Doctrine, or Worship; and
therefore, I confess, it has given me very just
Resentments to hear our Church charged
with such unjust Imputations of Popery,
Superstition, Idolatry, Will-worship, and
what not, and to see a blind and furious
Zeal ready to raze up the very Foundations
of it. It has often grieved me to see such a
Church as this rent and torn by Schisms,
which a man of ordinary prudence might
easily foresee, would give great advantage
to the common Enemy of the <hi>Protestant</hi>
Faith. This and the care of mens Souls,
and of their temporal Fortunes too, moved
several Divines of this Church, when the
Government thought fit to re-enforce the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63387:13"/>
Laws of Uniformity, to examine and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
all the Arguments of our Dissenting
Brethren, which they performed with that
good Temper, with that perswasiveness and
strength of Argument, as will be a Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of our Church to future Ages; and
I wish it may upon second thoughts, have
yet a better effect upon those, who were
not then perswaded: and this, I suppose,
will not be called Persecution, much less
can the many kind Offices they did in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off Ecclesiastical Censures be called a
Persecution.</p>
            <p>And yet after all, when it is so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that Prejudices are grown as obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
as they are unreasonable, when not
the reason of the thing, but the weakness
of some, and the ill designs of others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
some compliance and condescension,
we have reason to hope, that the <hi>CHVRCH
of ENGLAND,</hi> which at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Reformation took such prudent
Care not to offend the Papist by going far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from them, than was necessary, will,
whenever it is likely to do good, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
a great deal farther, than it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63387:14"/>
to Reform, to meet the Dissenter;
for while the external Decencie, Gravity,
and Solemnity of Worship is secured, no
wise and good Man will think much to
change a changeable Ceremony, when it
will heal the Breaches and Divisions of the
Church: and let us all heartily Pray to
GOD, that there may be this good and
peaceable Disposition of Mind in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
and Non-conformists, towards a
happy Re-union; and all considering Men
will think it time to lay aside such little
Disputes, when it is not meerly the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> nor any particular <hi>Sect of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
whose Ruin is aimed at, but the
whole <hi>Protestant FAITH.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> Another kind of Unity is, Love and
Charity, and a mutual Forbearance. This,
I confess, is a very difficult thing, when the
Dispute runs so high as to divide Christian
Communion; for it seems in effect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
Men to be Heathens and Publicans,
when we refuse to Worship GOD with
them: and few Men can bear this, when so
dear an Interest is concerned, as the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Souls. And the truth is, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63387:14"/>
Forbearance St. <hi>Paul</hi> so often mentions, was
to preserve Men of different attainments,
and different apprehensions, in the Unity
of the Church, not to countenance their
Schisms and Separations.</p>
            <p>But yet, since we are fallen into such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Circumstances, that a great many
Men, whom we have reason to hope, are
in other respects very good Christians, and
such as our common Saviour will receive
with all their Infirmities, are involved in a
Schism, let us still treat them as Christian
Brethren, pay all that Kindness and Respect
to them, which is due to the Members of
Christ, to the Children of the same Father,
and the Heirs of the same Promises.</p>
            <p>The good Order and Government, and
the wholsom Laws and Constitutions of a
Church, trust not be presently Sacrificed to
the Scruples of every good, but it may be
ig<gap reason="illegible" extent="6 letters">
                  <desc>••••••</desc>
               </gap> and indiscreet Christian; but yet
in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Treatment of them, we must consider
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ether we have not reason to think,
that Christ will own them with all their
Fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and if we have reason to believe,
that Christ will own them, we ought also
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63387:15"/>
to own them, and pay such Kindness to
them as is due to all sincere Christians,
though under some Mistakes.</p>
            <p>Now I am very confident, after all the
Heats that have been between the <hi>Church
of England</hi> and Dissenters, neither of them
will Damn each other upon account of such
Differences as are between them: no <hi>Church-of-England-man</hi>
will say, That to Pray Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore,
to Baptize without the Sign of the
Cross, to Officiate without a Surplice, to
Receive the Sacrament Sitting, are damning
Sins; and I believe there are very few, if
any of our Dissenters, that will say, That
the contrary Practise is Damning; and then
there may be good Christians on both sides;
and those who are so, ought to love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
as Members of the same Body of
CHRIST, though divided in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Communion, by some unhappy Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
            <p>Schism indeed we do say, is a damning
Sin; but there may be Divisions where
there is not always the guilt and formality
of Schism; and we hope this is the Case
of all good Men, who separate from the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63387:15"/>
Church, through some invincible Prejudices
and Prepossessions.</p>
            <p>This shews what great reason we have to
love one another, notwithstanding such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
Disputes; but if we would practise
this true Christian Charity, we must take
care, that these Differences do not grow
up into personal Hatreds and Animosities.
Mens Opinions and Practices may differ, and
while they dispute fairly, they may be Friends
still; but when Self-love, Honour, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Interest, is engaged in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
this makes the Enmity mortal, and they
must Ruin one another, though they both
fall together. This I am sure is not the
Zeal which descends from above, which is
pure and peaceable, gentle and easie to be
entreated.</p>
            <p>2. The Peace of the Church signifies its
Preservation from the Oppression and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of its Enemies: For the Church
never wants Enemies, though their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
be not always equal; and this, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
I need not perswade you to Pray
for, for you are all sensible what an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63387:16"/>
this is. There is none of you
would choose Racks and Tortures, a Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
or a Stake, these are greivous things
to Flesh and Bloud, the very thoughts of
which make us tremble: though immortal
Life, and the Joys and Pleasures of GOD's
Presence, are an abundant Recompence for
the loss of this present Life, and all the
Sufferings of this World; yet it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
difficult Tryal, even to the best Men,
who, when they see it a coming, cannot
but Pray with the importunity of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony,
as our SAVIOUR did, <hi>Lord, let
this Cup pass from me.</hi> Though good Men
prefer their future Hopes before all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Things, yet their Life, their Ease,
their Liberties, their Estates, are valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things too, and all Men would be glad
to get to Heaven without meeting with
such a Storm by the way.</p>
            <p>Especially if it be such a Storm as threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
the very Ruin of the Church, and
of the true Religion, to subvert the Faith
of many professed Christians, to entail Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
Infidelity, or monstrous Errours
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63387:16"/>
on our Posterity; in such a case the love
of our Religion, of our Country, of our
Posterity will make us raise our Hearts and
our Voices to Heaven, in our fervent and
passionate Prayers <hi>for the Peace of Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
And if we do heartily <hi>Pray for the
Peace of Jerusalem,</hi> methinks we should not
Sacrifice our Religion to private Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities:
GOD forbid, were it in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and had I never so little kindness for
Dissenters, that I should ever embrace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Proposals which would Ruin all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
in <hi>England,</hi> and the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
into the bargain; and I doubt they
are no Protestant Dissenters who would
be contented to Ruin the <hi>CHVRCH of
ENGLAND,</hi> though they introduce
Popery, and set up the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> in
its stead.</p>
            <p>Thus I have shewn you, what that Peace
is, which we must Pray for; and I need
not add many words in the second place,
to shew you, how necessary Prayer is to
obtain these Blessings; for not to insist now
on those common Topicks, of the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63387:17"/>
of Prayer in general, and its Power
and Efficacy to obtain our Requests of
GOD, I shall desire you only to consider,
that this Peace is such a Blessing, as none but
GOD can bestow, and therefore we ought
to pray for it.</p>
            <p>1. As for Unity and Peace among our
selves, this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expresly prays for,
15 <hi>Rom. 5, 6. Now the God of patience and
consolation grant you to be like minded one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another, according to Christ Jesus, that
ye may with one mind and one mouth glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ:</hi> for it is God that maketh men to
be of a mind. Whoever considers the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
passions of men, their different capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
and understandings, and different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
will not wonder that the best Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and the most obliging Arts, do
not always prevail; but God can still our
passions, enlighten our minds, over-rule our
interests, remove our prejudices, and unite
and reconcile the most distant persons: and
not to take notice now of that power he
has over our Wills, and his immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63387:17"/>
to our Minds and Spirits, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times effects this by some external and
visible Providences. The Jail and the
Stake presently reconciled the Differences
between those two excellent Bishops and
Martyrs <hi>RIDLEY</hi> and <hi>HOOPER,</hi> who
before disputed fiercely about some Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
as we have done; and I pray God
grant us so much Christian prudence and
temper, that we may not need such means
to reconcile us: and we have great reason
to hope this, since the Divine Providence
has in a great measure already removed the
Prejudices on both sides, and convinc'd us,
that we are not at such a distance from
each other as our Enemies would have us,
and as it may be, we thought our selves to
be. Dissenters, I hope, are by this time
very well satisfied, that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
has no inclination to <hi>Popery,</hi> and we
have reason to acknowledge, that the Body
of Dissenters (for some private Intriguers
on either side do not deserve our notice,
nor to be thought on either side) have
not such an irreconcileable Hatred to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63387:18"/>
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as to sacrifice her to a
<hi>Popish</hi> Interest; and this bids fair for a
good Understanding between us, and
let us pray to God to continue and perfect
it.</p>
            <p>2. As for the Preservation of the Church
from the Oppression and Persecution of her
Enemies, this is God's care too, and many
times nothing but an All-seeing, Vigilant,
and Omnipotent Providence can secure her.
Many times their Designs are laid deep and
low, full of Intrigue and Artifice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to all men but themselves, as it
was in the Gunpowder Treason, when our
King, and Nobles, and Senators, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
as a rich Sacrifice to a furious and
Antichristian Zeal; but when <hi>the wicked
plotteth against the just, and gnasheth on him
with his teeth, the Lord shall laugh at him,
for he seeth, that his day is coming,</hi> 37 Psal.
12, 13.</p>
            <p>Let us then Pray heartily to God, that he
would reconcile our Differences and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
and restore Peace and Unity to his
Church, that he would defend us from all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63387:18"/>
the Plots and Machinations of our Enemies,
that we being delivered <hi>from all Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
may ever more give thanks unto him in
his Holy Church, through Jesus Christ our
Lord;</hi> to whom, with the Father and the
Holy Ghost, be Honour, Glory, and Power,
now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
