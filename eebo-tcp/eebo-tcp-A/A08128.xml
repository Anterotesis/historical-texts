            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>¶Heare how this miſery hath wrought,</l>
               <l>The taming of my fleſh ſo proud:</l>
               <l>My ſoule to God that hath it bought,</l>
               <l>I do commend with voyce ſo loud.</l>
               <l>Knowing that he doth heare my cry,</l>
               <l>And pardons me immediately,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶Would God the world dyd heare my voyce</l>
               <l>And would be warned by my death,</l>
               <l>Then would they not in euyll reioyce,</l>
               <l>But prayſe the Lord whyles they haue breath.</l>
               <l>And loue hym that hath loued them well,</l>
               <l>Who hath redeemed their ſoules from hell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶O God (quoth he) is thys thy kynde,</l>
               <l>To care for hym that knew not thee?</l>
               <l>I neuer had thee earſt in mynde,</l>
               <l>Yet now thy grace hath healed me.</l>
               <l>Due thankes to thee I cannot geue,</l>
               <l>That haſt now made me to beleue.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶O tell me I pray, what is your name,</l>
               <l>Sayth he to me vnknowen you are:</l>
               <l>To you lykewyſe I am the ſame,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶He prayed wyth vs moſt earneſtly,</l>

               <l>Wyth teares he kyſt vs louingly,</l>
               <l>And went with mourning there God wote.</l>
               <l>So doth the power of the Lord,</l>
               <l>Make diuers men in truth accord.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶Thus God hath found me out at length,</l>
               <l>And ſtayed me of my wicked race</l>

               <l>I would my death were much more vile</l>
               <l>That others might beware ther while.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶So then we prayed ech one for other</l>
               <l>Wyth trickling teares of ioye and greefe</l>
               <l>In truth I tooke him for my brother</l>
               <l>Though neuer ſo much he were a theefe.</l>
               <l>Then death to him could not come ill,</l>
               <l>For of Gods grace he had his fill.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶Then foorth we went and made a fyre,</l>
               <l>I dyned there wyth bread and cheeſe:</l>
               <l>To ſing ſome Pſalmes was his deſyre,</l>
               <l>So ech man ſoonge in their degrees.</l>
               <l>O Lord turne not away thy face,</l>
               <l>From hym that lyes proſtrate in place.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>¶But Watſon fell vnto hys foode</l>
               <l>As one that hungry was in deede</l>
               <l>And merely eate that he thought good,</l>
               <l>But threw the reſt the dogs to feede.</l>
               <l>I ſaw no thought that he did take,</l>
               <l>Nor lykelyhoode from ſinne to wake.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶Then vp came Maiſter Yong agayne</l>
               <l>Their deathes now being at the doore</l>
               <l>But Watſon could not yet refrayne,</l>
               <l>But laughes it out ſtill more and more.</l>
               <l>Still all in vayne to hym was ſayd,</l>

               <l>And preached, though ſmall to his regarde</l>
               <l>Yet all the reſt might vnderſtande,</l>
