            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur Name is not prefixed to this Treatiſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as accuſing you of the Sin herein detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or as praiſing you for thoſe Virtues, which good Men are more pleaſed to poſſeſs and exerciſe, than to have proclaimed, though they be as Light, that is
<pb facs="tcp:55434:4"/>
hardly hid. But it is to vent and exerciſe that Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude which loveth not the concealment of ſuch Friendſhip and Kindneſs, as you and your Lady E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently, and your Relatives and Hers, [the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Lord <hi>Paget</hi>] have long obliged me by: And it is to Poſterity that I record your Kindneſs, more than for this Age, to which it hath publickly notified it ſelf, during my publick Accuſations, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, Sentences, Impriſonments, and before and ſince: Who knoweth you that knoweth not hereof? And it is to renew the record of that Love and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which I owed to your deceaſed Father (former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pthough too ſlenderly recorded,) to be the Heir and Imitater of whoſe Faith, Piety, Charity, Patience, Humility, Meekneſs, Impartiality, Sincerity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, is as great an Honour and Bleſſing as I can wiſh you, next to the conformity to our higheſt pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern. And though he was averſe to worldly Pomp and Grandeur, and deſired that his Children ſhould not affect it, yet God that will honour thoſe that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, hath advanced his Children, I believe partly for his ſake: But I intreat you all (and ſome other of my Friends whom God hath raiſed as a Bleſſing to their Pious and Charitable Parents and themſelves) to watch carefully leſt the deceitful World and Fleſh, do turn ſuch Bleſſings into Golden
<pb facs="tcp:55434:4"/>
Fetters, and to be ſure to uſe them as they would find at laſt on their account.</p>
            <p>And as you are a Member of the preſent Houſe of Commons, I think the Subject of this Treatiſe is not unneceſſary to your conſideration and daily care: That when proof, and notorious, and ſad Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence telleth us what diſtractions have befaln Church and State, by Mens ſelf-conceited, erroneous ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſin and falſhood, as if it were <hi>Certainly Good and True,</hi> and how little Poſterity feareth and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this confounding Vice, though Hiſtory tell us that it hath been the Deluge that in all Ages hath drowned the peace and welfare of the World, you may be wary, and try before you venture, in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful caſes, eſpecially where the Sacred and Civil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of this and many other Lands, doth probably lye on the determination? Do you think all that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured upon the Actions and Changes, that have toſt up and down both Churches and Kingdoms, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, Perſecutions and Wars, had not done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſuſpend their Judgments, till they could have more certainly determined? <hi>Who</hi> ſhould proceed more cautelouſly than <hi>Biſhops?</hi> And <hi>where</hi> rather than in <hi>Councils?</hi> And in <hi>what</hi> rather than about <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Publick Government</hi> and <hi>Order?</hi> And had Biſhops and
<pb facs="tcp:55434:5"/>
Councils torn the Church, and Empires, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as they have done by aſpiring after Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by contentious Writings, and condemning each other, and by contradictory and erroneous, and perſecuting Canons, or by raiſing Wars and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Princes, ever ſince 400, or 500, or 600 years after Chriſt, if not ſooner, if they had known their ignorance, and ſuſpended in ſuch dangerous caſes till they were ſure?</p>
            <p>I know you are none of them who dare pretend to a <hi>Certain Knowledge,</hi> that all thoſe Oaths, Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Covenants, Practices impoſed by Laws and Canons on Miniſters and People in this Land, in the Act of Uniformity, the Corporation Act, the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Act, the Militia Act, the five Mile Act of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſo <hi>Good and Lawful,</hi> as will juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Execution of them, and the ſilencing, eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ruining, and judging to lye from ſix Months to ſix in the common Jails till they die, 2000 as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of Chriſt as any Nation hath under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, unleſs they forbear to Preach the Goſpel to which they are vowed, or venture their Souls on that which they fear to be ſins ſo great as they are loth to name: When Chriſt will ſentence them to Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhment, who did not viſit, feed, clothe him
<pb facs="tcp:55434:5"/>
in the leaſt of them, whom he calls his Brethren. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men <hi>ſilence conditionally the whole Miniſtry</hi> of ſuch a Kingdom, and <hi>actually</hi> 2000 <hi>ſuch,</hi> while the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dividing conſequents may be ſo eaſily foreſeen, and before men deliberately and reſolutely <hi>continue</hi> and <hi>keep up</hi> ſuch Battering Engines on pretence of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity and Obedience to Men, and before they venture to own this to that Lord who hath made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terms of Church Unity and Peace, it nearly concerneth them to think, and think on it a thouſand times: A <hi>ſuſpended judgment</hi> is here ſafer than <hi>prefidence</hi> and <hi>confident rage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And alſo they that deſire an Abolition of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, ſhould a thouſand times bethink them firſt what <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Primitive</hi> Epiſcopacy is, and whether the <hi>Epiſcopi Gregis,</hi> or <hi>eorum Praeſides,</hi> or true <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> or <hi>Apoſtolical General Biſhops, diſarmed</hi> and <hi>duely choſen,</hi> be any injury to the Church? And whether the Jews had not been a National Chriſtian Church under the Twelve Apoſtles and Seventy, if they had not rejected him that would have gathered them as the Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings.</p>
            <p>They that cannot deny that Chriſt ſetled a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Rank of Miniſters, appointing them beſides
<pb facs="tcp:55434:6"/>
their Extraordinaries, the work of Gathering and Over-ſeeing many Churches, promiſing therein to be with them to the end of the World, and that only <hi>Matthias</hi> muſt make up the National number of ſuch, though <hi>Juſtus</hi> had been with Chriſt as well as he, muſt be the Provers that this Rank and Imparity was reverſed by him that did Inſtitute it, if they affirm it: And not without proof charge Chriſt with ſeeming levity and mutability, as ſetling a Form of Miniſtry and Government, which he would have continue but one Age: Much leſs muſt they impoſe ſuch an unproved affirmation as the terms of Church Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
            <p>Woe, woe, woe! how effectually hath Satan al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt undone the Chriſtian World, by getting in naughty Miniſters and Magiſtrates, where he could not utterly Extirpate Chriſtianity by Arms? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by making Rulers and Preachers the Captains of the malignant Enemies of ſeriouſneſs in that Religion which they Profeſs and Preach themſelves: And if in ſuch Hypocriſie they Convert a Soul, they hate him as an Enemy for believing them: And thereby tempt Religious Men to miſtake the Crime of the naughty Preacher, as the fault of the Office, and to oppoſe the Office for the Perſons ſake; and
<pb facs="tcp:55434:6"/>
ſo Miniſtry and Chriſtianity is deſpiſed by too many.</p>
            <p>The ſhutting of their Church Doors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning to Scorn and Beggery, and Jails, thoſe that were as wiſe and faithful as themſelves (unleſs fearing heinous ſin made them worſe,) ſhould have been by the Perſecutors long and deeply thought on, twenty eight years ago<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ever ſince, by them that believe that Chriſt will judge them. And ſo ſhould all Doctrines and Practices that tend to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable ſeparations and diviſions by others. Things of this moment ſhould not be ventured on, nor Papiſts made both Lords and Executioners by our diſtracted Combates with each other, and the miſerable Nation and undone Church, left to no better a remedy than a <hi>non putaremus,</hi> and to hear the <hi>worldly Tyrants,</hi> and the <hi>tempted Sufferers</hi> accuſing each other, and diſputing when the Houſe is burnt <hi>who was in the fault.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think he was moſt faulty that could moſt eaſily have helped it, and would not: But if Great and Rich Men will be the ſtrength of the Factious, as they have <hi>moſt to loſe,</hi> they may be the <hi>greateſt loſers.</hi>

            <p>UPon the Review of this Book, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten long ago, I find, <hi>1.</hi> That it is a Subject as <hi>neceſſary</hi> now as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Experience telling us that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is ſo far from being Cured, that it is become our publick ſhame and danger, and if the wonderful Mercy of God prevent it not, is like to be the ſpeedy confuſion and ruine of the Land. <hi>2.</hi> As to the <hi>manner</hi> of this writing, I find the effects of the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Memory, in the oft repeating of the ſame things, with little diverſification: But I will not for that caſt it away, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
<pb facs="tcp:55434:8"/>
               <hi>1.</hi> That perhaps oft repeating may make the matter the better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered; and if it do the work intended, no matter though the Author be not applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>2.</hi> And men may think juſtly that what is oft repeated dropt not from the Author inconſiderately, nor is taken by him to be ſmall and uſeleſs; but is that digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truth which he would moſt inculcate. <hi>3.</hi> And thoſe who blame their weakneſs, who accuſe the Church Liturgy of too much repetition, I ſuppoſe will not be much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with it in our Writings, while the dulneſs and forgetfulneſs of many Readers maketh it needful.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE Calamitous Diviſions of the Churches of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Had I been ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have written this Book, to hide my ſloth and ignorance, men would not have neglected my <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Theologie</hi> and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Theology thro' meer ſloth, and ſaying, That it's too high and hard for them.</note> and the Miſcarriages and Contentions of too many particular Brethren, having been ſad upon my thoughts above forty years, by this time without impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of haſtineſs and raſh judging, I may take leave to tell the World, what I have diſcovered to be the principal cauſe, which is <hi>falſly</hi> PRETENDED KNOWLEDGE, or IGNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANCE OF IGNORANCE, or <hi>a proud unhumbled under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, confident that it knoweth that which it knoweth not.</hi> And conſequently what muſt be the cure (if our calamity be here cureable,) <hi>viz. To know as much as we can; but withal to know how little we know, and to take on us to know no more than we do know, nor to be certain of our uncertainties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Text which I have choſen to be the ground of my diſcourſe, is ſo plain, notwithſtanding ſome little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that did not the nature of the Diſeaſe reſiſt the cleareſt Remedy, ſo many good people had never here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten read their ſin deſcribed, as inſenſibly as if they read it not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55434:11"/>The Chapter hath ſo much difficulty, as will not ſtand with my intended brevity to open it: I refer you to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors for that, whether they were the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> or any other ſort of Hereticks that the Apoſtle dealeth with, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine not. It is plain that they were Licentious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity, who thought that it was the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of others that made them judge it unlawful to eat things offered to Idols; and that their own greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſet them above that ſcruple. A mixture of Platonick Philoſophy with Chriſtianity, made up moſt of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Hereticks, (and for want of a due digeſtion of each, too much corrupted many of the Greek Doctors of the Church.) The unlearned ſort of Chriſtians, were ſo much deſpiſed by ſome of the Philoſophical Hereticks, that they were not thought worthy of their Communion; for as <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, they <hi>ſeparated themſelves, being ſenſual, having not the Spirit,</hi> but more affected Philoſophical fancies: which made <hi>Paul</hi> warn men to take heed leſt any ſeduced them by vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; not uſing the name of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> for that ſolid knowledge of Gods works which is deſireable, but for the Syſtemes of vain Conceits and Precepts, which the Word was then uſed to ſignifie, as every Sect derived them from their Maſters. And ſo the Apoſtle taketh <hi>knowledge</hi> in this Text; not for <hi>ſolid knowledge</hi> indeed, but for Gnoſticiſm or Philoſophical preſumptions; ſuch as even yet moſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers are guilty of, who take a multitude of Precepts, ſome uſeful, ſome uſeleſs, ſome true, and ſome falſe, and all but notionally or to little purpoſe, and joining theſe do call them Philoſophy. And <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, that <hi>opinionative</hi> and <hi>notional knowledge</hi> (were it true, like the Devils Faith) is of no ſuch excellency as to cauſe them to ſhelter their ſins under the confidence and honour of it, and deſpiſe unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſcionable Chriſtians; for ſuch knowledge by inflation oft deſtroyeth the Poſſeſſors, or becomes the Fuel of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh ſin of Pride, when Love buildeth up our ſelves and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55434:11"/>
others to Salvation. And to conceit that a man is wiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſuch knowledge, and ſo to over-value his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, is a certain ſign that he is deſtitute of that knowledge in which true wiſdom doth conſiſt; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing with a wiſe and ſaving knowledge, as every thing ſhould be known: And indeed a mans excellency is ſo far from lying in vain Philoſophical Speculations, that the uſe of all true knowledge is but to bring us up to the Love of God, (as the higheſt felicity) to be approved and beloved by God: And thoſe unlearned Chriſtians that have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sanctification, without your vain Philoſophy, have knowledge enough to bring them to this Love of God, which is a thing that paſſeth all your knowledge, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be known of God as his own, and loved by him: For our felicity lyeth in <hi>receiving from God,</hi> and in <hi>his lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us</hi> more than in <hi>our loving him</hi>; but both ſet together, to <hi>love God,</hi> and ſo to be <hi>loved of him</hi> are the ultimate end and perfection of man; and all knowledge is to be eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but as it tendeth to this.</p>
               <p>This being the plain Paraphraſe of the Text, I ſhall ſtay no longer on it, but thence deduce and handle theſe two Obſervations.</p>
               <p>Doct. I. <hi>Falſly pretended knowledge is oft pernicious to the Poſſeſſor, and injurious to the Church. And, over-valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones own Opinions and Notions, is a certain mark of dangerous Ignorance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>A Man is ſo far truly wiſe, as he loveth God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is approved (or loved) by him, and as he loveth others to their Edification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt is but the ſame that <hi>Solomon</hi> thus expreſſeth, Prov. 26.12. <hi>Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Be not wiſe in your own conceits:</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.5, 16.

So Chap. 2.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>And my ſpeech and my preaching was not with enticing words</hi> (or <hi>probable diſcourſes) of mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God: Howbeit we ſpeak wiſdom among them that are perfect; yet not the wiſdom of this World, nor of the Princes of this World that come to nought: But we ſpeak that wiſdom of God in a Myſtery, even the hidden wiſdom which God ordained before the World unto our glory (even Chriſt the wiſdom of God,</hi> chap. 1.24.) <hi>which none of the Princes of this World knew—.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all this note, 1. That there is a wiſdom which <hi>Paul</hi> placeth Chriſtianity it ſelf in: 2. That this is to <hi>know God in Chriſt objectively,</hi> and to <hi>be taught of God by Chriſt and his Spirit efficiently.</hi> 3. That there is a Wiſdom which <hi>Paul</hi> comparatively vilifieth. 4. This is called the <hi>Wiſdom of this world</hi> (or <hi>age.</hi>) 5. That moſt plainly he meaneth by it, that which then was called <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi>; which the Greeks did value, and by which they judged of the Goſpel; which comprehended the methods of all the Sects, Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans, Academicks, Peripateticks and Stoicks; but not their true Morals, but their Phyſicks, and Logick, and Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55434:12"/>
which <hi>Laertius</hi> and others tell us how variouſly they held. 6. That <hi>Paul</hi> doth not abſolutely prohibit ſuch ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, nor yet deſpiſe any true knowledge. 7. But he vilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Philoſophy on theſe accounts. 1. Becauſe it was the exerciſe of a poor, low, inſufficient Light: They did but <hi>Grope</hi> after God in the dark, as <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27. 2. Becauſe it was moſtly taken up with inferiour things, of ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment comparatively: As things corporeal are good in <hi>themſelves,</hi> and when <hi>ſanctified</hi> and made ſubſervient to things ſpiritual; ſo the knowledge of Phyſicks is to be eſteemed: But as things corporeal yet are objectively the ſnare and ruine of thoſe that periſh, and therefore the world to be renounced and crucified, as it is our temptation, an Enemy, or Competitor with Chriſt; juſt ſo it muſt be with Natural Philoſophy. 3. Becauſe it was greatly overvalued by the <hi>World,</hi> as if it had been the <hi>only Wiſdom,</hi> when indeed, it is of it ſelf but an indifferent thing, or fit but to make a by-recreation of, till it be made to ſerve to higher ends; even as Riches, Honour and Pleaſure are overvalued by worldlings, as if they were the only felicity; when in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are but more indifferent things, and prove <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial</hi> or <hi>hurtful</hi> as they are uſed. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> was to take down the pernicious eſteem of this kind of Philoſophy, as Preachers now muſt take down mens eſteem of worldly things, however they are the works and gifts of God. And as Chriſt would by his actual poverty and ſufferings, and not by words only, take down the eſteem of worldly wealth and pride; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> by <hi>neglecting</hi> and <hi>forbearing</hi> the uſe of Artificial Logick, <hi>Phyſicks</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> would depreſs their rate. 4. Becauſe that there was abundance of falſhood mixt with the truth which the Philoſophers held; as their multitude of different Sects fully proves. 5. Becauſe the Artificial, Organical part was made ſo operous, as that it drowned Real Learning inſtead of promoting it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came but like a game at Cheſs, a deviſe rather to exerciſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55434:13"/>
vain proud wits by, than to find out uſeful truth. As to this day when Logick and Metaphyſicks ſeem much cultivated and reformed, yet the variety of methods, the number of notions, the precariouſneſs of much, the uncertainty of ſome things, the falſhood of many, maketh them as fit for Boys to play with in the Schools, and to be a <hi>Wood</hi> into which a Sophiſter may run, to hide his Errours, as to be a means of detecting them. And therefore a knaviſh Cheater will oft bind you ſtricteſt to the pedantick part of the Rules of Diſputation, that when he cannot defend his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he may quarrel with your Form and Artifice, and loſe time by queſtioning you about Mood and Figure. 6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by theſe operous diverſions, the minds of men were ſo foreſtalled or taken up, as that they had not leiſure to ſtudy great and neceſſary ſaving truth: And if men muſt be untaught in the Doctrines of Life, till they had firſt Learnt their Logick, Phyſicks and Metaphyſicks, how few would have been ſaved? when at this day ſo many come from our Univerſities after ſeveral years ſtudy, raw ſmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers in theſe, and half-witted Scholars, whoſe Learning is fitter to trouble than to edifie: And if Scripture had been written in the terms and method of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> how few would have been the better for them? But great Good muſt be common.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Paul</hi> on all theſe accounts ſets light by this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, ſo he calls it, <hi>the wiſdom of this</hi> world. 1. Becauſe this world was its chief object. 2. And the creatures were its only Light. 3. And it led but few to any higher than worldly ends. 4. And it was that which worldly men that were ſtrangers to heavenly <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> did then moſt magnify and uſe.</p>
               <p>Yet as Chriſt when he ſaid, how hard it was for a rich man to be ſaved, did not make Riches abſolutely unlawful, nor to have no goodneſs nor uſefulneſs at all, but teacheth men, if they are wiſe, not to overvalue them, and to be too
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55434:13"/>
eager for them; ſo is <hi>Paul</hi> to be interpreted about Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or the wiſdom of this world. (For it is not only crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for worldly ends that he ſo calls.)</p>
               <p>And as God when he denyeth his Servants <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>worldly fulneſs,</hi> doth it not becauſe he taketh it to be <hi>too good</hi> for them, but becauſe it is not <hi>good enough,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will give them better; even the Heavenly Riches, and Honour and Delights: Even ſo when <hi>Paul</hi> compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively vilifieth Philoſophy, it is not as being really a wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>too high</hi> for Chriſtians, but <hi>too</hi> low; Nor doth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or extol <hi>Ignorance</hi>; but would lead men to the trueſt Learning, the higheſt Knowledge and Improvement of Reaſon, the only Wiſdom, from trifling, Pedantick, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Notions, and Ludicrous loſs of Time and Studies.</p>
               <p>It is not therefore for want of <hi>wiſdom</hi> that the Scripture is not written according to the Philoſophers art. Though <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus</hi> overvalued his <hi>Grammaticiſms,</hi> it was not for want of Learning in Philoſophy that he ſo much deſpiſed the Philoſophical Schoolmen! (ſo that Speaking of the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who maligned Dr. <hi>Colet,</hi> and was a ſubtile Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt he ſaith of <hi>ſuch</hi>; [That <hi>he had known ſome of them whom he would not call Knaves, but he never knew one of them whom he could call a Chriſtian.</hi>] <hi>Vid.</hi> Mr <hi>Smiths</hi> Life of Dr. <hi>Colet</hi> By <hi>Eraſmus.</hi> A ſmart charge: I ſuppoſe he meant it of them, rather as Scotiſts, than as Biſhops.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Apoſtle aptly joyneth both together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called</hi>; Seeming to equal <hi>worldly Wealth</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> with <hi>worldly wiſdom</hi> or <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as to the intereſt of Religion and Salvation. And the fooliſh wits that think he ſpake againſt Learning becauſe he had it not, may as truly ſay that he ſpake againſt worldly <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>greatneſs</hi> becauſe he had it not: For the <hi>Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Uſe</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> of worldly things, are near of Kin. But they knew not <hi>Paul</hi> ſo well as <hi>Feſtus,</hi> who thought him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55434:14"/>
not unlearned, though he thought him mad. Nor was it the way of <hi>worldly wealth</hi> and <hi>greatneſs</hi> which he choſe.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs neither Chriſt, nor <hi>Paul,</hi> did ſpeak againſt any <hi>Real Knowledge,</hi> but 1. Againſt nominal, pretended Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which was ſet up to divert men from Real Knowledge, and was full of Vanities and Falſhoods. 2. And againſt the overvaluing of that Learning, which is of little uſe, in compariſon of the Knowledge of Great, and Excellent, and Neceſſary things. For knowledge is valuable according to its <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>its uſe.</hi> The Knowledge of <hi>trifles</hi> for trivial ends, is it ſelf a trifle. The Knowledge of things <hi>great</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> for <hi>great</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> ends, is the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Knowledge. And therefore how unmeaſureably muſt the knowledge of God and our eternal happineſs, <hi>excel</hi> the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick Philoſophy of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> However Chriſtians may Sanctify and Ennoble this by making it a help to higher knowledge. And therefore the Platoniſts and the Stoicks were the nobleſt Philoſophers; becauſe the former ſtudied the higheſt things, and the other the neceſſary <hi>means</hi> of felicity, amending of mens hearts and lives.</p>
               <p>But in the preſent Text the thing which the Apoſtle repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth is, the eſteeming of a <hi>mans ſelf</hi> to be <hi>wiſer than he</hi> is; and taking himſelf to be a <hi>wiſe man</hi> becauſe of his trifling Philoſophical knowledge.<note place="margin">A Country-man having ſent his Son to the Univerſity, when he came home askt him what he had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He told him he had learnt Logick. He askt him what that Logick was, and what he could do with it: And it being Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-time, and the poor people having but two Eggs for Supper, he told them that he could prove that thoſe Eggs were three: <hi>This is one,</hi> ſaith <hi>he,</hi> and that <hi>is Two,</hi> and <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Two</hi> are <hi>three:</hi> The Father gave him the better, and told him that his art was uſeful; for he had thought himſelf to have gone without his Supper, but now, ſaith he, I will take <hi>one Egg,</hi> and your Mother the other, and take you the third. Such kind of Logick the World hath gloried in as learning.</note> And he would have them know that till they knew nobler things than thoſe, &amp; were guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a nobler light, they were very fools.</p>
               <p>I have lookt over <hi>Hutten, Vives, Eraſmus, Scaliger, Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Caſaubone,</hi> and many other <hi>Critical Grammarians,</hi> and

I have waſted much of my time among whole loads of Hiſtorians, <hi>Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers</hi> and <hi>Antiquaries</hi>: I deſpiſe none of their learning. All truth is uſeful; Mathematicks, which I have leaſt of, I find a pretty manlike ſport. But if I had no other kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than theſe, what were my underſtanding worth! what a dreaming dotard ſhould I be?

               <p>I have higher thoughts of the School-men, than <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and our other <hi>Grammarians</hi> had: I much value the method and ſobriety of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> the ſubtility of <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Ockam</hi> the plainneſs of <hi>Durandus,</hi> the ſolidity of <hi>Ariminenſis,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity of <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> the excellent acuteneſs of many of their followers, of <hi>Aureolus, Capreolus, Bannes, Alvarez, Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, &amp;c.</hi> Of <hi>Mayro, Lychetus, Trombeta, Faber, Meuriſſe, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, &amp;c.</hi> Of <hi>Ruiz, Pennattus, Suarez, Vaſquez,</hi> &amp;c.

The jingling of too much and too falſe Philoſophy among them oft drowns the noiſe of <hi>Aarons</hi> Bells. I feel my ſelf much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Herberts</hi> Temple: Or in a heavenly Treatiſe of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> And though I do not with Dr. <hi>Colet</hi> diſtaſt <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> above the plainer Fathers, yet I am more taken with his Confeſſions, than with his Grammatical and Scholaſtick treatiſes.

               <p>In a word, There is a Divine knowledge, which is part of mans felicity, as it promoteth Love and Union, and there

is a ſolid Knowledge of Gods <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> a valuable Grammatical knowledge, and a true Philoſophy, which none but ignorant perſons will deſpiſe.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Not any <hi>real uſeful knowledg</hi> at all, whilſt every thing keepeth its proper place, and due eſteem, (as is ſaid.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which of it ſelf primarily is of ſo ſmall uſe, as that it falleth under the contempt of the Apoſtles, yet by <hi>accident,</hi> through the ſubtilty of Satan, and the viciouſneſs of the World, may become to ſome men in ſome meaſure neceſſary. And here cometh in the calamity of Divines. Of how little uſe is it to me in it ſelf to know what is written in many a hundred Books, which yet by accident, it much
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55434:15"/>
concerneth me to know? And if God reſtrain him not, the Devil hath us here at ſo great an advantage, that he can make our work almoſt endleſs, and hath almoſt done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; yea can at any time divert us from greateſt <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> by making another at that time more neceſſary.</p>
               <p>If he raiſe up Socinians, our task is increaſed; we muſt read their Books, that we may be able to confute them: ſo muſt we when he raiſeth up Libertines, Familiſts, Seekers, Quakers, and ſuch other Sects. If he ſtir up controverſies in the Church, about Government, Worſhip, Ceremonies, Circumſtances, Words, Methods, &amp;c we muſt read ſo much as to underſtand all, that we may defend the truth againſt them. If Papiſts will lay the ſtreſs of all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies on Church Hiſtory, and the words of Ancients, we muſt read and underſtand all, or they will triumph. If School-men will build their Theology on <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> all men have not the wit with the <hi>Iberian</hi> Legate at the Florentine Council in <hi>Sagyrophilus,</hi> to cry againſt the <hi>Preacher, What have we to do with Ariſtotle?</hi> But if we cannot deal with them at their own weapons, they will triumph. If Cavillers will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute only in mood and figure, we muſt be able there to over-top them, or they will inſult. If the Plica, Pox, Scurvey or other new diſeaſes do ariſe, the Phyſician muſt know them all, if he will cure them. And hence it is that we ſay, that a Lawyer muſt know the Law, and a Phyſician muſt know Phyſicks and Medicine, &amp;c. But a Divine ſhould know all things that are to be known: becauſe the diſeaſed world hath turned pretended knowledg into the great malady, which muſt be cured: but is the thing it ſelf of any great worth? Is it any great honour to know the vanity of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Pedantry? And to be able to overdo ſuch gameſters, any more than to beat one at a game at Cheſs, or for a Phyſician to know the Pox or Leproſie?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet indeed, as all things are ſanctified to the holy, and pure to the pure, a wiſe man may and muſt make great uſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55434:16"/>
of common inferiour kinds of knowledge: eſpecially the true Grammatical ſenſe of Scripture words, the true pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Logick, the certain parts of real Phyſicks and Pneumatology: For God is ſeen in his Works as in a Glaſs; and there to ſearch after him and behold him, is a noble pleaſant Work and Knowledg. And I would that no <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite</hi> may have need to go down to the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of this ſort.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not forbidden to any man to know that meaſure of wiſdom which he truly hath; God bindeth us not to err, nor to call Light Darkneſs, or Truth Error, or to belie our ſelves, or deny his gifts. 1. It is deſireable for a man abſolutely to know as <hi>much as he can,</hi> preferring ſtill the greateſt things, and to know that he knoweth them, and not to be ſceptical, and doubt of all. 2. It is a duty for a converted ſinner comparatively to know that he is <hi>wiſer</hi> than he was in his ſinful ſtate, and to give God thanks for it. 3. It is his duty who <hi>groweth</hi> in <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and receiveth <hi>new acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> to know that he ſo groweth, and to give God thanks, and to welcome each uſeful truth with joy. 4. It is the duty of a good and wiſe man comparatively to know that he is not as fooliſh as the ungodly, nor to think that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked man, or ignorant perſon whom he ſhould pity and inſtruct is already wiſer than he; every Teacher is not to be ſo fooliſh as to think that all his flock are more judicious than himſelf.

               <p n="1">I. Natural Imperfection layeth the Foundation of our common calamity; in that it is ſo long before ſenſe and reaſon grow up to a natural maturity, (through the unripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Organs,</hi> and want of <hi>Exerciſe</hi>) that Children are neceſſitated to learn words before <hi>things,</hi> and to make theſe <hi>words</hi> the means of their firſt knowledge of many of the <hi>things ſignified</hi>; ſo that moſt furniſh themſelves with a ſtock of names and <hi>words</hi>; before ever they get any true knowledge of the matter.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And then they are exceeding apt to think that this treaſury of <hi>words</hi> and ſecond notions is true wiſdom, and to miſtake it for the knowledge of the thing: Even as in Religion we find almoſt all Children and ignorant people, will learn to ſay by rote the Creed and Lords Prayer, and Commandments, and Catechiſm, and then think that they are not Ignorants, when it is long after before we can get them to underſtand the ſenſe of the words which they can ſo readily ſpeak, yea though they are plain Engliſh
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55434:18"/>
words, which they uſe for the moſt part in ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. When Children come to School alſo their Maſters teach them as their Parents did, or worſe; I mean that they beſtow almoſt all their pains to furniſh them with words and ſecond notions: And ſo do their Tutors too oft at the Univerſity: So that by that time they are grown to be Maſters of a conſiderable ſtock of <hi>words,</hi> Grammatical, Logical, Metaphyſical, &amp;c. and can ſet theſe together in Propoſitions and Syllogiſms, and have learnt <hi>Memoriter</hi> the Theorems or Axioms, and ſome diſtinctions which are in common uſe and reputation, they are ready to paſs for Maſters of the Arts, and to ſet up for themſelves, and leave their Tutors, and to teach others the like ſort and meaſure of Learning, which they have thus acquired. Like one that ſets up his Trade as ſoon as he hath gotten a Shop full of Tools.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And indeed the memories of young men are ſtrong and ſerviceable ſo many years ſooner than their judgments, that prudent Teachers think it meet to take that time to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with words and organical notions, while they are unmeet to judge of <hi>things</hi>: Even as pious Parents muſt teach them the words of the Catechiſm, that when they grow riper, their judgments may work upon that which their <hi>Memories</hi> did before receive. And in this they are in the right upon two ſuppoſitions. 1. That diſtinguiſhing <hi>things obvious</hi> and eaſily underſtood from things remote, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe and difficult, they would teach them thoſe of the firſt ſort with the words, though not the ſecond: And while they make haſte with them in the Languages they would not make too much haſte with the Notions and Theorems of the Arts and Sciences. 2. That they ſtill make them know that <hi>words</hi> as to <hi>matter</hi> are but as the <hi>diſh</hi> to the <hi>meat,</hi> and all this while they are but <hi>preparing</hi> for wiſdom and true Learning, and not getting or poſſeſſing it; and that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55434:18"/>
unleſs they will equalize a Parrot, and a Philoſopher, they muſt know how little they have attained, and muſt after Learn <hi>things,</hi> or not pretend to know any thing indeed. As Children learn firſt to ſpeak and then learn what to ſpeak of.</p>
               <p n="5">V. And the great miſchief is, that multitudes of thoſe notions which are taught us are <hi>falſe,</hi> not <hi>fitted</hi> to the <hi>Things,</hi> but expreſſing the conceptions of roving, uncertain, errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, bewildred minds. Words are the inſtruments of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of thoughts. And when I hear a man ſpeak I hear (perhaps) what he <hi>thinketh</hi> of things, but not always what they are. Our <hi>Univerſal notions</hi> are the reſult of our own comparing <hi>Things</hi> with <hi>things.</hi> And we are ſo wofully defective in ſuch <hi>comparings</hi> that our <hi>Univerſal notions</hi> muſt needs be very defective, ſo that they abound with errour.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. And the <hi>penury</hi> and <hi>narrowneſs</hi> of <hi>words</hi> is a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to the due expreſſing of thoſe poor confuſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions which we have; For a man can <hi>think</hi> more aptly and comprehenſively than he can ſpeak. And hence it cometh to paſs that <hi>words</hi> and <hi>univerſal notions</hi> are become like Pictures or Hieroglyphicks, almoſt of arbitrary ſignification and uſe, as the ſpeaker pleaſeth. And (as a multitude of School-diſtinctions tell us) you can know little by the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical uſe or Etymology of the words, what the meaning of them is in a theorem or diſtinction, till the ſpeaker tell it you by other words.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. And the conceptions of men being as various as their Countenances, the ſame words in the mouths of ſeveral men, have ſeveral ſignifications. So that when Tutors read the ſame books to their Schollars, and teach them the ſame notions, it is not the ſame conceptions always that they thus communicate.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. And when all is done, <hi>Recipitur ad modum recipientis.</hi> It's two to one but the Learner receiveth their notions with a conception ſomewhat different from them all. And when
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55434:19"/>
he thinks that he hath learnt what was taught him, and is of his <hi>Teachers</hi> mind, he is miſtaken, and hath received ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apprehenſion.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. And the narrowneſs of mans mind and thoughts is ſuch, that uſually there muſt go many partial conceptions, to <hi>one thing</hi> or <hi>Object</hi> really indiviſible: So that few things, or nothing rather in the world, is known by us with one conception, nor with a ſimplicity of apprehenſions anſwerable to the ſimplicity of the things: And hereby it cometh to paſs that <hi>Inadequate conceptions</hi> make up a great part of our <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and knowledge. And (yet worſe) our <hi>words</hi> being nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower than our Thoughts, we are fain to multiply words more than conceptions, ſo that we muſt have ten concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons perhaps of <hi>one thing,</hi> and <hi>twenty words</hi> perhaps for thoſe ten conceptions. And then we grow to imagine the <hi>things</hi> to be as various as our <hi>conceptions,</hi> yea and our <hi>words</hi>: And ſo Learning is become confuſed error, and the great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Actions of the Phantaſtical world, are a pitiful confuſed agitation of Phantaſms, and (whether fortuitous or artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) a congreſs of Atoms, ſometimes digladiating, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeeming by amicable embraces to compoſe ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent piece of Art. And <hi>things</hi> ſeem to us to be <hi>multiplyed</hi> and <hi>ordered</hi> as our conceptions of them are. And the Scotiſts may yet write as many more Treatiſes <hi>de formalitatibus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men will underſtand indeed what a <hi>conceptus formalis</hi> with them is, and whether diverſe <hi>formalities</hi> be diverſe <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> or only <hi>ejuſdem conceptus inadequati.</hi> But thus Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is become like a poppet play, or the raiſing of the duſt.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The <hi>Entia Rationis</hi> being thus exceeding numerous, are already confounded with objective Realities, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded our common Syſtems of Logick, Metaphyſicks, and too much of Phyſicks: So that Students muſt at firſt ſee through falſe Spectacles, and Learn by ſeducing notions, and receive abundance of falſe conceptions, as the way to Wiſdom, and Shadows and Rubbiſh, muſt furniſh their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55434:19"/>
minds under the name of truth (though mixt with many real Verities.) For young men muſt have Teachers: They cannot begin at the foundation, and every one learn of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as if none had ever learnt before him: He is like to make but a ſlow proficient, that maketh no uſe of the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Experience of any that ever learnt before him. And he that will learn of others, muſt receive their notions and words as the means of his information.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. And when they grow up to be capable of real wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, O! what a labour is it, to cleanſe out this rubbiſh, and to unlearn all the errors that we have learnt, ſo that it is much of the happieſt Progreſs of extraordinary ſucceſsful Studies, to find out our old miſtakes, and ſet our concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in better order one by one: Perhaps in one year we find out and reform ſome two or three, and in another year one or two more, and ſo on. Even as when at my removal of my Library, my Servant ſets up all my books, and I muſt take them half down again to ſet them in their right places.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. And the <hi>difficulty</hi> of the matter is our great <hi>Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> when we come to ſtudy things. For, 1. Their Matter, 2. Their Compoſure, 3. Their Numbers, 4. Their Order and Relations, 5. And their Action and Operation, are much unknown to us.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. 1. The ſubſtance of <hi>Spirits</hi> is ſo little known, as tempteth Sadduces to dream that there are none. The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Spirit to ſome (through ignorance) is taken to be meerly negative, as if it ſignified no more, but <hi>[not corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real.]</hi> The notion of <hi>Immateriality</hi> is lubricous, and he that knoweth not the true bounds of the ſignification of <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> knoweth not what it is to be Immaterial. The pureſt Spirit is known only by many inadequate conceptions: One muſt anſwer the ſimilitude of Matter, in fundamental ſubſtantiality: Another muſt be anſwerable to that of <hi>Forms</hi> of ſimple Elements; and another anſwerable to Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55434:20"/>
And though nothing be ſo notorious of Spirits as their <hi>Operations,</hi> and from the <hi>Acts</hi> we know the <hi>Virtues</hi> or <hi>Powers,</hi> yet that theſe <hi>Virtues</hi> are not <hi>Accidents,</hi> but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Eſſential Form,</hi> and that they are (in all Spirits) One in Three, and many other things concerning their Eſſentiality, are quite overlookt by the greater part of Philoſophers; and thoſe few that open it, do either with <hi>Campanella,</hi> loſe it again in a wood of miſtaken ill gathered conſequences; or with <hi>Lullius,</hi> drown it in a multitude of irregular arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary notions; or with <hi>Commenius,</hi> give us a little undigeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the mixture of crudities and miſtakes; or with our Learned Dr. <hi>Gliſſon de vitâ Naturae,</hi> confound Spirits and Bodies, and make thoſe Spirits which are the Vital conſtitutive principle of Compounds, to be but the inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate conception of <hi>Bodies,</hi> as if they were all ſimply and formally Vital of themſelves, and for a <hi>Body</hi> to be inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate were a contradiction, or impoſſible. And they that treat more nobly of <hi>Spirits</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Got</hi> and many Platoniſts) do it ſo immethodically and confuſedly, as greatly diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageth the Learner.</p>
               <p>And yet to treat of <hi>Bodies</hi> without treating of the <hi>Spirits</hi> that <hi>animate</hi> or <hi>actuate</hi> them, is a lame, deluding, unedifying thing: As it is to treat of a Kingdom, an Army, a School, without mentioning a King, a Captain, or a Schoolmaſter; or as to deſcribe a Gun, without any mention of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or ſhooting: Or a Clock or Watch without the Poiſe or Spring, or Motion; or a Book or words without the ſenſe; and ſo of a Man without a Soul or Reaſon, or a Brute without any Life or Senſe. I mean when we ſpeak of Compound Beings, and not meerly of <hi>Corporeity</hi> in the notion, as abſtracted from all Vital moving principles.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. 2. And what the true notion of <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reity</hi> it ſelf is, it is but darkly and uncertainly known, how confidently ſoever ſome decantate their <hi>moles</hi> or quantity, <hi>diviſibility</hi> or diſcerptibility, and impenetrability: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p n="15">XV. 3. Nor do we well know the <hi>Nature</hi> of the ſimple Corporeal Elements; whether they agree only in materiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, quantity, and diviſibility, and impenetrability; and whether they differ only in magnitude, ſhape, ſight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of parts; or by any eſſentiating Formal Virtues; or both; or (as Mr. <hi>Got</hi> thought) by a differencing proper ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. 4. How little of the Divine Artifice is known in the compoſition of mixt Bodies? (And we know of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent Simples in the world, that are not found only in Compoſitions.) All men confeſs that every Plant, every Worm, or Fly, every ſenſitive, yea every ſenſible Being, is ſo little known to us, as that the unknown part far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the known.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. 5. And we are not agreed of late of the <hi>number</hi> of the very <hi>Elements</hi> themſelves; much leſs of Compounds; of which, while we know ſo few, that which we do know is the more defectively known; becauſe (as in knowing of Letters and Syllables) the knowledge of one thing is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the true and uſeful knowledge of another.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. But the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> of things to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſo wonderfully unſearchable, and innumerably va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as quite ſurpaſſeth all humane underſtanding. Yea, though ORDER and <hi>Relation</hi> conſtitute all Morality, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, Literature, &amp;c. ſo that it is as it were that <hi>World</hi> which humane Intellects converſe in, and the <hi>buſineſs</hi> of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> yet few men know ſo much as what ORDER and RELATION is: Nay, nor whether it be <hi>Any thing</hi> or <hi>nothing</hi>: And though health and ſickneſs, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and diſcord, beauty and uglineſs, virtue and vice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in it, and Heaven and Hell depend upon it, and <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> do make and determine it; yet is it not eaſie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55434:21"/>
to know what it is by an <hi>Univerſal Notion</hi>; nor whether it be truly to be called <hi>Any thing</hi> at all. We doubt not but ORDER ſhould be a moſt obſervable Predicament, in the <hi>Series</hi> of humane <hi>Notions</hi> or <hi>nominanda</hi>: But yet I doubt not much but that <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> who would make <hi>tempus</hi> and <hi>ſpatium</hi> two of his Predicaments, doth aſcribe to them that Entity which they have not.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. And though undoubtedly <hi>Action</hi> is a noble Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament, and whatever the <hi>Carteſians</hi> ſay, requireth more cauſation than <hi>non agere</hi> doth; yea is it ſelf the cauſation of the mutations in the World; yet men ſcarce know what to call it. Some ſay it is <hi>res:</hi> others it is but <hi>accidens rei</hi>; and others <hi>modus rei</hi>; ſome ſay, It is <hi>in paſſo</hi>: Some ſay it is <hi>in agente</hi>: Some ſay it is neither, but is <hi>agentis</hi>: Some ſay immanent acts are Qualities, as <hi>Scotus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. And which is yet worſe, the very <hi>name, Accident, Mode</hi> and <hi>Quality,</hi> are but general unapt notions, not well underſtood by any that uſe them, nor ſuited meetly to the ſeverals contained under them. And when we call a thing, (or nothing) a Quality, Accident or Mode, we are little the wiſer, and know not well what we have ſaid. Sure I am that they are exceedingly <hi>heterogenea</hi> which Ariſtotle compriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the very predicament of Quality. And <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> thought all <hi>Accidents</hi> may be as well called Qualities or Modes.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. And which is yet worſe, all humane language is ſo wofully <hi>Ambiguous,</hi> that there is ſcarce a word in the World that hath not many ſenſes: and the learned world never <hi>came</hi> to agreement about the meaning of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon words, ſo that ambiguity drowneth all in uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and confuſion.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. And which is yet worſe, the <hi>certain apprehenſion</hi> of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> is commonly by men called <hi>Learned,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to, and tryed by, theſe dreaming ambiguous names and univerſal notions: and men are drawn to deny their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55434:21"/>
                  <hi>certain knowledge,</hi> becauſe they know not by what <hi>univerſal term</hi> to call it, <hi>e. g.</hi> I know as far as is uſeful to me, by <hi>ſeeing</hi> what <hi>Light</hi> is; but whether it be <hi>Subſtantia, Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Modus, &amp;c.</hi> or what to call it univerſally, few know! And no wonder, for their univerſal notions are their <hi>own</hi> works or <hi>Entia rationis,</hi> fabricated by the imperfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of things with things, by ignorant underſtandings; but the ſenſibility of objects &amp; the ſenſitive faculty &amp; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, are the works of God. I know much better what <hi>Light</hi> is by ſeeing it, than I know what an <hi>Accident</hi> or a <hi>Quality</hi> is.</p>
               <p>So I know by <hi>feeling</hi> what <hi>Heat</hi> is, I know what <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> is, I know what pain and pleaſure is, I know what love and hatred is, I know partly what it is to think, to know, to will, chooſe and refuſe; but what is the right univerſal notion of theſe, what true definition to give of any one of them, the Learnedſt man doth not well know; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, as I dare boldly ſay, that the vulgar ordinarily know all theſe better without definitions, than the moſt Learned man living can know them by definitions alone.</p>
               <p>And here I will preſume to ſtep aſide, to ſay as in the Ears of our over-doing <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> who can take none into Chriſtian Communion, that cannot tell you how they were Converted, or at leaſt give them a fair account of their underſtanding all the Articles of the Faith, in words that are adapted to the matter: I tell you 1. That the knowledge of <hi>Words,</hi> and ſecond <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Definitions,</hi> is one thing, and the knowledge of Matters or Things is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2. And it is the knowledge of the <hi>Things,</hi> and not of the <hi>Words,</hi> that is <hi>primarily</hi> and abſolutely neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 3. And that many an illiterate, ill bred perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand things long before they can utter their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings in any intelligible words. 4.

And do manifeſt ſerious <hi>willingneſs</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, by <hi>avoiding</hi> evil, and uſing <hi>Gods means</hi>; I dare not, I will not refuſe that perſon from the Communion of the Church; Though I would do as much as the rigideſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer to bring ſuch up to greater knowledge.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. And on the other ſide men are made to think that they <hi>know</hi> the <hi>things</hi> becauſe they know the <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions</hi>: And ſo that they are learned and Wiſe when they know little the more by all their learning. For to be able to talk over all the Critical Books and Lexicons and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars; all the Logical Notions and Definitions, is nothing but Organical Knowledge; Like the Shoemaker that hath a Shop full of <hi>Laſts,</hi> (and that moſt of them unmeet for any mans foot) but never made a Shoe by any of them. And <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>confuſed</hi> and <hi>idle names</hi> and notions, fill the learned world with <hi>Falſe, Confuſed</hi> and <hi>Vain</hi> Conceptions, which Common-Countrey people ſcape, ſo that it coſteth many a man twenty years ſtudy, to be made more erroneous than he would have been, by following an honeſt trade of life.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. Nay our very Articles of Faith and Practice, which Salvation lyeth on, are commonly tryed by theſe arbitrary Organical notions; whole loads of School Volumes are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of this. Though the School-men, where our Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians deride them as Barbarians, have often done well in fitting <hi>words</hi> to <hi>things,</hi> and making the Key meet for the Lock: Yet old terms and notions and axioms too often go for current, and over-rule diſputes, when they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, nor are proper or univocal. What work doth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> make with <hi>Actus</hi> and <hi>Potentia,</hi> and the School-men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him? What abundance of darkneſs do theſe two words contain in all their writings? And for want of other words to ſupply our needs, what abundance of diſtinctions of <hi>Actus</hi> and <hi>Potentiae</hi> are the Scotiſts and other Schoolmen fain to uſe? What abundance of diſputes are kept up by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of the word <hi>[Cauſe]</hi> while it is applyed to things
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55434:22"/>
ſo different, as <hi>Efficience, Conſtitution,</hi> and <hi>Finality</hi>? The like may be ſaid of many more. And then when it cometh to a diſpute of the Divine Nature, of the Soul, of the moſt weighty things, theſe confounding notions muſt over-rule the Caſe. We muſt not have an argument for the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, but what theſe notions check or vitiate; no nor ſcarce for an Attribute of God.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. And it is ſo hard a thing to bring men to that ſelf-denial and labour, as at Age throughly and impartially to reviſe their juvenile conceptions, and for them that <hi>learnt words</hi> before <hi>things,</hi> to proceed to <hi>learn things</hi> now as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in their proper evidence, and to come back and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all their old notions, which were not found, and to build up a new frame, that not one of a multitude is ever Maſter of ſo much virtue as to attempt it, and go through with it. Was it not labour enough to ſtudy ſo many years to know what others ſay? but they muſt now undo much of it, and begin a new and harder labour? who will do it?</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. And indeed none but men of extraordinary <hi>Acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneſs</hi> and <hi>Love of truth,</hi> and <hi>Self-denial</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> are fit to do it. For, 1. The Common <hi>dullards</hi> will fall into the ditch when they leave their Crutches. And will multiply Sects in Philoſophy and Religion, while they are unable to ſee the truth in itſelf. And indeed this hath made the Proteſtant Churches, ſo liable to the deriſion and reproach of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. And how can it be avoided, while all men muſt pretend to know and judge, what indeed they are unable to underſtand?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yea the half-witted men, that think themſelves acute and wiſe, fall into the ſame Calamity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the proud will not endure to be thought to err, when they plague the world with error.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And the Impatient will not endure ſo long and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult ſtudies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And when all is done, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, they muſt be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55434:23"/>
content with a very few approvers, and muſt bear the ſcorn of the ignorant-learned crowd. Who have no way to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the reputation of their own <hi>Wiſdom, Orthodoxneſs</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> but by calling him <hi>Proud,</hi> or <hi>Self-conceited,</hi> or <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,</hi> that differeth from them by knowing more than they. And who but the truly ſelf-denying can be at ſo much coſt and labour for ſuch reproach, when they foreknow that he that increaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow?</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. By theſe means mens minds that ſhould be taken up with God and his Service, are abuſed and vilified, and filled with the duſt and ſmoak of vain, and falſe, and confuſed notions. And mans life is ſpent (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) in a vain ſhew. And men dream waking with as great induſtry, as if they were about a ſerious work. Alas how pitifully is much of the learned world employed.</p>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. By this means alſo mens precious time is loſt: And he that had time little enough to learn and do things neceſſary, for the common good, and his own ſalvation, doth waſte half of it on he knoweth not what. And Satan that findeth him more ingenious than to play it away at Cards and Dice, or than to Drink and Revel it away, doth caſt another bait before him, and get him learnedly to dream it away about unprofitable words and notions.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. And by this means the <hi>Practice</hi> of goodneſs is hindred in the world, yea and <hi>Holy Affections</hi> quenched. While theſe arbitrary Notions and Speculations, (being mans own) are his more pleaſant game; And Studies and Pulpits muſt be thus employed, and heart and life thus ſtoln from God. Yea it's well if Godlineſs grow not to be taken by ſuch dreamers, for a low, a dull and an unlearned thing; yea if they be not tempted by it to Infidelity, and to think (not only the zealous Miniſters and Chriſtians, but even) Chriſt and his Apoſtles to be unlearned men, below their eſtimation.</p>
               <p n="30">XXX. And by the ſame means the deviliſh ſin of Pride
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55434:23"/>
will be kept up, even among the Learned, yea and the Preachers of Humility: For what is that in the world (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt) that men are prouder of than that Learning which conſiſteth in ſuch notions and words as are afore deſcribed? And the proudeſt man, I think, is the worſt.</p>
               <p n="31">XXXI. And by this means the ſacred Chairs and Pulpits will be poſſeſſed by ſuch men, whoſe ſpirits are moſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a Crucified Chriſt, and to that Croſs and Doctrine which they muſt preach. And when Chriſt's greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are the Paſtors of his Churches, all things will be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and managed accordingly; and the faithful hated and abuſed accordingly. Though I muſt add, that it is not this Cauſe alone, but many more concurring to conſtitute a worldly wicked mind, which uſe to procure theſe effects.</p>
               <p n="32">XXXII. And by falſe and vain Learning Contentions are bred and propagated in the Churches. None are inſtruments ſo apt, and none have been ſo ſucceſsful, as all Church Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry recordeth and the Voluminous contentions of many ſuch learned parties teſtify.</p>
               <p n="33">XXXIII. And this is an increaſing malady, for new Books are yearly written, containing the ſaid arbitrary notions of the ſeveral Authors. And whereas real and organical Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be orderly and conjunctly propagated, and <hi>Things</hi> ſtudied for themſelves, and <hi>Words</hi> for <hi>Things,</hi> the ſyſtems of of Arts and Sciences grow more and more corrupted, our Logicks are too full of unapt notions, our Metaphyſicks are a meer confuſed mixture of Pneumatology and Logick; and What part hath totally eſcaped?</p>
               <p n="34">XXXIV. And the number of ſuch Books doth grow ſo great, that they become a great impediment and ſnare; and how many years precious time muſt be loſt, to know what men ſay, and who ſaith amiſs, or how they differ?</p>
               <p n="35">XXXV. And the great diverſity of Writers and Sects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth the danger &amp; trouble, eſpecially in Phyſicks; by that time a man hath well ſtudied the ſeveral ſects, the Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55434:24"/>
and Somatiſts, the Carteſians, with the by-parties, <hi>(Regius, Berigardus, &amp;c.)</hi> the Platoniſts, the Peripateticks, the Hermeticks, <hi>Lullius, Patricius, Teleſius, Campanella, White, Digby, Gliſſon,</hi> and other Noveliſts; and hath read the moſt learned improvers of the curranter ſort of Philoſophy, (<hi>Scheggius, Wendeline, Sennertus, Hoffman, Honorat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faber, Got,</hi> &amp;c.) how much of his life will be thus ſpent. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he will be as <hi>far</hi> to ſeek, in all points ſaving thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon evident certainties, which he might have learned more cheaply in a ſhorter time, than he was before he read them. And will wiſh that <hi>Antonine, Epictetus,</hi> or <hi>Plutarch</hi> had ſerved inſtead of the greater part of them. And will perceive that Phyſicks are much fuller of uncertainties, and emptier of ſatisfying uſefulneſs than Morality, and true Theology.</p>
               <p n="36">XXXVI. By ſuch falſe methods and notions men are often led to utter Scepticiſm, and when they have found out their own errors, they are apt to ſuſpect all the ſubſtance of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be error. And he ſpeeds well that cometh but with <hi>Sanchez</hi> to a <hi>nihil ſcitur</hi>: And he better that cometh but with <hi>Cornel. Agrippa,</hi> to write <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation</hi> upon all the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: for many come to <hi>Infidelity</hi> it ſelf, and ſome to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm: And, as Dr. <hi>Tho. Jackſon</hi> noteth, by ſuch diſtruſt of men and humane things, are tempted into a diſtruſt or unbelief of Chriſt; or perhaps with <hi>Hobbs</hi> grow to cry down all Learning beſides their own, which is worſe than the worſt that they decry.</p>
               <p n="37">XXXVII. And by all this Princes and States are tempted to hate Learning it ſelf, and baniſh it as a pernicious thing: As the caſe of the Turkiſh, Muſcovian, and ſome other Empires teſtifie.</p>
               <p>All this I have ſaid, not to diſhonour true Learning, which I would promote with all my power; but to ſhew the <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> of that <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and humane falſe Learning, which <hi>Paul</hi> and the Ancient Writers did
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55434:24"/>
decry; and why the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> forbad the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gentiles Books, and reproached <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> and other Hereticks for their Gentile Learning.</p>
               <p>Of the great uncertainty of our Phyſicks and Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, almoſt all the chief Authors themſelves make free confeſſions.

               </argument>
               <p>IT is none of the Apoſtles meaning that men ſhould be meer Scepticks: Nor am I ſeconding <hi>Sanchez</hi> his <hi>nihil ſcitur,</hi> unleſs you take <hi>Science</hi> for adequate Science, or in a tranſcendent notion, as it ſignifieth that which is proper to another World, and therefore may be denyed of this. He can neither play the part of a Chriſtian or of a man, who doubts of all things, and is aſſuredly confident of nothing.</p>
               <p>That our diſcourſe of this may be orderly and edifying, it is of great uſe that I firſt help you rightly to underſtand what <hi>Certainty</hi> is. The word is ambiguous, and ſometime is applied to the <hi>Object,</hi> and ſometime to the Act and Agent. The former is called <hi>Objective Certainty</hi>; the latter <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective</hi> Certainty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Objective</hi> is either Certainty of the <hi>Thing,</hi> or Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of <hi>Evidence,</hi> by which the thing is diſcernible or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to us. And this either <hi>Senſible</hi> Evidence, or <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>; and the latter is either <hi>ſelf-evidence</hi> of <hi>principles,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Conſequences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subjective</hi> Certainty is alſo either conſidered in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of it, or in the <hi>Degree</hi>: And as to the <hi>Nature</hi> it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55434:25"/>
the <hi>Senſes Certainty,</hi> or the <hi>Intellects</hi>; and this either of <hi>Incomplex</hi> Objects, or <hi>Complex:</hi> The firſt is either of <hi>ſenſed</hi> Objects, or purely <hi>Spiritual:</hi> The ſecond of <hi>Principles,</hi> or of <hi>Concluſions.</hi> Of all theſe there are Certainty.</p>
               <p>The Degrees are theſe: It being firſt ſuppoſed that no Humane apprehenſion here is abſolutely <hi>perfect</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all our <hi>Certainties ſubjective</hi> are Imperfect: The word therefore ſignifieth not only a <hi>perfect apprehenſion</hi>; but it ſignifieth <hi>non falli, not to be deceived, and ſuch an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the evidence as giveth us a juſt reſolving and quieting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</hi> And ſo 1. The due Objects of ſenſe, and 2. The immediate acts of the Soul it ſelf, are Certain in the firſt and higheſt degree. I know certainly what I ſee clearly, ſo far as I ſee it: And I know certainly that I think, and <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>will.</hi> The next degree of Certainty is of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Principles, and the next of Conſequents.</p>
               <p>It's like in a Scheme you will eaſilier underſtand it.</p>

               <p>A few Propoſitions may further help your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p n="1">I. All things in the world have their Certainty phyſical of Being; that is, it is a Certainty, or a Truth that this thing is.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The thing which is moſt commonly called <hi>Objective Certainty,</hi> is ſuch a degree of Perceptibility or Evidence as may aptly ſatisfie the doubting Intellect.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Evidence is called Infallible; 1. When he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it is never deceived; and ſo all Truth is Infallible Truth; for he is not deceived who believeth it: 2. Or when a man cannot err about it. And there is no ſuch Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the world, unleſs you ſuppoſe all things elſe agreeable.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Perception is called Infallible, 1. Either <hi>quia non falſa,</hi> becauſe it is not deceived: And ſo every man is Infallible in every thing which he truly perceiveth: 2. Or becauſe it <hi>Cannot</hi> or <hi>Will</hi> not <hi>err.</hi> And ſo Abſolute Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is proper to God: But <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> in certain caſes upon certain Objects, with certain Conditions, all ſound mens Senſes and Intellects are Infallible.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:55434:26"/>V. <hi>Certainty of Evidence</hi> conſiſteth in ſuch a <hi>Poſition</hi> of the thing evident, as maketh it an Object perceptible to the faculty perceiving; to which many Conditions are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: As 1. That the Thing it ſelf have ſuch intrinſick qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, as make it fit to be an Object. 2. That it have the due extrinſick conditions concomitant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the Nature of an <hi>Object</hi> of perception it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 1. That it be a thing which in its Nature is within the reach of the perceiving faculty: And not (as Spirits are to ſenſe) ſo above us, or alien to us, as to be out of the Orb of our perception. 2. That they have a percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Quantity, Magnitude or Degree. 3. That, if it be an Incomplex term and object, and not an Univerſal of the higheſt notion, it be <hi>hoc aliquid,</hi> and have its proper Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduation. 4. That it have ſome ſpecial <hi>diſtinct</hi> conformity to the diſtinct perceiving faculty. In ſum, that it be <hi>Ens, Unum, Verum, Bonum, vel hiſce contraria reductivè</hi> &amp; <hi>per accidens cognita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To the extrinſick Conditions, it is neceſſary, 1. That the Object have a due <hi>ſite</hi> or poſition. 2. And a due <hi>diſtance</hi>; neither too near, nor too far off. 3. And that it have a due <hi>medium,</hi> fitted to it and to the faculty. 4. And that it have a due <hi>abode</hi> or <hi>ſtay,</hi> and be not like a Bullet out of a Gun, imperceptible through the celerity of its motion.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That the perception of <hi>ſenſe</hi> be certain, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 1. That the Organ be ſound, in ſuch a meaſure as that no prevalent Diſtemper undiſpoſe it. 2. That it be not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by any diſturbing adjunct. 3. That the ſenſitive Soul do operate on and by theſe Organs: For elſe its alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will leave the Organ uſeleſs: As ſome intenſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations make us not hear the Clock. 4. That it be the due Senſe and Organ which meeteth with the Object; as ſounds with the Ear, light with the Eye, &amp;c. beſides the foreſaid neceſſaries.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Common <hi>Notitiae</hi> or <hi>Principles</hi> are not ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55434:26"/>
men are born with the Actual Knowledge of them; But becauſe they are truths, which mans mind is naturally ſo diſpoſed to receive as that upon the firſt exerciſes of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> ſome of them are underſtood, without any other humane teacher.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Even ſelf-evident Principles are not equal, but ſome of them are more, and ſome leſs evident. And therefore ſome ſooner, and ſome later known. And ſome of them are more commonly known than others.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The <hi>ſelf evidence</hi> of theſe <hi>Principles</hi> ariſeth from the very <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Intellect</hi> which inclineth to <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> which eſſentially inclineth to <hi>Good,</hi> and the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Poſture</hi> of the <hi>Objects,</hi> which are <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in the moſt evident poſition, compared together, or Conjunct; ſome call it Inſtinct.</p>
               <p n="10">X. It is not neceſſary to the certainty of a Principle, that it be commonly known of all or moſt. For Intellects have great Variety of Capacities, Excitation, Helps, Improvements, and even Principles have various degrees of evidence, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances to men.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Mans mind is ſo conſcious of its own darkneſs and imperfections, that it is diſtruſtful of its own Inferences un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be very <hi>Near</hi> and <hi>Clear.</hi> When by a long Series of <hi>Ergo</hi>'s any thing is far fetcht, the mind is afraid there may be ſome unperceived error.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. He therefore that holdeth a true <hi>Principle</hi> as ſuch, and at once a <hi>falſe inference</hi> which contradicteth it, is to be ſuppoſed to hold the principle firſt and <hi>faſteſt,</hi> and that if he ſaw the Contradiction he would let go the conſequent, and not the principle.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. He that denieth the certainty of <hi>Senſe, Imagination,</hi> and <hi>Intellective perception</hi> of things <hi>ſenſed</hi> as ſuch, doth make it impoſſible to have any certainty of <hi>Science</hi> or <hi>Faith</hi> about thoſe ſame Objects but by miracle. And therefore the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts denying and renouncing all theſe (Senſe, Imagination
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55434:27"/>
and Intellective perception,) when they ſay, that there is no <hi>Bread</hi> nor <hi>Wine</hi> in the Sacrament, do make their pretended contrary Faith impoſſible. For we are men before we are Chriſtians, and we have Senſe and Intellects, before we have faith. And as there is no Chriſtianity but on ſuppoſition of humanity, ſo there is no Faith, but on ſuppoſition of ſenſe and underſtanding. How know you that here is no Bread and Wine? Is it becauſe Scripture or Councils ſay ſo? How know you that? By Hearing or Reading? But how know you that ever you did <hi>hear</hi> or <hi>read</hi> or ſee a <hi>Book</hi> or <hi>Man</hi>? By ſenſe or no way! If ſenſe be fallible <hi>here,</hi> why not <hi>there?</hi> You'l ſay that ſenſe may be fallible in <hi>one caſe,</hi> and not in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I anſwer, either you prove it infallible from <hi>Nature,</hi> even by <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Intellective</hi> perception of and by ſenſe, or elſe by ſupernatural Revelation. If only by this Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how know you that Revelation? How know you that ever you heard, read or ſaw any thing which you call Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. If by a former Revelation, I ask you the ſame que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion <hi>in infinitum.</hi> But if you know the certainty of <hi>Senſe</hi> by <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Intellective</hi> perception, then where there is the ſame <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>perception,</hi> there is the ſame <hi>certainty.</hi> But here is as full Evidence and Perception as any other Object can have. 1. We ſee Bread and Wine. 2. We taſt it. 3. We ſmell the Wine. 4. We hear it poured out. 5. We feel it. 6. We find the effects of it; It refreſheth and nouriſheth as other Bread and Wine. 7. It doth ſo by any other creature as well as by a man. 8. It corrupteth. 9. It becometh true fleſh and blood in us, and a part of our bodies; Even in the worſt: Yea part of the body of a Mouſe or Dog. 10. It's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a Mouſe or Dog to live only upon conſecrated Bread and Wine. Is his body then nothing but Chriſt. 11. In all this perception the Objects are not rare, but commonly exhibited in all ages; They have all the Conditions that other ſenſible evident objects have, as to ſite, magnitude, diſtance, medium. 12. And it is not one or two, but all men
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55434:27"/>
in the World of the ſoundeſt ſenſes, who ſenſe and perceive them to be Bread and Wine. So that here is as full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as the <hi>words</hi> which you <hi>read</hi> or <hi>hear</hi> can have to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But if God deny ſenſe in this caſe and not in others, we muſt believe ſenſe in others and not in this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But again I ask you, <hi>How you know</hi> that God bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or forbiddeth you any thing, if ſenſe be not <hi>firſt to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But is it not poſſible for ſenſe to be deceived? Cannot God do it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is poſſible for ſenſe to be annihilated, and made no ſenſe; and it is poſſible that the Faculty or Organ, or <hi>Medium,</hi> or Object, be depraved, or want its due condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo to be deceived. But to retain all theſe due Conditions, and yet to be deceived is a <hi>Contradiction</hi>: For then it is not the ſame Thing: It is not that which we call now formally <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Intellect,</hi> or Senſation and Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And Contradictions are not things for Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be tryed about. God can make a man to be no Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Creature: But thereby he maketh him <hi>no man:</hi> For to be a <hi>man,</hi> and not <hi>Intellectual,</hi> is a contradiction. And ſo it is to be <hi>men,</hi> and yet to have no <hi>Senſe</hi> nor <hi>Intellect,</hi> that can truly perceive <hi>ſenſible Objects</hi> as before qualified: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they unman all the World, on pretext of aſſerting the power of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſe that all Senſe be fallible, and Intellection of things ſenſible, yet it is the <hi>firſt and only entrance</hi> of all things <hi>ſenſible</hi> into the mind or knowledge of man: And therefore we muſt take it as God hath given it us, for we can have no ſurer: No ſenſible thing is in the Intellect which was not firſt in the Senſe: Whether my Eyes and Ears, and Taſte be fallible or not, I am ſure I have no other way to perceive their Objects; but by them I muſt take them and uſe them as they are. All the words and definitions in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55434:28"/>
World will not give any man without ſenſation, a true conception of a ſenſible Object.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such abſurd ſuppoſitions therefore are not to be put, <hi>[What if God ſhould tell you by his Word, that all the ſenſes of all men are deceived, in one thing, or in all things? would you not believe him?]</hi> It is not to be ſuppoſed that God will give us all our Senſes and Intellective perception by them, to be our diſcerner of things ſenſible, and then bid us not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, for they are falſe; unleſs he told us that all our perceptions are falſe, and our whole Life is but deceit. And I further anſwer, if God tell me ſo, it muſt be by ſome <hi>word or writing</hi> of Man or Angel, or Himſelf: And how ſhould I know that <hi>word</hi> but by my ſenſe?</p>
               <p>But the great anſwer which ſeemeth to ſatisfie <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the reſt, is, that <hi>ſenſe is no judge of Subſtances, but of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents only; therefore it is not deceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 1. It is falſe that ſenſe perceiveth not ſubſtances: It is not only <hi>colour,</hi> quantity, figure, which I ſee, nor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly roughneſs and ſmoothneſs which I feel, nor only ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which I taſte; but it is <hi>a coloured, extended, figured ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which I ſee; a rough or ſmooth ſubſtance which I feel,</hi> and a <hi>ſweet ſubſtance</hi> which I taſte: And if the Accident were the <hi>only primary object,</hi> the Subſtance is the <hi>ſecondary</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Elſe no one ever ſaw a Man, a Tree, a Bird, a Plant, the Earth, a Book, or any ſubſtance; but only the colour, quantity or figure of them! no man ever felt or touched a Body, but only the Accidents of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And I pray you tell me how Subſtances come to the underſtanding if they were never in the ſenſe: Prove a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance without ſenſation as a medium if you can. Do you <hi>perceive</hi> any Subſtances <hi>Intellectually</hi> or not? If not, why pretend you that there are any? if yea, it muſt be either as Concluſions, or as Intellectual Principles, (which are both Logical complex Objects, and therefore not ſubſtances) or as the immediate immaterial objects of Intellection (which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55434:28"/>
is only the Souls own acts) or what is by Analogy gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them; or elſe the objects of <hi>ſenſe</hi> it ſelf. It can be none of the former; therefore it muſt be the latter: And how can the underſtanding find that in <hi>ſenſe</hi> which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be ſaid that it is there but by <hi>Accidents</hi>; I anſwer, 1. That is falſe, though ſaid by many: I do as immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch <hi>ſubſtance</hi> as <hi>accidents,</hi> though not ſubſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the accidents. 2. Whether it be there by the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the accidents, or immediately it ſelf, we are ſure that the underſtanding no otherwiſe receiveth it, than as the ſenſe tranſmitteth it; we muſt know material ſubſtance as it is ſenſed, or not at all.</p>
               <p>We ſee then what a paſs this <hi>Roman</hi> Religion bringeth the World to. That they may be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they muſt believe (and ſwear by the <hi>Trent</hi> Oath) that they are <hi>not men</hi>; and that they may <hi>have Faith,</hi> they muſt renounce their <hi>Senſes,</hi> and that they may be <hi>ſure</hi> Gods Word is true, (and the Churches decrees,) they muſt be ſure that they are <hi>ſure of nothing</hi>; and how then are they ſure of that? And while they ſubvert all the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> in the World, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that <hi>God can do it,</hi> and therefore we are to believe that <hi>he doth it,</hi> meerly becauſe theſe Doctors can call themſelves the <hi>Church,</hi> and then can ſo expound the Scripture. When it is Gods ſetled order in Nature, that a Man as an Animal ſhall have <hi>Senſe</hi> to perceive things ſenſible by, and as a Man ſhall have <hi>underſtanding</hi> to receive from the <hi>Imagination</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> theſe objects, we muſt now ſuppoſe that God hath quite overturned the courſe of Nature, either by making ſenſe no ſenſe, or the object no object, or the medium no fit medium; and yet this is to be <hi>believed</hi> by Men that have nothing but the ſame ſenſes to tell their underſtandings that it is <hi>written</hi> or <hi>ſpoken,</hi> or that there is a Man in the World.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe we grant it to be no contradiction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a thing that <hi>God can do,</hi> no man can queſtion but that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55434:29"/>
he muſt do it as a <hi>Miracle,</hi> by altering and overturning Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures courſe. And ſhall we fain, 1. Miracles to become or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary things, through all the Churches in the World, and every day in the week or every hour to be done? 2. And Miracles to be made a ſtanding Church Ordinance? 3. And every one in the Church, even all the wicked, and every Mouſe that eateth the Hoſt, to be partaker of a Miracle? 4. Yea that every ſuch Man and Mouſe, may all the week long live on a continued Miracle, while Accidents without ſubſtance do nouriſh them and turn to Fleſh and Blood? 5. And all this ordinary courſe of Miracles to be wrought at the will of every Prieſt, be he never ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or wicked a Man? 6. And yet the ſame words ſpoken by the holieſt of the Proteſtant Paſtors will not do the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. 7. But if a Papiſt Prieſt ſhould be unduely ordained, or forge his own orders, ſobeit the Church think him truly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, he can do the Miracle. All this muſt be believed.</p>
               <p>And the Plague of all is, all men muſt be Burnt as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or exterminated, that cannot believe all this, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe their Senſes. And yet worſe, all temporal Lords muſt be diſpoſſeſt of their Dominions, who will ſuffer any ſuch to live therein, and not exterminate them.</p>
               <p>An Epicure and a ſenſual Infidel who think man is but of the ſame ſpecies of Brutes, do but unman us, and leave us the Honour of being <hi>Animals</hi> or <hi>Brutes.</hi> But the Papiſts do not leave us this much, but muſt reduce us to a lower or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and teach us to deny our ſenſe it ſelf; and Torment and Kill them that will not do it.</p>
               <p>And what is it that muſt perſwade us to <hi>all this</hi>? Why meerly a <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> as expounded by the Councils of <hi>Laterane</hi> and <hi>Trent.</hi> And is not <hi>Davids</hi> [<hi>I am a Worm and no Man, Pſal.</hi> 22.6.] as plain; yea and that in a Prophecy of Chriſt? Muſt we believe therefore that neither <hi>David</hi> nor Chriſt was a Man, but a Worm? Is not [<hi>I am the Vine, and ye are the Branches, Joh.</hi> 15.1, 2.] as plain? Muſt Senſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55434:29"/>
be renounced and ordinary Miracles believed for ſuch words as theſe?</p>

               <p>And when did God work Miracles which were meer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of belief againſt ſenſe? Miracles were done as ſenſible things, thereby to confirm Faith, and that which no ſenſe perceived was not taken for a Miracle.</p>
               <p>To conclude, when the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> (plainly ſpeaking of them <hi>formally</hi> as now called, and not as they ſignify <hi>Sin,</hi>) and conſequently that Chriſts <hi>Body</hi> is now in Heaven a <hi>Spiritual Body,</hi> and not formally <hi>Fleſh and Blood,</hi> yet muſt the <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> be turned into his <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> when he hath none in Heaven?</p>
               <p>And by their Doctrine no Baker nor Vintner is ſecured but that a Prieſt may come into his Shop or Celler and turn all the Bread and Wine in it, into Chriſts Body and Blood: yea the whole City or Garriſon may thus be deprived of their Bread and Wine, if the Prieſt intend it: and yet it ſhall not be ſo in the Sacrament it ſelf, if the Prieſt intend it not.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the ſeveral Degrees of Certainty.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. AS Certainty is taken for <hi>Truth of Being,</hi> it admitteth of no Degrees: All that is <hi>True,</hi> is <hi>equally True.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Evidence</hi> hath various degrees: none doubteth but there are various degrees of <hi>Evidence:</hi> all the doubt is whether any but the <hi>higheſt</hi> may be called <hi>Certainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here let the Reader firſt remember that the queſtion is but <hi>de nomine,</hi> of the <hi>name,</hi> and not the thing. And next, the Evidence is called <hi>Certain,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>Certifying</hi> aptitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinally. It is apt to certify us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And then the queſtion will be devolved to <hi>ſubjective Certainty,</hi> whether <hi>it have</hi> various degrees. For if it have
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55434:30"/>
ſo, then the <hi>Evidence</hi> muſt be ſaid to have ſo, becauſe it is denominated <hi>reſpectively</hi> from the <hi>Apprehenſive Certainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here <hi>de re</hi> it muſt be taken as agreed, 1. That <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> is a certain Degree of apprehenſion. 2. That there are various degrees of apprehenſion. 3. That no Man on Earth hath a perfect Intellectual apprehenſion, at leaſt, of things Moral and Spiritual. For his apprehenſion, may be ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and thoſe in Heaven have perfecter than we.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there are ſome degrees ſo low and doubtful, as are not fit to be called <hi>Certainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That even theſe loweſt degrees with the greateſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are yet often <hi>True</hi> apprehenſions: and whenever they are <hi>True</hi> they are <hi>Infallible,</hi> that is, <hi>not deceived:</hi> Therefore this <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which is but, <hi>not to be deceived,</hi> is indeed one ſort of <hi>Certainty,</hi> which is ſo denominated Relatively from the natural Truth or Certainty of the object: But it is not this ſort of <hi>Certainty</hi> which we enquire after.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Therefore it followeth that this ſubjective certainty, containeth this <hi>Infallible Truth</hi> of perception, and addeth a degree which conſiſteth in the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of <hi>the mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. But if the mind ſhould be never ſo confident and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of a <hi>falſhood,</hi> this deſerveth not the name of <hi>Certainty,</hi> becauſe it includeth not <hi>Truth.</hi> For it is a <hi>Certain perception</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> which we ſpeak of; and <hi>Confident erring</hi> is not <hi>Certainty of the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. As therefore the degrees of doubting are variouſly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, ſo there muſt needs be various degrees of <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. When doubting is ſo far overcome, as that the mind doth find reſt and ſatisfaction in the Truth, it may be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Certainty.</hi> But when doubting is either prevalent, and ſo troubleſome as to leave us wavering, it is not called <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. It is not the <hi>forgetting</hi> or <hi>neglect</hi> of a <hi>difficulty</hi> or <hi>doubt,</hi> nor yet the <hi>wills rejecting</hi> it, which is properly called <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:55434:31"/>
This <hi>quieteth</hi> the mind indeed, but not by the way of <hi>aſcertaining</hi> Evidence. Therefore <hi>ignorant</hi> people that ſtumble upon a truth by chance with confidence, are not therefore <hi>Certain</hi> of it. And thoſe that take it upon truſt from a Prieſt or their Parents, or good peoples Opinion, are not therefore Certain of it. Nor they that ſay as ſome Papiſts, <hi>[Faith hath not evidence, but is a Voluntary reception of the Churches Teſtimony, and meritorious, becauſe it hath not Evidence: Therefore though I ſee no cogent Evidence, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe it is my duty.]</hi> Whether this mans Faith may be ſaving or no, I will not now diſpute; but certainly it is no <hi>Certainty</hi> of apprehenſion. He is not <hi>Certain</hi> of what he ſo believeth. This is but to <hi>caſt away</hi> the <hi>doubt</hi> or difficulty, and not at all by <hi>Certainty</hi> to overcome it. 11. When a man hath attained a <hi>ſatisfying degree</hi> of perception, he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable ſtill of clearer perception. Even as when in the heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of water, after all the ſenſible <hi>cold</hi> is gone, the water may grow hotter and hotter ſtill. So after all ſenſible doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is gone, the perception may go clearer ſtill. 12. But ſtill the <hi>Objective Certainty</hi> is the ſame; that is, There is that Evidence in the object which is <hi>in ſuo genere ſufficient</hi> to notifie the thing to a prepared mind. 13. But this <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi> is a <hi>reſpective proportion</hi>; and therefore, as it <hi>reſpecteth mans mind</hi> in <hi>common,</hi> it ſuppoſeth that by due means and helps, and induſtry, the mind may be brought <hi>certainly</hi> to diſcern this Evidence. But if you denominate the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of the Evidence, from its reſpect to the <hi>preſent diſpoſition</hi> of mens <hi>minds,</hi> ſo it is almoſt as various as mens minds are. For <hi>recipitur ad modum recipientis</hi>; and that is a <hi>certifying ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Evidence of truth,</hi> to one man, which to a thouſand others, is not ſo much as an Evidence of probability. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>mediate</hi> and <hi>immediate ſufficiency</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, muſt be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>From all this I may infer, 1. That though God be the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of all <hi>Verities,</hi> and is ever the <hi>Firſt in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55434:31"/>
eſſendi</hi> &amp; <hi>efficiendi,</hi> and ſo <hi>à Jove principium, in methodo ſyntheticâ</hi>; yet he is not the <hi>primum notum,</hi> the firſt <hi>known, in ordine cognoſcendi,</hi> nor the beginning <hi>in methodo inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vâ</hi> (though in ſuch <hi>Analytical methods</hi> as begin at the <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end,</hi> he is alſo the <hi>firſt.</hi>) Though all <hi>truth and evidence</hi> be from God, yet two things are more <hi>evident to man</hi> than <hi>God</hi> is, and but two: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The preſent evident objects of <hi>ſenſe.</hi> 2. Our own internal Acts, of Intellective Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Volition. And theſe being ſuppoſed the Being of God is the third evident Certainty in the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be no diſparagement to <hi>God himſelf,</hi> that he is leſs certainly known of us, than <hi>ſenſibles,</hi> and our <hi>Internal acts, (de eſſe)</hi> it is then no diſparagement to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>ſupernatural Truths,</hi> that they are leſs certainly known: Seeing they have not ſo clear evidence as the <hi>Being of God</hi> hath.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The certainty of Scripture Truths, is mixt of almoſt all other kinds of certainty conjunct. 1. By <hi>ſenſe</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective perception of things ſenſed, the Hearers and See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, knew the words and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. 2. By the ſame <hi>ſenſe</hi> we know what is written in the Bible, and in Church Hiſtory concerning it, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting matters of Fact: And alſo what our Teachers ſay of it. 3. By certain <hi>Intellectual inference</hi> I know that this Hiſtory of the words and <hi>fact</hi> is true. 4. By <hi>Intellection</hi> of a <hi>natural principle</hi> I know that God is true. 5. By <hi>inference</hi> I know that all his Word is true. 6. By <hi>ſenſe</hi> I know (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectually receiving it by ſenſe) that this or that is written in the Bible, and part of that word. 7. By further infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence therefore I know that it is true. 8. By <hi>Intuitive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> I am certain that I have the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> deſires, and a Love of holineſs, and hatred of ſin, &amp;c. 9. By certain inference I know that this is the ſpecial work of the Spirit of Chriſt by his Goſpel Doctrine. 10. By <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> I find the predictions of this Word fulfilled. 11.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55434:32"/>
Laſtly, By <hi>Inſpiration</hi> the Prophets and Apoſtles knew it to be of God. And our certain Belief ariſeth from divers of theſe, and not from any one alone.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There are two extreams here to be avoided, and both held by ſome not ſeeing how they contradict themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Of them that ſay that <hi>Faith hath no Evidence,</hi> but the merit of it lyeth in that we believe without <hi>Evidence.</hi> Thoſe that underſtand what they ſay, when they uſe theſe words, mean that <hi>Things evident to ſenſe, as ſuch,</hi> that is, <hi>Incomplex</hi> ſenſible objects are not the objects of Faith. We live by Faith and not by ſight. God is not viſible: Heaven and its Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Angels and perfected Spirits are not viſible. Future Events, Chriſts coming, the Reſurrection, Judgment, are not yet viſible: It doth not yet appear (that is, to ſenſe) what we ſhall be. Our Life is hid (from our own and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſenſes) with Chriſt in God. We ſee not Chriſt when we rejoice in him with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8. Heb. 11.1.</note> Thus Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen, or evident to ſight. But ignorant Perſons have turned all to another ſenſe; as if the objects of Faith had no aſcertaining Intellectual Evidence. When as it is impoſſible for mans mind to underſtand and believe any thing to be true, without perceiving <hi>evidence</hi> of its truth; as it is for the Eye to ſee without Light. As <hi>Rich. Hooker</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Eccl. Pol. Let men ſay what they will, men can truly believe no further than they perceive Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> It is a natural Impoſſibility: For <hi>Evidence</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>perceptibility</hi> of the Truth: And can we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that which is not perceptible?</p>
               <p>It's true that evidence from Divine Revelation is oft without any <hi>Evidence ex natura rei:</hi> But it may be never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs a <hi>fuller</hi> and more ſatisfying evidence.</p>
               <p>Some ſay there is Evidence of <hi>Credibility,</hi> but not of <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</hi> Not of natural <hi>Certainty</hi> indeed. But in <hi>Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> (though not in humane) evidence of <hi>Credibility,</hi> is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55434:32"/>
                  <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Certainty,</hi> becauſe we are certain that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie.</p>
               <p>And to ſay, <hi>I will believe, though without Evidence of Truth,</hi> is a contradiction or hypocritical ſelf-deceit. For your <hi>will believeth not.</hi> And your <hi>underſtanding</hi> receiveth no <hi>Truth</hi> but upon evidence that it is <hi>Truth.</hi> It acteth of itſelf <hi>per modum naturae,</hi> neceſſarily further than it is <hi>ſub imperio Voluntatis</hi>; And the will ruleth it not deſpotically; Nor at all <hi>quoad Specificationem,</hi> but only <hi>quoad exercitium.</hi> All therefore that your <hi>will</hi> can do (which maketh <hi>Faith a moral Virtue</hi>) is to be free from thoſe vicious habits and acts in itſelf which may hinder faith, and to have thoſe holy <hi>diſpoſitions</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> in itſelf which may help the underſtanding to do its proper Office, (which is to believe evident truth on the teſtimony of the revealer, becauſe his Teſtimony is ſufficient Evidence. The true meaning of a good Chriſtian, when he ſaith, I <hi>will believe,</hi> is, I am truly <hi>willing</hi> to believe, and a perverſe will ſhall not hinder me, and I will not think of ſuggeſtions to the contrary. But the meaning of the formal hypocrite when he ſaith, <hi>I will believe,</hi> is, I will caſt away all doubtful thoughts out of my mind, and I will be as careleſs as if I did believe, or I will believe the Prieſt or my Party, and call it <hi>a believing</hi> God. Evidence is an eſſentiating part of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects act. As there is no Act, without an Object, ſo there is no <hi>object ſub formali ratione objecti,</hi> without evidence. Even as there is no <hi>ſight</hi> but of an <hi>Illuſtrated object,</hi> that is, <hi>A viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> object.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The other extream (of ſome of the ſame men) is, that yet <hi>Faith is not true and certain if it have any doubtfulneſs with it.</hi> Strange! That theſe men cannot only <hi>ſee what is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Believe what is inevident</hi> as to its <hi>truth,</hi> that is, incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but alſo believe paſt all <hi>doubting,</hi> and think that the weakeſt true believer doth ſo too! Certainly there are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious degrees of faith in the ſincere. All have not the ſame ſtrength! Chriſt rebuketh <hi>Peter</hi> in his fears, and his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55434:33"/>
all at other times, for their little <hi>faith</hi>: When <hi>Peters</hi> faith <hi>failed</hi> not, it <hi>ſtaggered,</hi> which <hi>Abrahams</hi> did not:<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord increaſe our Faith,</hi> and <hi>Lord, I believe, help my unbelief,</hi> were prayers approved by Chriſt. I will call <hi>a prevalent belief</hi> which can lay down Life and all this world for Chriſt and the hopes of Heaven, by the name of <hi>certainty</hi> (which hath various degrees.) But if they differ <hi>de nomine,</hi> and will call nothing <hi>certainty</hi> but the higheſt degree, they muſt needs yet grant that there is true ſaving faith that reacheth to no certainty in their <hi>ſenſe.</hi> Yea no man on Earth then attaineth to ſuch a certainty, becauſe that every mans faith is imperfect.</p>
               <p>To conclude. Though all Scripture in itſelf (that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the true <hi>Canon</hi>) be equally true, yet all is not equally <hi>certain</hi> to us, as not having equal evidence that it is Gods word. But of that in the next Chapter of the uncertainties.</p>

               <p>SOmewhat of this is ſaid already, <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. But I am here to come to more particular inſtances of it. But becauſe that an enumeration would be a great Volume of it ſelf, I ſhall begin with the more general, that I may be excuſed in moſt of the reſt; or mention only ſome particulars under them as we go.</p>
               <p n="1">I. A very great, if not the far greateſt part of that part of Philoſophy called <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> is <hi>uncertain</hi> (or certainly falſe) as it is delivered to us in any methodiſt that I have yet ſeen; whether Platoniſts, Peripateticks, Epicureans, (the Stoicks have little, but what <hi>Seneca</hi> gives us, and <hi>Barlaam</hi> Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, I know not whence, as making up their <hi>Ethicks,</hi> and what in three or four Ethical writers is alſo brought in on the by, and what <hi>Cicero</hi> reporteth of them) or in our Nove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, <hi>Patricius, Teleſius, Campanella, Thomas White, Digby,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55434:33"/>
Carteſius, Gaſſendus,</hi> &amp;c. Except thoſe whoſe modeſty cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to ſay but little, and to avoid the uncertainties; or confeſs them to be uncertainties. To enumerate inſtances would be an unſeaſonable digreſſion. <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> is large in his Confeſſions of uncertainties. I think not his Brother <hi>Hobs,</hi> and his ſecond <hi>Spinoſa</hi> worth the naming. Nor the Paracelſians and Helmontians as giving us a new Philoſophy, but only as adding to the old. There needs no other teſtimony of <hi>uncertainty</hi> to a man that hath not ſtudied the points him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than their lamentable difference, and confutation of each other, in ſo many, very many things; even in the great Principles of the Science.</p>
               <p>Yet here no doubt, there are certainties, innumerable certainties, ſuch as I have before deſcribed. We know <hi>ſomething certainly</hi> of many things, even of all ſenſible objects. But we know nothing <hi>perfectly</hi> and <hi>comprehenſively,</hi> not a <hi>worm,</hi> not a <hi>Leaf,</hi> not a <hi>Stone,</hi> or a <hi>Sand,</hi> not the <hi>Pen, Ink</hi> or <hi>Paper,</hi> which we write with; not the <hi>hand</hi> that writeth, nor the ſmalleſt particle of our bodies; not a hair or the leaſt acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. In every thing neareſt us, or in the world, the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties and <hi>incognita</hi> are far more than that which we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If I ſhould enumerate to you the many uncertainties in our common <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> (yea about the Being of the Science) and our common <hi>Logick,</hi> &amp;c. It would ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to a Theological diſcourſe. And yet it would not be unuſeful, among ſuch Theologues as the Schoolmen, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve more of their doubts by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> than by the Holy Scriptures; doubtleſs, as <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Predicaments are not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the kinds of beings, ſo many of his diſtributions and orders, yea and precepts are arbitrary. And as he left room and reaſon for the diſſent of ſuch as <hi>Taurellus, Carpenter, Jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus, Gorlaeus, Ritſchel,</hi> and abundance more, ſo have they alſo for mens diſſent from them. Even <hi>Ramus</hi> hath more adverſaries than followers. <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> goeth the right way,

               <p>As for the lamentable uncertainties in Medicine, the poor world payeth for it. Anatomy as being by ocular inſpection hath had the beſt improvement; And yet what a multitude of uncertainties remain? Many thouſands years have milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons yearly died of Feavers, and the medicating them is a great part of the Phyſicians work; and yet I know not that ever I knew the man, that certainly knew what a Feaver is. I crave the pardon of the Maſters of this noble art for ſaying it; It is by dear experience that I have learnt how little Phyſicians know; having paſſed through the tryal of above thirty of them on my own Body long ago, meerly induced by a conceit that they knew more than they did, and moſt that I got was but the ruine of my own body, and this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to leave to others, [<hi>Highly value thoſe few excellent men, who have quick and deep conjecturing apprehenſions, great read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and greater Experience, and Sober, Careful, Deliberating minds, and had rather do too little than too much: But uſe them
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55434:34"/>
in a due conjunction with your own experience of your ſelf:</hi> But for the reſt, how Learned ſoever, <hi>whoſe heads are dull, or temper precipitant, or apprehenſions haſty or ſuperficial, or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmall, but eſpecially that are young, or of ſmall experience,</hi> love and honour them, but uſe them as little as you can, and that only as you will uſe an honeſt ignorant Divine, whom you will gladly hear upon the certain Catechiſtical Principles, but love not to hear him meddle with Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. So uſe theſe men in common eaſie caſes, if neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and yet <hi>there</hi> the leſs the better, leſt they hinder na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that would Cure the Diſeaſe. If you diſlike my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, you may be ſhortly paſt blaming it; for though their ſucceſſes have Tongues, their miſcarriages are moſtly ſilent in the Grave. O how much goeth to make an able Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian? But enough of ſuch inſtances.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But though <hi>Errors</hi> in Politicks the World payeth yet much dearer for, I muſt not be too bold in talking here. But I will confeſs that here the uncertainties are almoſt all in the <hi>Applicatory part,</hi> and through the <hi>incapacity</hi> of the minds of men: For the truth is the main Principles of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy are part of the Divine Law, and of true Morality, and in themſelves are plain, and of a <hi>ſatisfying Certainty,</hi> could you but get mens <hi>heads</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> into a fitneſs duely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and receive them.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But to come nearer to our own profeſſion, there is much uncertainty in thoſe Theological Concluſions, which are built on ſuch premiſes, where any one of theſe <hi>Phyſical, Metaphyſical</hi> or <hi>Logical Uncertainties</hi> are a part; yea, though it be couched in the narroweſt room, even in one ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous term of Art, and ſcarce diſcerned by any but accurate obſervers. With great pomp and confidence many proceed to their <hi>Ergo</hi>'s, when the detection of the fraud not only of an uncertain Medium, but of one ambiguous ſyllable, will marr all. And the concluſion can be no ſtronger or furer, than the more weak and doubtful of the premiſes.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:55434:35"/>V. When the Subject is of <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>abſtruſe parts,</hi> far from the <hi>Principles</hi> and Fundamentals of the Matter, uſually the Concluſions are uncertain. Nature in all matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth with ſome few great and maſter parts, like the great boughs or limbs of the Tree, or the great Trunks and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Veſſels in our bodies; and from thence ſpring branches, which are <hi>innumerable</hi> and <hi>ſmall</hi>: And it is ſo in all Sciences, and in Theology it ſelf. The great Eſſential and Chief Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral parts, are few, and eaſily diſcerned: But two grand Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments hinder us from a <hi>Certain</hi> knowledge in the reſt: one is the great <hi>Number</hi> of Particles, where the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is loſt, and, as they ſay, ſeeketh a Needle in a bottle of Hay, or a leaf in a Wood; and the other is the <hi>Littleneſs</hi> of the thing, which maketh it undiſcernible to any but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate and ſtudious minds. And therefore how much ſoever men that trade in little things, may boaſt of the ſublimity of them, and their own ſubtilty, their perceptions uſually are accompanied with uncertainty; though in ſome caſes an uncertain knowledge, known to be ſo, is better than none.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Yea, though the <hi>Matters themſelves</hi> may be more <hi>bulky,</hi> yet if in <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>proving</hi> them, we muſt go through a great <hi>number of Syllogiſms</hi> and <hi>Inferences,</hi> uſually the concluſion is very uncertain to us, whatever it may be to an extraordinary accurate and prepared mind: For 1. We ſhall be ſtill jealous (or may be) leſt in ſo many terms and mediums ſome one of them ſhould be fallacious and inſufficient, and weaken all. And we are ſo conſcious of our own weakneſs, and liableneſs to forget, overſee or be miſtaken, that we ſhall or may ſtill fear leſt we have miſt it, and be overſeen in ſomething, in ſo long a courſe and ſeries of arguings.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Thoſe parts of Hiſtory which depend meerly on the credit of Mens <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Honeſty,</hi> and ſo are <hi>meerly</hi> of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Faith, muſt needs be uncertain. For the concluſion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55434:35"/>
can be no ſurer than the premiſes, All men as ſuch are liars, that is, untruſty, or ſuch as poſſibly may deceive. 1. They may be deceived themſelves. 2. And they may deceive others where they are not themſelves deceived. Every man hath ſome Paſſion, ſome Ignorance, ſome Error, ſome Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh intereſt and ſome Vice. This age, if we never had known other inſtance, is ſo ſad a proof of this, that tears are fitter than words to expreſs it, moſt confident reporters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally differ about the moſt notorious matters of Fact. I muſt not name them, but I pity ſtrangers and poſterity. If it come eſpecially to the characterizing of others, how or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily do men ſpeak as they are affected? And they are affected as ſelf-intereſt and paſſion leadeth them, with <hi>Cochlaeus, Bolſeck,</hi> and ſuch others, what villains were <hi>Luther, Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius, Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. with their faithfulleſt acquaintance; what Good and Holy men (ſaving <hi>Luthers</hi> animoſity?) If the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors Torment Proteſtants, or Burn them, is it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that they call them by ſuch odious names as may juſtify their fact? If they baniſh and ſilence faithful, holy, able, Miniſters, they muſt accuſe them of ſome villanies which may make them ſeem worthy of the puniſhment, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to Preach the Goſpel of Chriſt! what different characters did <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> and their party on one ſide, and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and the Orthodox on the other ſide, give of one another? What different characters were given of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>? How differently do <hi>Hunnerichus</hi> and <hi>Genſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> on one ſide, and <hi>Victor Uticenſis</hi> and other Hiſtorians on the other ſide, deſcribe the Biſhops and Chriſtians of <hi>Africk,</hi> that then ſuffered? They were Traytors and Rebels, and Rogues, and Enemies to the King, and Hereticks to <hi>Hunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richus</hi>: But to others, they are Holy blameleſs Men, and thoſe were Tyrants and Hereticks that Perſecuted them. What difference between the Hiſtories of the orthodox, and that of <hi>Philoſtorgius,</hi> and <hi>Sondius?</hi> What different Characters do <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Eunapius</hi> give of <hi>Conſtantine?</hi> and <hi>Eunapius</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:55434:36"/>
and <hi>Hilary,</hi> &amp;c. give of <hi>Julian</hi>? What different Characters are given of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> on one ſide, and of the Emperours <hi>Henrys</hi> on the other ſide, by the many Hiſtorians who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſeveral parts? How falſe muſt a great number of the Hiſtorians on one ſide be? I know that this doth not make all Humane Faith and Hiſtory uſeleſs. It hath its degree of credibility anſwerable to its uſe. And a wiſe man may much conjecture whom to believe. 1. A Man that (like <hi>Thuanus</hi>) ſheweth modeſty and impartiality, even towards Diſſenters. 2. A man that had no notable intereſt to byas him. 3. A man that manifeſteth otherways true honeſty and conſcience. 4. Suppoſing that he was himſelf upon the place, and a competent Witneſs.</p>
               <p>But there is little or no Credit to be given, 1. To a factious, furious railer. 2. To one that was a flatterer of Great Men, or depended on them for preferment, or lived in fear of ſpeaking the truth, or that ſpeaketh for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his <hi>Riches</hi> and Honour in the World; or for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged perſonal reputation, or that hath eſpouſed the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of a ſect or faction. 3. There is little credit to be given to any Knave and Wicked Man. He that dare be Drunk, and Swear and Curſe, and be a Fornicator or covetous Worldling, dare <hi>Lie</hi> for his own Ends. 4. Nor to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſteſt man that taketh things by rumours, hear-ſay and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain reports, and knoweth not the things themſelves.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall ſtrangers and poſterity know when they read a Hiſtory, whether the Writer was an honeſt Man or a Knave? A man of credit, or an impudent Liar? Both may be equal in confident aſſerting, and in the plauſibility of the narrative. Meer humane belief therefore muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
               <p>From whence we ſee the pitiful caſe of the ſubjects of the King of <hi>Rome</hi> (for ſo I muſt rather call him than a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.) Why doth a Lay-man believe Tranſubſtantiation, or any other Article of their Faith? Becauſe the Church faith
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55434:36"/>
it is Gods Word. What is the Church that ſaith ſo? It is a faction of the Popes, perhaps at <hi>Laterane,</hi> or forty of his Prelates at the Conventicle of <hi>Trent.</hi> How doth he know that theſe men do not lie? Becauſe God promiſed that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Faith ſhould not fail, and the Gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt the Church; and the Spirit ſhould lead the Apoſtles into all truth. But how ſhall he know that this Scripture is Gods Word? And alſo that it was not a total failing, rather than a failing in ſome degree that <hi>Peter</hi> was by that promiſe freed from? Or that the Spirit was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to theſe Prelates which was promiſed to the Apoſtles? Why, becauſe theſe Prelates ſay ſo! And how know they that they ſay true? Why, from Scripture, as before.</p>
               <p>But let all the reſt go. How knoweth the Lay-man that ever the Church made ſuch a decree? That ever the Biſhops of that Council were lawfully called? That they truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented all Chriſts Church on Earth? That this or that Doctrine is the decree of a Council, or the ſence of the Church indeed? Why, becauſe the Prieſt tells him ſo. But how knoweth he that this Prieſt ſaith true, or a few more that the man ſpeaketh with: there I leave you: I can anſwer no further; but muſt leave the credit of Scripture, Council and each particular Doctrine, on the credit of that poor ſingle Prieſt, or the few that are his companions. The Lay-man knoweth it no otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But is not the Scripture it ſelf then, ſhaken by this, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hiſtory of the Canon and incorruption of the Books,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>dependeth on the word of Man</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No. 1. I have elſewhere fully ſhewed how the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath ſealed the ſubſtance of the Goſpel. 2. And even the matters of fact are not of <hi>meer humane Faith.</hi> For <hi>meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faith</hi> depends on the meer honeſty of the reporter: but this Hiſtorical Faith dependeth partly on <hi>Gods atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and partly on <hi>Natural proofs.</hi> 1. God did by Miracles atteſt the reports of the Apoſtles and firſt Churches, 2. The
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55434:37"/>
                  <hi>conſent</hi> of all Hiſtory ſince, that theſe are the ſame writings which the Apoſtles wrote, hath a <hi>Natural Evidence</hi> above bare humane Faith. For I have elſewhere ſhewed, that there is a <hi>concurrence</hi> of humane report or a conſent of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which amounteth to a true <hi>Natural Evidence,</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> having its <hi>Nature</hi> and ſome <hi>neceſſary acts,</hi> and nothing but <hi>neceſſary aſcertaining cauſes,</hi> could cauſe ſuch concurrence. Such Evidence we have that K. <hi>James,</hi> Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> lived in <hi>England:</hi> that our Statute books contain the true Laws, which thoſe Kings and Parliaments made whom they are aſcribed to. For they could not poſſibly rule the Land, and over-rule all mens intereſts, and be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Bar, &amp;c. without contradiction and detection of the fraud, if they were forgeries: (though it's poſſible that ſome words in a Statute Book may be miſprinted. There is in this a <hi>Phyſical Certainty</hi> in the <hi>conſent of men,</hi> and it depends not as <hi>humane Faith,</hi> upon the <hi>honeſty</hi> of the reporter; but Knaves and Liars, have ſo conſented, whoſe intereſts and occaſions are croſs, and ſo is it in the caſe of the hiſtory of the Scripture Books: which were read in all the Churches through the World, every Lords day, and contenders of various opinions took their Salvation to be concerned in them.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Thoſe things muſt needs be <hi>uncertain</hi> to any man, as to a particular Faith or Knowledge, which are more in number than he may poſſibly have a diſtinct underſtanding of; or can examine their Evidence whether they be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or not. For inſtance the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith containeth all the Doctrinal decrees, and their Religion alſo all the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical decrees of all the approved General Councils, (that is, of ſo much as pleaſed the Pope, ſuch power hath he to make his own Religion.) But theſe General Councils (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all the Bible, with all the <hi>Apocrypha</hi>) are ſo large, that it is not poſſible for moſt men to know what is in them. So that if the queſtion be whether this or that Doctrine be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55434:37"/>
the Word of God, and the proof of the affirmative is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is decreed by a General Council, this muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain to almoſt all men, who cannot tell whether it be ſo decreed or no: Few Prieſts themſelves knowing all that is in all thoſe Councils: So that if they knew that all that is in the Councils is Gods Word; they know never the more whether this or that Doctrine (<hi>e. g.</hi> the immaculate Conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c.) be the Word of God. And if a Heathen knew that all that is in the Bible is the Word of God, and knew not a word what is in it, would this make him a Chriſtian or Saint him?</p>
               <p>You may object, <hi>that moſt Proteſtants alſo know not all that is in the Scripture. Anſ.</hi> True; nor any one. And therefore Proteſtants ſay not that all that is in the Scripture is neceſſary to be known to Salvation, but they take their Religion to have <hi>eſſential</hi> parts, and integral parts and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. And ſo they know how far each is neceſſary. But the Papiſts deride this diſtinction, and becauſe all truths are equally true, they would make men believe that all are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Fundamental or Eſſential to Chriſtianity: But this is only when they diſpute againſt us; at other times they ſay otherwiſe themſelves, when ſome other intereſt leads to it, and ſo cureth this impudency.</p>
               <p>It were worthy the enquiry whether a Papiſt take all the Bible to be Gods Word, and <hi>de fide,</hi> or only ſo much of it as is contained particularly in the decrees of Councils? If the latter, then none of the Scripture was <hi>de fide,</hi> or to be particularly believed for above 300 years, before the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> If the former, then is it as neceſſary to Salvation to know how old <hi>Henoch</hi> was, as to know that Jeſus Chriſt is our Saviour?</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Thoſe things muſt needs be uncertain which depend upon ſuch a number of various circumſtances as cannot be certainly known themſelves. For inſtance, the common rule by which the Papiſt Doctors do determine what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55434:38"/>
Knowledge and Faith are neceſſary to Salvation, is that <hi>ſo many truths are neceſſary as are ſufficiently propounded to that perſon to be known and believed.</hi> But no man living, learned nor unlearned, can tell what is neceſſary to the ſufficiency of this propoſal. Whether it be ſufficient, if he be told it in his Childhood only, and at what Age? Or if he be told it but once, or twice, or thrice, or how oft? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a Parent or Layman that can not tell him what is in the Councils? or by a Prieſt that never read the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils? and whether the variety of natural capacities, bodily temperaments, education and courſe of Life before, do not make as great variety of proportions to be neceſſary to the ſufficiency of this Propoſal? And what mortal man can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take the meaſure of them? And how then can any man be <hi>Certain</hi> what thoſe points are which are neceſſary for him to believe?</p>
               <p n="10">X. Thoſe things are <hi>uncertain</hi> which depend upon an uncertain Author or Authority. For inſtance, the Roman faith dependeth on the expoſition of the Scriptures by the conſent of the Fathers, and on the Tradition of the Church, and the decrees of an authorized Council. And here is in all this, little but uncertainties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is utterly uncertain who are to be taken for Fathers, and who not. Whether <hi>Origen, Tatianus, Arnobius, Lactanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Tertullian,</hi> and many ſuch, be <hi>Fathers</hi> or not. Whether ſuch a man as <hi>Theophilus Alexandrinus,</hi> or <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> was the Father, when they condemned each other. Whether ſuch as are juſtly ſuſpected of Hereſy, (as <hi>Euſebius</hi>) or ſuch as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts have caſt ſuſpicions on (as <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> called a Heretick, <hi>Socrates, Sozomens</hi> falſly called Novatians, <hi>Hilary, Arelatenſis</hi> Condemned by the Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Claud. Turo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venſ. Rupertus Tuitienſ.</hi> and ſuch others.) When the ancients renounced each others Communion, (as <hi>Martin</hi> did by <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thacius</hi> and <hi>Idacius</hi> and their Synod,) when they deſcribe one another as ſtark Knaves, as <hi>Socrates</hi> doth <hi>Theophil. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrin.</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:55434:38"/>
and <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> doth <hi>Ithacius,</hi> which of them were the Fathers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How ſhall we know certainly which are the true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted writings of theſe Fathers among ſo many forgeries and ſpurious Scripts?</p>
               <p n="3">3. How ſhall it be known what expoſition the Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented on, when not one of a multitude, and but few in all have commented on any conſiderable parts of the Scripture, and thoſe few ſo much often differ?</p>
               <p n="4">4. When in the Doctrine of the Trinity it ſelf <hi>Petavius</hi> largely proveth that moſt of the writers of the three firſt Centuries after the Apoſtles were unſound, and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the ſame about the <hi>Millennium,</hi> the corporeity of Angels and of the Soul, and divers other things; doth their conſent bind us to believe them? If not, how ſhall we know in what to believe their conſent, according to this Rule?</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as to the Church, they are utterly diſagreed among themſelves, what that Church is which hath this authority.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the Pope alone. 2. Or the Pope with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Council. 3. Or the Pope with a General Council. 4. Or a General Council without the Pope. 5. Or the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of Paſtors. 6. Or the univerſality of the people with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And for a Council. 1. There is no certainty what number of Biſhops, and what conſent of the Comprovincial Clergy is neceſſary to make them the true repreſentatives of any Church. 2. And more uncertain in what Council the Biſhops had ſuch conſent. 3. And uncertain whether the Popes approbation be neceſſary. (The great Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> determining the contrary.) 4. And uncertain which were truly approved. 5. And moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there never was any General Council in the world (unleſs you will call the Apoſtles a General Council) but only General Councils of the Clergy of one Empire (with now and then a ſtragling Neighbour,) even as we
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55434:39"/>
have General Aſſemblies and Convocations in this Kingdom: And who can be certain of that faith which dependeth upon all, or any of theſe uncertainties?</p>
               <p n="11">XI. That muſt needs be an <hi>uncertainty</hi> which dependeth on the unknown thoughts of another man. For inſtance, with the Papiſts the Prieſts intention, which is the ſecret of his heart, is neceſſary to the being of Baptiſm, and Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. And ſo no man can be certain whether he or any other man be baptized or not. Nor whether it be Bread or Chriſts Body which he eateth. We confeſs that it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>being</hi> of a Sacrament, that the Miniſter do <hi>ſeem</hi> or <hi>profeſs</hi> to <hi>intend</hi> it as a Sacrament; But if the <hi>reality</hi> of his intent be neceſſary to the being of it, no man can be certain that ever he had a Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. It is a hard thing to be <hi>certain</hi> on either ſide, in thoſe controverſies which have multitudes, and in a manner equal ſtrength, of <hi>Learned, Judicious, Well-ſtudyed, Godly, Impartial</hi> men for each part. I deny not but one clear-headed man, may be <hi>certain</hi> of that which a multitude are uncertain of, and oppoſe him in. But it muſt not be ordinary men, but ſome rare illuminated perſon, that muſt get above a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, unto a <hi>Certainty,</hi> of that which ſuch a company as aforeſaid are of a contrary mind in.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. There is great <hi>uncertainty</hi> in matters of private im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe. When a man hath nothing to prove a thing to be Gods will, but an inward perſwaſion or impulſe in his own Breaſt, let it never ſo vehemently incline him to think it true, it's hard to be ſure of it. For we know not how far Satan or our own diſtempered Phantaſies may go. And moſt by far that pretend to this, do prove deceived. That which muſt be certain, muſt be ſomewhat equal to Prophetical Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Which indeed is its own Evidence: But what that is, no man can formally conceive but he that hath had it. Therefore we are bid to <hi>Try the Spirits.</hi>

Providential changes have their great uſe, as they are the fulfilling or execution of the word. But they that will take them inſtead of the Scripture, do uſually run into ſuch miſtakes, as are rectifyed to their coſt, by ſome contrary work of Providence ere long. Theſe times have fully taught us this.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. It is hard to gather Doctrinal certainties from Godly mens <hi>Experiences</hi> alone. Even our Experimental Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Phyſicians find, that an experiment that hits oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, quite miſſeth afterwards on other Subjects, and they know not why. A courſe of effects may oft come from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known cauſes. And it's no rare thing for the common <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, Selfconceitedneſs,</hi> or corruption of the weaker and greater number of good people, which needeth great repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and a cure, to be miſtaken, for the <hi>Communis Senſus Fidelium,</hi> the Inclination and Experience of the Godly. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when <hi>conſent</hi> or the <hi>honour</hi> of their <hi>Leaders</hi> or <hi>Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> hath engaged them in it. In my time, the common ſenſe of the ſtricteſt ſort was againſt long hair, and taking Tobacco and other ſuch things, which now their common practice is for. In one Countrey the common conſent of the ſtricteſt party is for Arminianiſm. In another they are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly againſt it. In <hi>Poland</hi> where the Socinians are for ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Sacrament, the Godly are generally againſt it. In other places they are for it. In <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi> where they had holy, humble, perſwading Biſhops, the generality of the Godly were for that Epiſcopacy, as were all the ancient Churches, even the Novatians: But in other places it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. So that it's hard to be certain of Truth or Error, Good or Evil, by the meer Conſent, Opinion or Experience of any.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. But the laſt and great inſtance is, that in the holy Scriptures themſelves, there is a great inequality in point of <hi>Certainty,</hi> yea many parts of them have <hi>great uncertainty</hi>; Even theſe that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:55434:40"/>I. Many hundred Texts are uncertain through various Readings in ſeveral Copies of the Original. I will not mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply them on <hi>Capellus</hi> his opinion. Though <hi>Claud. Saravius</hi> (Who got the Book Printed) and other worthy men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. I had rather there were fewer Varieties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had rather think there are fewer. But theſe that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied muſt not be denied: Nor do I think it fit, to gather the diſcrepancies of every odd Copy and call them <hi>Various readings.</hi>

                  </gap>ut it is paſt denial that the world hath no one ancient Copy which muſt be the Rule or Teſt of all the reſt, and that very many Copies are of ſuch equal credit, as that no man living can ſay that <hi>this,</hi> and not that where they differ hath the very words of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi>; And that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the New Teſtament alone the differences or various Readings, of which no man is able to ſay which is the right, are ſo great a number as I am not willing to give every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an account of; Even thoſe that are gathered by <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Brugenſis,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> if you leave out all the reſt in the appendix to the Polyglot Bible. In all or moſt of which we are utterly uncertain which Reading is Gods Word.</p>
               <p n="2">II. There are many hundred <hi>words</hi> in the Scriptures that are <hi>ambiguous, ſignifying more things than one</hi>; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text in a multitude of places determineth not the proper ſenſe; ſo that you may with equal Authority tranſlate them either <hi>thus</hi> or <hi>thus:</hi> The Margin of your Bibles giveth you no ſmall number of them. It muſt needs here be uncertain which of them is the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There are many hundred Texts of Scripture, where the Phraſe is <hi>General,</hi> and may be applyed to more <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> than one: In ſome places the ſeveral particulars muſt be taken as included in the General. (And where there is no neceſſity, a General Phraſe ſhould not be expounded as if it were particular.) But in a multitude of Texts the <hi>General</hi> is put for the <hi>particular,</hi> and muſt be interpreted, but of <hi>one
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55434:40"/>
ſort,</hi> and yet the context giveth us no certain determination <hi>which particular</hi> is meant. This is one of the commoneſt uncertainties in all the Scriptures. Here it is Gods will that we be uncertain.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. In very many paſſages of the Hiſtory of Chriſt, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts ſet both <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Deeds</hi> in Various Orders, one ſets this firſt, and another ſets another firſt. (As in the order of Chriſts three Temptations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. And many ſuch like.) Though it is apparent that <hi>Luke</hi> doth leſs obſerve the order than the reſt, yet in many of theſe caſes it is apparent that it was Gods will to notifie to us the <hi>Matter</hi> only, and not the <hi>Order.</hi> And that it muſt needs be uncertain to us, which was firſt ſaid or done, and which was laſt.</p>
               <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> of ſome ſpeeches of Chriſt recorded by them.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Many of Chriſts Speeches are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by the Evangeliſts in various words.<note place="margin">It is moſt probable that Chriſt and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles then ſpake in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> called Hebrew, and ſo that the four Goſpels are but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations of Chriſts words, and ſo not the the words, but the ſence was Chriſts: And what wonder then if the tranſlating Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts uſe divers words?</note> Even the Lords Prayer it ſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. Beſides that <hi>Matthew</hi> hath the doxology which <hi>Luke</hi> hath not (which <hi>Grotius</hi> and many others think came out of the Greek Liturgy into the Text.) And even in Chriſts Sermon in the Mount, and in his laſt Commiſſion to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. Now in ſome of theſe caſes (as of the Lords Prayer) it is uncertain whether Chriſt ſpake it <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice</hi>: (Though the former is more likely.) In moſt of them, it is plain that it was the Will of Gods Spirit to give us the true <hi>ſenſe</hi> of Chriſts ſayings in various words, and not all the very words themſelves: For the Evangeliſts that differ do neither of them ſpeak falſly, and therefore meant not to recite all the <hi>very words:</hi> If you ſay that <hi>one</hi> giveth us the true words and <hi>another</hi> the true ſenſe, we ſhall
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55434:41"/>
never be certain that this is ſo, nor which that one is. So that in ſuch caſes no man can poſſibly tell which of them were the very words of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. There are many Texts of the Old Teſtament recited in the New, where it is uncertain whether that which the Penman intended was an <hi>Expoſition</hi> or Proof of what he ſaid, or only an <hi>Alluſion</hi> to the Phraſe of Speech, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>[I may uſe ſuch words to expreſs my mind or the matter by.]</hi> As <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.23. <hi>He ſhall be called a Nazarene.</hi> So <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8, 18. and others. I know the Excellent <hi>Junius</hi> in his Parallels hath ſaid much, and more than any other that I know, to prove them all, or almoſt all to be expoſitory and probatory Citations: But withal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that the generality of Ancient and Modern Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors think otherwiſe, he thereby ſheweth a great uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; when he himſelf ſaith not that he is <hi>Certain</hi> of it; and few others thought it <hi>probable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. There are many Texts cited in the New Teſtament out of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> where it differeth from the Hebrew: Wherein it is utterly uncertain to us, whether Chriſt and his Apoſtles intended to juſtifie abſolutely the tranſlation which they uſe, or only to make uſe of it as that which then was known and uſed for the ſake of the <hi>ſenſe</hi> which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. If they abſolutely juſtifie it, they ſeem to condemn the Hebrew, ſo far as it differeth. If not, why do they uſe it, and never blame it? It ſeemeth that Chriſt would here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by tell us, that the <hi>ſenſe</hi> is the <hi>Gold,</hi> and the <hi>words</hi> but as the Purſe; and we need not be over-curious about them, ſo we have the ſence. As if I ſhould uſe the vulgar Latine, or the Rhemiſts Tranſlation with the Papiſt, becauſe he will receive no other.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. There are many <hi>Aenigmatical</hi> and <hi>obſcure expreſſions,</hi> which a few Learned men only can probably conjecture at, &amp; few or none be certain of the full ſenſe. If any <hi>certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand</hi> much of the Prophecies in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55434:41"/>
it muſt needs be very few: When <hi>Calvin</hi> durſt not meddle with the latter: And though moſt of the famous Commentators on the Revelations are ſuch as have peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly made it their Study, and ſet their minds upon it above all other things, and rejoiced in conceit that they had found out the true ſenſe which others had overſeen, (as men do that ſeek the Philoſophers Stone) yet how few of all theſe are there that agree? And if ten be of nine minds, eight of them at leaſt are miſtaken. <hi>Franc. du Jon,</hi> the Lord <hi>Napier, Brightman, Dent, Mede,</hi> and my godly Friend Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> yet living, (ſince dead,) with many others, have ſtudied it thus with extraordinary diligence, but with different ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes: And <hi>Lyra</hi> with other old ones turn all quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. And then come <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and contradict both ſides, and make it all (ſaving a few Verſes) to have been fulfilled many Ages ſince. And can the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, or the unſtudied part of Miniſters then, with any modeſty pretend a <hi>certainty,</hi> where ſo many and ſuch men differ?</p>
               <p>I know it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and they that hear the words of this Prophecy, and keep thoſe things which are written therein:</hi> But that proveth no more than 1. That ſome of it (as <hi>ch.</hi> 1, 2, 3.) is plain and commonly intelligible. 2. That it is a deſirable thing to underſtand the reſt; and worthy mens endeavour in due time and rank; and he that can attain to certainty may be glad of it.</p>
               <p>I paſs by the darkneſs of many Types and Prophecies of Chriſt in the Old Teſtament, and how little the Jews or the Apoſtles themſelves, till after Chriſts Reſurrection, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood them. With very many other obſcurities, which yet are not written in vain, nay, which make up the true perfection of the whole.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. There are very many <hi>proverbial</hi> Speeches in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are not to be underſtood as the words properly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55434:42"/>
ſignifie, but as the ſenſe of thoſe Proverbs then was among the Jews. But diſuſe hath ſo totally obliterated the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſenſe of many of them, that no man living can certainly underſtand them.</p>
               <p n="10">X. There are many Texts which have words adapted to the <hi>Places,</hi> the <hi>Animals,</hi> the <hi>Utenſils,</hi> the <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> the <hi>Coins,</hi> the <hi>Meaſures,</hi> the <hi>Vegetables,</hi> &amp;c. of that place and time, which are ſome hard, and ſome impoſſible now to be <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> underſtood: And therefore ſuch as <hi>Bochart, Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Caſaubone, Scaliger,</hi> &amp;c. have done well to add new Light to our conjectures; but leaving great uncertainty ſtill.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Becauſe the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law is by <hi>Paul</hi> plainly ſaid to be ceaſed or done away, it remaineth very difficult to be <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of abundance of paſſages in the Old Teſtament, how far they are obligatory to us? For when they now bind no otherwiſe than as the <hi>continued</hi> Law of <hi>nature,</hi> or as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumed by Chriſt into his ſpecial Law, where the latter is not found, in the former there is often inſuperable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For moſt lyeth upon the proof of a <hi>parity</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which puts us upon trying caſes hardly tryed, unleſs we knew more of the reaſon of all thoſe Laws. (As about Vows and Diſpenſations, <hi>Num.</hi> 30. about prohibited de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Marriage, and ſuch like; which makes Divines ſo much differ about the obligation of the Judicials, (of which ſee <hi>Junius</hi> vol. 1. p. 1861, &amp;c. <hi>de Polit. Moſ. obſerv.</hi>) and about Uſury, Prieſthood, Magiſtrates power in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and many ſuch.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. There are abundance of Texts which only open the ſubſtance of the matter in hand to us, and ſay nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout abundance of difficulties of the <hi>manner,</hi> and many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, (as the manner of the Divine influx, and the Spirits operation on the Soul, &amp;c.) And here all that which is unrevealed muſt needs be unknown.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:55434:42"/>XIII. There are many Precepts which were <hi>local, perſonal, particular,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is very hard to be ſure what the Apoſtles ſetled as an Univerſal perpetual Law, in Church matters, and what they ſetled only as ſuited to that time and place by the common rule of doing all to Edification: I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice being a ſtanding Rule, it's hard to plead their uſe of any Rites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt common good: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more is mutable than moſt think.</note> and ſo <hi>temporary,</hi> and bind not univerſally all Perſons, at all times afterwards: Such as the <hi>Rechabites</hi> Precepts from their Father, and ſuch as the Love Feaſts, the Kiſs of Love, Womens Veil and long Hair, Mens being uncovered, &amp;c. Now it is very hard to know in all inſtances whether the Precepts were thus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary or univerſal and durable: which makes Divines differ about the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing of the Sick, the Office of Deacons and Deaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the Power of Biſhops, and Extent of their Dioceſſes, the Eating things ſtrangled, and Blood, (againſt which <hi>Chr. Beckman</hi> in his <hi>Exercit.</hi> hath abundance of ſhrewd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, though few are of his mind.) In theſe caſes few reach a Certainty, and <hi>none</hi> ſo full a Certainty as in plainer things.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. It is very hard to be <hi>Certain</hi> when, and how far <hi>Examples</hi> of holy men in Scripture bind us: Though I have elſewhere proved that <hi>wherever</hi> the Apoſtles practice was the Execution of their Commiſſion for ſetling Church Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in which Chriſt promiſed them the help of his Spirit, their Practice was obligatory. Yet in many inſtances the obligation of Examples is very doubtful: Which occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Controverſies about imitating <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Life in the Wilderneſs, and <hi>Anna,</hi> and about <hi>Lent,</hi> and about Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing by dipping over Head, and about the Lords Supper, whether it ſhould be Adminiſtred to a Family, or at Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only, or after Supper, or Sitting, or in a private Houſe, &amp;c. And about waſhing Feet, and many Church Orders and Affairs.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. There are many things in Scripture that are ſpoken but <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice,</hi> and that but as on the by, and not very
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55434:43"/>
plainly: And we cannot be ſo <hi>Certain</hi> of any Doctrine founded on theſe, as on paſſages frequently and plainly written.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. There are ſo many ſeeming differences in Scripture, eſpecially about Numbers, as that if they be reconcileable, few or none in the World have yet found out the way. If we mention them not our ſelves, ſuch paultry Fellows will do it, as <hi>Bened. Spinoſa</hi> in his <hi>Tractatus Theolog.

I think an impartial conſiderer of his inſtances will confeſs, that as God never promiſed all or any of the <hi>Scribes</hi> or Printers of the Bible any infallible Spirit, that they ſhould never write or print a word falſly, and as it is certain by the various Lections that many ſuch there have been in many and moſt Books; ſo there is no <hi>one Scribe</hi> that had a promiſe above the reſt, nor any one Hebrew or Greek Copy which any man is <hi>ſure</hi> is abſolutely free from ſuch miſwritings. For how ſhould we be ſure of that one above all the reſt? And I wiſh the Learned Reader to conſider <hi>Bibliander</hi>'s Preface to his Hebr.

               <p n="17">XVII. We have not the ſame <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Certainty</hi> of the Canonicalneſs or Divineneſs of every Book of Scripture:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55434:43"/>
Though they are all <hi>Gods Word,</hi> they have not all the ſame <hi>Evidence</hi> that they are ſo. The New Teſtament had a fuller Atteſtation from Heaven for its Evidence to man, than moſt of the Old had. And of the New Teſtament, it was long before many Churches received the Epiſt. to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Peter, Jude, Revel.</hi> &amp;c. Even in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> days, in his <hi>Praepar. Evangel.</hi> he ſheweth that they were not received by all. And of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and the Pſalms and Prophets have fuller Atteſtation than the reſt. And indeed, as it is probable that the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi> were written in or after <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time at ſooneſt, ſo they do in ſo many places differ in numbers from the Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> where all would agree with the reſt of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if thoſe numbers were but reduced to thoſe in the <hi>Kings,</hi> that if any man ſhould doubt of the Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Book, that thereby he may be the leſs tempted to queſtion any others, I ſhould not think his Error incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Salvation. Put but that man to prove what he ſaith, who aſſerteth that we have <hi>equal Evidence</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> of the <hi>Chronicles, Canticles, Eſther,</hi> as we have of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> the Prophets, the Pſalms, and the New Teſtament, and you ſhall quickly find that he did but <hi>pretend</hi> an <hi>equal degree</hi> of <hi>Certainty</hi> which indeed he had not. The Papiſts pretend that they are as certain of the Divinity of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha,</hi> as we are of the reſt: But they do but <hi>pretend</hi> a <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> for <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> ſake.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. Though it be to be held that <hi>Certainly</hi> the <hi>Holy Writers</hi> had no falſhoods in Doctrine or Hiſtory, but delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us the Truth alone, yet no one of them delivereth us <hi>all</hi> the Truth, no not of many particular Hiſtories, and Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt which they mention: And therefore we muſt ſet them altogether for the underſtanding of them: (As in the inſtance of Chriſts appearing and the Angels Speeches after his Reſurrection.) And when all's done we have not all that Chriſt ſaid and did, but all that was neceſſary to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55434:44"/>
our Faith and Salvation. For as <hi>Paul</hi> citeth Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>It is more honourable to give, than to receive,</hi> ſo <hi>John</hi> tells us that the <hi>World could not contain the Books that ſhould be written,</hi> we muſt take heed therefore how far we go with <hi>Negatives,</hi> of ſuch unmentioned things.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. Though all that the Holy Writers have recorded <hi>is true,</hi> (and no falſhood in the Scripture but what is from the error of Scribes and Tranſlators) yet we are not certain that the Writers had <hi>not human infirmites</hi> in the <hi>Phraſe, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Manner</hi> of expreſſion. It is apparent that their <hi>ſtyle,</hi> yea their <hi>Gifts</hi> were <hi>various,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> oft openeth them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. &amp;c. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> rather than <hi>Barnabas</hi> was the <hi>Chief Speaker.</hi> And <hi>Apollo</hi> was more eloquent than others: Hence ſome were of <hi>Paul</hi> and ſome of <hi>Apollo</hi> and ſome of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas:</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> is put to vindicate his miniſterial abilities to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Therefore though weaker mens gifts put no <hi>ſinful imperfection</hi> into the Scriptures, yet a humane natural imperfection of ſtyle, and order might be more in ſome than others. It is certain that they were not all <hi>perfect</hi> in <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Holineſs.</hi> And how far every Sermon which they Preached was free from all that Imperfection (any more than <hi>Peters</hi> carriage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.) we are uncertain. And how far their <hi>Writings</hi> had a promiſe of being free from <hi>Natural modal imperfections</hi> more than their Preachings, we know not fully. And yet God turned this weakneſs of theirs to the confirmation of our Faith; ſhewing us that <hi>Heavenly power,</hi> and not <hi>human wiſdom</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> did his work. As <hi>Davids</hi> ſling in conquering <hi>Goliath</hi> ſhewed Gods power. And out of the mouths of Babes doth God ordain ſtrength, and the weak things of the World are uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the ſtrong.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. Laſtly, though all be <hi>certainly true</hi> which they have recorded, yet we have not the <hi>ſame degree of Certainty,</hi> that no Writer erred through lapſe of memory in ſome leſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial paſſage, as we have that they <hi>infallibly delivered us the

               <p>Q. <hi>But if there be ſo many things either uncertain or leſs-cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is it that we are or may be fully certain of?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. What you are or <hi>are</hi> not <hi>certain</hi> of your ſelf, you ſhould know if you know your ſelf without my telling you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deny not but you <hi>may</hi> come to a <hi>Certainty</hi> of all thoſe things which are never ſo difficult, that have any aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidence; if you live long enough, &amp; ſtudy hard enough, and have an extraordinary meaſure of Divine illumination: I do not meaſure others by my ſelf: You may know that which I know not. God may bleſs your ſtudies more, as being better men and fitter for his bleſſing: he may give you extraordinary Inſpirations, or Revelations if he pleaſe. But I am thankful for my low degree, and confeſs my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But I have told you before what Certainties we have. 1. We are certain of <hi>things ſenſible.</hi> 2. And of our <hi>Elicite and Imperate acts.</hi> 3. And of <hi>Natural principles.</hi> 4. And of <hi>clear inferences</hi> thence. 5. And of the <hi>Truth of all the Certain holy Scriptures</hi> which are <hi>Evidently the Word of God</hi> 6. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly therein of the <hi>plain Hiſtorical parts.</hi> 7. And of all that which is the <hi>main deſign and ſcope</hi> of the Text in any Book or Chapter. 8. And of all that which is <hi>purpoſely</hi> and <hi>often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,</hi> and not only obſcurely once ſpoken on the by. 9. Therefore we may be Certain of all that is <hi>neceſſary to Salvation</hi>: of every Article of the Creed; of every Petition in the Lords Prayer, and <hi>every</hi> neceſſary common duty: We may be <hi>Certain</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> of all the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace concerning the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, his Relation to us, and our Relation and Duty to him, and of the benefits of the Covenant; of the neceſſity and nature of Faith, Repentance, Hope, Love, Obedience, Patience, &amp;c. It's tedious to recite all, in a word, all that is of common
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55434:45"/>
neceſſity, and all (how ſmall ſoever) which is plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and expreſſed. 10. And you may be certain of the fulfilling of much of this Holy Word already by ſufficient Hiſtory and Experience.</p>

               <p>IT hath ever been the uſe of the Church of God, to Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe men before they were Baptized; and therein to teach them the true meaning of the Baptiſmal Covenant, by opening to them the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the Decalogue: And when they underſtood this Covenant they were admitted (upon conſent) by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm into the Church,<note place="margin">

(<hi>Though</hi> indeed the opening of Baptiſm was the opening of the Life of that. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the ſame Covenant which is Solemnized in both.</p>
               <p>By doing thus the Church notoriouſly declared that they took not all the Scripture to be equally neceſſary to be <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood</hi>; but that the Govenant of Grace, and the Catechiſm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining it, is the Goſpel it ſelf, that is, the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of it, and of the Chriſtian Religion, and that all the reſt of the Scriptures contain but partly the <hi>Integrals,</hi> and partly the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents</hi> of that Religion. He is the wiſeſt man that knoweth <hi>Moſt</hi> and <hi>Beſt</hi>; and every man ſhould know as much of the Scriptures as he can: But if you <hi>knew all</hi> the reſt, without this (the Covenant of Grace, and its explication) it would not make you Chriſtians or ſave you. But if you know this (truly) without all the reſt, it will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:55434:45"/>The whole Scripture is of great uſe and benefit to the Church. It is like the body of a man; which hath its Head, and Heart, and Stomach, &amp;c. And hath alſo Fingers, and Toes, and fleſh; yea Nails and Hair. And yet the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>Heart</hi> it ſelf fare the better for the reſt, and would not be ſo well Seated ſeparate from them: Though a man may be a man that loſeth even a Leg or Arm. So is it here. But it is the <hi>Covenant</hi> that is our Chriſtianity and the duly Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized are Chriſtians, whatever elſe they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Theſe are the things that all muſt know, and daily live upon.</p>
               <p>The Creed is but the Expoſition of the three Articles of the Baptiſmal Covenant. <hi>[I believe in God, the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt.]</hi> Though the Jews that had been bred up to a preparing knowledge, were quickly baptized by the Apoſtles upon their Converſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Yet no man can imagine that either the Apoſtles or other Miniſters did uſe to admit the Ignorant Gentiles into the Covenant of God, without opening the meaning of it to them; or Baptize them as Chriſtians without teaching them what Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is. Therefore Reaſon and the whole Churches ſubſequent Cuſtom aſſure us that the Apoſtles uſed to expound the three great Articles to their Catechumens; And thence it is called, <hi>The Apoſtles Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcus</hi> Biſhop <hi>of Epheſus</hi> told them in the <hi>Florentine</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil (as you may ſee <hi>Sgyropilus</hi>) <hi>that we have none of the Apoſtles Creed:</hi> And <hi>Voſſius de Symbolis</hi> (beſides many others) hath many Arguments to prove that this ſo called was not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> made by the Apoſtles. Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> hath opened the changes that have been in it. <hi>Sandford</hi> and <hi>Parker</hi> have largely <hi>(de Deſcenſu)</hi> ſhewed how it came in as an Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Baptiſmal Articles. Others ſtifly maintain that the Apoſtles made it. But the caſe ſeemeth plain. The Apoſtles uſed to call the Baptized to the profeſſion of the ſame Articles (which <hi>Paul</hi> hath in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, &amp;c.)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55434:46"/>
and varied not the <hi>matter.</hi> All this was but more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to profeſs <hi>Faith in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Two or three further Expoſitory Articles are put into the Creed ſince: Otherwiſe it is the ſame which the Apoſtles uſed; not in the <hi>very ſyllables,</hi> or forms of words; but in the ſame ſenſe, and the words indeed being left free, but ſeldom much altered, becauſe of the danger of altering the matter. Of all the Antienteſt Writers, not one repeateth the Creed in the ſame words that we have it; nor any two of them in the ſame with one another. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> once, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> twice hath it, all in various words, but the ſame ſenſe. That of <hi>Marcellus</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> cometh neareſt ours called the Apoſtles, and is almoſt it. Afterward in <hi>Ruffinus</hi> and others we have more of it. Yet no doubt but the Weſtern Churches (at leaſt) uſed it with little variation ſtill. The <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed is called by ſome Antients the Apoſtles Creed too. And both were ſo; for both are the ſame in ſenſe and ſubſtance: For it is not the very words that are truly fathered on the Apoſtles.</p>

                  </gap> years a go Mr.<hi>Aſhwel</hi> having publiſhed a Book for the Neceſſity and Honour of the Creed, I wrote in the Poſtſcript to my Reformed Paſtor, <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. a Corrective of ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> paſſages, in which he ſeemeth to ſay too much for it, or at leaſt to depreſs the Scripture too much in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it. But long experience now telleth me, that I have more need to acquaint men with the Reaſons and Neceſſity of the Creed: Seeing I find a great part of ignorant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people much to ſlight the uſe of it, and ſay, <hi>It is not Scripture, but the work of man</hi>: Eſpecially taking offence at the harſh tranſlati<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n of that Article, <hi>[He deſcended into Hell.]</hi> which from the beginning it's like was not in. It is the Kernel of the Scripture; and it is that for which the reſt of the Scripture is given us, even to afford us ſufficient help to <hi>underſtand</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> to the Covenant of Grace, that our <hi>Belief,</hi> our <hi>Deſires,</hi> and our <hi>Practice</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55434:46"/>
principally to theſe Summaries. It is not every Child or Woman that could have gathered the Eſſential Articles by themſelves out of the whole Scripture, if it had not been done to their hands: Nor that could have rightly methodized the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>our deſires,</hi> or gathered the juſt heads of <hi>natural duty,</hi> if Chriſt had not done the firſt in the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and God the ſecond in the Decalogue.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But I believe theſe only, becauſe the Matter of the Creed, and the words alſo of the other two are in the Scripture, and not on any other Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If you ſpeak of the Authority of the Author, which giveth them their truth, it is neither <hi>Scripture</hi> nor <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but <hi>God,</hi> for whoſe Authority we muſt believe both Scripture and them.</p>
               <p>But if you ſpeak of the Authority of the <hi>Deliverers,</hi> and the <hi>Evidence</hi> of the Delivery, be it known to you, 1. That the Creed, Lords Prayer, Decalogue, and the Baptiſmal Covenant have been delivered down to the Church from the Apoſtles by a <hi>diſtinct Tradition,</hi> beſides the Scripture Tradition. Even to all the Chriſtians one by one that were Baptized, and admitted to the Lords Table, and to every particular Church. So that there was not a Chriſtian or Church that was not even <hi>Conſtituted</hi> by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be it known to you, that the Church was long in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them, before it had the Scriptures of the New Teſtament. It's ſuppoſed to be about eight years after Chriſt's Aſcenſion before <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote the firſt Book of the New Teſtament, and near the year of our Lord one hundred, before the <hi>Revelation</hi> was written. And do you think that there were no Chriſtians or Churches all that while? Or that there was no Baptiſm? Or no Profeſſion of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith in diſtinct Articles</hi>? No Knowledge of the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> and <hi>Commandements</hi>? No Goſpel daily preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and practiſed? What did the Church-aſſemblies think you, do all thoſe years? No doubt, thoſe that had Inſpiration uſed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55434:47"/>
it by extraordinary gifts: But that was not all. Thoſe that had not did <hi>preach</hi> the Subſtance of the Chriſtian Religion contained in theſe <hi>forms,</hi> and did <hi>Pray</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi> God, and celebrate the Lords Supper, provoking one another to Love and to good works.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be it known to you that theſe three <hi>Summaries</hi> come to us with fuller <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Certain Tradition</hi> from God, than the reſt of the Holy Scriptures. Though they are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>true,</hi> they are not <hi>equally Evident</hi> to us. And this I thus prove. 1. The Body of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were delivered but <hi>one way</hi>; but the <hi>Covenant, Creed, Lords Prayer</hi> and <hi>Decalogue,</hi> are delivered <hi>two ways.</hi> They are in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and ſo have all the <hi>Evidence</hi> of Tradition which the Scriptures have. And they were beſides that delivered to the <hi>memories</hi> of all Chriſtians. If you ſay that the <hi>Creed</hi> is not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or that the Scripture is not altered as <hi>it</hi> is; I anſwer, 1. That it is in the Scripture as to the matter ſignified in as plain words, even of the ſame ſignification. 2. There is no alteration made, but a ſmall addition, which is no diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to it, becauſe the ancient ſubſtance of it is ſtill known, and the additions are not new made things, but taken out of Scripture. And if yet any Heretick ſhould deny that God is <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Merciful,</hi> it were no diſhonour to the Creed nor weakening of its certainty to have theſe attributes yet added to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Summaries, as is ſaid, were far ancienter than the reſt of the New Teſtament, as written and known, and uſed long before them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Summaries being in every <hi>Chriſtians mind and memory</hi> were faſter held, than the reſt of the Scriptures. Therefore Parents could and did teach them more to their Children. You never read that the Catechizers of the people did teach them all the Bible, nor equally ask them who <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> or <hi>Mehaleel</hi> or <hi>Lamech</hi> was, as they did <hi>who Chriſt was.</hi> Nor put every Hiſtory into the Catechiſm, but only the Hiſtorical Articles of the Creed.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:55434:47"/>4. Therefore it was far eaſier to preſerve the purity of theſe <hi>Summaries,</hi> than of the whole Body of the Scriptures: For that which is in <hi>every mans memory,</hi> cannot be altered without a multitude of reprovers: Which makes the Greeks ſince <hi>Photius</hi> keep ſuch a ſtir about <hi>[Filioque,]</hi> as to think that the Latines have changed Religion, and deſerved to be ſeparated from, for changing that <hi>word.</hi> But no wonder that many hundred various Readings are crept into the Bible, and whole Verſes and Hiſtories (as that of the <hi>Adulterous Woman,</hi>) are out in ſome that are in others. For it is harder to keep ſuch a Volume uncorrupt than a few words. Though <hi>writing</hi> as ſuch is a ſurer way than <hi>memory,</hi> and the whole Bible could never have been preſerved by memory. Yet a <hi>few words</hi> might, eſpecially when they had thoſe words in writings alſo.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Add to this, that the Catechiſtical <hi>Summaries</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, were more frequently repeated to the people, at leaſt every Lords day. Whereas in the reading of the Scriptures, one paſſage will be read but ſeldom, perhaps once or twice in a year. And ſo a corruption not ſo eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And if among an hundred Copies: of the Scripture ten or twenty only ſhould by the Careleſneſs of the Scribes be corrupted, all the reſt who ſaw not theſe Copies would not know it, and ſo they might fall into the hands of Poſterity, when many of the ſounder might be loſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And Laſtly, The danger of depravation had no end. For in every age the Scripture muſt be written over anew, for every Church and perſon that would uſe it. And who that knoweth what writing is, could expect that one Copy could be written without errors, and that the ſecond ſhould not add to the errors of the 1ſt, as Printers now do, who print by faulty Copies. And though this danger is much leſs ſince Printing came up, that is but lately. And the miſchiefs of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55434:48"/>
Wars and Heretical Tyrants burning the trueſt Copies, hath been ſome diſadvantage to us.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Thus you ſeem to weaken the Certain incorruption of the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No ſuch thing: I do but tell you the caſe truly as it is. The wonderful Providence of God, and care of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hath ſo preſerved them, that there is nothing corrupted which ſhould make one Article of faith the more doubtful. I aſſert no more depravation in them than all confeſs; but only tell you how it came to paſs, and tell you the <hi>greater certainty</hi> that we have of the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of <hi>Religion than</hi> of the reſt. And whereas every man of brains confeſſeth that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred words in Scripture (by Variety of Copies) are uncertain, I only ſay, that: <hi>it is not ſo in the Eſſentials.</hi> And I do not wonder that <hi>Virgil, Ovid, Horace, Cicero,</hi> &amp;c. Have not ſuffered ſuch depravations. For, 1. It is not ſo eaſy for a Scribes error to paſs unſeen <hi>in oratione ligata</hi> as <hi>in oratione ſoluta,</hi> in verſe as in proſe. 2. And <hi>Cicero</hi> with the reſt was almoſt only in the hands of Learned men; whereas the Scriptures were in the hands of all the Vulgar, Women and Children. 3. And the Copies of theſe Authors were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively but few: Whereas every one almoſt got Copies of the Scripture that was able. And it's liker that ſome depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſhould be found among ten thouſand Copies than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a hundred.</p>
               <p>So that I have proved to you that the Creed, Lords Prayer, Commandments and Covenant of Baptiſm are not to be <hi>believed only</hi> becauſe they are in the Scripture, but alſo becauſe they have been delivered to us by <hi>Tradition,</hi> and ſo we have them from <hi>two hands</hi> as it were, or ways of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, and the reſt of the Scriptures but by <hi>one,</hi> for the moſt part.</p>
               <p>I will ſay yet more, becauſe it is true, and needful. If any live among Papiſts, that keep the Scripture from the people, or among the poor <hi>Greeks, Armenians</hi> or <hi>Abaſſines</hi> where
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55434:48"/>
the people neither have Bibles commonly, nor can read, or if any among us that cannot read, know not what is in the Bible; yea if through the fault of the Prieſt, any ſhould be kept from knowing that ever there was a Bible in the world: Yet if thoſe perſons by Tradition receive the <hi>baptiſmal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> the <hi>Creed, Lords Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Commandments as Gods Word,</hi> and <hi>truly believe,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> them, thoſe perſons ſhall be ſaved. For they have Chriſts promiſe for it. And the very Covenant itſelf is the Gift of Chriſt and Life to conſenters. Whereas he that knoweth all the Scripture can be ſaved only by <hi>conſenting</hi> to and performing this <hi>ſame Covenant.</hi> But having greater helps to <hi>underſtand</hi> it, and ſo to <hi>Believe</hi> it and <hi>Conſent,</hi> he hath a great advantage of them that have not the Scripture; And ſo the Scripture is an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mercy to the Church. And it is ſo far from being <hi>too little</hi> without the ſupplement of the <hi>Papiſts Traditions</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> as that the hundredth part of it as to the bulk of words, is not abſolutely it ſelf of neceſſity to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Yet I ſay more; If a man that hath the Scripture ſhould doubt of ſome Books of it, whether they be the <hi>Word of God</hi>) as of <hi>Ruth, Judges, Joſhua, Chronicles,</hi> &amp;c.) Yea if he doubted of all the Old Teſtament, and much of the New; yet if he believe ſo much as containeth all the Covenant of Grace, and the foreſaid Summaries, though he ſin, and loſe much of his helps, yet he may and will be ſaved, if he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely receive but this much. The reaſon is before given. Though no man can believe any thing truly who believeth not all that he knoweth to be Gods Word, yet a man may doubt whether one thing be Gods Word, who doubteth not of another, by ſeveral occaſions.</p>
               <p>And here you ſee the Reaſon why a particular or expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Belief of all the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf, was never required of all that are baptized, nor of all or any man that entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Miniſtry. For the wiſeſt Doctor in the world doth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55434:49"/>
not attain ſo high. For no man hath a particular explicite <hi>Belief</hi> of that which he doth not <hi>underſtand.</hi> For it is the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>ſence</hi> that we believe: and we muſt firſt know <hi>what that ſence is</hi> before we can <hi>believe</hi> it to be <hi>true.</hi> And no man in the World underſtandeth all the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Yea more, it is too <hi>much to</hi> require <hi>as neceſſary to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi> a ſubſcription in <hi>General that he implicitely believeth all that is in that Bible</hi> which <hi>you ſhall</hi> ſhew <hi>him.</hi> For 1. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faults may be in the Tranſlation, if it be a Tranſlation. 2. Many errors may be in the Copy, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Nay ſuch a ſubſcription ſhould not, as abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, be required of him as to all the real Word of God. For if the man by error ſhould doubt whether <hi>Job</hi> or the <hi>Chronicles</hi> or <hi>Eſther</hi> were Canonical, and none of the reſt, I would not be he that ſhould therefore forbid him to Preach Chriſts Goſpel. I am ſure the ancient Church im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed no ſuch terms on their Paſtors, when part of the new Teſtament was ſo long doubted of; and when ſome were choſen Biſhops before they were Baptized; and when <hi>Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> was choſen a Biſhop before he believed the Reſurrection. I would not have ſilenced <hi>Luther, Althamer</hi> or others that queſtioned the Epiſtle of <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then ſhall we ſay of the <hi>Roman</hi> inſolence, which thinketh not all the Scripture big enough, but Miniſters muſt alſo ſubſcribe to many additions of their own, yea and <hi>ſwear</hi> to <hi>Traditions</hi> and the <hi>Expoſitions</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and take whole Volumes of Councils for their Religion? No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if ſuch men do tear the Churches of Chriſt in pieces.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By this time I hope you ſee to what uſe Baptiſm and the Summaries of Religion are. 2. And of how great uſe Catechizing is. 3. And that Chriſtianity hath its <hi>eſſential</hi> parts. 4. And how <hi>plain</hi> and ſimple a thing true Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is which conſtituteth the Church of Chriſt; And how few things as to <hi>knowledge</hi> are neceſſary to make a man a Chriſtian, or to Salvation. Multitudes of opinions have
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55434:49"/>
been the means of turning Paſtors and People from the holy and diligent improvement of theſe few truths in our practice, where we have much to do which might take up all our minds and time.</p>

                  <p>Inference <hi>2.</hi> Of the uſe of Catechizing.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THough it be ſpoken to in what is ſaid, I would have you more diſtinctly here note the uſe of Catechizing. 1. It collecteth thoſe <hi>few things</hi> out of <hi>many,</hi> which the Ignorant could not themſelves collect. 2. It collecteth thoſe <hi>neceſſary things,</hi> which all muſt <hi>know</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> that will be ſaved. 3. It containeth thoſe <hi>Great</hi> practical things, which we have daily uſe for, and muſt ſtill live upon; which are as Bread and Drink for our food. Other things may be well added; the more the better, which God hath revealed. But our <hi>Life</hi> and our <hi>comfort</hi> and our <hi>Hope</hi> is in theſe. 4. And it giveth us the <hi>true method</hi> or <hi>order</hi> of holy truths: which is a great advantage to underſtand them. Not but that the <hi>things themſelves</hi> have the ſame <hi>orderly</hi> reſpect to one another in the Scripture, but they are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the ſame order of words.</p>
               <p>Therefore 1. Catechiſms ſhould be very skilfully and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made. The true fundamental Catechiſm is nothing elſe but the Baptiſmal Sacramental Covenant, the Creed, the Lords Prayer and the Commandments, the Summaries of our <hi>Belief, Deſires</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> And our ſecondary Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm muſt be nothing elſe, but the plain expoſitions of theſe: the firſt is a <hi>Divine Catechiſm</hi>: the ſecond is a <hi>Miniſterial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory Catechiſm.</hi> And here 1. O that Miniſters would be wiſer at laſt, than to put their ſuperfluities, their contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and private opinions into their Catechiſms? and would fit them to the true end, and not to the intereſt of their ſeveral ſects. But the <hi>Roman</hi>-Trent Catechiſm (and many more of theirs) muſt needs be defiled with their traſh, and every ſect elſe muſt put their ſingularities into their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſms;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55434:50"/>
ſo hard is it for the aged decrepit body of the diſeaſed Church (for want of a better concoction of the common eſſentials of Chriſtianity) to be free from theſe heaps of inconcocted crudities, and excrementitious ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, and the many maladies bred thereby.</p>
               <p>I deny not but a uſeful controverſie may be opened by way of <hi>Queſtion</hi> and <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But pretend it not then to be what it is not,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1.</note> Milk for Babes. Him that is weak in the Faith receive, but not to doubtful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations. The Servant of the Lord muſt be <hi>apt to teach,</hi> but muſt not ſtrive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it is not commonly believed, how great skill is needful to make a Catechiſm, that the method may be true, and that it may neither be too long for the memory, nor too ſhort for the underſtanding, for my part, it is the hardeſt work ſave one (which is the full methodizing and explaining the whole body of <hi>Divinity</hi>) that ever I put my hand to; And when all's done, I cannot ſatisfy my ſelf in it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Since this I have publiſhed a Book called the Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of <hi>Houſholds.</hi>
                  </note>II. Why is not Catechizing more uſed, both by <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Parents</hi>? I mean not the bare words unexplained without the ſence, nor the ſence in a meer rambling way without <hi>a form of words.</hi> But the <hi>words explained.</hi> O how much fruit would poor Souls and all the Church receive, by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful performance of this work, would God but cure the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs and ſloth of unfaithful Paſtors and Parents which ſhould do it. But I have ſaid ſo much of this in my <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Paſtor,</hi> that I may well forbear more here.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IT is the common out-cry of the World. <hi>How ſhall we know which ſide to be on? And who is in the right among ſo
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55434:50"/>
many who all with confidence pretend to be in the right?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Your Preſervative is obvious and eaſie: but men uſually beſtow more labour and coſt for Error and Hell, than for <hi>Truth and Heaven. Pretend not to Faith or knowledge before you have it,</hi> and you are the more ſafe. SUSPEND your judgments till you have true <hi>evidence</hi> to eſtabliſh them. 1. It is only <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that I am now inſtructing: and if you are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> you have already received the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity even the Baptiſmal Covenant, the Creed, the Lords Prayer and Decalogue. And I need not tell you that moreover you muſt receive all thoſe Truths in Nature, and Scripture which are ſo plain that all theſe diſſenting ſects of Chriſtians are agreed in them. And when you have <hi>all theſe,</hi> and faithfully love and <hi>practice</hi> them, you are ſure to be ſaved, if you do not afterward receive ſome contrary Doctrine which deſtroyeth them. Mark then which is the <hi>ſafe Religion.</hi> As ſure as the Goſpel is true, he that is meet for Baptiſm before God, is meet for pardon of ſin, and he that truely conſenteth to the Baptiſmal Covenant, and ſo doth dedicate himſelf to God, is made a Member of Chriſt, and is juſtified, and an Heir of Heaven. Your Church Catechiſm ſaith truly of all ſuch, that in Baptiſm each one is made, a <hi>Member of Chriſt, a Child of God, and an Heir of Heaven.</hi> So that as ſure as the Goſpel is true, every <hi>true Baptized Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> whoſe <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> doth anſwer that Faith, ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Ask all parties, and few of them but impudent deſigners can deny this. Well then, the <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>Creed, Lords Prayer</hi> and <hi>Commandments</hi> is your Chriſtian Religion. As a Chriſtian you may and ſhall be ſaved: that a True Chriſtian is ſaved all confeſs. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Papiſt</hi> be ſaved is queſtioned by the Proteſtants; and ſo is the Salvation of many other ſects by others. You are ſafe then if you take in nothing to endanger you. And is it not wiſdom then to take heed how you go further, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55434:51"/>
on what grounds, leſt you over-run your ſafe Religion.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But then I muſt not be a Proteſtant: For the Papiſts ſay that they cannot be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. A <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is either one that <hi>holdeth to the ancient ſimple Chriſtianity without</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> manifold additions:<note place="margin">☞</note> Or <hi>one that poſitively alſo renounceth and oppoſeth thoſe</hi> additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In the firſt ſenſe, a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and a <hi>meer Chriſtian</hi> is all one; and ſo to ſay that a Proteſtant cannot be ſaved is to ſay that a <hi>Chriſtian as ſuch</hi> cannot be ſaved. If it be the meer <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> that the Papiſt accounteth dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, tell him that you will not ſtick with him for the name: You are contented with the old name of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> in the ſecond ſenſe is not your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the Defenſative of your Religion; as flying from the Plague is not my Humanity or Life, but a means to preſerve it. And ſo Proteſtants are of many ſizes: Some oppoſe ſome points, and ſome others, ſome more, ſome leſs, which the Papiſts have brought in:<note place="margin">☞</note> And yet they are not of <hi>ſo many Religions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whoever condemneth you, if Chriſt ſave you, he doth but condemn himſelf as uncharitable. <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is certainly a State of Salvation; but whether <hi>Popery</hi> be, or whether the <hi>Greek</hi> Opinions be, or whether this or that difference and ſingularity ſtand with Salvation, is the doubt. Caſt not your ſelf then needleſly into doubt and danger.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But then you will have us be ſtill but Infants, and to learn no more than our Catechiſms, and not to learn and believe all that God hath revealed in his Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No ſuch matter. This is the ſum of what I adviſe you to.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hold faſt to your ſimple Chriſtianity as the Certain terms of Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Receive nothing that is againſt it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Learn as much more as ever you can.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:55434:51"/>4. But take not <hi>mens words,</hi> nor their plauſible talk for <hi>Certifying Evidence:</hi> And do not think if you <hi>believe</hi> a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> that this is <hi>believing God,</hi> nor if his Reaſons ſeem plauſible to you, and you are of his Opinion, that this is Divine <hi>Knowledge.</hi> If you do incline to one mans Opinion more than another, tell him that you incline to his Opinion, but tell him that you take not this for <hi>Divine Knowledge</hi> or any part of your <hi>Religion.</hi> If you will needs believe one ſide rather than another, about Church Hiſtory, or the matters of their Parties Intereſt, tell them, I believe you as fallible men; but this is none of my <hi>Divine Faith</hi> or <hi>Religion.</hi> To <hi>learn to know,</hi> is to <hi>learn Scientifical Evidence,</hi> and not to learn what is another mans Opinions; nor whether they are probable or not; much leſs to read a Councils Decrees, or the Propoſitions of a diſputing Syſteme, and then for the mens ſake, to ſay, <hi>This is Orthodox</hi>: Nor yet becauſe it hath a taking aſpect. To <hi>learn</hi> of a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to <hi>believe God</hi> is one thing; and to <hi>believe him,</hi> or his <hi>party, Church</hi> or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is another thing. Learn to <hi>know</hi> as much as you can; and eſpecially to <hi>know</hi> what God hath revealed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: And learn to believe God as much as you can: And believe all your Teachers and all other men, as far as they are credible in that caſe, with ſuch a humane belief as fallible men may juſtly require. And where Contenders do conſent, ſuſpect them the leſs. But where they give one another the Lie in matters of Fact, try both their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of credibility before you truſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then truſt them not beyond that Evidence.</p>
               <p>But ſtill difference your <hi>Divine Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> from your <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Faith. And let men ſollicite you never ſo long; take not on you to <hi>know</hi> or <hi>believe</hi> till you do; that is, not beyond the <hi>Evidence.</hi> I do but perſwade you againſt <hi>Preſumption</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſie.</hi> Shall I ſay, SUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEND TILL YOU HAVE TRUE EVIDENCE, and you are ſafe? why if you do not, you will <hi>know</hi> never the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55434:52"/>
more, nor have ever the more <hi>Divine Faith</hi>: For I can mean no more than SUSPEND YOUR PRESUMPTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS, and do not fooliſhly or hypocritically take on you to <hi>know</hi> what you do not, or to have a <hi>Faith</hi> which you have not. If you <hi>can know truly,</hi> do it with fidelity, and be true to the Truth, whoever offer it, or whatever it coſt you. But ſuſpend your Profeſſion or haſty Opinions and Conceits of what you know not.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But every ſide almoſt tells me that I am damned if I do not believe as they do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. By that you may ſee that they are all deceived at leaſt ſave one (which ever it be) while they differ, and yet condemn each other. 2. Thereby they do but give you the greater cauſe to ſuſpect them. For by this ſhall all men know Chriſts Diſciples, if they love one another. Right Chriſtians are not <hi>many Maſters,</hi> as <hi>knowing</hi> that <hi>themſelves ſhall have</hi> the greater <hi>condemnation elſe</hi>; for <hi>in many things we offend all.</hi> And the wiſdom which hath envy and ſtrife is not from above, but from beneath, and is earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh, introducing confuſion and every evil work, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.1, 15, 16. Chriſts Diſciples judge not, leſt they be judged.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this you may ſee that unleſs you can be of all mens minds, you muſt be damned by the Cenſures of many. And if you can bear it from all the Sects ſave one, why not from that one alſo?</p>
               <p n="4">4. But I pray you ask theſe damning Sectaries, <hi>Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving your Word, and being of your Opinion that will ſave me?</hi> Or muſt I alſo <hi>know by ſcientifical Evidence that you ſay true, and that God himſelf hath ſaid what you ſay?</hi> If he ſay that <hi>believing</hi> him and his party (though he call it the Church) is enough to ſave you, you have then leſs reaſon to believe him: For unleſs he can undertake himſelf to ſave you, he cannot undertake that believing him ſhall ſave you? If he ſay, <hi>God hath promiſed to ſave you if you believe me,</hi> believe that when he hath proved it to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:55434:52"/>But if it be <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Faith which he ſaith muſt ſave you, it is not your believing his Word or Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that will help you to that. I would tell ſuch a man, <hi>Help me to Knowledge and Faith, by Cogent or Certifying Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and I will learn, and thank you with all my Heart.</hi> But till I have it, it is but mocking my ſelf and you to ſay that I have it.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But the Papiſts herein differ from all other Sects: For they will ſay, That if I believe the Church concerning Divine Revelations, and take all for Divine Revelation which the Church ſaith is ſo, and ſo believe it, then I have a Divine Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. And is this to you a <hi>Certifying Evidence</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God revealed it, becauſe their Church ſaith ſo? If their Church agree with <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Syrians, Copties, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſines,</hi> Proteſtants, and all other Chriſtian Churches, then it will be no part of the conteſt in queſtion; and it is a ſtronger Foundation of the two, to believe it, becauſe <hi>all ſay it,</hi> than becauſe <hi>they ſay it.</hi> But if they differ from the reſt, know their proof that <hi>their Church</hi> can tell Gods mind, and not the reſt of the Chriſtian World. And that about a third part of the Chriſtians in the World have ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which all the reſt have not. 2. And <hi>how doth their Church know</hi> that it is <hi>Gods Word?</hi> Is it by any <hi>certifying E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> or by Prophetical Inſpiration? If by <hi>Evidence,</hi> let it be produced? Is it not revealed to others as well as to them? Muſt not we have a Faith of the ſame kind as the Church hath? If ſo, we muſt believe by the ſame Evidence as that Church believeth. And what is that? It is not their own words: Doth a Pope believe himſelf only? or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil believe themſelves only? Or hath God ſaid, <hi>You ſhall be ſaved if you will believe your ſelves, and believe that I have ſaid all that you ſay I have ſaid?</hi> Where is there ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? But if Pope and Council be not ſaved for <hi>believing themſelves,</hi> how ſhall I know that I ſhall be ſaved for <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55434:53"/>
them,</hi> and that <hi>one kind</hi> of Faith ſaveth <hi>me,</hi> and <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ask it of each particular Biſhop in that Council, Is he ſaved for believing himſelf or the reſt? If no man be ſaved for believing himſelf, why ſhould another be ſaved for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving him? And the Faith of the Council is but the Faith of the Individual Members ſet together.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But they are ſaved for believing themſelves as conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and not ſingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> All Conſenters know nothing, as Conſenters, but what they know as Individuals. And what is the Evidence by which they know, and are brought to conſent? Muſt not that Evidence convince us alſo?</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But the preſent Church are ſaved for believing not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but the former Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Then ſo muſt we: It is not the preſent Church then that I muſt believe by a ſaving Faith: But why then was the laſt Age ſaved, and ſo the former? and ſo on to the firſt? Is any thing more evident than that all men muſt be ſaved for Believing God? And that his Word muſt be known to be his Word, by the ſame Evidence by one man and another? And that Evidence I have proved in ſeveral Treatiſes to be another kind of thing, than the Decree of a Pope and his Council.</p>
               <p>But if it be not <hi>Evidence,</hi> but Prophetical Inſpiration and Revelation by which the Council or Church knoweth Gods Word, I will believe them when by Miracles or otherwiſe they prove themſelves to be true Prophets; till then, I ſhall take them for Phanaticks, and hear them as I do the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
               <p>Should I here ſtay to bid you ask them, as before, How you ſhall be ſure that their Council was truly General, and more Authentick and Infallible than the ſecond at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> or that at <hi>Ariminum,</hi> or that at <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> &amp;c. And whether the more General Diſſent of all the other
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55434:53"/>
Chriſtians from them be not of as great Authority as they that are the ſmaller part? and how you ſhall be ſure of that? And alſo how but on the word of a Prieſt you can know all that the Church hath determined? with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance ſuch Queſtions, of the Meaning of each Council, the ambiguity of words, the Errour of Printers, the forgery of Publiſhers, &amp;c. I ſhould help you to ſee, that ſaying as a Prieſt ſaith, Is not <hi>Knowing the thing,</hi> nor <hi>Believing God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stop</hi> therefore till you have <hi>Evidence:</hi> Follow no Party as a Party in the dark: Or if probability incline you more to them than to others, call not this <hi>Certainty, Religion, Divine Faith.</hi> Thus your <hi>Faith</hi> will be <hi>Faith indeed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fathering Errours on God, and ſaying that he ſaith what he never ſaid, and forbade or commanded what he doth not, is the moſt direct breach of the third Commandment. To father lies on God, is the taking of his Name in vain.</note> and you will eſcape all that would corrupt and fruſtrate it. The buſineſs is great. God requireth you to refuſe no Light: But withal he chargeth you to believe no falſhood, nor put darkneſs for light: Much leſs to father mens Lies, or Errours, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits on God, and to lay your Salvation on it, that they are all God's Word. How dreadful a thing is this if it prove falſe! Is it not blaſpheming God?</p>
               <p>No man in his wits then but a partial deſigner can look that you ſhould make haſte, or go any further than you have aſſuring or convincing Evidence: If you <hi>Know</hi> that any Sect doth <hi>Err,</hi> you need no Preſervative: If you do not, tell them, <hi>I am ignorant of this matter, I will learn as faſt as I can</hi>; not neglecting greater matters; and I will be neither for you, nor againſt you, further than I can know.</p>
               <p>And as to the former Objection, of being <hi>ſtill Infants,</hi> I further anſwer, that as feigned knowledge is no knowledge; ſo Manhood conſiſteth not in being of many uncertain Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, no not ſo much in <hi>knowing</hi> many little controverted things, as in getting a <hi>clearer, more affecting powerful practical Knowledge</hi> and belief of our Chriſtianity, and the great and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55434:54"/>
ſure things which we know already; and in Love and Obedience practiſing of them. He is the ſtrongeſt Chriſtian who loveth God beſt, and hath moſt Holineſs; and he knoweth God better than any others do.</p>
               <p>By this much you may ſee that the world is full of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi>; even fancy and <hi>belief of men,</hi> and their own <hi>Opinions,</hi> which go under theſe names. One turneth an Anabaptiſt, and another a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and another an Antinomian, and another a Pelagian, and another a Papiſt, when if you try them you ſhall find that they neither underſtand what they turn to, nor what they are againſt: They do but turn to his ſide who hath the beſt advantage to perſwade them, either by inſinuating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their affections, or by plauſible reaſonings; they talk for one Doctrine, and againſt another, when they underſtand neither; much leſs diſcern true Evidence of their truth. And as for the Papiſts, what wonder is it, when their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is to believe as the Church believeth? And what the Church believeth, they know not perhaps but by believing a Prieſt: And then though they know not <hi>what the Church believeth,</hi> ſome ſay they are Catholicks, and others that this Implicite Faith is that in the virtue of which all the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite muſt proceed. And if God may but be allowed to be equal herein with their Church, and ſo that all ſhould be ſaved who Implicitely believe that <hi>all that he ſaith is true,</hi> though they know not what he ſaith at all, then I think few Infidels would periſh, that believe there is a God.</p>
               <p>Reader I adviſe thee therefore as thou loveſt thy Soul, 1. Not to neglect or delay any <hi>true knowledge</hi> that thou canſt attain. 2. But not to be raſh and haſty in judging. 3. Nor to take <hi>ſhews</hi> and <hi>mens opinions,</hi> or any thing below a certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying or <hi>notifying Evidence</hi> of Truth, to make up thy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Knowledge.</hi> 4. And till thou ſee ſuch <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Evidence,</hi> ſuſpend, and tell them that ſollicite thee that thou underſtandeſt not the matter, and that thou art

neither for them nor againſt them; but wilt yield as ſoon as Truth doth certainly appear to thee.</p>
               <p>If an Anabaptiſt perſwade thee, yield to him as ſoon as thou art <hi>ſure</hi> that God would not have Believers Children now to be <hi>Infant-Members</hi> of his Church, as well as they were before Chriſts coming; and that the <hi>Infants</hi> of <hi>believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jews</hi> were cut off from their Church State; and that there is any way beſides Baptiſm appointed by Chriſt, for the ſolemn initiating of Church-Members with the reſt which in my Treat. of Baptiſm I have produced.</p>
               <p>If thou art ſollicited to renounce Communion with other Churches of Chriſt as unlawful, either becauſe they uſe the Common Prayer and Ceremonies, or becauſe that Miniſters are faulty (if tolerable) or the People undiſciplined, before thou venture thy Soul upon an uncharitable and dividing principle, make ſure firſt that Chriſt hath Commanded it. Try whether thou art ſure that Chriſt ſinned by Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating ordinarily with the Jewiſh Church and Synagogues, when the corruption of Prieſts, People and worſhip was ſo much worſe than ours? Or whether that be now a ſin to us, which (in the General) Chriſt did then.

As if the diſſenters in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>We thought beforehand the contrary had been true; But now</hi> the <hi>Italian Biſhops being ſo numerous as to over-vote us, we will lay our own and all mens Salvation on it, that we were deceived, though we have no other reaſon to think ſo.</hi> O noble <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi>! It's poſſible <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> poor ſilly Prelates may turn the Scales and make up a majority, though as Learned men as <hi>Janſenius, Cuſanus</hi> or <hi>Gerſon</hi> were on the other ſide.

From that day to this, we muſt renounce ſenſe, and yet believe; we muſt believe that by conſtant Miracles all <hi>Chriſtians ſenſes</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: And ſo that this is the difference between Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Infidels, and Heathens, that our Religion deceiveth all mens ſenſes (even Heathens and all, if they ſee our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,) and their Religion deceiveth no mans ſenſes, ſaith the grave Author of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Trent Council (Ed.

I ſee in them a true Conformity to Chriſt, and a grand difference between them and the furious fiery pretenders to more wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; And the two ſorts of <hi>Wiſemen</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> excellently deſcribed by <hi>James, Chap.</hi> 3. I have ſeen in two ſorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious people among us, moſt lively exemplified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55434:59"/>
our Eyes. God hath a people that truly honour him in the world.</p>
               <p>But O that they were more! And O that they were more perfect! Alas what a number are there that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?</p>
               <p>Even among Divines this Plague is moſt pernicious, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of moſt publick influence. Take him that never had a natural acuteneſs of wit, nor is capable of judging of difficult points, if he be but of long ſtanding and grey hairs, and can preach well to the people, and have ſtudied long, he is not only confident of his fitneſs to judge of that which he never underſtood,<note place="margin">Yea now it is alſo young ignorant Novices that are ſick of the ſame feaveriſh temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> but his Reputation of wiſdom muſt be kept up among the people by his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious talking againſt what he underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not: Yea if he be one that never mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated his fleſh with the difficult and long ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the matter, without which hard points will never be well digeſted and diſtinctly underſtood, yet if he be a Doctor, and have lived long in a reputation for wiſdom, his Ignorant flaſhy Conjectures, and haſty ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial apprehenſions, muſt needs go for the more excellent Knowledge: And if you put him to make good any of his Contradictions to the truth, his Magiſterial contempt, or his uncivil wrath and unmannerly interruptions of you in your talk muſt go for reaſon: And if he cannot reſiſt the ſtrength of your evidence, he cannot bear the hearing of it, but like a ſcold rather than a Scholar, taketh your words out of your mouth before you come to the end: As if he ſaid, <hi>Hold your tongue and hear me who am wiſer: I came to Teach, and not to Hear.</hi> If you tell him how uncivil it is not patiently to hear you to the end, he thinks you wrong him, and are too bold to pretend to a liberty to ſpeak without interruption; Or he will tell you that you <hi>are too long; he cannot remember all at once.</hi> If you reply that the ſenſe of the forepart of a Speech uſually depends much on the latter part;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55434:60"/>
and he cannot have your ſence till he have all; and that he muſt not anſwer, before he underſtandeth you; and that if his memory fail he ſhould take notes, and that to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted turns of ſpeaking is neceſſary in the order of all ſober conferences, without which they will be but noiſe and ſtrife; he will let you know that he came not to hear or keep any Laws of Order or Civility, but to have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with you for the reputation of wiſdom or Orthodoxneſs And what he wants in Reaſon and Evidence, he will make up in ignorant Confidence and Reviling, and call you by ſome ill <hi>Name</hi> or other, that ſhall go for a Confutation.</p>
               <p>But yet this is not the uſual way: It is too great a hazard to the reputation of their wiſdom to caſt it on a diſpute. The common way is never to ſpeak to the Perſon himſelf, but if any one croſs their conceits, or become the object of their envy, they backbite him among thoſe that reverence their wiſdom, and when they are ſure that he is far enough out of hearing, they tell their credulous Followers, O ſuch a man holdeth unſound or dangerous Opinions! Take heed how you hear him, or read his writings, [this or that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie they ſavour of:] when the poor man knoweth not what he talketh of. And if any one have the wit to ſay to him, <hi>[Sir, he is neither ſo ſottiſh, nor ſo proud, as to be uncapable of inſtruction; if you are ſo much wiſer than he, why do you not teach him?]</hi> He will excuſe his <hi>omiſſion</hi> and his <hi>commiſſion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a further calumny, and ſay, <hi>Theſe erroneous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will hear no reaſon: It is in vain.</hi> If he be asked [<hi>Sir, did you ever try</hi>?] it's like he muſt confeſs that he did not; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome magiſterial rebuke once went for Evidence of truth. If the hearers (which is rare) have ſo much Chriſtian wit and honeſty, as to ſay, <hi>[Sir, Miniſters above all men muſt be no back-biters, nor unjuſt: you know it is unlawful for us to judge another man, till we hear him ſpeak for himſelf: If you would have us know whether he or you be in the right, let us hear you both together:]</hi> His anſwer would be like Cardinal <hi>Turnon</hi> at
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55434:60"/>
the conference at <hi>Poiſie,</hi> and as the Papiſts ordinarily is, [<hi>It is dangerous letting Hereticks ſpeak to the People, and it agreeth not with our zeal for God to hear ſuch odious things uttered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, There are more that have the Spirit of a Pope in the World than one, even among them that cry out againſt Popery; and that would fain be taken for the Dictators of the World, whom none muſt diſſent from, much leſs contradict. And there are more Idolaters than Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who would have their Ignorant underſtandings to be inſtead of God, the uncontrolled director of all about them.</p>
               <p>But if theſe men have not any confidence in their ſelf-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, if they can but embody in a ſociety of their minds, or gather into a Synod, he muſt needs go for a proud and arrogant Schiſmatick at leaſt, that will ſet any Reaſon and Evidence of Truth, againſt their Magiſterial Ignorance, when it is the Major Vote.</p>
               <p>The very Truth is, <hi>The great Benefactor</hi> of the World hath not been pleaſed to diſpenſe his <hi>Benefits Equally,</hi> but with marvellous diſparity: As he is the God of Nature, he hath been pleaſed to give a natural capacity for judiciouſneſs and acuteneſs in difficult ſpeculations but to few. And as he is the Lord of all, he hath not given men equal educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, nor advantages for ſuch extraordinary knowledge: Nor have all that have leiſure and capacity, ſelf denyal and patience enough for ſo long and difficult ſtudies: But the Devil and our ſelves have given to all men <hi>Pride</hi> enough to deſire to be thought to be wiſer and better than we are: And he that cannot be <hi>equal</hi> with the wiſeſt and beſt would be thought to be ſo: And while all men muſt needs <hi>ſeem</hi> wiſe, while few are ſo indeed, you may eaſily ſee what muſt thence follow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it is not Divines only, but all ranks of people, who are ſick of this diſeaſe. The moſt unlearned ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the ſillieſt Women, if they will not for ſhame ſay
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55434:61"/>
that they are wiſer than their Teachers in the general, yet when it cometh to particular caſes, they take themſelves to be always in the right; and O how confident are they of it! And who more peremptory and bold in their judgments than thoſe that leaſt know what they ſay? It is hard to meet with a perſon above eighteen or twenty years of age, that is not notably tainted with this malady.</p>
               <p>And it is not only theſe great miſchiefs in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which ſpring from <hi>ſelf-conceitedneſs,</hi> but even in our <hi>common converſe,</hi> it is the cauſe of diſorder, ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: For it is the common vice of blinded nature, and it is rare to meet with one that is not notably guilty of it: When they are paſt the ſtate of profeſſed Learners.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ordinary for <hi>ſelf-conceited</hi> Perſons to ruine their own <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and <hi>Healths,</hi> and <hi>Lives.</hi> When they are raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly making ill Bargains, or undertaking things which they underſtand not, they ruſh on till they find their error too late, and their Poverty, Priſons or ruined Families, muſt declare their ſin. For they have not humility enough to ſeek Counſel in time, nor to take it when it is offered them. What great numbers have I heard begging relief from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, under the confeſſion of this ſin?</p>
               <p>And far more, even the moſt of Men and Women, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their Health, and loſe their Lives by it. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth not ſuffice to teach them, what is hurtful to their Bodies; and as they <hi>know not,</hi> ſo you cannot convince them that they know not. Moſt Perſons by the <hi>exceſs in quantity of food,</hi> do ſuffocate Nature, and lay the Foundation of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Maladies. And moſt of the Diſeaſes that kill men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely are but the effects of former Gluttony or Exceſs. But as long as they feel not any preſent hurt, no man can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them but their fulneſs is for their Health, as well as for their Pleaſure. They will laugh perhaps at thoſe that tell them what they do, and what Diſeaſes they are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for: Let Phyſicians (if they be ſo honeſt) tell them,
<q>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:55434:61"/>[It is the perfection of the nutritive Juices, the Blood and nervous Oyl, which are the cauſes of Health in man: Perfect Concoction cauſeth that perfection: Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perfectly concoct too much, or that which is of too hard digeſtion: While you feel no harm, your Blood groweth diſ-ſpirited, and being but half concocted, and half Blood, doth perform its Office accordingly by the halves; till crudities are heaped up, and obſtructions fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a Dunghil of Excrements, or the diſ-ſpirited hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are ready to take in any Diſeaſe, which a ſmall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offereth; either Agues, Feavers, Coughs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, Pleuriſies, Dropſies, Colicks and Windineſs, Head-achs, Convulſions, &amp;c. or till the Inflammations or other Tumors of the inward Parts, or the torment of the Stone in Reins or Bladder, do ſharply tell men what they have been doing. A clean Body and perfect Concoction, which are procured by Temperance and bodily Labours, which ſuſcitate the Spirits, and purifie the Blood, are the proper means which God in the courſe of nature hath appointed, for a long and healthful Life.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is all true, and the reaſon is evident, and yet this talk will be but deſpiſed and derided by the moſt; and they will ſay,
<q>[I have ſo long eaten what I loved, and lived by no ſuch rules as theſe, and I have found no harm by it.]</q>
Yea if Exceſs have brought Diſeaſes on them, if Abſtinence do but make them more to <hi>feel</hi> them; they will rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their illneſs to the Remedy, than to the proper cauſe. And ſo they do about the quality as well as the quantity: Self-conceitedneſs maketh men uncureable. Many a one have I known that daily lived in that fulneſs which I ſaw would ſhortly quench the Vital Spirits; and fain I would have ſaved their Lives; but I was not able to make them willing: Had I ſeen another aſſault them, I could have done ſomewhat for them, but when I foreſaw their death, I could not ſave them from themſelves. They ſtill ſaid, they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55434:62"/>
found their meaſures of eating and drinking (between Meals) refreſh them, and they were the worſe, if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore it, and they would not believe me againſt both Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, Reaſon and Experience: And thus have I ſeen abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of my acquaintance wilfully haſten to the Grave: And all long of an unhumbled, ſelf-conceited underſtanding, which would not be brought to ſuſpect it ſelf, and know its error.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And O how often have I ſeen the deareſt Friends thus kill their Friends; even Mothers kill their deareſt Children, and too oft their Husbands, Kindred, Servants and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by their <hi>ſelf-conceit</hi> and confidence in their ignorance and error? Alas what abundance empty their own Houſes, gratifie covetous Landlords, that ſet their Lands by Lives, and bring their deareſt Relations to untimely ends, and a wiſe man knoweth not how to hinder them! How oft and oft have I heard ignorant Women confidently perſwade e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their own Children to eat as long as they have an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and ſo they have vitiated their Blood and Humours in their Childhood, that their Lives have been either ſoon ended, or ever after miſerable by Diſeaſes! How oft have I heard them perſwade ſick or weak diſeaſed Perſons, to eat, eat, eat, and take what they have a mind to, when unleſs they would Poyſon them, or cut their Throats, they could ſcarce more certainly diſpatch them? How oft have theſe good Women been perſwading my ſelf, that eating and drinking more would make me better, and that it is Abſtinence that cauſeth all my illneſs, (when Exceſs in my Childhood cauſed it;) as if every wiſe Woman that doth but know me, knew better what is good for me, than my ſelf after threeſcore years experience, or than all the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians in the City? And had I obeyed them, how many years ago had I been dead?</p>
               <p>How ordinary is it for ſuch ſelf-conceited Women to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude their skill and Medicines on their ſick Neighbours,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55434:62"/>
with the greateſt confidence, when they know not what they do? yea upon their Husbands and their Children? One can ſcarce come about ſick Perſons, but one Woman or other is perſwading them to take that, or do that which is like to kill them: Many and many when they have brought their Children to the Grave, have nothing to ſay but <hi>[I thought this or that had been beſt for them.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you'l ſay, <hi>[They do it in love; they meant no harm.]</hi> I anſwer, ſo falſe Teachers deceive Souls in Love. But are you content your ſelves to be kill'd by Love? If I muſt be kill'd, I had rather an Enemy did it than a Friend, I would not have ſuch have the guilt or grief. Love will not ſave mens lives if you give them that which tends to kill them.</p>
               <p>But you'l ſay, <hi>[We can be no wiſer than we are: If we do the beſt we can, what can we do more?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, <hi>I would have you not think your ſelves wiſer than you are:</hi> I would write over this word five hundred times if that would cure you. About matters of <hi>Diet and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,</hi> and Health, this is it that I would have you do to ſave you from killing your ſelves and your Relations. 1. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to know upon the report of ſuch as your ſelves, or in matters that are difficult and beyond your skill; or where you have not had <hi>long conſideration</hi> and <hi>experience.</hi> Meddle with no Medicining, but what in common eaſy caſes the common judgment of Phyſicians and common Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have taught you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you have not Money to pay Phyſicians and Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, tell them ſo, and deſire them to give you their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel freely, and take not on you to know more than they that have ſtudied and practiſed it all their (riper part of their) lives.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suſpect your underſtandings, and conſider how much there may be unknown to you, in the ſecreſie and variety of Diſeaſes, difference of temperatures, and the like, which

may make that hurtful which you conceit is good. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do nothing raſhly and in ſelf-conceited confidence, but upon the beſt advice ask the Phyſician whether your Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines and Rules are ſafe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And be ſure that you do rather too little than too much: What abundance are there, eſpecially in the <hi>ſmall Pox</hi> and <hi>Feavers,</hi> that would have ſcaped, if Women (yea and Phyſicians) would have let them alone, that die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Nature had not leave to cure them, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by miſtaken Uſages or Medicines. Diſeaſes are ſo various and ſecret, and Remedies ſo uncertain, that the wiſeſt man alive that hath ſtudied and practiſed it almoſt all his riper days (were it an hundred years) muſt confeſs that Phyſick is a hard, a dark, uncertain work, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſes (much more extraordinary) have ſomewhat in them which doth ſurpaſs his skill: And how then come ſo many Medicining Women to know more than they?</p>
               <p>But you'l ſay, <hi>[We ſee that many miſcarry by Phyſicians, and they ſpeed worſt that uſe them moſt.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer. But would they not yet ſpeed worſe if they uſed <hi>you</hi> as <hi>much</hi>? If <hi>they</hi> are too ignorant, how <hi>come you</hi> to be wiſer? If you are, teach them your Skill.</p>
               <p>But I muſt add, that even Phyſicians guilt of the <hi>ſin</hi> which I am reproving doth coſt many a hundred perſons their lives, as well as yours. Even too many Phyſicians who have need of many daies enquiry and obſervations truly to diſcover a diſeaſe, do kill men by raſh and haſty judging (I talk not of the Cheating ſort that take on them to know all by the Urine alone, but of honeſter and wiſer men.) It is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that old <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith, that a Phyſitian is not able faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to do his Office, for very many Patients: A few will take up all his time. But they that gape moſt after money, muſt venture upon a ſhort ſight, and a few words, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reſolve before they know, and write down their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections while they are ignorant of one half, which if they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55434:64"/>
knew, would change their Counſels! And ſuch is mans body and its diſeaſes, that the overſight or ignorance of one thing among twenty is like enough to be the patients death. And how wiſe, expedient and vigilant muſt he be that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no ſuch killing overſight?</p>
               <p>And as too many medicine a man whom they know not, and an unknown diſeaſe, for want of juſt deliberation; ſo too many venture upon uncertain and untryed medicines, or raſhly give that to one in another caſe, which hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited others. In a word, even raſh Phyſicians have cauſe to fear leſt by prefidence and haſty judging, more ſhould die by their miſtakes than do by murderers, that I ſay not by Souldiers in the world: And leſt their deareſt friends ſhould ſpeed worſe by them, than by their greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For as Seamen and Souldiers do boldly follow the trade, when they find that in ſeveral Voyages and Battels they have eſcaped; but yet moſt or very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them are drowned or killed at the laſt; So he that is tampering over-much with medicines, may ſcape well and boaſt of the Succeſs a while: But at laſt one blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, one Vomit, one Purge or other medicine may miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by a ſmall miſtake or accident, and he is gone. And there are ſome perſons ſo <hi>Civil,</hi> that if a raſh or unexperienced Phyſician be their <hi>Kinſman, Friend,</hi> or <hi>Neighbour,</hi> they will not go to an abler man, leſt they be accounted unfriendly, and diſoblige him; And if ſuch ſcape long with their lives, they may thank Gods mercy and not their own wiſdom. Souldiers kill enemies, and unskilful raſh Phyſicians kill their friends.</p>
               <p>But you'l ſay; <hi>They do their beſt, and they can do no more.</hi> I anſwer as before, 1. Let them not think that they know what they do not know; but ſufficiently ſuſpect their own underſtandings. 2. Let them not go beyond their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: How little of our kind of Phyſick did the old Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians (<hi>Hypocrates, Galius, Celſus,</hi> &amp;c.) give? Do not <hi>too
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55434:65"/>
much.</hi> 3. Venture not raſhly without full ſearch, delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Counſel and Experience. O how many die by <hi>haſty judging,</hi> and raſh miſtakes! Phyſicians muſt pardon my free ſpeaking or endure it: for I conceive it neceſſary: It hath not been the leaſt part of the Calamity of my Life to ſee my Friends and other worthy perſons killed by the <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Haſtineſs</hi> of Phyſicians: I greatly reverence and honour thoſe <hi>few</hi> that are men. 1. Of clear ſearching judicious heads, 2. Of great reading, eſpecially of other mens Experiences, 3. Of great and long Experience of their own, 4. Of preſent Sagacity and ready memory to <hi>uſe their</hi> own experiments, 5. Of Conſcience and cautelouſneſs to ſuſpect and know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haſtily Judge and Practice. I would I could ſay that ſuch are not too few. But I muſt ſay to the people, as you love your lives take heed of all the reſt: A high-way Robber you may avoid or reſiſt with greater probability of ſafety, than ſuch men: How few are they that are kill'd by Thieves or in Duels, in compariſon of thoſe that are kill'd by Phyſicians, eſpecially confident young men that account themſelves wits, and think they have hit on ſuch Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical principles as will better ſecure both their <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> than old Phyſicians Doctrine and Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could do? Confident young men of unhumbled under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings preſently truſt their undigeſted thoughts, and raſhly uſe their poor ſhort experiments, and truſt to their new conceptions of the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of all <hi>Operations</hi>; and then they take all others for meer Empyricks in compariſon of them: And when all is done, their pretended <hi>Reaſon</hi> for want of full <hi>Experience</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> to improve it, doth but enable them to talk and boaſt, and not to heal; and when they have kill'd men, they can juſtify it, and prove that they did it Rationally, or rather that it was ſomething elſe, and not their error that was the cauſe. They are <hi>wits</hi> and men of <hi>rare inventions,</hi> and therefore are not ſuch fools as to confeſs the Fact. How oft have I ſeen men of great worth,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55434:65"/>
ſuch as few in an age ariſe too who having a high eſteem of an injudicious unexperienced Phyſician, have ſealed their erroneous kindneſs with their blood? How oft have I ſeen worthy perſons deſtroyed by a pernicious medicine clear contrary to what the nature of the diſeaſe required, who without a Phyſician might have done well? Such ſorrows juſt now upon me make me the more plain and copious in the Caſe. And yet alas I ſee no hope of amendment proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! For, 1. Many hundred Miniſters being forbidden to Preach the Goſpel and caſt out of all their livelyhood, for not Promiſing, Aſſerting, Swearing and doing all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, many of theſe think that neceſſity alloweth them to turn Phyſicians, which they venture on upon ſeven years ſtudy when Seven, and Seven, and Seven, is not enough, though advantaged by the help of other mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments. 2. And others ruſh on Practice in their youth, partly becauſe they have not yet knowledge enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern uncertainties and difficulties in the Art, or to ſee what is further neceſſary to be known. And partly, becauſe they think that ſeeing Skill muſt be got by experience, uſe muſt help them to that experience, and all men muſt have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. 3. And when they do their beſt, they ſay, God requireth no more. 4. And they hope if they kill one, they cure many.</p>
               <p>But O that they had the Sobriety to conſider, 1. That the Phyſician is but <hi>One man</hi>; And will his maintenance or livelyhood excuſe him for killing many? 2. That even <hi>one mans Life</hi> is more precious than one mans <hi>maintenance,</hi> or fuller ſupply: Is it not honeſter to beg your bread? 3. That killing men by virtue of your trade without danger to you doth but hinder your Repentance, but not ſo much exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate your ſin as many think: Which is aggravated in that you kill your friends that truſt you, and not Enemies that oppoſe you or avoid you. 4. Your experience muſt not be got by killing men, but by accompanying experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced

               <p>And whereas they ſay that they <hi>Cure more than they Kill</hi>; I wiſh that I had reaſon to believe them: I ſuppoſe that if more of their patients did not live than die, they would ſoon loſe their practice: But it's like the far greateſt part of thoſe that live, would have lived without them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been ſooner and eaſier cured, if nature had not by them been diſturbed.</p>

               <p>How ordinarily in the world are the excellenteſt men on Earth, for Wiſdom and Holineſs (ſuch as <hi>Ignatius, Cyprian,</hi> and the reſt of the Antient Martyrs; and ſuch as <hi>Athanaſius, Chryſoſtom, &amp;c.</hi>) reviled, and uſed as if they were the baſeſt Rogues on Earth, laid in Jails, baniſhed, ſilenced, murdered, and all this by men that know not what they are, and have no true underſtanding of their cauſe? Men of whom the world <hi>was not worthy,</hi> wandred up and down, in Dens, and Caves, and ſuffered joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, yea and death it ſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. from men that <hi>Judged</hi> before they knew? Many a Great Man and Judge that hath condemned Chriſt's Miniſters as Hereticks, falſe Teachers, unworthy to preach the Goſpel, have been ſuch as underſtand not their Baptiſm, Creed or Catechiſm, and have need of many years teaching to make them know tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but thoſe Principles that every Child ſhould know. There needs no great learning, wiſdom, ſobriety or honeſty to teach them to cry out, [<hi>You are a Rogue, a Seducer, a Heretick, a Schiſmatick, diſobedient, ſeditious</hi>; or, <hi>Away with ſuch a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from the Earth; it is not fit that he ſhould live, Act.</hi> 22.22. and 21.26.

               <p>I know that ignorance and weakneſs of Judgment is the common calamity of mankind, and there is no hope of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us by unity in high degrees of knowledge. And though Teachers are, and muſt be a great ſtay to ignorant Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; yet alas! how can they tell which are the wiſeſt Teachers, and whom to chuſe? When all pretend to Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and no man can judge of that which he neither <hi>hath</hi> nor <hi>knoweth</hi>; and even the Roman Sect who pretend moſt to Infallibility, have ſo exceeded all men in their Errour, as to make it a part of Religion, neceſſary to our poſſeſſions, communion, dominion, and ſalvation, to maintain the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of God's Natural Revelations to the ſenſes of all ſound men in the world. How ſhall one that would learn Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy know in this Age, what Sect to follow, or what Guide to chuſe? Hence is our Calamity, and the Remedy will be but imperfect till the time of perfection come.</p>
               <p>But yet we are not remedileſs 1,. If men would but well lay in, hold faſt, love, and faithfully improve the few neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eſſential Principles. 2.

If they will carry themſelves as humble Learners to thoſe whoſe wiſdom is conſpicuous by its proper light, eſpecially the concordant Paſtors of the Churches. 5. And if they will not quarrel with Truth for every difficulty which they underſtand not, but humbly, as Learners, ſuſpect their own wit, till their Teachers have helpt them in a leiſurely and faithful tryal; by ſuch means the miſchief of Errour and Raſhneſs might be much avoided.</p>

If they that never uſed a Trade, ſhould preſently take themſelves to be as wiſe as the longeſt practicers, who would be Apprentices? And if an unskilful Muſician, Painter, Poet, or other ſuch like, ſhall be confident that he is as good at his work as any, ſtanders by will not eaſily cheriſh his folly, as being not blinded by his ſelf-love. A good workman ſhall have moſt praiſe and practice. Buyers will convince the ignorant boaſters by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking ſuch mens ſhops: As it is with ſelf-conceited igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Writers, who are reſtrained by the people, who will not buy and read their Books. And uſually Good and Bad Judges, Magiſtrates, Lawyers, Souldiers, Pilots, Artificers, are diſcerned by moſt that are capable of judging; becauſe, 1. Theſe are matters where the common ſenſe and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of mankind doth render them ſomewhat capable of judging, and ſave them from deceit. 2. And here is not uſually ſuch deep and long Plots and endeavours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as in matters of Speculation, and ſpecially Religion and Policy there is. 3. And the Devil is not ſo concerned and induſtrious to deceive men in matters of ſo low impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. 4. And if one be deceived, many are ready to rectifie him. 5. And Mens Intereſt here is better underſtood in bodily matters, and they are not ſo <hi>willing</hi> to be deceived. A poor man can eaſily diſcern between a charitable man, and an uncharitable; between a merciful and an oppreſſing Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord: We diſcern between diligent and ſlothful Servants; but in matters that are above our reach, which we muſt take on truſt, and know not whom to truſt, the difficulty is greater: Where the Errour and Haſte of either party will breed miſchief, but much more of both: If the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,</hi> or other <hi>Undertaker</hi> be <hi>Confident</hi> in his Errour, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55434:68"/>
precipitant, he will impoſe ruine on mens health, as I have ſaid: And if the <hi>Patient</hi> be <hi>ſelf-conceited and raſh</hi> in his choice, he is like to ſuffer for it: But when both Phyſician and Patient are ſo, what hope of eſcape? And eſpecially when through the great imperfection of mans underſtanding, not one of a multitude is clear and skilful in things that are beyond the reach of ſenſe: And if <hi>one man,</hi> after great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, come to be wiſer than the reſt, the hearer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not, and he muſt caſt out his <hi>Notions</hi> among as many aſſailing Warriours, as there are ignorant ſelf-conceited hearers preſent (and that is uſually as there are perſons:) And when every one hath poured out his confidence againſt it, and perhaps reproached the Author as erroneous, becauſe he will know more than they, and will not reverence their known miſtakes, alas! how ſhall the perſon that we would inſtruct (be it for <hi>Health</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi>) be able to <hi>know</hi> which of all theſe to truſt as wiſeſt?</p>
               <p>But the ſaddeſt work is that forementioned, in Churches, Kingdoms, Families and Souls. I muſt expect that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Crime will exaſperate the Guilty: But what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy? 1. Should I largely open what work this maketh in Families, I have too much matter for the complaint. If the Wife differ from the Husband, ſhe ſeemeth always in the right: If the Servant differ from the Maſter, and the Child from the Parent (if a little paſt infancy) they are always in the right. What is the Contention in Families, (and in all the World) but who ſhall have his way and will? If they are of ſeveral Parties in Religion, or if any be againſt Religion it ſelf, if they be fooliſh, erroneous, or live in any ſin, that can without utter impudence be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, ſtill they are able to make it good: And, except Children at School, or others that profeſſedly go to be taught, whom can we meet with ſo ignorant or miſtaken, that will not ſtill think when even Superiours differ from them, and reprove them, that they are in the right.</p>

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:55434:69"/>2. And what miſchiefs doth it cauſe in Churches? When the Papal Tyrannical part are ſo confident that they are in the right, that when they ſilence Preachers, and Impriſon and burn Chriſtians, they think it not their duty ſo much as to hear what they have to ſay for themſelves. Or if they hear a few words, they have not the patience to hear all, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially to try the cauſe: But they are ſo full of themſelves and over wiſe, that it muſt ſeem without any more ado a crime to diſſent from them, or contradict them. And thus proud ſelf-conceitedneſs ſmiteth the Shepherds, ſcattereth the flocks, and will allow the Church of Chriſt no Unity or Peace. And the popular croud are uſually or oft as ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited in their way; And if they never ſo unreaſonably op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Teachers, how hard is it to make them know or once ſuſpect that they are miſtaken? O what mutinies in Chriſts Armies, what Schiſms, what Confuſions, what Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, what perſecutions in the Church, what falſe accuſations, what groundleſs cenſures, do proud ſelf-conceited underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings cauſe?</p>
               <p>But ſcarce any where is it more lamentably ſeen than among injudicious, unexperienced Miniſters. What work is made in the Chriſtian world, by Sect againſt Sect, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt Party, in caſes of controverſy, by moſt mens bold and confident judging of what they never truly ſtudied, tried or underſtood? Papiſts againſt Proteſtants, Proteſtants againſt Papiſts, Lutherans (or Arminians) and Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, &amp;c. uſually charge one another by bare hear-ſay, or by a few ſentences or ſcraps Collected out of their writings by their adverſaries, contrary to the very Scope of the whole diſcourſe or context. And men cannot have leiſure to peruſe the books and to know before they judge. And then they think that ſeeing their Reverend Doctors have ſo reported their adverſaries before them, it is arrogance or injury to think that they knew not what they ſaid, or elſe belied them. And on ſuch ſuppoſition the falſe judging doth go on.

Of all the Pulpits that oft trouble the people with Invectives againſt this ſide or that, eſpecially in the Controverſies of Predeſtination, Grace and Free-will, how few do we hear that know what they talk againſt?</p>
               <p>Yea thoſe young or unſtudied men, who might eaſily be conſcious how little they know, are ready to oppoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the moſt ancient ſtudied Divines; When if ever they would be wiſe men, they ſhould continue Scholars to ſuch even while they are teachers of the people.</p>
               <p>I will not preſume to open the Calamities of the World, for want of Rulers true knowing their Subjects caſe, but judging haſtily by the reports of Adverſaries: But that Rebellions ordinarily hence ariſe I may boldly ſay: When Subjects that know not the reaſons of their Rulers actions, are ſo over wiſe as to make themſelves Judges of that which concerneth them not: And how few be they that think not themſelves wiſer than all their Guides and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours?</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, by this ſin it is that the wiſdom of the wiſeſt is as loſt to the world: For let a man know never ſo much more than others, after the longeſt, hardeſt ſtudies, the ſelf-conceitedneſs of the ignorant riſeth up againſt it, or maketh them uncapable of receiving it, ſo that he can do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good to others.</p>
               <p>I conclude again that this is the Plague and miſery of mankind and the cauſe of all Sin and Shame and Ruines, that <hi>Ignorant unhumbled underſtandings will be ſtill judging raſhly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have throughly tried the caſe, and will not ſuſpend till they are capable of Judging,</hi> nor be convinced that they know not what they know not, but be confident in their firſt or ungrounded apprehenſions.</p>

               <p n="1">1. When they will be confident of things that are quite above their underſtandings, or elſe which they never throughly ſtudied; ſome are confident of that which no man knoweth; And moſt are confident of that which I think they are unlike to be <hi>certain</hi> of themſelves, without miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous inſpiration, which they give us no reaſon to believe that they have. Things that cannot ordinarily be known, 1. Without the preparation of many other Sciences, 2. Or without reading many books, 3. Or without reading or hearing what is ſaid againſt it. 4. Or at leaſt without long and ſerious ſtudies we have abundance that will talk moſt peremptorily of them, upon the truſt of their teachers or party, without any of this neceſſary means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>haſtineſs of mens concluſions</hi> diſcovereth this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and Self-conceit. When at the firſt hearing or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or after a few thoughts they are as confident, as if they had grown old in ſtudies; the beſt underſtandings muſt have a long time to diſcern the Evidence of things difficult, and a longer time to try that Evidence by comparing it with what is brought againſt it: and yet a longer time to digeſt truths into that <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Clearneſs</hi> of <hi>Apprehenſion,</hi> which is neceſſary to diſtinct and ſolid Knowledge, when without all this ado<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moſt at the firſt lay hold of that which cometh in their way: And there they ſtick, at leaſt till a more eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed teacher or party tell them ſomewhat that is contrary to it.

                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:55434:70"/>
and need not much conſideration to perfect them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it not a plain diſcovery of a preſumptuous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when men will confidently conclude of things which their own tongues are forced to confeſs that they do not underſtand? I mean not only ſo as to give an accurate definition of them, but really not to know what it is that they talk of. Many a zealous Anabaptiſt I have known, that knoweth not what <hi>Baptiſm is.</hi> And many a one that hath diſputed confidently for or againſt <hi>Free-will,</hi> that knew not at all what <hi>Free-will</hi> is. And many a one that hath diſputed about the Lords Supper, and Separated from almoſt all Churches for want of ſufficient ſtrictneſs in it, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for giving it to the ignorant, who upon examination have not known the true Nature of a Sacrament, nor of the Sacred Covenant which it ſealeth. Many a one forſaketh moſt Churches as no Churches, that they may be of a right conſtituted Church, who know not what a Church is. What abundance will talk againſt an Arminian, a Calviniſt, a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſt, a Presbyterian, an Independent, that really know not what any of them are? Like a Gentleman the other day that after long talk of the Presbyterians, being urged to tell what a Preſbyterian was, could tell no more but that he was one that is not <hi>ſo merry</hi> and <hi>ſociable</hi> as other men, but ſtricter againſt ſports or taking a Cup. And if I ſhould tell you how few that can judge the controverſies about Predeſtination, do know what they talk of, it were eaſy to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. May I not diſcern their Prefidence, when men that hold contraries, five men of five inconſiſtent opinions, are yet every one confident that his own is right? When at beſt it is but <hi>one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that can be right. When ſix men confidently expound a text in the Revelation ſix ways. When five men are ſo confident of five ſeveral ways of Church Government, that they embody themſelves into ſeveral Policies or parties

to enjoy them. Is not here <hi>Self-conceitedneſs</hi> in all (at leaſt) ſave one?</p>
               <p n="5">5. When men themſelves by turning from opinion to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, ſhall confeſs their former opinion was falſe; and yet made a Religion of it while they held it; was not this a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous underſtanding</hi>? When a man ſhall be one year of one Sect, and another of another, and yet always confident that he is in the right.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When men that are known to be ignorant in other parts of Religion, ſhall yet in ſome one opinion which they have eſpouſed, ſeem to themſelves much wiſer than their Teachers and make nothing of the Judgments of thoſe that have ſtudied it many a year, is not this a preſuming mind? Take the ableſt Divine that ever you knew living, ſuppoſe him to be <hi>Jewel, Andrews, Uſher, Davenant, Calvin, Chamier, Camero, Armeſius, Gataker,</hi> &amp;c. Let him be one that all Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men admire, whoſe Judgment is ſent for from ſeveral Kingdoms; who hath ſpent a long life in hard and very ſucceſsful ſtudies, every Boy and Silly Woman every igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant vicious clown, that differeth from him in any point, ſhall ſlight all the wiſdom of this man, as if in compariſon of himſelf he were a fool. Let it come but to the point of Anabaptiſtry, Separation, Antinomianiſm yea the groſſeſt opinions of the Quakers, and what ſenſeleſs fellow or wench is not much wiſer than all theſe Divines? And they will pity him as a poor carnal ignorant perſon, which hath not the teaching of God which they have. Yea let him but ſeek to draw a ſenſualiſt from his Voluptuouſneſs, this poor ſot doth preſently take himſelf to be the wiſer man, and can prove all his Gaming, his Idleneſs, his Wantonneſs, his precious time waſted in Plays and long Feaſtings, his Gluttony, his Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, his Prodigal waſtefullneſs to be all lawful things, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Learned Paſtor ſay.</p>
               <p>But why do not ſuch men ſuſpect their underſtandings, and conſider with themſelves, what likelihood is there that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55434:71"/>
men as holy as I, that have ſtudied it all their days, ſhould not be wiſer than I that never ſearcht as they have done? Doth not God ſay, he that ſeeketh ſhall find; and wiſdom muſt be laboriouſly ſearched for, as a hidden treaſure? and doth not God uſe to give his bleſſing on ſuppoſition of mens Faithful endeavours?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Is it not palpable Pride when a <hi>few men,</hi> no wiſer nor better than others, can eaſily believe that all the reſt of the Chriſtian World, the moſt Learned, Godly and concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Chriſtians, are all deceived ignorant Souls, and they and their few adherents only are in the right, in ſome doubtful controverſies, wherein they have no advantage above others, either for capacity or grace? I know that when the World is drowned in wickedneſs, we muſt not imitate them, be they never ſo many, nor follow a multitude to do evil; and I know that the <hi>Certain Truth</hi> of the Goſpel muſt be held faſt though moſt of the World be Infidels: And that when the Arrians were the moſt, they were not therefore the righteſt; And that even among Chriſtians, Carnal Intereſts uſe to breed and keep up ſuch corruptions, as muſt not for the number of the vicious be approved. But when thoſe that truely fear God, and ſeek the Truth and Faithfully ſerve him, as ſelf-denyingly as any others, ſhall agree in any part of Holy Doctrine or Worſhip, for a few among them to riſe up in a conceit of their own underſtandings, and ſeparate from them as they ſeparate from the World, and this upon leſs ſtudy than many of the reſt have uſed, to find out the Truth; I am ſure none but a Proud perſon will do this, without great jealouſie of his own underſtanding, and great fear of erring, and without long and ſerious ſearch and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the leaſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Is it not Pride of underſtanding, when we ſee men confident upon inconſiderable Reaſons: when they bring nothing that ſhould move a man of any competent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and yet they build as boldly on this Sand, as if they built upon a Rock.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:55434:72"/>9. And when they ſlight the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> and <hi>cleareſt</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of another: And in their prefidence diſdain them, before they underſtand them, as not worthy of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as ſilly things.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When they obtrude all their Conceits magiſterially upon others; and expect that all men preſently be of their mind and ſay as they do: when they value men juſt as they agree with or diſagree from their opinion, and all are dear to them that hold with them, and all are ſlighted that think they err. When a man that without chewing preſently ſwalloweth their conceits, is taken for a ſounder man than he that will take nothing as <hi>ſure</hi> till <hi>Evidence</hi> prove it to him: Is not this notorious <hi>Pride</hi> of underſtanding? And O how common is this impoſing Pride, even in them that cry out againſt it and condemn it? They that will vilify one party as Impoſing all their own conceptions, even in words and forms and ceremonies, on the Churches of Chriſt, will yet themſelves be rigid Impoſers; No man ſhall be of their Communion, nor judged meet for the Holy Sacrament, who cometh not to their opinions in many of their ſingularities; Nay worſe, that will not abſtain from communion with other Churches; whom their preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeparateth from.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And do not thoſe people moſt value their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, who chooſe Teachers to pleaſe them, and not to Teach them, and hear them as Judges or cenſurers, and not as Learners? How ordinary is this? If they be to chooſe a Paſtor, they will rather have the moſt injudicious man who thinks as they think, than the wiſeſt man that is able to teach them better. If they hear any thing which agreeth not with their former conceits, they go away magiſterially, cenſuring the Preacher; He taught unſound Doctrine, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous things; And neither underſtand him, nor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Learn. I have ſeldom Preached in ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, nor ſeldom written on any ſubject, but among
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55434:72"/>
many Learners, ſome ſuch hearers and readers I have had that neither have underſtanding enough to Teach, nor hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility enough to know it, and to Learn: but they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way prating among their Companions of what they never underſtood; and if it fall out that I know of it, and anſwer them, they have nothing to ſay; But a <hi>putarem,</hi> or <hi>non-pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarem</hi>: I thought you had meant thus or thus (contrary to what I ſpoke) or I noted not this or that word (which the ſence depended on.) Do but ſay as they would have you, and you are an excellent man! But if you tell them more than they knew, if it detect any error or ignorance which they had before, they condemn your teaching, inſtead of learning of you. Poor Souls! If you are wiſe enough already, what need you a Teacher? If you are not, why will you not learn? If you were wiſer than He, why did you chooſe or take him for your Teacher? If you are not, why will you not learn of him?</p>
               <p n="12">12. The deep and cruel cenſures which they paſs againſt Diſſenters, doth ſhew their ſelf-conceitedneſs. None more cenſorious than raw unexperienced perſons, not only Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Preachers, but Women and Boys. How readily and boldly without any fear of God doth one ſeek to make his Brother odious as a Schiſmatick and a Fanatick, and worſe than words can deſcribe him; and another to reproach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as Antichriſtian and Carnal, whom he never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood? Nothing but <hi>Pride</hi> could make men ſo <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>bold</hi> and fearleſs in their moſt fooliſh cenſures.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And it further ſheweth their <hi>proud preſumption,</hi> when they dare do all this upon bare rumors and hear-ſay, and ungrounded ſuſpicions. Were they not <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,</hi> they would think, Alas, my underſtanding is not ſo clear and ſure, nor my Charity ſo ſafe and ſtrong, as that I ſhould in reaſon venture to condemn my Brother, upon uncertain rumors, and ſo ſlight reports? Have I heard him ſpeak for himſelf? Or is it Charity or common Juſtice
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55434:73"/>
to condemn a man unheard? What though they are godly men that report it? So was <hi>David</hi> that committed Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Murder, and haſtily received a Lie againſt <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth</hi>; and perhaps many of thoſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> againſt whoſe falſe cenſures, <hi>Paul</hi> was put ſo largely to vindicate himſelf.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Yea, when they dare proceed to vend theſe falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and cenſures upon hear-ſay, to the deſtruction of the Charity of thoſe that hear them. And ſo entangle them all in ſin: As if it were not enough to quench their own Love to their Brother by falſe Surmiſes, but they muſt quench as many others alſo as they can.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Yea, when they dare venture ſo far as to unchurch many Churches, yea, moſt in the World, and degrade moſt Miniſters, if not unchriſten moſt Chriſtians, or at leaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves withdraw from the Communion of ſuch Churches, and all for ſomething which they never underſtood; about a Doctrine, a Form, a Circumſtance, where ſelf-opinion or ſelf-intereſt draweth them to all this bold adventure.</p>
               <p>To ſay nothing of Condemnations of whole Churches and Countreys, the tyrannical, proud Impoſitions, the cruel Perſecutions, which the Papal Faction hath been guilty of by this Vice, judge now whether it be not too common a caſe to be guilty of an <hi>unhumbled underſtanding, and of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended knowledge?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>If it be ſo, is it not beſt do as the Papiſts, and keep men from reading the Scriptures, or medling with divine things which they cannot maſter, any further than to believe what the Church believeth.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is beſt no doubt, to teach men to know the difference between Teachers and Learners, and to keep in a humble learning ſtate, and in that ſtate to grow as much in knowledge as they can: But not to caſt away knowledge, for fear of over-valuing it, nor renounce their reaſon, for fear of errour. No more than to put out their Eyes for fear of miſtaking by them, or chuſing madneſs leſt they abuſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55434:73"/>
their wits: Elſe we might wiſh to be Brutes, becauſe abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Reaſon is the cauſe of all the errours and miſchiefs in the World.</p>

               <p n="3">3. The truth is, the cauſe is the common frailty of man, and the common pravity of corrupted nature, and it is to be found in Perſons of all Ranks, Religions and Conditions; of which more after in due place.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the miſchievous effects of this proud pretence of more knowledge than men have.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF the miſchiefs of this ſin had not been very great, I had not choſen this ſubject to treat of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no ſmall miſchief to involve mens Souls in the guilt of all the ſins, which I named in the laſt Chapter, as the diſcovery of this Vice. Sure all thoſe diſorders, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſlanders, and preſumptions, ſhould not ſeem ſmall in the Eyes of any man that feareth God, and loveth holineſs, and hateth ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Pretended knowledge</hi> waſteth men ſome time in getting it, and much more in abuſing it: All the time that you ſtudy for it, preach for it, talk for it, write for it, is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully loſt and caſt away.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It kindleth a corrupt and ſinful Zeal; ſuch as <hi>James</hi> deſcribeth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.1, 15. which is envious and ſtriving, and is but Earthly, Senſual and Deviliſh: A Zeal againſt Love, and againſt good Works, and againſt the Intereſt of our Brother, and againſt the Peace and Concord of the Church; a hurting, burning, devouring, excommunicating, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Zeal. And a Feaver in the Body is not ſo pernicious as ſuch a ſinful Zeal in the Soul. Such a Zeal the Jews had
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55434:74"/>
as <hi>Paul</hi> bears them witneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1. Such a Zeal, alas, is ſo common among perſecuting Papiſts on one ſide, and cenſorious Sectaries and Separatiſts on the other, that we muſt all bear the ſad effects of it. And ſelf-conceited know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the fuel of this Zeal, as <hi>James</hi> 3. fully manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This <hi>pretended knowledge</hi> is the fixing of falſe Opinions in the minds of men, by which the truth is moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept out. A Child will not wrangle againſt his Teacher, and therefore will learn; but theſe over-wiſe Fools do preſently ſet their wits againſt what you ſay, to keep out knowledge. You muſt beat down the Garriſon of his pride, before you come within hearing to inſtruct him: He is hardlier <hi>untaught</hi> the errours which he hath received, than an unprejudiced man is taught to underſtand moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent truths.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By this the gifts of the moſt wiſe and excellent Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are half loſt: It is full Bottles that are caſt into theſe Seas of knowledge, which have no room for more, but come out as they went in: If an <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> or an <hi>Aquinas,</hi> or <hi>Scotus</hi> were among them, yea, a <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> what can he put into theſe Perſons that are full of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits already? Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his own conceit? there is more hope of a Fool than of him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Yea, they are uſually the perverters of the Souls of others: Before they can come to themſelves, and know that they were miſtaken, what pains have they taken to make others of their own erroneous minds, whom they are not able afterward to undeceive again?</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is a vice that blemiſheth many excellent qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: To hear of a man that valueth his own Judgment but according to its worth, and pretendeth to know but ſo much as he knoweth indeed, is no ſhame to him; though knowledge is a thing fitter to be <hi>Uſed</hi> than <hi>Boaſted</hi> of: But if a man know never ſo much, and can never ſo well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55434:74"/>
it, if he think that he is wiſer than he is, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth others more than indeed he doth, and over-valueth that knowledge which he hath, it is a ſhame which his greateſt parts cannot excuſe or hide.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It expoſeth a man to baſe and ſhameful mutability. He that will be <hi>haſty</hi> and confident in his apprehenſions, is ſo oft miſtaken, that he muſt as oft change his mind, and recant, or do much worſe. I know that it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that any man ſhould have as ſound apprehenſions in his youth, as in his age, and that the wiſeſt ſhould not have need of mutations for the better, and retractations of ſome youthful Errours; and he that changeth not, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth nothing, it ſeems is in his childiſh Ignorance and Errour ſtill: but when natural frailty expoſeth us all to much of this diſgrace, we ſhould not expoſe our ſelves to ſo much more. A haſty judger, or prefident man muſt be a very Weathercock, or be defiled with a Leproſie of Errour. Whereas if men would but be humble and modeſt, and ſelf-ſuſpicious and ſuſpend their preſumption, and not take on them to know before they know indeed, how ſafely might they walk, and how ſeldom would they need to change their minds, or either ſtick in the ſink of Errour, or make many ſhameful Retractations?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Prefidence and falſe judging engageth a man in a very life of ſin. For when falſhood goeth for truth with him, it will infect his affections, and pollute his converſation, and all that he doth in the obedience and proſecution of that Errour will be ſin. Yea the greateſt ſin that he can but think no ſin, may be committed; as was the Perſecution of Chriſt and Chriſtians, by the Jews, and <hi>Paul,</hi> and others like them; and the Papiſts bloodineſs for their Religion throughout Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It diſturbeth the Peace of all Societies: This is the vice that diſquieteth Families: Every one is wiſeſt in his own Eyes: The Servant thinketh his own way better than
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55434:75"/>
his Maſters: What are all the contentions between Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, or any in the Family, but that in all their differences, every one thinketh himſelf to be in the right? His own Opinion is right, his own Words and Ways are right; and when every one is wiſe and juſt, and every one is in the right, the effects are ſuch as if no one were wiſe or in the right.</p>
               <p>And in Civil Societies, Seditions, Rebellions Oppreſſions, Tyranny, and all Confuſions come from this, that men <hi>pretend to be ſure</hi> of what <hi>they are not.</hi> Rulers take up with falſe reports from idle malicious whiſperers and accuſers againſt their inferiours, and have not the Juſtice and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to ſuſpend their Judgments, till they have ſearcht out the matter, and fully heard men ſpeak for themſelves. Subjects make themſelves Judges of the ſecrets of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>overn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the Councils and Actions of their Rulers, of which they have no certain notice, but venture to conclude upon deceitful ſuſpicions. And the Contentions and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions amongſt Nobles and other Subjects, come from miſunderſtandings, through <hi>haſty</hi> and ungrounded judgings.</p>
               <p>But the wofulleſt effects are in the <hi>Churches</hi>; where, alas, whilſt every Paſtor will be wiſer than another, and the People wiſer than all their Paſtors, and every Sect and Party much wiſer than all that differ from them, their diviſions, their ſeparations, their alienations and bitter cenſurings of each other, their obtruding their own Opinions, and Rules and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eremonies upon each other, their bitter envyings, ſtrife and perſecutions of each other, do make ſober ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders-by to ask, as <hi>Paul, Is there not a wiſe man among you?</hi> O happy the World, happy Kingdoms, but moſt happy the Churches of Chriſt, if we could poſſibly bring men but to <hi>know their Ignorance!</hi> If the Paſtors themſelves were not <hi>prefident</hi> and <hi>preſumptuous over-valuers</hi> of their own <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions!</hi> And if the People <hi>knew</hi> how little they know! But now alas, men rage againſt each other in their dreams, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55434:75"/>
few of them have the grace to awake before death, and find to repentance, that they were themſelves in errour.</p>
               <p>Hear me, with that remnant of meekneſs and humility which thou haſt left, thou confident, bitter, cenſorious man! Why muſt that man needs be taken for a Heretick, a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, a refractory, ſtubborn, ſelf-willed perſon, an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, carnal, formal man, who is not of thy Opinion in point of a Controverſie, of a Form, of an Order, of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, or Subſcription, or ſuch like? It's poſſible it may be ſo! And its poſſible thou maiſt be more ſo thy ſelf. But haſt thou ſo patiently heard all that he hath to ſay, and ſo clearly diſcerned the truth on thy own ſide, and that this truth is made ſo evident to him as that nothing but wilful obſtinacy can reſiſt it, as will warrant all thy cenſure and contempt? Or is it not an over-valuing of thy own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which makes thee ſo eaſily condemn all as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable that differ from it? Hath not pride made thy ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wit to be as an Idol, to which all muſt bow down on pain of the heat of thy diſpleaſure? Do not ſome of thoſe men whom thou ſo Magiſterially condemneſt, ſtudy as hard and as impartially as thy ſelf? Do they not pray as hard for Gods aſſiſtance? Have they not the ſame Books, and as good Teachers? Do they not <hi>live</hi> as well, and ſhew as much tenderneſs of Conſcience, and fear of erring and ſinning as thy ſelf? why then art thou ſo haſty in condemning them that are as fair for the reputation of wiſdom as thou art?</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe them miſtaken; haſt thou tryed that they are unwilling to be inſtructed? It may be you have wrangled with them by diſputes, which have but engaged each other to defend his own Opinion: But call them to thee in Love, and tell them, you are ignorant, and I am wiſe: I will teach you what you know not, and open to them all the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which cauſeth your own confident apprehenſions: Wiſh them to ſtudy it, and hear patiently what they have to ſay; and I am perſwaded that many or moſt ſober men
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55434:76"/>
that differ from you, will not refuſe thus to become as your Scholars, ſo far as to conſider all that you have to offer to convince them, and thankfully receive as much of the truth as they can diſcern.</p>
               <p>But, alas, no men rage ſo much againſt others as errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and blind, as the blind and erroneous; and no men ſo furiouſly brand others with the marks of <hi>Obſtinacy, Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as the <hi>Obſtinate, Factious</hi> and <hi>Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> The <hi>prouder</hi> the Obtruder of his own conceits is, the more he condemneth all Diſſenters as <hi>proud,</hi> for preſuming to differ from ſuch as he? and all for want of a <hi>humble mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Moreover it is this <hi>pretended knowledge</hi> which is the cauſe of all our <hi>falſe Reformations.</hi> Men are ſo over-wiſe, that they preſently ſee a Beam in their Brothers Eye, which is but a Mote; and they magnifie all the imperfections of others, Paſtors and Churches, into Mountains of iniquity: Every miſ-expreſſion or diſorder, or inconvenient phraſe in a Prayer, or a Sermon, or a Book, is an odious, damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, intolerable evil. O! ſay ſuch, what Idolaters are they that uſe a <hi>Form</hi> of Prayer, which God did not command? What large Conſciences have they that can join with a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Church? that can communicate Kneeling, and among bad men, or thoſe whoſe Converſion is not tryed? What abundance of intolerable evils do ſuch men find in the <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of other mens Worſhip, which God mercifully accepteth through Chriſt, taking all theſe but for ſuch pardonable imperfections as he mercifully beareth with in all. And then the Reformation muſt be preſently anſwerable to the apprehenſion of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſometimes the very injudicious ſort of zealous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple make the cry of the greatneſs of this or that corruption, how Antichriſtian and intolerable it is? And then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation muſt <hi>ſatisfie</hi> this <hi>vulgar errour,</hi> and anſwer the cry and expectation of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:55434:76"/>I would here give inſtances of abundance of miſ-reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which all need a Reformation, both in Doctrine, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Worſhip, but that I reſerve it for another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe if I live to finiſh it, and can get it printed, called <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing</hi> is <hi>Undoing.</hi>

But it was not all neceſſary in the Apoſtles times, nor in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s times, no nor in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s own times; much of thoſe things being uſed arbitrarily: And what was made neceſſary by Canons of General Councils in the Empire, (mark it) was never thereby made neceſſary in all the reſt of the Churches. And are you ſure that meer Chriſtians will take all theſe for certain truths? Why, if they will not, <hi>Burn</hi> and Baniſh them. This is, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem facere &amp; pacem vocare.</hi> But hark Sir, this way hath been tryed too long in vain: Millions of <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and

The French Maſſacre killed about Forty or Thirty Thouſand: The Iriſh Maſſacre in that little Iſland killed about Two Hundred Thouſand. But were they not ſtronger after all theſe cruelties than before? Alas, Sir, all your labour is loſt, and your party is taken for a Blood-thirſty Generation, and humane Nature which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth the Blood-thirſty, ever after breedeth Enemies to your way. This is the effect of falſe Principles, and terms of <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> contrived by <hi>proud ſelf-conceited men,</hi> that think the World ſhould take their <hi>Dictates</hi> for a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Law, and obey them as the Directive Deities of Mankind.</p>
               <p>If all this be not enough to tell you what <hi>proud pretended certainty</hi> is, read over the Hiſtories of the Ages paſt, and you ſhall find it written in Ink, in Tears, in blood, in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in Subverſions of the Empires and Kingdoms of the World, in the moſt odious and doleful Contentions of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Lacerations of Churches, and Deſolations of the Earth.

               <p>THough there be ſo much evil in this ſin of <hi>Preſumption</hi> as I have noted, yet is it not in all alike culpable or unhappy: But differeth in both reſpects as I ſhall tell you.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is a great ſin in thoſe who have leaſt reaſon to think highly of their own underſtandings, and greateſt reaſon to diſtruſt themſelves: As. 1. In thoſe that are young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced, and muſt be miraculouſly wiſe, if they are wiſer than old experienced perſons <hi>(caeteris paribus.)</hi> 2. In the unlearned or half-learned who have had but little time or helps for ſtudy, or at leaſt have made but little uſe of them. 3. In duller wits, and perſons that in other matters are known to be no wiſer than others. 4. In thoſe that take up their <hi>prefidence</hi> upon the ſlighteſt grounds, as bare ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and reports from others that were uncertain. 5. In thoſe that have been oft deceived already, and ſhould by their ſad experience have been brought to humble ſelf-ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it is an aggravated ſin in thoſe whoſe place and condition obligeth them to learn from others. As for the Wife to be ſelf-con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eited of all her apprehenſions againſt her Husband (unleſs he be a fool:) For the Servant to ſet his wit againſt his Maſters; where he ſhould obey him. For Children to think that their wits are righter than their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Maſters, and Apprentices and Learners to think that they know more than their teachers: And for the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people to cenſure over-haſtily the Doctrine and Practice of their Paſtors, as if they were wiſer than they: Perhaps they are. But it muſt be ſome rare perſon who is fit to be a Teacher himſelf, or the Teacher ſome ſot that hath intruded into the Office, or elſe it muſt be a wonder. For God uſually giveth men Knowledge according to the <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Means,</hi> and Pains that they have had to get it, and not by miraculous infuſions without means. Doth not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expreſly tell you this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>When for the Time you ought to have been Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. Men ſhould be wiſe according to <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom, which they</hi> have had.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:55434:79"/>3. It is the greater crime when men will ſeem wiſeſt in other mens matters and concernments. When the Subject will know beſt what belongeth to a King or Governor, and the people will know beſt how the Paſtor ſhould teach them, and when he faileth, and whom he ſhould receive into the Church or exclude. When the Servant will know beſt his Maſters duty, and every man his Neighbours, and leaſt his own.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is the greater crime when men will be the Judges of their own underſtandings, and think highly of them in caſes where they ſhould be tryed by others. As if an Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, or Woman do think that they know better how to cure a diſeaſe than the ableſt Phyſicians; why do they not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to the Tryal, and before them make good their Skill by reaſon? If an unexperienced young ſtudent think himſelf able to be a Phyſician, he is not to be Judge, but muſt be Tryed and Judged by Phyſicians: If a ſelf-conceited Profeſſor, or a young Student think himſelf fit for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, he muſt not preſently contrive how to get in, and how to ſhift off Examination, but freely offer himſelf to be tried by able Godly Miniſters, and then by the ordainers, who are to judge. But when ſuch Perſons can think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficient if no body elſe do, or if but a few ignorant perſons do, that are unfit to judge, this proves their <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Preſumption</hi> to be a great and heinous ſin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And it is yet more heinouſly aggravated, when to keep up the reputation of their own underſtandings, they uſe to depreſs and vilify the wiſer, even thoſe whom they never knew: As he that affecteth to be a Preacher and dare not paſs the Examination, hath no way to hide his ſhame, but 1. By crying down the Learning which he wanteth, as a humane carnal thing. And 2. By reproaching thoſe that ſhould judge of him and ordain him, as poor carnal perſons who underſtand not the things of the Spirit as he doth, and as proud ſelf-ſeeking men, that will approve of none but
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55434:80"/>
thoſe that flatter them, and are of their way. Some ſuch there may be: But ſure all are not ſuch. Why do you not deſire the Judgment of the wiſeſt moſt impartial men, but take up with the applauſe of unlearned perſons that are of your own mind and way, and magnify you for humouring them?</p>
               <p>So you ſhall hear Empyricks and She-Phyſicians vilify Doctors of Phyſick, as men that have leſs knowledge than they, and are ſo Proud and Covetous and Diſhoneſt, that there is no truſting them. When <hi>Pretended Knowledge</hi> muſt have ſo baſe a Cloak, it is the greater ſin.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And it is the heinouſer ſin when they venture to do heinous miſchief by it: As a Papiſt, a Quaker, or a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt will in his confidence, be a perverter of others, and a Condemner of the Juſt, and a defamer of thoſe that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and a troubler of the Church and World. He that in his ſelf-conceitedneſs dare reſiſt the wiſeſt, and his Teachers, and Rulers, and ſet Countries on Fire, is wickedly preſumptuous.</p>
               <p>So in the practice of Phyſick, when people will be ſelf-conceited, when the Lives of others lie upon it, and a ſilly Fellow or Woman will venture to purge, to let blood, to give this or that, who know neither the diſeaſe nor proper cure.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is therefore a heinous ſin in Rulers, who muſt judge for the life and death of others, or for the peace or miſery of thouſands about them. I mean Paſtors and Commanders in Armies, and Navies, and other Governours on whom the publick welfare of the Church, or Army, or Navy, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey doth depend. O how wiſe ſhould that perſon be, whoſe errours may coſt thouſands, ſo dear as their deſtruction! Or if their underſtandings be not extraordinary how cautelous ſhould they be in judging; upon hearing the <hi>wiſeſt,</hi> and hearing <hi>diſſenters,</hi> and not only Flatterers or Conſenters; and hearing men of ſeveral minds, and hearing all Witneſſes, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55434:80"/>
Evidence, and hearing every man ſpeak for himſelf: and after all conſidering throughly of it: Specially of Laws and Wars, and Impoſitions in Religion, where thouſands of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſay what you can, will expect Satisfaction. When a Woman called to <hi>Antigonus</hi> to hear her cauſe and do her Juſtice, he told her that he could not have leiſure: She anſwered, you ſhould not have while to be King then: Whereupon he heard her, and did her right. Had it been to an inferior Judge ſhe had ſpoken reaſon.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Laſtly, <hi>Pretended Certainty</hi> is the greater ſin when it is falſly fathered on God. But the Pope and Council dare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>promiſed</hi> them Infallibility, and <hi>God hath</hi> certified them that the conſecrated Bread is no Bread, and that our ſenſes are all deceived; and God hath made the Pope the univerſal Ruler of the World or Church, and made him and his Council the only Judges by which all men muſt know what is the word of God. So when Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks will pretend that by Revelation, Viſions or Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit, God hath aſſured them that this or that is the meaning of a Text which they underſtand not, or the truth in ſuch or ſuch a controverſy. Alas among too many well meaning perſons, <hi>God</hi> is pretended for a multitude of ſinful errors; And they that preach falſe Doctrine, will do it as the old Prophet ſpake to the young, as <hi>from the Lord:</hi> And they that rail at godlineſs and they that cenſure, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, caſt out or perſecute their Brethren, will do it as <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhakeh; Hath not God ſent me,</hi> &amp;c. Men will not make any ſnares for the Church or their Brethrens Conſciences, but in the name of God: They will not divide the Church, nor caſt out Infants, nor refuſe Communion with their Brethren, but in the name of God. One man ſaith, <hi>God forbiddeth him all Book Prayers, or all Impoſed Forms of Prayer.</hi> And another ſaith, <hi>God forbiddeth him all but ſuch.</hi> And all bely God, and add this heinous abuſe of his holy word and name unto their ſin.</p>

               <p n="2">2. While you <hi>do ſtudy,</hi> it keepeth out Knowledge: You are too full of your ſelves to receive eaſily from others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the Common Parent of Errour and Hereſy. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> is the <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> the Father of them all: And <hi>Prefidence</hi> and <hi>Pretended Knowledge</hi> is but <hi>Proud Ignorance</hi> in another name.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What a life of precious <hi>time</hi> will you waſte in following the erroneous thoughts of your bewildred minds.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As food altereth the temperament of the body which it nouriſheth, ſo the very temperament of your minds and wills and affections will become vain, and frothy, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy, or malignant and perverſe, according to the quality of your Errour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is the common Parent of Superſtition: It defileth God's Worſhip with Humane Inventions, with duties and ſins of our own making: All ſuch mens dreams will ſeem to them to be the Laws of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It will entail a corrupt Education of Youth upon us, and conſequently a corrupt degenerate kind of Learning, and ſo a degenerate Miniſtry on the Churches. When Youths are poſſeſſed with abundance of <hi>Uncertainties</hi> under the name of <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> it will grow the cuſtom to <hi>Teach,</hi> and <hi>Talk,</hi> and <hi>Live</hi> accordingly: Do I ſay, <hi>It will

               <p n="8">8. And you will make <hi>vain ſtrife</hi> and <hi>contention</hi> about vanity, your very trade and buſineſs when you come abroad in the world. They that make <hi>Uncertainties</hi> or <hi>Errours</hi> to be their ſtudies and honourable Learning, muſt keep up the honour of it by Living as they Learnt, and talking vainly for the vanities of their minds.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And you are like hereby to become the chiefeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Satan, to trouble the Church either with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Schiſms or Perſecutions.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And truly it ſhould much turn your hearts againſt it, to know that it is a continual habit or exerciſe of <hi>Pride.</hi> And Pride (the Devil's ſin) is one of the moſt heinous and odious to God. If you hate any ſin, you ſhould hate Pride. And it is one of the worſt ſorts of Pride too. As Nature hath three Principles, active <hi>Power, Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and Man three Excellencies, <hi>Greatneſs, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi>; ſo Pride hath theſe three Great Objects: Men are proud that they are <hi>Greater,</hi> or <hi>Wiſer,</hi> or <hi>Better</hi> than others: That is, They think themſelves <hi>Greater,</hi> or <hi>Wiſer,</hi> or <hi>Better</hi> than they are, and they would have others think ſo too. As for Pride of Beauty, or Clothing, or ſuch like corporeal things and appurtenances, it is the Vice of Children, and the more ſhallow and fooliſh ſort of Women. But Greater things make up a Greater ſort of Pride. O what a number of all Ranks and Ages do live in this great ſin of <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or an <hi>Over-valued Underſtanding,</hi> who never feel or lament it!</p>
               <p n="11">11. Moreover your <hi>Prefidence</hi> prepareth you for Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, or doubting of the moſt certain neceſſary Truths: Like ſome of our Sectaries, who have been falſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confident of ſo many Religions, till at laſt they doubt of all Religion. He

that finds that he was deceived while he was an Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and deceived when he was a Separatiſt, and deceived while he was an Antinomian or Libertine, and deceived when he was a Quaker, is prepared to think alſo that he was deceived when he was a Chriſtian, and when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Immortality of the Soul, and the Life to come. When you have found your Underſtandings oft deceive you, you will grow ſo diſtruſtful of them, as hardly ever to believe them when it is moſt neceſſary. He that often lyeth, will hardly be believed when he ſpeaketh truth. And all this cometh from believing your <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſlight</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions too eaſily and too ſoon, and ſo filling up your minds with lyes, which when they are diſcovered, make the <hi>Truth</hi> to be ſuſpected. Like ſome fanciful, luſtful Youths, who haſtily grow fond of ſome unſuitable unlovely perſon, and when they know them, cannot ſo much as allow them the conjugal affection which they are bound to.</p>

He that ſeeth but <hi>ſome parcels</hi> of Truth, or ſeeth them but <hi>confuſedly,</hi> or in a falſe method, not agreeable to the things, doth know but little, becauſe he knoweth not the place, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and reſpects of <hi>Truths</hi> to one another, and conſequently neither their compoſition, harmony, <hi>ſtrength</hi> or <hi>uſe.</hi> Like a Philoſopher that knew nothing but <hi>Elements,</hi> and not mixt bodies, or animate beings: Or like an Anatomiſt that is but an Atomiſt, and can ſay no more of the body of a man, but that it is made up of <hi>Atoms,</hi> or at moſt, can only enumerate the ſimilar parts: Or like a man that knoweth no more of his Clock and Watch, but as the pieces of it lie on a heap, or at beſt, ſetteth ſome one part out of its place, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth the whole Engine: Or like one that knoweth the Cheſs-men only as they are in the Bag, or at beſt in ſome diſorder. Who will make me ſo happy as to ſhew me one true Scheme of Phyſicks, of Metaphyſicks, of Logick, yea of Theology, which I cannot preſently prove guilty of ſuch miſtake, confuſion, miſorder, as tendeth to great errour in the ſubſequent parts, I know of no ſmall number that have been offered to the world, but never ſaw one that ſatisfied my underſtanding. And I think I ſcarce know any thing to purpoſe, till I can draw a true Scheme of it, and ſet each compounding notion in its place.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And the great <hi>Diverſity</hi> and <hi>Contrariety</hi> of Opinions, of Notions and of Methods, proveth that our Knowledge indeed is yet but ſmall. How many Methods of Logick have we? How many Hypotheſes in Phyſicks, yea how many contentious Volumes written againſt one another, in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and Theology it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What loads of <hi>Videtur</hi>'s in the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55434:83"/>
Schoolmen? How many Sects and Opinions in Religion? Phyſicians agree not about mens Lives. Lawyers agree not about mens Eſtates; no nor about the very fundamental Laws. If there be a Civil War, where both ſides appeal to the Law, there will be Lawyers on both ſides. And doth not this prove that we know but little?</p>
               <p n="3">III. But mens rage and confidence in theſe Contrarieties doth diſcover it yet more. Read their contentious writings of Philoſophy and Theology; obſerve their uſage of one another, what contempt, what reproach, what cruelties they can proceed to? The Papiſt ſilenceth and burneth the Proteſtant; the Lutheran ſilenceth and revileth the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt; the Calviniſt ſharply judgeth the Arminians, and ſo round: And may I not judge that this wiſeſt part of the world is low in Knowledge, when not the vulgar only, but the Leaders and Doctors are ſo commonly miſtaken in their greateſt Zeal? And that <hi>Solomon</hi> erred not in ſaying, <hi>[The fool rageth, and is confident.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. If our knowledge were not very low, the long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the World would have long ago reconciled our Controverſies. The ſtrivings and diſtractions about them (both in Philoſophy, Politicks and Theology) have torn Churches, and raiſed Wars, and ſet Kingdoms on Fire, and ſhould in reaſon be to us as a Bone out of Joint, which by the pain ſhould force us all to ſeek out for a cure: And ſure in ſo many thouſand years, many Remedies have been tryed: The iſſues of ſuch diſingenuous-ingenious Wars, do furniſh men with ſuch experience as ſhould teach them the cure. And yet after ſo many years War of wits, to be ſo witleſs as to find no End, no Remedy, no Peace, doth ſhew that the wit of man is not a thing to be proud of.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The great mutability of our apprehenſions doth ſhew that they are not many things that we are certain of. Do we not feel in our ſelves how new thoughts and new rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ready to breed new conjectures in us, and that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55434:83"/>
looketh doubtful to us, upon further thoughts, of which long before we had no doubt. Beſides the multitudes that change their very Religion, every ſtudious Perſon ſo oft changeth his conceptions, as may teſtifie the ſhallowneſs of our minds.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The general barbarouſneſs of the World, the few Countreys that have polite Learning, or true Civility or Chriſtianity, do tell us that knowledge in the World is low: When beſides the vaſt unknown Regions of the World, all that are of late diſcovery in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> or elſewhere, are found to be ſo rude and barbarous; ſome little differing from ſubtile Brutes: When the vaſt Regions of <hi>Africk,</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> are no wiſer to this day. When the <hi>Roman</hi> Eaſtern Empire ſo eaſily parted with Chriſtianity, and is turned to ſo much barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ignorance; this ſheweth what we are: For theſe men are all Born as capable as we.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Eſpecially the ſottiſh Opinions which the Heathen and Mahometan World do generally entertain, do tell us how dark a Creature man is. That four parts of the whole World (if not much more, that is unknown) ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the ſottiſh Opinions as they do, both againſt the light of Nature (knowing ſo little of God) and by ſuch vain conceits of their Prophets and petty Deities: That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the fifth part of the known World, ſhould receive, and ſo long and quietly retain, ſo ſottiſh an Opinion as Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metaniſm is, and Build upon it the hopes of their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If the Greek Church can be corrupted into ſo groſs a foolery, why may not the Latine, and the Engliſh, if they had the ſame temptations? O what a ſad proof is here of humane folly.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. But in the Latine Church (be it ſpoken without any comparing Mahometaniſm with Chriſtianity) the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is yet greater, and the diſcovery of the fallaciouſneſs of mans underſtanding is yet more clear: Were there no proof
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55434:84"/>
of it, but the very being of <hi>Popery</hi> in the World, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it by <hi>ſuch</hi> and ſo <hi>many,</hi> it affordeth the ſtrongeſt temptation that ever I thought of in the World, to the Brutiſt, to queſtion whether Inſtinct advance not Brutes above man! The Brutes diſtruſt not their right diſpoſed ſenſes; but the Papiſts not only diſtruſt them, but renounce them: Bread is no Bread, and Wine is no Wine with them, All mens ſenſes are deceived that think otherwiſe: It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation to believe that Gods natural Revelations to ſenſe here are falſe,<note place="margin">Of this oft before.</note> and not to be believed. Every man that will be ſaved muſt believe that Bread is no Bread, that Quantity, Locality, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Weight, Figure, are the Quantity, Locality, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Weight, Figure, of nothing: And God worketh Grand Miracles by every Prieſt, as frequently as he Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crateth in the Maſs: And if any man refuſe to Swear to this Renunciation of Humane Senſe, and the Truth of theſe Miracles, he muſt be no Prieſt, but a combuſtible Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. And if any Temporal Lord refuſe to exterminate all thoſe from their Dominions who will believe their Senſes, and not think it neceſſary to renounce them as deceived, he muſt be Excommunicated and Diſpoſſeſt himſelf, his Subjects abſolved from their Oaths and Allegiance, and his Dominions given to another: And this is their very Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, being the Decree of a great General Council, (queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned indeed by ſome few Proteſtants, but not at all by them, but largely vindicated:) <hi>Later. ſub. Innoc.</hi> 3. <hi>Can.</hi> 1, 3. The ſum is, No man that will not renounce not only his Humanity, but his Animality, muſt be ſuffered to live in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ones Dominions, and he that will ſuffer men in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, muſt be himſelf turned out? this is plain truth: And yet this is the Religion of Popes and Emperors, and Kings, of Lords and Councellors, of Prelates and Doctors, Univerſities, Churches and famous Kingdoms; and ſuch as men, all theſe wiſe men dare lay their Salvation upon;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55434:84"/>
and dare Maſſacre men by Thouſands and Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands upon, and Burn their Neighbours to Aſhes upon; and what greater confidence of certainty can be expreſt! And yet ſhall man be proud of Wit? O what is man! How dark, how ſottiſh and mad a thing! All theſe great Princes, Doctors, Cardinals, Univerſities and Kingdoms, are Born with Natures as capacious as ours. They are in other things as wiſe: They pity us as Hereticks, becauſe we will not ceaſe to be men: The Infidel that denieth mans Reaſon and Immortality, would but level us with the Brutes, and allow us the pre-eminence among them in ſubtlety: But all theſe Papiſts Forſwear or Renounce that Senſe which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Brutes and us, and ſentence us either <hi>below</hi> the Brutes, or unto Hell. Pretend no more, poor man, to great knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the ſight of a Grave and a rotten Carcaſs may humble the Fool that is proud of Beauty, ſo the thought of the Popiſh, Mahometan and Heathen World, may humble him that is proud of his underſtanding. I tell thee, man, thou art capable of that madneſs as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that an Ox or an Onion is a God; or to believe that a bit of Bread is God; yea more, to believe as neceſſary to Salvation that thy own and all mens ſenſes about their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects are deceived, and the Bread which thou ſeeſt and eateſt is no Bread; yea though it be three times in the three next verſes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Called <hi>Bread</hi> after Conſecration by an inſpired Expoſitor of Chriſts words.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Moreover the poverty of mans underſtanding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the great <hi>time and labour</hi> that muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed for Knowledge: We muſt be Learning as ſoon as we have the uſe of reaſon, and all our Life muſt be beſtowed in it; I know by experience; Knowledge will not be got, without <hi>long, hard</hi> and patient ſtudies; O what abundance of Books muſt we read! What abundance of deep Meditations muſt we uſe! What help of Teachers, do we need? And when all's done, how little do we obtain? Is this an Intellect to be proud of?</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:55434:85"/>X. And it is obſervable how every man ſlighteth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Reaſons, while he would have all to magnify his own. All the Arguments that in diſputation are uſed againſt him, how frivolous and fooliſh are they? All the Books that are written againſt him, are little better than Nonſence, or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or Blaſphemy. Contempt is anſwer enough to moſt that is ſaid againſt them. And yet the men in other mens Eyes, are perhaps wiſer and better than themſelves. Moſt men are fools in the judgment of others! Whatever ſide or party you are of, there are many parties againſt you, who all pity your ignorance, and judge you ſilly deceived Souls. So that if one man be to be believed of another, and if the moſt of mankind be not deceived, we are all poor ſilly cheated Souls: But if moſt be deceived, mankind is a very deceivable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. How know I that I muſt believe you when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool twenty other Sects, any more than I ſhould believe thoſe twenty Sects when they as confidently befool you; if no other Evidence turn the Scales?</p>
               <p n="11">XI. And verily I think that the <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Contentions,</hi> and Diſtractions of the Kingdoms of the World, do ſhew us that man is a pitiful, ſilly deceiveable thing. I am not at all ſo ſharp againſt Wars and Souldiers as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was; But I ſhould think that if men were wiſe, they might keep their peace, and ſave the lives of thouſands, which muſt be dearly anſwered for. Were all the Princes of Chriſtendom as wiſe as proud wits conceit themſelves to be, how eaſy were it for them to agree among themſelves, and equally to diſtribute the charge of two or three Armies, which might quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhake in pieces the Turks Dominions, and recover <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and free the Greek Church from their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. And what need we more than every days miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to tell us of our folly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Do we not miſs it in one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or other in almoſt all that we take in hand! Hence cometh the ruine of Eſtates, the ill education of Children,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55434:85"/>
the diſſentions among Neighbours and in Families: Parents have ſcarce wit enough to breed and teach a Child; Nor Husbands and Wives to live together according to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; nor Maſters to teach their Servants. If I write a Book how many can find folly and errour in it: And I as eaſily in theirs. If I Preach, how many faults can the ſillieſt Woman find in it: And I as many perhaps in other mens. Do we <hi>live</hi> in ſuch weakneſs, and ſhall we not know it?</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. And the uncureableneſs of <hi>ancient errours</hi> is no ſmall evidence of our folly: If our anceſtors have but been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived before us, though their errour be never ſo Palpable, we plead their venerable antiquity, for an honour to their Ignorance and miſtakes: The wiſdom of wiſe anceſtors almoſt dieth with them; But the errours of the miſtaken muſt be Succeſſive, leſt they be diſhonoured. We will deny reaſon, and deny Scripture, and deny ſenſe for fear of being wiſer for our Souls than ſome of our forefathers were.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The <hi>ſelf-deſtroying courſes</hi> of mankind, one would think ſhould be enough to evince mans folly. Who almoſt ſuffer but by themſelves? Few ſickneſſes befall us which folly brings not on us by exceſs of Eating or Drinking, or by ſloth or ſome unwiſe neglect. Few ruines of Eſtates but by our own folly! Few calamities in Families and Relations but by our ſelves! What Churches diſtracted and ruined, but by the Paſtors and Children of the Church themſelves! What Kingdom ruined without its own procurement. It need not be ſaid, <hi>Quos perdere vult Jupiter hos dementat</hi>; It is enough to ſay, <hi>Inſaniam eorum non curat</hi>: If he cure not our madneſs, we ſhall certainly deſtroy our ſelves. Whoſe hands kindled all the flames that have waſted the Glory, Wealth and Peace of <hi>England</hi> in State and Church except our own? Were they Forreign Enemies that did it, and ſtill keep open our wounds, or is it our ſelves? And yet are we wiſe men?</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:55434:86"/>XV. But the greateſt evidence in all the world of the madneſs of Mankind, is the <hi>obſtinate ſelf-deſtruction of all the ungodly.</hi> Conſider but 1. The weight of the Caſe; 2. The plainneſs of the Caſe; 3. The means uſed to undeceive them; 4. And yet the number of the madly erroneous; and then bethink you what man's Underſtanding is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is their Souls and everlaſting Hopes that are caſt away! It is no leſs than Heaven and Endleſs Happineſs which they reject: It is no better than Hell and Endleſs Miſery which they run into; and are theſe men in their wits?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is themſelves that do all this; neither Man nor Devils elſe could do it: They do it for nothing: What have the wretches for their Salvation! a few cups of drink; a filthy Whore; a little preferment or proviſion for a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible fleſh, which muſt ſhortly lie and rot in darkneſs: The applauſe and breath of flatterers as ſilly as themſelves. O profane perſons, worſe than <hi>Eſau,</hi> who will fell their birth-right for ſo poor a morſel! Come ſee the madneſs of Mankind! It is a doubt to them whether God or a filthy luſt ſhould be more loved and obeyed! It is a doubt with them whether Heaven or Earth be better worth their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour! Whether Eternity or an inch of Time; whether a <hi>Soul</hi> or a periſhing Body ſhould be more cared for! Are theſe wiſe men? Did I ſay, <hi>It is a doubt?</hi> yea their <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> ſheweth that at the preſent they are reſolved: Vanity, and ſhadows and dreams are preferred: Heaven is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: They are lovers of pleaſure more than God: They ſet leſs than a Feather in the ballance againſt more than all the world, and they chuſe the firſt, and neglect the latter! This is the wiſe world!</p>
               <p n="3">3. And all this they do, againſt common reaſon, againſt daily teaching of appointed Paſtors, againſt the Judgment of the Learnedeſt and Wiſeſt men in the world; againſt the expreſs Word of God; againſt the obligation of daily mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55434:86"/>
againſt the warnings of many afflictions; againſt the experience of all the world, who pronounce all this <hi>Vanity</hi> which they ſell their Souls for; even while men die daily before their Eyes, and they are certain that they muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die themſelves; while they walk over the Church-yard, and tread on the Graves of thoſe that went before them; yet will they take no warning, but neglect God and their Souls, and ſin on to the very death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And this is not the caſe only of here and there one; we need not go to <hi>Bedlam</hi> to ſeek them. Alas! in how much more honoured and ſplendid habitations and conditions may they be found! In what reverend and honourable garbs! And in how great numbers throughout the world! And theſe are not only Sots and Idiots, that never were told of better things; but thoſe that would be accounted <hi>witty,</hi> or men of Learning and venerable aſpect and eſteem. But this is a ſubject that we uſe to Preach on to the people; it being eaſie, by a multitude of arguments, to prove the <hi>Madneſs</hi> of all ungodly perſons. And is this nothing to humble us, who were naturally like them, and who, ſo far as we are ſinners, are, alas! too like them ſtill?</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. And the <hi>fewneſs</hi> of <hi>wiſe men</hi> in all <hi>Profeſſions,</hi> doth tell us how rare true Wiſdom is: Among men, whoſe <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> lieth in <hi>Speculation,</hi> where the <hi>Effects</hi> of it do not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difference it much from <hi>Prefidence,</hi> the difference is not commonly diſcerned: A prating Speculator goeth for a wiſe man: But in Practicals the difference appeareth by the Effects. All men ſee, that among Phyſicians and Lawyers, thoſe that are excellent are few. And even among the Godly Preachers of the Goſpel, O that it were more eaſie and common, to meet with men ſuited to the majeſty, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, greatneſs, neceſſity and holineſs of their works, that ſpeak <hi>to God,</hi> and <hi>from God,</hi> like Divines indeed, and have the true frame of found Theology ready in their Heads and Hearts; and that in publick and private ſpeak to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55434:87"/>
as beſeemeth thoſe that believe that they and we are at the door of Eternity, and that we ſpeak, and they hear for the life of Souls, and that are uncertain whether ever they ſhall ſpeak again. Alas! Lord, thy Treaſure is not only in Earthen Veſſels, but how ordinarily in polluted Veſſels, and how common are empty ſounding Veſſels, or ſuch as have Dirt or Air inſtead of holy Treaſure!</p>
               <p>And as for Philoſophers and Judicious Speculators in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, do I need to ſay, that the number is too ſmall? Of ſuch as are able judiciouſly to reſolve a difficulty, to anſwer Caſes of Conſcience, to defend the Truth, to ſtop the mouths of all gainſayers, and to Teach holy Doctrine clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in true Method, without confuſion, or running into any extreams? We bleſs God this Land, and the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, have had a laudable degree of this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: The Lord reſtore it to them and us, and continue the comfortable meaſure that we poſſeſs.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. And it is a notorious diſcovery of the common Ignorance, that a <hi>wiſe man</hi> is ſo hardly <hi>known</hi>: And men that have not wiſdom to <hi>imitate</hi> them, have not wit enough to value them: So that as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that will have the pleaſure of wiſdom, muſt be content with it for it ſelf, without Applauſe: Two or three approvers muſt ſuffice him.</hi> The Blind know not who hath the beſt Eye-ſight.

               <p n="18">XVIII. And this leadeth me to the next diſcovery, How rare wiſdom is in the world, in that the wiſeſt men and Learnedſt Teachers have ſo ſmall Succeſs. How few are much the wiſer for them? If they praiſe them, they will not Learn of them, till they reach to their degree. Men may delight in the ſweetneſs of truth themſelves; but it is a Feaſt where few will ſtrive for part with them. A very few men that have firſt ſprung up in obſcure times have had great Succeſs; So had <hi>Origine</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but with bitter ſauce. <hi>Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> at <hi>Hippo</hi> had the moſt that Hiſtory maketh mention of (with <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> in Oratory;) <hi>Melanchthon</hi> at <hi>Wittenberge</hi> (with <hi>Luther</hi>) and <hi>Zwinglius</hi> in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> at <hi>Geneva</hi> prevailed much: And now and then an age hath been fruitful of Learned, Wiſe and Godly men: And when we are ready to expect, that each of theſe ſhould have a multitude of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars like themſelves, ſuddenly all declineth, and Ignorance and Senſuality get uppermoſt again. And all this is becauſe that all men are born <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Senſual</hi>; But no man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to any excellency of Wiſdom, without ſo long and laborious ſtudies, as the fleſh will give leave to few men to perform. So that he that hath moſt laboriouſly ſearcht for knowledge all his days, knoweth not how to make others partakers of it: No not his own Children of whom he hath the education: Unleſs it be here and there one <hi>Scaliger,</hi> one <hi>Paraeus,</hi> one <hi>Toſſanus,</hi> one <hi>Trelcatius,</hi> one <hi>Voſſius,</hi> &amp;c. how few excellent men do leave one excellent Son behind them! O what would a wiſe man give, that he could but

bequeath all his wiſdom to others when he dieth.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. And it's evident that great Knowledge is more rare than <hi>Prefidence,</hi> in that the hardeſt Students, and moſt knowing men, complain more than others of <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Ignorance.</hi> When certainly other men have more cauſe. They that ſtudy a little, know little, and think they know much: They that ſtudy very hard, but not to maturity, oft become Sceptick, and think nothing certain. But they that follow it till they have digeſted their ſtudies, do find a certainty in the great and neceſſary things, but confeſs their ignorance in abundance of things which the preſumptuous are confident in. I will not leave this out, to eſcape the carping of thoſe that will ſay, that by this Character I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim my ſelf one of the wiſeſt, as long as it is but the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my Ignorance which is their occaſion. But I will ſay as <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to <hi>Hierome,</hi> Epiſt. 29. <hi>Adverſus eos qui ſibi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur ſcire quod neſciunt, hoc tutiores ſumus, quod hanc ignoranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am noſtram non ignoramus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">XX. Laſtly, Every mans <hi>nature,</hi> in the midſt of his <hi>pride,</hi> is conſcious of the <hi>Fallibility</hi> and <hi>Frailty</hi> of his own <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> And thence it is that men are ſo fearful in great matters of being over-reacht. And where ever any concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dependeth upon a contexture of many proofs, or on any long, operous work of Reaſon, men have a natural conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the uncertainty of it. Yea though our Doctrines of the <hi>Immortality</hi> of our own Souls, and of the Life of Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution after this, and the Truth of the Goſpel, have ſo much certain Evidence as they have, yet a <hi>Lively certain Faith</hi> is the more rare and difficult, becauſe men are ſo conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the fallibility of their own underſtandings, that about things unſeen &amp; unſenſible, they are ſtill apt to doubt, whether they be not deceived in their apprehenſions of the Evidence.</p>
               <p>By theſe twenty inſtances it is too plain that there is little ſolid wiſdom in the world; that wiſe men are few, and thoſe few are but a little wiſe. And ſhould not this ſuffice to make

all men, but eſpecially the unlearned, half-learned, the young and unexperienced, to abate their ungrounded confidence and to have humble and ſuſpicious thoughts of their own apprehenſions.</p>

                  </note>I Have been my ſelf oft Scandalized at the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the 4th <hi>Carthage</hi> Council, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad Biſhops the reading of the Heathens Books; and at ſome good old unlearned Chriſtian Biſhops who ſpake to the ſame purpoſe, and oft reproach <hi>Apollinaris, Aetius</hi> and other Hereticks for their Secular or gentile Learning, Logick, &amp;c. And I wondered that <hi>Julian</hi> and they ſhould prohibit the ſame thing. But one that is ſo far diſtant from the action, is not a competent Judge of the reaſons of it. Perhaps there were ſome Chriſtian Authors then, who were ſufficient for ſuch literature as was beſt for the Church: Perhaps they ſaw that the danger of reading the Heathens Philoſophy was like to be greater than the benefit: Both becauſe it was them that they lived among, and were to gather the Churches out of, and if they put an honour upon Logick and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, they might find it more difficult to draw men from that party which excelled in it, to the belief of the Scriptures which ſeemed to have ſo little of it: And they had ſeen alſo how a mixture of Platonick notions with Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, had not only been the Original of many hereſies, but had ſadly blemiſhed many great Doctors of the Churches.</p>
               <p>Whatever the cauſe was, it appeareth that in thoſe days it was the deepeſt inſight into the Sacred Scriptures which was reckoned for the moſt ſolid Learning; Philoſophy was ſo confounded by Differences, Sects, Uncertainties, and Falſhoods, that made it the more deſpicable, by how much
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55434:89"/>
the leſs pure. And Logick had ſo many precarious Rules and Notions, as made it fitter to wrangle and play with, than to further grave men in their deep and ſerious enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the great things of God, and myſteries of Salvation.</p>
               <p>But yet it cannot be denied but that true Learning of the Subſervient Arts and Sciences is of ſo great uſe, to the accompliſhing of mans mind with wiſdom, that it is one of the greateſt offences that ever was taken againſt Chriſt and the holy Scriptures, that ſo little of this Learning is found in them, in compariſon of what is in <hi>Plato, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle, Demoſthenes,</hi> or <hi>Cicero.</hi> But to remove the danger of this offence, let theſe things following be well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Every means is to be judged of by its aptitude to its proper uſe and end: <hi>Morality</hi> is the <hi>ſubject and buſineſs</hi> of the Scriptures: It is not the work of it to teach men Logick and Philoſophy, any more than to teach them Languages: Who will be offended with Chriſt for not teaching men La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Greek, or Hebrew, Architecture, Navigation, or Mechanick Arts? And why ſhould they be more offended with him for not teaching them Aſtronomy, Geometry, Phyſicks, Metaphyſicks, Logick, &amp;c. It was none of his work.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Nature</hi> is preſuppoſed to <hi>Grace</hi>; and God in <hi>Nature</hi> had before given man <hi>ſufficient helps</hi> to the attainment of ſo much of the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> as was convenient for him. Philoſophy is the knowledge of Gods works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was not this (at leaſt chiefly) that man loſt by his fall: It was from God, and not from the Creature that he turned: And it was to the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, rather than of the <hi>Creature</hi> that he was to be reſtored. What need one be ſent from Heaven to teach men the order and rules of ſpeaking? Or to teach men thoſe Arts and Sciences which they can otherwiſe learn themſelves. As it is preſuppoſed that men have reaſon, ſo that they have among them the common helps and crutches of reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:55434:90"/>III. The truth is, it is much to be ſuſpected, leſt as an <hi>inordinate deſire</hi> of <hi>Creature-knowledge</hi> was a great part of our firſt Parents ſin; ſo it hath accordingly corrupted our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with an anſwerable vicious inclination thereunto: Not that the thing in it ſelf is evil to know Gods works; but good and deſireable in its <hi>place</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi>: But it is ſuch a <hi>good</hi> as by <hi>inordinacy</hi> may become a dangerous evil: Why ſhould we not judge of this deſire of knowing the Creatures, as we do of other Creature-affections? It is lawful and meet to <hi>love all Gods</hi> Creatures: His works are good, and therefore amiable. And yet I think no man is damned but by the inordinate loving of the Creature, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Heart from the love of God. And as our <hi>Appetites</hi> are lawful and neceſſary in themſelves; and yet Natures pravity conſiſteth much in the prevalency of them againſt reaſon, which is by <hi>reaſons infirmity,</hi> and the <hi>inordinacy</hi> of the ſenſitive Appetite; even ſo a deſire to <hi>know</hi> Gods works, is natural and good; but its inordinateneſs is our pravity and a ſinful Luſt.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs the mind and phantaſie may find a kind of <hi>pleaſure</hi> in <hi>knowing,</hi> which is according to the <hi>nature</hi> and uſe of the thing known. When it is vain or low, and baſe, the pleaſure is vain, and low, and baſe! When the object is enſnaring and diverting from higher things, it doth this principally by <hi>delight.</hi> Verily this inordinate deſire of <hi>Creature-knowledge</hi> is a <hi>Luſt,</hi> a vicious <hi>Luſt.</hi> I have been guilty of it in ſome meaſure my ſelf ſince I had the uſe of reaſon. I have lived a Life of conſtant pleaſure, gratifying my Intellect and Phantaſie with ſeeking to <hi>know</hi> as much as I could know: And if I could not ſay truly, that I referred it as a means to the knowledge and love of God, I ſhould ſay that it was <hi>all ſin:</hi> But becauſe I have loved it too much <hi>for it ſelf,</hi> and not referred it to God more purely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, I muſt confeſs that it was never blameleſs.</p>
               <p>And the corruption of the nobleſt faculty is the worſt:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55434:90"/>
The delights of Eating, Drinking, Venery, are the matter of common Senſuality, when they are inordinately deſired: And is not the inordinate deſire of <hi>Creature-knowledge,</hi> (if it be deſired from the like principle, and to the like ends) as bad or worſe in ſome reſpects. Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I am ſure that it doth as much take up and pre-poſſeſs the mind, which ſhould be employed on God, and take up thoſe thoughts and affections which ſhould be holy. Tell me why one man ſhould be accounted carnal and ungodly, for delighting to ſee his <hi>own</hi> Houſes, Fields, Woods, Corn, Rivers, Cattle, &amp;c. rather than another that hath as much delight to peruſe a Map of pleaſant Countreys (ſetting aſide the covetous deſire of <hi>having much.</hi>) Do we not juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it as unfit a work for the Lords day to be for pleaſure peruſing Maps, as to be for pleaſure viewing the Woods and Fields? Many a poor Student is as long and perilouſly entangled in his thoughts and affections, and kept from God and Heaven, and Holineſs, by deep ſtudy of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, Cuſtoms, Countreys, Chronology, Logick, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, Mathematicks, Metaphyſicks, Law, &amp;c. as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are by over-minding the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it waſteth their precious <hi>time</hi> as much as other Luſts do. One Senſualiſt ſpendeth his hours in Gaming, Feaſting, Wantonneſs, idle Courtſhip, Hunting, Hawking, Bowling, and other Exceſs of Sports: Another ſpends his precious time in hearing Comedies; and another in reading Play-Books and Romances; and another in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true and uſeful Hiſtory, and other parts of uſeful Learning: And though the matter of the latter be <hi>better</hi> than the former, a man may make up the ſame ſenſuality in one as in the other; in reading Mathematicks or Hiſtory, as in reading or beholding, and hearing Comedies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And ſome turn this Learning to as powerful a <hi>perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of the mind, as others do their ſenſual delights. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think ſo highly of their Languages and Chronology, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55434:91"/>
Philoſophy, that ſecretly they are drawn by it to deſpiſe the Goſpel, and to think a holy Life to be but an Employment for Women, &amp; Perſons that live more by Affection than by Judgment: So perniciouſly doth Learning make them Mad.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And abundance make it the Fuel of their pride, and think that they are excellent Perſons, becauſe they have got ſome Ornaments of the mind; as vain Women are proud of fine clothes inſtead of real comelineſs and worth. I will not diſhonour ſome famous Writers by naming them here, leſt I ſeem to take down their due praiſe. But in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral I may ſay, that it is more than one, of our late fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Philological and Grammatical Criticks, who openly ſhew ſo much pride of their kind of wordy knowledge, as may warn humble men to fear ſuch temptations, and to ſee that this Learning may be made a ſnare.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And the worſt of all is, that while ſuch Learned men think highly of themſelves for that, they are kept from the knowledge and ſenſe of their ſinful corruption and miſery, and feel not the need of a Saviour and a Sanctifier; they cry not for Grace; they ſeek not after God and everlaſting happineſs; they neglect a holy heavenly Life: They take up ſome eaſie formalities and words to make up an Image of Religion of; and then they think that (in their unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, unſanctified ſtate) they have as good right to be eſteemed godly, as any other, and if any queſtion it, they are accounted proud, ſelf-conceited Phanaticks, who appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate the reputation of holineſs to themſelves: And to queſtion a Learned Formaliſts ſincerity, (as <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius Severus</hi> did <hi>Ithacius</hi> his, and his Fellow Biſhops) is to expoſe himſelf to the cenſure of proud Hypocriſie. Yea, no man is ſo fit for Church preferment and honour, and to be the Governor of all the Religious Perſons and Affairs, as one of theſe unſanctified Learned men is in his own Eyes; from whence it is, that the ſtate of the Churches is ſo low in the Eaſt and Weſt (the <hi>Roman</hi> I mean) becauſe thoſe that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55434:91"/>
have truly no Religion muſt diſpoſe of Religion, and the Churches of Chriſt muſt be inſtructed and ruled by his real Enemies; and thoſe that hate godlineſs at the heart, muſt be the Teachers of godlineſs, and the chief managers of the ſacred work.</p>
               <p>Lay all this together, and think whether our <hi>inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> of common Learning, which is the <hi>knowledge of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> be not the fruit of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin.</p>
               <p>And if it prove ſo, conſider how far it was the work of Chriſt to <hi>cure it.</hi> Sure he was ſent to deſtroy the works of the Devil (Not <hi>Learning,</hi> but this <hi>Inordinate</hi> deſire of it.) And he was to mortify it in the ſame way, as he mortified other ſinful luſts. Therefore as he mortified venereous and all ſenſual Luſts, by holy example, and by condemning them, and calling men off them to ſpiritual delights; And as he mortified Worldlineſs in men, by living himſelf a life of Poverty and Inferiority in the World, and calling men off from the Love of the World, to the Love of God and Glory; Even ſo no wonder if he mortified in men, the inordinate deſire of greater knowledge, by calling them up to higher things, and ſhewing them the vanity of this alone. And as he ſaith, <hi>Love not the World, nor the things that are in the World; If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. When yet the <hi>ordinate love</hi> of the World is lawful: And as he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 6.27. <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth,</hi> when he meaneth, <hi>Labour not for it inordinately</hi>: Even ſo no wonder if Chriſt omit this common Philoſophy, and if <hi>Paul</hi> bid them take heed that none deceive them by vain <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> when it is the <hi>Inordinacy</hi> only which they condemn.</p>
               <p>If you ask me, <hi>when this deſire of common Learning is inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi>? I anſwer 1. When it's deſired <hi>moſt</hi> for the phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, ſenſual or intellectual Delight of <hi>Knowing</hi>! or from the overvaluing of the thing known? Not but a <hi>delight</hi> in <hi>knowledge</hi> as ſuch is good and lawful, but not as our Chief End. 2. When it is deſired as a ſtep to ſerve a proud aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55434:92"/>
mind, that we may be magnified as Learned men: or to ſerve any Worldly Covetous deſign. 3. When it is not duely ſubordinate and ſubſervient to the Love of God,<note place="margin">☞</note> and to his Service, and the Common good: If <hi>God be not firſt</hi> Intended, and all our Studies and Learning <hi>deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red purely</hi> as a <hi>means</hi> to God, that is, as a means to know him, and to love him, and to pleaſe him, and praiſe him, and do him ſervice in the World, and enjoy him for ever, but be deſired for it ſelf or Carnal Ends, it is a Carnal luſt. 4. When it hath a <hi>greater meaſure</hi> of our <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> and <hi>Induſtry</hi> comparatively than its due; and the ſtudy of higher things is put behind it, or neglected by it, at leaſt in a great degree. 5. When it cometh not in due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but is taken firſt and in the hours and place which higher things ſhould have.</p>
               <p>In a word; God, and our duty to him, and the common good, and our Salvation, are the great and neceſſary things, in compariſon of which, all other things are vain: As <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> with its Appetite, may be uſed <hi>Holily,</hi> as God's mercies, to raiſe us unto ſpiritual delights, and to ſerve him the better our ſelves, and to be helpful to others: And for theſe ends they are given us, and may be ſought and uſed; when yet, as they are the fuel of Luſt, they are the ſnares of Satan, the Mammon, the God of this World, the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Souls: So is it with the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the creature; ſanctified and made ſerviceable to God and Holineſs, it is of great utility; but out of its place it is poiſon and perdition.</p>
               <p>Yea, as Appetite and Senſual Delight is <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> while we are in a body in which the Soul muſt <hi>operate</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>: Even ſo is ſome <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Creatures</hi> and <hi>common</hi> things (called Learning) of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> as a means to better. And while we ſee, as in a glaſs, we muſt not caſt away the glaſs, nor neglect it, though it be but a help to ſee the ſpecies.</p>
               <p>I conclude then, 1. That it is hard to ſay that any man
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55434:92"/>
can <hi>know too much,</hi> except it be, 1. Matter of Temptation: 2. And of penal Knowledge, raiſing terrours, and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul. In theſe two caſes we may know too much; And I fear ſome mens knowledge is much of the firſt ſort. But ſo far am I from diſſwading any from true knowledge, or ſtudies to attain it, that I think <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the Mother, as <hi>Pride</hi> is the Father of all hereſies, and almoſt all ſins: And that the lazy ſtudent ſhall never be wiſe, though one may take his years in the Univerſity, the greatneſs of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, or the titles which he hath obtained, inſtead of <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>; and another as ſlothful, may boaſt that the <hi>Spirit</hi> hath ſaved him the labour of long and hard ſtudies; for my part I ſhall account both ſorts as they are, and leave them to be admired by ſuch as themſelves: And verily they have their reward. He that will be wiſe, muſt ſpare no pains, and be diverted by no worldly things, but take wiſdom for his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare here, and the <hi>getting</hi> and <hi>uſing it</hi> for all his work. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſlothful, or impatient, or preſumptuous perſon wiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath not made and ſet before us his works in vain:<note place="margin">Pſal. 111,</note> Great and wonderful are all his works, ſought out of them that have pleaſure therein: The Image of his Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs is imprinted on them all. Who can look up to the Sun and Moon and Stars; to the vaſt and numerous Globes above us; to this Earth and all its furniture and inhabitants, and not ſee the footſteps of the Great and Wiſe, and Good Creator, and be edified and made more holy; that doth not uſe the Eye of ſenſe alone, while he winketh with the eye of reaſon? Our Redeemer came to recover us to the <hi>Knowledge, Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> of our Creator, and by <hi>Faith</hi> to lead us up to the love of God, and to ſanctifie us to our Makers praiſe and Service. Far was it from his deſign to call us from ſtudying the works of Creation; which he prepareth us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to underſtand and uſe: Nor would he deprive Reaſon of its Spectacles, but help us to better, than we had before.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55434:93"/>
Mans wit and Tongue are apt to be ſo irregular, that we have need of the Rules of true Logick to keep them to order, and ſave them from deceit. Too little true Logick and Philoſophy is much of their unhappineſs who think they have enough, to deſerve veneration and applauſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But all this is dreaming, inſignificant, incoherent non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, deliration, worſe than Childrens chat (as it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the world more) if God be not the <hi>Beginning, Guide,</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of it, and if we know not how to pleaſe him and be ſaved; And if all Learning be not directly or indirectly a Learning to know God and life eternal: When Conſcience is awakened all things are as dreams and ſignify nothing in compariſon of God and Life eternal, to be obtained by Chriſt. When men come to die, the moſt Learned die in this mind. And further than it is Divine and Holy and Felicitating, they cry out of all their Fame and Learning, Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity. Though Learning be the moſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did of all Vanities: <hi>Fear God and Keep his Commandments,</hi> is the end of true Learning, and the <hi>whole</hi> Learning of <hi>Man.</hi> Of writing many Books there is no end; and much reading is a wearineſs to the fleſh, and he that increaſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Contracteth Envy and Contradiction, and increaſeth ſorrow: But ſanctified Learning maketh a man indeed; ſo it be true, and not falſe pretended Learning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore the induſtry of a mans ſtudy, the moſt of his time, the Zeal of his Soul, muſt be laid out on God, and the great and endleſs concernments of his own and others Souls; And <hi>Learning</hi> muſt be <hi>Deſired, Eſteemed, Sought</hi> and <hi>Uſed,</hi> according to its uſefulneſs to theſe high and glorious Ends: Then it is the lower part of wiſdom: Which all that want it muſt eſteem and honour, and deſire: Elſe it is a dream and folly, which leaveth the awakened Soul in ſhame. But I have been too long on this.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Conſider next, that as this lower ſort of Learning
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55434:93"/>
is <hi>preſuppoſed</hi> by Chriſt <hi>as true,</hi> and the deſire of it <hi>Cured</hi> as it is a luſt; ſo <hi>Plainneſs</hi> and Intelligibleneſs were altogether neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his ends; what came he on Earth to do, but to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to God, and make known his Kingdom, and his Love to ſinners: To procure us pardon and a Spirit of Vivificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Illumination, and Sanctification? And the word that muſt be the means of this muſt be fitted to its end, and be intelligible to the unlearned; or elſe he ſhould have been the Saviour of a few Learned men only, and not of the World. Kings and Parliaments write their Laws in a ſtile ſuitable to the matter: And ſo do men draw up their Covenants; and Princes their Pardons, and Phyſicians their Bills and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections: And none of theſe uſeth to write a Grammar or Logick inſtead of their proper work, nor to fill their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with Ludicrous, Logical Tricks, and Toys. He that is but to tell men how to be ſaved from ſin and Hell, and brought to Heaven, and live ſo here that he may live with God and Angels for ever, muſt ſpeak in plainneſs and in good earneſt.</p>
               <p n="5">V. And conſider that the Scripture is not void of ſo much Logick and Philoſophy as is ſuitable to its deſign. In a well fleſht body the diſtinction and compagination of the parts are hid, which in an ugly Sceleton are diſcerned. So the Scripture is a Body of Eſſentials, Integrals and Accidentals of Religion, and every unſtudied fellow cannot anatomize it: But it hath its real and excellent Method, for all that it is hid to the unskilful. There is a <hi>Method</hi> of Scripture Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, which is the moſt accurate that ever the World knew in Morality. I have drawn up the Body of Theology into Schemes. In which I doubt not but I have ſhewn, that the Method of Theology contained in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is more accurate than any Logical Author doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe: And the Lords Prayer and Decalogue, eſpecially will prove this, when truly opened: And the Doctrine of of the Trinity and the Baptiſmal Covenant, is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all true method of Phyſicks, and Morality in the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55434:94"/>
World. What if a novice cannot Anatomize <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes,</hi> doth it follow that they are immethodical? <hi>Brand-miller</hi> and <hi>Flaccher</hi> upon the Scripture Text, and <hi>Steph. Tzegedine, Sohnius, Gomarus, Dudley Fenner,</hi> and many others upon the Body of Theology have gone far in opening the Scripture Method. But more may be yet done.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Conſider alſo that the Eternal <hi>Wiſdom, Word</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> of God our Redeemer, is the Fountain and giver of all Knowledge: <hi>Nature</hi> to be reſtored, and <hi>Grace</hi> to reſtore it, are in his hands. He is that true Light that lighteneth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that cometh into the World: The Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Arts, and Sciences are from his Spirit and Teaching, as well as the Goſpel. Whether <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> and ſome other Ancients were in the right or not, when they taught that Philoſophy is one way by which men come to Salvation, it is certain that they are in the right, that ſay it is now the gift of Chriſt: And that as the Light which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before Sun-riſing (yea which in the night is reflected from the Moon,) is from the Sun, as well as its more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Beams; So the Knowledge of <hi>Socrates, Plato, Zeno, Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, Antonine, Epictetus, Seneca, Plutarch,</hi> were from the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of God, the Redeemer of the World even by a lower gift of his Spirit, as well as the Goſpel and higher illumination: And ſhall Chriſt be thought void, of what he giveth to ſo many in the World?</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, Let it be conſidered above all that the grand difference between the teaching of Chriſt and other men, is that he <hi>teacheth effectively</hi> (as God ſpake when he Created, and as he ſaid to <hi>Lazarus, Ariſe.</hi>) <hi>He giveth wiſdom</hi> by giving the Holy Ghoſt: All other Teachers ſpeak but to the <hi>Ears</hi>; but he only ſpeaketh to the Heart: Were it not for this he would have no Church.— I ſhould never have elſe believed in him my ſelf, nor would any other, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſavingly. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeak but words, but Chriſt ſpeaketh LIFE and LIGHT, and LOVE, in all
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55434:94"/>
Countreys, through all Ages to this day. This above all is his witneſs in the World. He will not do his work on Souls, by ludicrous enticing words of the Pedantick wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the World; but by illuminating Minds, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hearts and Lives by his effectual operations on the Heart. God uſed not more Rhetorick nor Logick than a Philoſopher, when he ſaid only <hi>[Let there be Light,]</hi> but he uſed more <hi>Power.</hi> Indeed the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> (though abuſed by Ignorants and Cabaliſts) hath more true Philoſophy in it than the preſumptuous will underſtand, (as my worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Samuel Gott</hi> lately gone to God, hath manifeſted in his excellent Philoſophy, (excepting the ſtyle and ſome few preſumptions.) But <hi>operations</hi> are the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oratory of God, and his wiſdom ſhineth in his works, and in things beſeeming the Heavenly Majeſty, and not in childiſh Laces and Toys of Wit.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore ceaſe quarrelling, and learn wiſdom of God, inſtead of teaching and reprehending him. Let us magnifie the mercy and wiſdom of our Redeemer, who hath brought Life and Immortality to light, and certified us of the matters of the World above, as beſeemed a Meſſenger ſent from God; and hath taught us according to the <hi>matter</hi> and our <hi>capacity,</hi> and not with trifling childiſh notions.</p>

                  <p>Of the Cauſes of this Diſeaſe of Prefidence, or Proud Pretended Knowledge, in order to the Cure.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Cure of <hi>Prefidence</hi> and <hi>pretended knowledge</hi> could it be wrought, would be the Cure of Souls, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Churches and Kingdoms. But alas, how low are our hopes? yet that may be done on ſome, which will not be done on <hi>all</hi> or <hi>moſt.</hi> And to know the <hi>cauſes,</hi> and <hi>oppugn</hi> them, is the chief part of the Cure, ſo far as it may be hoped for.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt and grand cauſe is the very Nature of <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> it ſelf; which many ways diſableth men, from <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that which ſhould abate their <hi>groundleſs confidence.</hi> For
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55434:95"/>
1. An ignorant man knoweth but little <hi>parcels</hi> and <hi>ſcraps</hi> of things: And all the reſt is unknown to him: Therefore he fixeth upon that <hi>little</hi> which he <hi>knoweth,</hi> and having no knowledge of the reſt, he cannot regulate his narrow appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions by any conceptions of them. And all things viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us (not light it ſelf excepted which as ſeen by us is Fire incorporated in Air) being Compounds, the very <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> of them, is not known where any Conſtitutive part is unknown. And in all Compounds each part hath ſuch relation and uſefulneſs to others, that one part which ſeemeth known is it ſelf but half known, for want of the knowledge of others. Such a kind of knowledge is theirs that knowing only what they ſee, do take a Clock or Watch to be only the Index moving by the Hours, being ignorant of all the cauſal parts within: Or that know no more of a Tree or other Plant, than the Magnitude, Site, Colour, Odour, &amp;c. Or that take a man to be only a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without a Soul; or the Body to be only the Skin and Parts diſcerned by the Eye in converſe.</p>
               <p>Now that which ſuch perſons do <hi>ſenſibly apprehend,</hi> they are <hi>confident</hi> of, becauſe that Nature teacheth them to truſt their ſenſes: But not knowing <hi>the reſt,</hi> their little partial conceptions are lame, defective and deceitful. For moſt will hence raſhly conclude of the Negative, that <hi>There is no more,</hi> becauſe they know no more. But if any be more wiſe and modeſt, yet do they want the conception of the unknown parts, to make the reſt to be true Knowledge, or to tell them what is yet unknown: And ſuch uſe to turn a Judicial Rule, into a Phyſical, that <hi>non apparere</hi> &amp; <hi>non eſſe</hi> are to them all one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And an <hi>Ignorant man</hi> doth not know what <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions other men have</hi> of the ſame things which he is ignorant of: So that he neither knoweth the <hi>thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible</hi> (what it is) nor yet the <hi>Act of Knowing</hi> it, which he never had: But as a man born blind hath no formal
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55434:96"/>
conception either of <hi>ſight,</hi> or of <hi>light,</hi> or <hi>viſible objects</hi>; ſo is it here.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor hath he uſually a true <hi>Knowledge of his own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>; how imperfect his underſtanding is, and how much to be ſuſpected, as liable to miſtake: Though in ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible matters it is eaſie to convince men of a <hi>total Ignorance</hi>; yet when they <hi>know any thing,</hi> it is hard to convince them what more is to be known, and to keep them from falſe and haſty concluſions. A man that cannot read at all, is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily convinced that he cannot read: But he that can read a little, is apt to think that he readeth rightly when he doth not. A man that never heard of Phyſick, is eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he hath no skill in it: But if he have read, heard of, and tryed a few Medicines, he is apt to grow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, and venture mens lives upon his skill. A man that never ſaw Building, Navigation, or any Art or Manufacture, is eaſily convinced that he is ignorant of it: But if he have got ſome ſmattering knowledge, he is ready to think that it is more than it is, becauſe he knoweth not what he wants.</p>
               <p>And to <hi>err,</hi> and <hi>know that a man erreth</hi> (at the ſame time, about the ſame thing) is a contradiction: For he that erreth judgeth a falſhood to be a truth: But to know that <hi>ſo to judge,</hi> is <hi>to err,</hi> is certainly <hi>not ſo to judge</hi>: For <hi>Intellectus vult verum,</hi> that is, <hi>Truth</hi> is the object which it is naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to. The ſame light which diſcovereth <hi>Errour</hi> cureth it: And that light which diſcovereth the <hi>Thing it ſelf,</hi> is it that muſt convince me that I before erred about it, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And an <hi>ignorant man</hi> doth not ſo much as know the <hi>difficulties</hi> of the caſe, and what may be ſaid on the other ſide: What contrary <hi>Evidence</hi> convinceth others, or what weight there is in the objections, which are or may be brought againſt him. So that all men being naturally ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and little being known for much that's unknown,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55434:96"/>
even to the wiſeſt; alas, the temptation to <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>falſe Confidence</hi> is ſo ſtrong, that few eſcape it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Another cauſe of it is, the <hi>Radical Maſter</hi> ſin of <hi>Pride:</hi> An unhumbled mind; never well acquainted with its own <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>erroneous condition,</hi> and its great need of natural and ſupernatural helps. I find it hard to convince men of this; but the formentioned Effects do certainly prove it. The Vice is Born with us at the very Heart. It is the Devils Image: He that is not naturally proud is not a Son of <hi>Adam</hi>: It liveth firſt, and dieth laſt: And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that a man is apter to be proud of than his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is his Humanity, and next to that of his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and of his <hi>Greatneſs.</hi> Men perceive not this in themſelves, becauſe they know not what <hi>Pride</hi> is while it ruleth in them. They think that it is only ſome womaniſh or child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh extrinſical Oſtentation, (boaſting) or perking up above others in Garb and Place, or Peacock-like looking upon their own Train, or ſetting it up for others to look on. But Pride is (as I ſaid before) an <hi>over-valuing our ſelves,</hi> and a <hi>deſire</hi> that <hi>others</hi> ſhould over-value us: And how few be there that be not tickled when their wiſdom is applauded, and netled when it is accounted ſmall: It's hard to bear to be accounted and reported a Fool, or a Perſon of little Wit. Many a man ſpendeth all the ſtudies of his Life, more for a <hi>Fame</hi> of Learning than for Learning it ſelf; what is <hi>Pride</hi> if this be not? What groſſer Pride, than for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or unexperienced Lad, to ſcorn and deſpiſe the eldeſt and hardeſt Students in Divinity as dark Souls in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of them? The Quakers in their Shops, when I go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <hi>London</hi> Streets, ſay, <hi>Alas, poor man, thou art yet in darkneſs: They have</hi> oft <hi>come</hi> into the Congregation, (when I had liberty to Preach Chriſts Goſpel) and cryed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me as a <hi>Deceiver of the people.</hi> They have followed me Home, <hi>Crying out in the Streets, The day of the Lord is coming, when thou ſhalt periſh as a Deceiver.</hi> They have ſtood
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55434:97"/>
in the Market-place, and under my Window year after year, Crying out to the people, <hi>Take heed of your Prieſts, they deceive your Souls</hi>: And if they ſaw any one wear a Lace or neat clothing, they cryed to me, <hi>Theſe are the fruit of thy Miniſtry.</hi> If they ſpake to me with greateſt ignorance or nonſence, it was with as much fury and rage, as if a bloody Heart had appeared in their Faces; ſo that though I never hurt, or occaſioned the hurt of one of them, that I know of, their truculent countenances told me what they would have done had I been in their power: (This was 1656, 57, 58, 59.) And yet they were poorly clothed: (Some of them went through the Streets ſtark naked) and cryed out over and over all the year, <hi>[Woe to the Proud.]</hi> Wonderful! wonderful! O the blindneſs of a corrupted mind! That theſe poor Souls did not perceive their ſuperlative <hi>Pride.</hi> How highly did theſe people think of their own <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> while they cryed down Laces, Points and Cuffs?</p>
               <p>And when did I ever know either a true <hi>Church-Tyrant,</hi> or a true <hi>Sectarian Separating</hi> Humoriſt, which were not both notorious proud over-valuers of their own conceits. To which thoſe that bowed not muſt be <hi>perſecuted as unruly</hi> Schiſmaticks by the one ſort, and Excommunicated, Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from, and Damned as Ungodly, Carnal or Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian by the other ſort?</p>
               <p>Several ways doth PRIDE cauſe <hi>pretended knowledge.</hi> 1. By thinking that our underſtandings are ſo good as that without great ſtudy we can know truth from falſhood; and ſo making us venture to judge of things at the firſt hearing or reading; which we cannot be capable of judging of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der long and diligent ſtudies: Becauſe <hi>recipitur ad modum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipientis.</hi> Therefore it is that when a man by great ſucceſs in Studies hath made things as plain as words can make them, ſo that you would think that all Students ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be wiſe at eaſie rates by the light which he hath ſet up to them, they are half as long in Learning for all that, as if
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55434:97"/>
he had never given <hi>them</hi> ſuch a help. And therefore it is that we cannot leave our Learning to Poſterity; Becauſe ſtill the ſtop is in the Receivers incapacity. And he cannot be capable of the plaineſt precepts, but by much time and ſtudy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Pride</hi> maketh men <hi>haſty in concluding,</hi> becauſe they are not humbled to a juſt Suſpicion of their own apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And men ſtay not to prove and try things, before they judge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Pride maketh men inſenſible how <hi>much</hi> they <hi>are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> of, in all their Knowledge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And it cauſeth men to ſlight the Reaſons and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of other men, by which they might learn, or at leaſt might be taught to Judge conſiderately, and ſuſpend their own.</p>
               <p>If over-valuing a mans own apprehenſions be <hi>Pride</hi> (<hi>as</hi> it is) then certainly <hi>Pride</hi> is one of the commoneſt ſins in the world, and particularly among men profeſſing godlineſs who upon every poor ſurmiſe or report are condemning thoſe that they do not throughly know, and in every petty contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, they are <hi>all ſtill</hi> in the right, though of never ſo many minds.</p>
               <p n="3">III Another cauſe of <hi>Pretended Knowledge</hi> is the want of a truly <hi>tender Conſcience</hi>: Which ſhould make men <hi>fear,</hi> leſt they ſhould <hi>err,</hi> leſt they ſhould deſerve the curſe of putting light for darkneſs, &amp; darkneſs for light; evil for good,<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.20.</note> &amp; good for evil: &amp; ſhould make them afraid leſt they ſhould defile their minds, reſiſt the truth, blaſpheme God or Diſhonour him, by fathering Errors on him, and leſt they ſhould prove ſnares to mens Souls, and a Scandal and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Church of God. A tender Conſcience would not have eſpouſed ſuch opinions under a year or two or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies deliberation, which an Antinomian, or other Sectary will take up in a few days, (if they were true.) O ſaith, the tender Conſcience, what if I ſhould Err, and prove a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55434:98"/>
Snare to Souls, and a Scandal and Diſhonour to the Church of God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Another cauſe of <hi>Pretended Knowledge</hi> is a blind <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs</hi> in the General, while men know not what it is that they are zealous of. They think that it is a neceſſary part of ſincerity, to receive the <hi>Truth</hi> ſpeedily without delay: And therefore they take a preſent <hi>concluding,</hi> for a <hi>true Receiving it.</hi> And he that ſooneſt taketh up that which is offered him, probably as a part of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is taken for the moſt reſolved down-right convert. Which is true in caſe of Evident Truths, where it is the will that by vice ſuſpendeth the mind. But not in dark and doubtful caſes.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Another cauſe is, an <hi>inordinate truſt in man:</hi> When ſome admire the learned too much, and ſome the Religious, and ſome this or that particular perſon, and therefore build too confidently on their words: Some on great men, ſome on the Multitude, but moſt on men of fame for great Learning, or great Piety. A credit is to be given by every learner to his Teacher: But the confounding this with o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Belief of God,</hi> and making it a part of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and not truſting man as man only, that is, as a fallible Wight, doth cauſe this Vice of <hi>Pretended Knowledge,</hi> to paſs with millions for Divine Faith. Eſpecially when men embody themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Sect</hi> as the only Orthodox or Godly party, or as the only true Church (as the Papiſts do) then it emboldeneth them to believe any <hi>thing</hi> which their Sect or Church believeth. For they think that this is the Churches Faith, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err, or is the ſafeſt: And that God would not let ſo many good men err. And thus they that ſhould be made their Teachers, and the Helpers of their Faith, become the Lords of it, and almoſt their Gods.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. And it much increaſeth this ſin, that men are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently acquainted with the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Additional Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of mans nature, and know not how <hi>Blind</hi> all <hi>Mankind</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:55434:98"/>
is. Alas man is a dark Creature! What error may he not hold. What villany may he not do? Yea and maintain? Truly ſaid <hi>David, All men are Liars.</hi> Pitifully do many expound this, as an effect of his unbelief and paſſion, becauſe he ſaith, (<hi>I ſaid it my haſte</hi>;] When it is no more than <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>Let God be true, and every man a Liar,</hi> Rom. 3. And than <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſay, <hi>All men are Vanity:</hi> And <hi>Jeremy, curſed be he that truſteth in man</hi>: All men are <hi>untruſty</hi> in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree! <hi>Weak, Falſe,</hi> and <hi>Bad.</hi> And his <hi>haſte</hi> was either as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> tranſlateth it, his <hi>Flight,</hi> or elſe that his Tryal and diſtreſs made him more paſſionately ſenſible of the <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or <hi>Untruſtineſs of man,</hi> than he was at other times. For <hi>Vanity</hi> and a <hi>Lie</hi> to the Hebrews were words of the ſame importance, ſignifying <hi>Deceivableneſs</hi> and <hi>untruſtineſs.</hi> And indeed among mankind there is ſo great a degree of <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, Selfiſhneſs, Timorouſneſs, Ignorance, Errour,</hi> and <hi>Viciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as that few wicked men are to be believed, where there is any ſtrong Temptation to lying. And the Devil is ſeldom unprovided of Temptations: And abundance of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are as <hi>untruſty</hi> as open wicked men: And abundance of ſincere Godly perſons, eſpecially Women, have looſe Tongues, and haſty paſſions, and a ſtretching Conſcience, but ſpecially injudicious heads, ſo that frequently they know not truth from falſhood, nor have the tenderneſs of Conſcience to be ſilent till they know: So that if one ſay it, another will ſay it, till a hundred ſay it, and then it goeth for currant truth.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55434:99"/>
and ſtories of pretended Miracles &amp; Revelations, that it made even <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> cry out of the ſhameful Ridiculous filth that hence had filled their <hi>Legends</hi>: Even <hi>Baronius</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tryal, retaineth no ſmall number of them, and with his Brethren the <hi>Oratorians</hi> on their Propheſying days told them to the people. I am aſhamed that I recited one out of him before my Treatiſe of <hi>Crucifying the World,</hi> though I did it not, as perſwading any that it was true: For I quickly ſaw, that <hi>Sophronious</hi> on whom he fathered it, was none of the reporters of it, that Book being ſpurious, and none of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronius</hi> his work.</p>
               <p>Indeed I know of ſuch impudent falſe Hiſtory lately Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of matters of publick fact in theſe times, yea divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my own Words and Actions, by perſons that are far from Contemptible, that Strangers and Poſterity will ſcarce believe that humane nature could be guilty of it in the open light. And I know it to be ſo cuſtomary a thing, for the Zealots profeſſing the fear of God, on one ſide and the other, to receive and raſhly tell about lies of one another, that I confeſs I am grown to take little heed of what ſuch ſay in ſuch a caſe, unleſs the report continue a year uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led!

               <p>And indeed the very wiſeſt and beſt of men are guilty of ſo much Ignorance, Temerity, Suſpiciouſneſs of others partiality, &amp;c. That we muſt believe them (though far ſooner than others, yet) ſtill with a reſerv<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">VII. Another great cauſe of <hi>pretended falſe Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> is the unhappy <hi>prejudices</hi> which our minds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55434:99"/>
even in our Childhood, before we have time and wit and Conſcience to try things, by true deliberation.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſt <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> that they keep open the door to abundance of more falſhoods; And it muſt be clear Teachers, or great impartial ſtudies, of a ſelf-denying mind, with a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, that muſt deliver us from prejudice, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us. And therefore all the World ſeeth, that almoſt all men are of the Religion of their Country or their Parents, be it never ſo abſurd; Though with the <hi>Mahometans</hi> they believe the Nonſence of a very ſot, (once reading a quarter of whoſe Alcoran one would think ſhould cure a man of Common reaſon, of any inclination to his belief.) And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Japonians</hi> even the eloquent <hi>Bonzii</hi> believe in <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> and <hi>Xaca</hi>; To mention the belief of the <hi>Chinenſes,</hi> the People of <hi>Pegu, Siam,</hi> and many other ſuch; yea the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans,</hi> the <hi>Braſilians, Lappians, &amp;c.</hi> that correſpond with Devils, would be a ſad inſtance of the unhappineſs of mens firſt apprehenſions and education. And what doth the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid inſtance of Popery come ſhort herein, which tells us how <hi>Prejudice and Education, and Company,</hi> can make men deny all mens common ſence, and believe common unſeen Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles pretended in the ſtead?</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Another cauſe is the miſtaking of the <hi>nature</hi> of the duty of <hi>ſubmitting</hi> our <hi>judgment</hi> to our Superiours and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, eſpecially to the Multitude or the Church, or Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: No doubt but much reverence and a humane belief, is due to the Judgment of our Teachers credibly made known. But this is another thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quite different, 1. From <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> by <hi>Evidence.</hi> 2. And from <hi>believing God</hi>; (of which before and after.)</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:55434:100"/>IX. Another cauſe is baſe <hi>ſlothfulneſs,</hi> which makes men take up with the judgment of thoſe in moſt reputation (for <hi>Power, Wiſdom,</hi> or <hi>Number</hi>) to ſave them the labour of ſearching after the ſcientifical Evidence of things; or the certain Evidence of Divine Revelations.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Another frequent cauſe is, an appearance of ſomething in the Truth, which frighteneth men from it; either for want of a clear, methodical, advantageous repreſentation; or by ſome difficult objection; or ſome miſcarriage in the <hi>utterance, carriage,</hi> or <hi>life</hi> of them that ſeem moſt zealous for it: ſuch little things deceive dark man: And when he is turned from the Truth, he thinks that the contrary Errour may be embraced without fear.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Another great cauſe of <hi>Confidence</hi> in falſe <hi>Conceits,</hi> is the <hi>byaſs</hi> of ſome perſonal Intereſt prevailing with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Will, and the mixture of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> in the Judgment. For, as intereſted men hardly believe what ſeemeth againſt them, and eaſily believe that which they would have to be true; ſo <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> (or <hi>Affections</hi>) uſually ſo bear down <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that they think it their right to poſſeſs the Throne. Not but that Senſe is the only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of its own ſenſible Object as ſuch, (and Reaſon by Senſe as it is intelligible:) But that's not the matter in hand. But the Senſualiſt forceth his Reaſon to call that <hi>Beſt</hi> for him, which his Senſe is moſt delighted with, and that <hi>Worſt</hi> which moſt offendeth Senſe. The Drunkard will eaſily judge that his drinking is good for him, and the Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton that his pleaſant meats are lawful, and the Time-waſter that his Plays are lawful, and the Fornicator, the wrathful revenger, &amp;c. that their luſts and paſſions are lawful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think that they have <hi>Feeling</hi> on their ſide. It's hard to carry an upright Judgment againſt <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Paſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">XII. Sometimes a <hi>ſtrong deluded Imagination,</hi> maketh men exceeding <hi>confident</hi> in <hi>Errour</hi>; ſome by Melancholy, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55434:100"/>
ſome by a natural weakneſs of Reaſon, and ſtrength of Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie; and ſome by miſapprehenſions in Religion, grow to think that every ſtrong conceit which doth but come in ſuddenly, at reading, or hearing, or thinking on ſuch a Text, or in time of earneſt prayer, eſpecially if it deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect themſelves, is certainly ſome ſuggeſtion or inſpiration of God's Spirit. And hence many Errours have troubled poor Souls and the Church of God, which afterward they have themſelves retracted. Hence are the confidence of ſome ignorant Chriſtians in expounding difficult Scriptures Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies; and the boldneſs of others in expounding dark Providences; and alſo in foretelling by their own ſurmiſes things to come.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. And not a few run into this miſchief in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, by ſeeing others run into Errour on the other ſide. Some are ſo offended at the credulity of the weak, that they will grow <hi>confident</hi> againſt plain certainties themſelves. As becauſe there are many feigned <hi>Miracles, Apparitions, Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions</hi> and <hi>Witchcrafts</hi> in the World, divulged by the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of the injudicious; therefore they will more fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be confident that there are no ſuch things at all. And becauſe they ſee ſome weak perſons impute more of their opinions, performances and affections to God's Spirit, than they ought; therefore they grow mad againſt the true ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit, and confident that there is no ſuch thing. Some deride <hi>Praying</hi> by <hi>the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> by <hi>the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Living</hi> by <hi>the Spirit</hi>; when as they may as well deride <hi>underſtanding, willing, working</hi> by a Reaſonable Soul; no holy thing being holily done without God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, any more than any act of life and reaſon without the Soul: And they may on the ſame grounds deride all that <hi>Live not</hi> after the fleſh, and that are Chriſtians, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13. or that Love God, or that ſeek Salvation. Yea, ſome run ſo far from ſpiritual Fanaticiſms, that they deny the very Being of Spirits; and many confidently ſet
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55434:101"/>
up a dead Image of true Religion, in bitter hatred and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of all that hath <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>ſerious Holineſs</hi>: So mad are ſome made by ſeeing ſome feveriſh perſons dote.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Another Cauſe is converſing only with thoſe of our own mind and ſide, and intereſt, and not ſeeking familiar loving acquaintance with thoſe that differ from us: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men deprive themſelves of hearing half that is to be heard, and of knowing much that is to be known. And their <hi>proud Vice</hi> hardeneth them in this way, to ſay, <hi>I have read, and I have heard enough of them; I know all that they can ſay:</hi> And if a man ſoberly ſpeak to them, their Vices of <hi>Pride, Preſumption</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> will ſcarce patiently bear him to go on without interruption to the end; but the Wiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard ſaith, <hi>I know already what you will ſay, and you are tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and do you think that ſo wiſe a man as I, hath nothing to do but hear ſuch a Fool as you talk</hi>? Thus proud men are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſo <hi>full of themſelves,</hi> that they can ſcarce endure to hear, or at leaſt learn any thing from others, nor reſtrain their violent liſt to ſpeak ſo long as either juſt information, or humane civility requireth.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Another Cauſe is <hi>Malignity</hi> and <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Love</hi>; whereby men are brought if not to a hatred, yet to a proud <hi>contempt</hi> of others, who are not of their mind, and ſide, and way. O they are all — as <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> as any one hath liſt to call them; and he that raileth at them moſt ingeniouſly, and impudently, giveth them but their due. And will a man full of <hi>Himſelf</hi> and <hi>his Own,</hi> be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his preſumptions, by any thing that ſuch a hated or ſcorned people can ſay? Nay, will he not be hardened in his ſelf-conceit, becauſe it is ſuch as theſe that contradict him?</p>
               <p>Many ſuch <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this Vice there be, but PRIDE and IGNORANCE are the proper Parents of it, whatever elſe be the Nurſe or Friend.</p>

               <p>I Eaſily foreſee that beſides the foreſaid impediments, all theſe following Objections will hinder the <hi>Cure of falſe pretended knowledge</hi> and <hi>ſelf-conceitedneſs,</hi> and <hi>falſe Belief,</hi> if they be not anſwered.</p>
               <p>Obj. I. <hi>You move men to an Impoſſibility: To ſee without light; and for an erring man to believe that he erreth. He that hath not light to ſee the truth, hath not light to ſee his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of it: This is no more than to perſwade all men to be wiſe and not to err; which you may do long enough to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is impoſſible indeed for an erring man, while ſuch, to know that he erreth: but it is not impoſſible 1. For an <hi>ignorant man</hi> to know that he is ignorant, (nor for a man without light or ſight to know that he <hi>ſeeth</hi> not; though he cannot ſee that he <hi>ſeeth</hi> not.) For though <hi>Neſcience</hi> be <hi>Nothing</hi>; and <hi>Nothing</hi> is not properly and directly an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of our <hi>Knowledge,</hi> no more than of our <hi>Sight</hi>: Yet as we <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>limited quantity</hi> of ſubſtances, and ſo know little from big, by concluding that it hath <hi>no more quantity</hi> than we ſee; ſo we <hi>know</hi> our <hi>own knowledge,</hi> both as to <hi>Object and Act,</hi> and we know the degree of it, and to what it doth extend: And ſo can conclude, <hi>I know no more:</hi> And though <hi>Neſcience</hi> be nothing, yet this Propoſition, <hi>[I know no more]</hi> is not <hi>nothing.</hi> And ſo <hi>nothing</hi> is uſually ſaid to be known <hi>Reductively</hi>; but indeed it is not properly known at all; but this propoſition <hi>de nihilo</hi> is known, which is ſomething<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (I will not here meddle with the queſtion, whether God know non-entities.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>think</hi> and to <hi>know</hi> are not all one: For I may <hi>think</hi> that I <hi>may know,</hi> that is, <hi>I ſtudy to know</hi>: Now I can know that I <hi>ſtudy</hi> or <hi>think</hi>; and I can perceive that my ſtudies reach not what I deſire to reach, but fall ſhort of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:

And ſo as in the Body, though emptineſs be nothing, and therefore not <hi>felt</hi> as nothing, yet a hungry man <hi>feeleth</hi> it in the <hi>conſequents,</hi> by accident; that is, feeleth that by which he knoweth that he is empty: And ſo it is with a Student as to knowledge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And a man that hath ſo much experience as we all have of the ſtated darkneſs of our underſtandings, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent errors, may well know that this underſtanding is to be ſuſpected, and ſo blind a Guide not over-confidently and raſhly to be truſted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And a man that knoweth the danger of <hi>Errour,</hi> may know that it is a thing that he ſhould <hi>fear:</hi> And <hi>fear</hi> ſhould make him cautelous.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And though an <hi>erring man</hi> while ſuch cannot know that he erreth, yet by the aforeſaid means he may ceaſe to err, and know that he hath erred.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And laſtly, It is a ſhame for a man to be unacquainted with himſelf, and eſpecially with his <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and not to <hi>know</hi> the meaſure of his knowledge it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Obj. II. <hi>You talk like a Carteſian that muſt have all that would know, ſuppoſe firſt that they know nothing, no not that he feeleth and liveth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No ſuch matter: Some things, we know <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> and cannot chuſe but know: For the Intellect is not <hi>free</hi> of it ſelf, but only as <hi>quoad exercitium actus,</hi> it is <hi>ſub imperio vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis:</hi> And it is vain to bid men <hi>not to know</hi> what they cannot chuſe but know: And it is as vain to tell them that they muſt ſuppoſe (falſly) that they <hi>know not</hi> what they <hi>know,</hi> as a means <hi>to know:</hi> For ignorance is no means to knowledge, but knowledge is: One act of <hi>knowledge</hi> being neceſſary to more, and therefore not to be denied. I have told you before what <hi>certainties</hi> are, which muſt be known and never forſaken.</p>
               <p>Obj. III. <hi>But your diſcourſe plainly tendeth to draw men to Scepticiſm, and to doubt of all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:55434:102"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I tell you I deſcribe to you many <hi>certainties</hi> not to be doubted of. 2. And it is indeed your <hi>prefidence</hi> that tendeth to Scepticiſm, as is ſhewed: For men that believe haſtily and falſly, find themſelves ſo oft deceived, that at laſt they begin to doubt of all things: It is Scepticiſm which I prevent. 3. But I confeſs to you that I am leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Scepticiſm in the World than ever I was; as find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupt nature ſo univerſally diſpoſed the contrary way. As when I firſt ſaw the Books of <hi>Jacob Behmen,</hi> and ſome ſuch others, I adventured to Prognoſticate, that the Church would never be much indangered by that Sect, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which a man cannot <hi>underſtand</hi> and join in without great ſtudy and acuteneſs; becauſe few men will be at ſo much labour; even ſo I ſay of Scepticiſm; here and there a <hi>hard-impatient half-knowing</hi> Student may turn Sceptick; but never any great number: For <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and other cauſes of <hi>ſelf-conceitedneſs</hi> are Born in all men, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that <hi>apprehendeth</hi> any thing, is naturally apt to be too confident of his <hi>apprehenſions</hi>; and few will have the humility to ſuſpect themſelves; or the patience and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to find out difficulties. I muſt ſay in my Experience, that except the Congregation which I long inſtructed, and ſome few-ſuch, I meet with few Women, Boys, or unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, when they are paſt 18 or 20 years old, but they are in conceit wiſer than I, and are ſtill in the right, and I am in the wrong, in things Natural, Civil, Religious, or almoſt any thing we talk of, if I ſay not as they ſay; and it is ſo hard to abate their confidence, or convince them, that I have half ceaſed to endeavour it, but let every one believe and ſay what he will, ſo it be not to the diſhonour of God, the wrong of others, and the hazard of his Salvation: For I take it for granted before-hand, that contradiction ofter cauſeth ſtrife than inſtruction; and when they take not themſelves for Scholars, they ſeldom learn much of any but themſelves: And their own <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> muſt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55434:103"/>
teach them that in many years which from an <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced</hi> man they might have cheaplier learnt, in a few days.</p>
               <p>Obj. IV. <hi>You ſpeak againſt taking things on truſt, and ſo would keep Children from Believing and Learning of their Parents and Maſters, and from growing wiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I oft tell you that <hi>humane faith</hi> is a neceſſary help to <hi>Divine Faith</hi>; But it muſt not be miſtaken for <hi>Divine Faith.</hi> Men are to be believed as fallible men: But in ſome things with diffidence; and in ſome things with confidence, and in ſome things, (where it is not the ſpeakers credit that we rely upon, but a Concurrence of Teſtimonies, which make up a natural certainty) <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the thing is ſure. But man is not God.</p>
               <p>Obj. V. <hi>May not a man more ſafely and Confidently believe by the Churches Faith, than his own! That is, take that for more certain which all men believe, than that which I think I ſee a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine word for my ſelf</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a Popiſh Objection thus confuſedly and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laciouſly often made. 1. Properly, No man can believe by any faith but his own, any more than underſtand with any underſtanding but his own. But the meaning being, that we may better truſt to the <hi>Churches Judgment,</hi> that this or that is <hi>Gods word,</hi> than to our own <hi>perſwaſion</hi> that it is Gods word, from the <hi>Evidence</hi> of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> I further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 2. That the Churches <hi>Judgment</hi> is one part of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate motive; and therefore not to be put in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with that Divine Evidence which it is always put in Conjunction with. And the Churches <hi>Teaching,</hi> is the means of my coming to know the true Evidences of Divinity in the word. And the Churches real <hi>Holineſs</hi> cauſed by that word, is one of the <hi>Evidences</hi> themſelves, and not the leaſt. Now to put the queſtion, Whether I muſt know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be Gods word becauſe I diſcern the Evidences of its Divinity, or rather becauſe the Church Teacheth me that it
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55434:103"/>
is Gods word, or becauſe the <hi>Church</hi> ſaith it is Gods word, or becauſe the Church is Sanctified by it, are all vain queſtions; ſetting things conjunct and co-ordinate as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. 1. By the Churches <hi>Judgment</hi> or <hi>Belief,</hi> I am moved to a high Reverence of Gods word, by a very high <hi>Humane Faith,</hi> ſuppoſing it credible that it may be <hi>Gods</hi> word indeed. 2. Next by the Churches (or Miniſters) Teaching, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of Divinity are made known to me. 3. The Effect of it, in the Churches Holineſs is one of theſe Evidences. 4. And by that and all other Evidences, I know that it is Gods word. 5. And therefore believe it to be true. This is the true Order and Reſolution of our Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But becauſe the Popiſh Method is, barely to believe the Scripture to be Gods word, becauſe a Pope and his Council judgeth ſo, I add, 1. That we have even of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſort of Teſtimony far more than ſuch. For theirs is the Teſtimony of a ſelf exalting <hi>Sect</hi> of Chriſtians, about the third part of the Chriſtian world: But we have alſo the Teſtimony of them and of all other Chriſtians; and in moſt or much of the matter of Fact, (that the Scriptures were delivered down from the Apoſtles) the Teſtimony of ſome Heathens and abundance of Hereticks. 2. And with theſe we have the <hi>Evidences</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> themſelves. 3. But if we had their Churches (or Pope and Councils) Decrees for it alone, we ſhould take it but for a humane Fallible Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>For, 1. They cannot plead Gods word here as the proof of their Infallibility: For it is the ſuppoſed queſtion, <hi>what is Gods word,</hi> which (they ſay) cannot be known but by their Infallible Judgment. 2. And they cannot plead num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; for, 1. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> are more than the Chriſtians in the world (<hi>Brierwood</hi> reckoneth that they are <hi>ſix parts</hi> of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; we but <hi>five.</hi>) And yet not therefore Infallible nor Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 2. And the Heathens are more than the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and Chriſtians (being four ſixth parts, of the world,) and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55434:104"/>
yet not infallible. But of this I have the laſt week wrote a Book of the <hi>certainty of Chriſtianity without Popery</hi>; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore my <hi>ſafe Religion</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Obj. VI. <hi>At leaſt this way of Believing and Knowing things by proper Evidences of Truth, will looſen the common ſort of Chriſtians, (even the godly) from their Faith and Religion: For whereas now they quietly go on without doubting, as receiving the Scriptures from the Church or their Teachers as the word of God, when they fall on ſearching after proofs, they will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being overcome by difficulties, and filled with doubts, if not apoſtatizing to Infidelity, or turning Papiſts.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Either theſe perſons have already the Knowledge of <hi>Certain Evidence</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the Scripture, or Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, or they have none. If they <hi>have</hi> any the way of ſtudying it more will not take it from them, but increaſe it: Elſe you diſhonour Chriſtianity to think that he that <hi>knoweth</hi> it to be of God, will think otherwiſe if he do but better try it. Upon ſearch he will not know leſs, but more.</p>
               <p>But if he have no ſuch certainty already, 2. I further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that I take away from him none of that humane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief which he had before: If the belief of his <hi>Parents, Teachers</hi> or the <hi>Church only,</hi> did ſatisfy him before, which was but a ſtrong probability, I leave with him the ſame help, and probability and only perſwade him to add more, and ſurer arguments. And therefore that ſhould not weaken, but confirm his Faith.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But you tell him that the Churches or his Teachers Judgment or word is uncertain, and that ſets him on doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I tell him of all the Strength and Credibility that is in it, which I would have him make uſe of. 2. And it is not <hi>alone,</hi> but by his <hi>Teachers help</hi> that I would have him ſeek for certainty. 3. But if he did take that Teſtimony for certain which was not <hi>certain</hi>; If he took man for God,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55434:104"/>
or took his Teachers, or Pope for inſpired Prophets, and a humane Teſtimony for Divine, do you think that this errour ſhould be <hi>cheriſhed,</hi> or <hi>cured?</hi> I think that God nor Man have no true need of a lie in this caſe; and that lies ſeldom further mens Salvation? And that though they do ſome job of preſent ſervice the next way, at the end we ſhall find that they did more harm than good. And that to ſay the contrary, and that men will ceaſe to be Chriſtians unleſs they be kept to it by deceit, is the way to downright infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>And yet that you may ſee how much more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I favour the weakneſſes of ſuch, I will here anſwer a great queſtion.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He that readeth Mr. <hi>Pinks</hi> excellent Sermons, and many other ſuch Divines, will find them thus deſcribing the Faith of Hypocrites, (that they conclude have no true ſaving Faith) that they believe in Chriſt, but on the ſame or like reaſons as a <hi>Turk</hi> may believe in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that is, becauſe the moſt, the greateſt, the Learnedſt and the beſt, and all the Countrey are of their minds, and in that way their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents did educate them in. For my part, I eaſily confeſs, 1. That ſuch a belief which buildeth on unſound grounds, is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proportionably in its own ſoundneſs; 2. And that it ſhould not be reſted in; 3. Much leſs cheriſhed againſt all counſels that would cure it. 4. And that though uncertain reaſons are, 1. The firſt, 2. And the moſt prevailing with him afterwards, yet every true Believer diſcerneth ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Signs of Divinity at leaſt as probable in the Word it ſelf. But yet ſuppoſing that wrong motives be his chief, and that he diſcerneth not that in the word it ſelf which moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth with him, I am of opinion that, 1. If the end of ſuch a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55434:105"/>
Believer be ſound, (the reducing of the Soul to God, and attainment of Glory, and the perfect Love of God.) 2. And if that man unfeignedly believe all that is Gods Word to be true. 3. And if he believe all the ſubſtance of the Goſpel to <hi>be Gods word,</hi> though by an unſound and non-concluding me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium as his chief. 4. And if he by this belief be brought himſelf to the actual love of God as God; This unſound Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is ſound in the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>The objection is, <hi>An uncertain, yea deceived belief upon falſe ſuppoſitions, is no true belief, and therefore cannot ſave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, There is a double Truth in ſuch a belief, 1. That all Gods Word is true. 2. That this Goſpel is Gods Word, and Chriſt is the Meſſiah.</p>
               <p>You will ſay that <hi>there can be no more, no ſurer, no better in the Concluſion, than is in the weaker of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi>

And all that will follow is, that the Concluſion is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary from theſe Premiſes; and that the believer was miſtaken in the reaſon of his inference, and that he concluded a truth upon an unſound medium; I grant all this, and conſequently that his Faith hath ſome unſoundneſs or diſeaſedneſs in it. But for all this, I ſee not but ſuch a believer may be ſaved. 1. Becauſe Chriſts promiſe is, that whoever <hi>believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life, without</hi> excepting ſuch as are drawn to it by non-cogent arguments. And he that will put in an exception againſt the Covenant of Grace, muſt prove it, or be injurious to Chriſt, to his Goſpel and to mens Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe by experience I find, that it is but a ſmall part of ſerious Godly Chriſtians, who believe the Scriptures upon cogent evidence, (or at leaſt many do not:) But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance take it upon truſt from Godly Preachers or Parents, and go on without much examining of their grounds; And are not able to bring a cogent proof of the Divinity of the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55434:105"/>
Scriptures, when they are called to it: And I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to conclude ſo great a part of humble upright Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to Damnation, as know not ſuch reaſons for their Faith as would hold good in ſtrict diſputation. Not that our Charity muſt bend the Scripture to it. But that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commandeth ſuch Charity; and it no where condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any man that believeth upon uncogent reaſons. For he that doth ſo, may yet firmly Truſt on Jeſus Chriſt, and firmly believe that the Goſpel is true, as being the very Word of God, and may take Heaven for his Portion, and Love God, as God, and therefore may be ſaved. Though yet I think it impoſſible that any man ſhould truly believe the Scriptures, and not perceive in them ſome Characters of Divinity, which as an intrinſical Evidence much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and induce him to believe them; And-though this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret guſt and perception be not the medium that he uſeth in arguing, or be not the chief, yet it may have an effectual force with his Soul to hold him cloſe to Chriſt. But if you ſuppoſe the man to have no Spiritual ſight and taſt of a difference between Gods Word and a common Book, then he cannot be ſuppoſed to be a ſound believer.</p>
               <p>As a man that hath one ingredient in his medicine which is effectual, may be cured, though in the compoſition the main bulk be vanities; or as a debtor that hath many inſufficient ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, may do well if he have one ſufficient one, though he more truſt the reſt; or as a mans cauſe may go for him in Judgment that hath one or two good Witneſſes, and twenty bad ones which he put more truſt in; and as he truly proveth his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, who bringeth one ſound argument for it, and twenty bad ones; So I think that the common way of the illiterate in believing is, firſt to believe Gods Word <hi>to be his Word</hi> by humane Faith; and after upon trial to find a Spiritual light and goodneſs in the Word it ſelf, and by both together to believe that it is <hi>Gods Word.</hi> And the worſer reaſons may be the more powerful with him, and yet not deſtroy the ſincerity of his Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:55434:106"/>Nor doth this make his Faith meerly humane: For the Queſtion now is not, why he <hi>believeth God's Word to be True,</hi> &amp; <hi>truſteth on it:</hi> For that is, becauſe it is God's Word (diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him ſo to be) but he that by an inſufficient Medium (at leaſt with a Better, though leſs underſtood) doth take it to be God's, may yet by a Divine Faith <hi>believe it,</hi> becauſe he judgeth it his Word.</p>
               <p>If a man ſhould counterfeit himſelf an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and come in ſome ſplendid deceitful appearance in the night to an Heathen, and tell him that he is ſent from God to bring him this Bible as his Certain Word, and if the man receive it, and believe it on his credit to the death, and by that Believing it be brought to ſee an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and credibility, and taſte a ſpiritual ſweetneſs in it, and be brought by it (as he may be) to Holineſs and the <hi>Love</hi> of God, that man ſhall be ſaved, though I cannot ſay that the Intrinſick Evidence of the Word alone would have prevailed with him without that falſe belief of a deceiver: When it is once become a <hi>Sanctifying Belief,</hi> then there is no doubt but the <hi>Man hath better Evidence</hi> than the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain word of man: He hath the witneſs in himſelf. And it is not a Glorifying Faith, till it be a Sanctifying Faith. But the Queſtion is, <hi>What ſoundneſs of Reaſon or proof</hi> that this is God's Word, is neceſſary to make it a Sanctifying Faith? at leaſt, as moſt prevalent and truſted in?</p>
               <p>By this you may know what I judge of the Faith of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt illiterate Papiſts, and of illiterate Proteſtants, for a great number of them, who live in Love and Obedience to God.</p>
               <p>And yet to ſpeak both more conciſely and diſtinctly, I. I may believe by Hiſtorical Tradition all that matter of Fact, which thoſe that ſaw Chriſt's and the Apoſtles Miracles, and heard their words, did know by ſenſe, and thoſe that ſaw not believed on the credit of the reporters. II. And yet I may know by reaſon, through God's help, that theſe <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:55434:106"/>

And of this all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have ſome perception in various degrees. III. And then we know it to be true, becauſe it is ſealed by thoſe atteſtations, and is the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Obj. VII. <hi>But would you have men take the matters of Fact for uncertain (that this is a true Bible and Copy, and was given the Church by the Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>and ſo not pretend to be certain of them.</hi>

And if the <hi>ſelf-conceited knew more,</hi> they would doubt more; and as they grow wiſer, will grow leſs <hi>confident</hi> in uncertainties.

Do you think that a thouſand ſelf-conceited men and women do really <hi>know</hi> ever the more, for <hi>ſaying</hi> they know, or crying down that Ignorance, Doubting and Uncertainty which they have themſelves? How many a one (yea Preachers) have cryed

down the Popiſh Doctrine of <hi>Uncertainty</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> who had no Certainty of their own; but their neighbours thought by <hi>their</hi> lives were certainly in the way to Hell.</p>
               <p>Obj. IX. <hi>But you would have men reſiſt the Spirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth them, and make ſo long a work in doubting, and queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and proving every thing, as that Chriſtians will come but to little knowledge in your way.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> They will have the more knowledge, and not the leſs for trying. Peremptory confidence is not knowledge. The next way here is fartheſt about. Receive all Evidence from God and Man, from the <hi>Word and Spirit</hi> with all the <hi>deſire,</hi> and all the <hi>delight,</hi> and all the <hi>ſpeed</hi> that poſſibly you can: Study earneſtly; Learn willingly; Reſiſt no Light; neglect no Truth. But what's all this to fooliſh conceit that you know what you do not? What's this to the haſty believing of falſhoods, or uncertainties, and troubling the Church and World with ſelf-conceit and dreams? I remember two or three of my old acquaintance, who ſuddenly received from a Seducer the Opinion of <hi>Perfection,</hi> that we might be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſinleſs</hi> in this life: And becauſe I denied it, they carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as if I had pleaded for ſin againſt perfection; and they preſently took themſelves to be <hi>perfect and ſinleſs,</hi> becauſe they had got the Opinion that ſome are ſuch. I told them that I <hi>deſired</hi> Perfection as well as they, and that I was far from hindering or diſſwading any from <hi>Perfection</hi>; but wiſht them to let us ſee that they are ſo indeed, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſin more in thought, word or deed: And ere long they forſook all Religion, and by Drunkenneſs, Fornication and Licentiouſneſs, ſhewed us their Perfection. So here, it is not a conceit that men have Faith and Knowledge, and quickly ſaying, <hi>I believe</hi>; or turning to the Prieſt or Party that perſwadeth them, which maketh them ever the wiſer men, or true Believers.</p>

               <p>But if you hear a man ſpeak evil of another behind his Back, when the thing is not notorious and certain other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, the Law of Juſtice and Charity obligeth you not to believe him, but to ſuſpend your belief till you hear both ſides, or have ſurer proof; yea, and to ſuſpend, not with an indifferency, but with a hope that it is not true which he ſpeaketh.</p>

For if I was bound to judge him innocent before this backbiting, I am bound ſo to judge him ſtill.

But do not therefore think that it is the ſame: Nor give men that prerogative of Infallibility which belongeth to God, or to inſpired Prophets who prove their word by Gods atteſtation. The belief of Logicians is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to your underſtanding Logick, and Logick is a great help to your certain diſcerning of Phyſical and Metaphyſical and Moral Verities.

               <p>Some think that nothing is known till we have Second notions for it, or can define it: When things ſenſible are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known by ſenſing them, and uſually ſecond notions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive men and make them doubt of what they better appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended without them.</p>

But I little doubt but they may and ſhould be all reduced to two, which are as the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> that yet make up one man, though not one nature, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>The</hi>

The <hi>Organical part,</hi> which fitteth <hi>words</hi> and <hi>Notions</hi> to <hi>Things.</hi> And I am ſure that as the Knowledge of one thing or of many much conduceth to further Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; ſo the Ignorance of one thing conduceth to igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and error about others: It is here as in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Clock or Watch or Muſical Inſtrument: <hi>Know all</hi> or you know <hi>little,</hi> and next to <hi>none.</hi> No man is a fit Judge of Church affairs, who hath not the State of the World in ſome good meaſure in his Eye; elſe he will be like moſt <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> who <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Talk</hi> and <hi>Live,</hi> as if the World were no bigger than their Synagogues or Sects. He muſt have <hi>all the Scripture in his Eye,</hi> and all <hi>the Body of Divinity</hi> and all the <hi>World</hi> in his <hi>Eye</hi>; and God himſelf who is more than all, who will not by a narrow mind be cheated into a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Errours. There are abundance of truths un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to you, which were they known, would rectify your other Errours.</p>
               <p>D. VIII. <hi>Conclude not haſtily of Negatives.</hi> You may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier know that you <hi>do know what you do know,</hi> than know what it is that you do not know. It doth not follow that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55434:111"/>
there <hi>is</hi> no more, becauſe you know no more. St. <hi>John</hi> tells you, that if all that Chriſt did ſhould be written, the World could not contain the Books: You cannot therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from what is recorded, that he <hi>ſaid and did no more</hi> than is recorded: Though I am ſure againſt Popery, by my ſenſe and intellect, that there is real <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> in the Sacrament, I am not ſure by <hi>ſenſe</hi> that there is <hi>no ſpiritual</hi> Body of Chriſt: The <hi>Negative</hi> muſt be otherwiſe proved. I am ſure by my five ſenſes (as they are commonly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and numbred) that there are exiſtent all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible qualities which are their objects: But whether the World may not have <hi>more ſenſible qualities,</hi> ſuited to many other ſort of ſenſes, which we have no conception, notion or name of, is a thing that no mortal man can know.</p>
               <p>You hear many things, and know many things by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, which make his cauſe ſeem bad: But do you know how many more things may be exiſtent unknown to you, which if you knew, would change your Judgment?</p>
               <p>Allow ſtill room and ſuppoſition for abundance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known things, which may come hereafter to your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and make things ſeem to you quite other than they do. How can you poſſibly <hi>know</hi> how much more may be unknown to you? If I have a Servant that ſtayeth out much longer than I expected, I may conjecture that he could have no buſineſs to ſtay him, but his negligence: But there may be many accidents to cauſe it, which I cannot judge of till I hear him ſpeak.</p>
               <p>D. IX. <hi>Be ſure that you ſuſpect your firſt apprehenſions of things, and take few conceptions</hi> (concluſive) <hi>for certain that are not digeſted.</hi> Faſten not over tenaciouſly upon Opinions in the beginning at the firſt hearing: Take it for granted that your firſt conceptions of things muſt alter, either as to the <hi>Truth,</hi> or the <hi>Evidence,</hi> or the <hi>Order,</hi> or the <hi>Degree.</hi> Few men are ſo happy in youth, as to receive at firſt ſuch right impreſſions, which need not after to be much altered. When
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55434:111"/>
we are Children, we know as Children; but when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Men, childiſh things are done away. Where we change not our Judgment of the matter, yet we come to have very different apprehenſions of it. I would not have Boys to be meer Scepticks (for they muſt be <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>) But I would have them leave room for increaſe of knowledge, and not be too peremptory with their juvenile conceptions, but ſuppoſe that a further light will give them another proſpect of the ſame things.</p>
               <p>D. X. <hi>Chuſe ſuch Teachers, if poſſible, as have themſelves at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the things you ſeek; even that moſt ſubſtantial Wiſdom which leadeth to Salvation.</hi> For how elſe ſhall they teach others what they have not learnt themſelves! O the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Teachers and Teachers! between a raſh flaſhy unexperienced proud wit, and clear headed, <hi>well ſtudied, much experienced,</hi> and godly man! Happy is he that hath ſuch a Teacher, that is long exerciſed in the ways of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and hath a heart to value him!</p>
               <p>D. XI. <hi>Value Truth for Goodneſs, and Goodneſs above Truth; and eſtimate all Truths and Knowledge by their uſefulneſs to higher Ends.</hi> That is Good as a <hi>Means,</hi> which <hi>doth Good.</hi> There is nothing beſides God that is ſimply Good, <hi>in, of,</hi> and <hi>for it ſelf</hi>; all elſe is only <hi>Good derivatively</hi> from God the <hi>Efficient,</hi> and as a <hi>Means</hi> to God the final Cauſe. As a pound of Gold more enricheth than many loads of Dirt: ſo a little Knowledge of great and neceſſary matters, maketh one wiſer, than a great deal of pedantick toyiſh Learning. No man hath time and capacity for all things: He is but a proud fool that would ſeem to know all, and deny his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in many things. Even he that with <hi>Alſtedius, &amp;c.</hi> can write an <hi>Encyclopaedia,</hi> is ſtill unacquainted with abundance that is intelligible. For my own part, I humbly thank God, that by placing my dwelling ſtill as in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, he hath led me to chuſe ſtill the ſtudies which I
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55434:112"/>
thought were fitteſt for a man that is poſting to another world. He that muſt needs be ignorant of many things, ſhould chuſe to omit thoſe which he can beſt ſpare. Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh well between <hi>ſtudying</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi> for <hi>Uſe,</hi> and for <hi>Luſt</hi>: For the <hi>True Ends</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and for the bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of <hi>Knowing.</hi> One <hi>thing</hi> is <hi>neceſſary, Luke</hi> 10.42. And all others but as they are neceſſary to that one. Mortifie the <hi>Luſt</hi> of <hi>uſeleſs Knowledge</hi> as well as other luſts of fleſh and fantaſie. Dying men commonly call it Vanity. Remember what a deal of precious Time it waſteth; and from how many greater and more neceſſary things it doth divert the mind; and with what wind it puffs men up; as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. How juſtly did the rude Tartarians think the great Libraries, and multitudes of Doctors, and idle Prieſts, among the <hi>Chinenſes</hi> to be a foolery, and call them away from their Books to Arms (as <hi>Palafox</hi> tells us) when all their Learning was to ſo little purpoſe as it was, and led them to no more high and neceſſary things?</p>
               <p>D. XII. <hi>Yet becauſe many ſmaller parts of Knowledge are neceſſary to Kingdoms, Academies and Churches, which are not neceſſary nor greatly valuable to individual perſons; let ſome few particular perſons be bred up to an eminency in thoſe ſtudies, and let not the generality of Students waſte their time therein.</hi> There is ſcarce any part of Knowledge ſo ſmall and uſeleſs, but it is neceſſary to great Societies that ſome be Maſters of it, which yet the generality may well ſpare. And all are to be valued and honoured according to their ſeveral excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. But yet I cannot have while to ſtudy as long as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litian</hi> how <hi>Virgil</hi> ſhould be ſpelt; nor to decide the quarrels between <hi>Phil.

Nor to learn all the Languages and Arts which I could wiſh to know, if I could know them without neglecting greater things. But yet the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Profeſſors of them all I honour.</p>

If you do not <hi>faithfully value and improve theſe,</hi> you prepare for deluſion: You forget your Premiſes and Principles: God may juſtly leave you in the dark, and give you up to believe a lie. Did you live according to the importance of your certain Principles, your lives would be filled with <hi>fruit,</hi> and <hi>buſineſs,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> and all this Great: So that you would have little mind or leiſure for little and unneceſſary things. It is the neglect of things <hi>neceſſary,</hi> which fills the World with the trouble of things unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>D. XIV. <hi>Study hard, and ſearch diligently and deeply, and that with unwearied patience and delight.</hi> Unpleaſant ſtudies tire and ſeldom proſper. Slight running thoughts accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh little. If any man think that the <hi>Spirit</hi> is given to ſave us the labour of hard and long ſtudies, <hi>Solomon</hi> hath ſpent ſo many Chapters in calling them, to dig, ſearch, cry, labour, wait for Wiſdom, that if that will not undeceive them, I cannot: They may as well ſay, that God's bleſſing is to ſave the Husbandman the labour of plowing and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And that the Spirit is given to ſave men the labour of learning to read the Bible, or to hear it, or think of it, or to pray to God. Whereas the Spirit is given us to <hi>provoke</hi> and <hi>enable</hi> us to ſtudy hard, and read, and hear, and pray hard, and to proſper us herein.</p>
               <p>And as vain are our idle Lads that think that their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Wits,</hi> or their <hi>Abode</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> in the Univerſities, will ſerve the turn inſtead of hard ſtudies! And ſo they come out almoſt as <hi>ignorant,</hi> and yet more <hi>proud</hi> than they went thither, to be Plagues in all Countreys where they come, to teach others by example the idleneſs and ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which they learnt themſelves; and being <hi>ignorant,</hi> yet the honour of their Functions muſt be maintained, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55434:113"/>
therefore their ignorance muſt be hid, which yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do weekly make oſtentation of in the Pulpit, where they ſhould be ſhining lights; and when their own Tongues have proclaimed it, thoſe of underſtanding that obſerve and loath it, muſt be maligned and railed at for <hi>knowing</hi> how little their Teachers know.</p>
               <p>Nothing without <hi>long</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> ſtudies furniſheth the mind with ſuch a ſtock of truth, as may be called real wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. That God is the <hi>rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> (and not of the lazy neglecters of him) is the <hi>ſecond</hi> Principle in Religion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. They that cannot be at this labour, muſt be content to know but little, and not take on them to know much. For they are not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern truth from falſhood: But while they ſleep the Tares are ſowed: Or while they open the Door, all croud in that can come firſt; and they cannot make a juſt ſeparation. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Perſons will ſwarm with errors; and he that <hi>erreth</hi> will think that he is in the right: And if he think that it is a divine and neceſſary truth which he embraceth, how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly may he purſue it?</p>
               <p>D. XV. <hi>Take heed of a byas of Carnal Intereſt, and of the diſturbing Paſſions which ſelfiſh partiality will be apt to raiſe.</hi> Men may verily think that they ſincerely love the truth, when the ſecret power of a carnal intereſt, their <hi>honour,</hi> their <hi>profit</hi> or <hi>pleaſure,</hi> is it that turneth about their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and furniſheth them with Arguments, and whets their Wits, and maketh them paſſionately confident, and they are not aware of it.

               <p>D.

You will not turn to paſſionate contentions, and reproaches of them when you differ; and the reverence of your Elders,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55434:113"/>
Teachers, Superiors, will make you more ready to ſuſpect your ſelves than them. Moſt of our <hi>ſelf-conceited pretenders</hi> to knowledge have loſt their love and reverence of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and are bold deſpiſers of the Perſons, reaſons and writings of all that contradict their errour. And moſt that venture to caſt the Churches into flames, and their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren into ſilence and ſufferings, that they may plant their own opinions, are great deſpiſers of thoſe that they afflict, and either hate them, or would make them hateful, leſt they ſhould be thought to be unjuſt in uſing them like hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perſons.

               <p>He that deſerteth the Chriſtian Univerſality, (in deed though not in words) and cleaveth too cloſe to any <hi>Sect,</hi> (whether Papal or any other) will be carried down the ſtream by that Sect, and will fill his underſtanding with all their errors and uncertainties, and confound them with the certain truths of God, to make up a mixt Religion with; and the reverence of his Party, Church or Sect, will blind his mind, and make him think all this his duty.</p>

A tender Conſcience cannot be bold and raſh, where the intereſt of God, the Church, and his own and others Souls is ſo much concerned: When you are invited to turn Papiſt, or Quaker, or Anabaptiſt, or Antinomian, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſt, think, <hi>What if it ſhould prove an Errour; and as great an Errour as many godly learned men affirm it to be?</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las what a gulf ſhould I plunge my Soul in? What injury ſhould I do the Truth? What wrong to Souls? And ſhall I raſhly venture on ſuch a danger, any more than I would do on Fornication, Drunkenneſs, or other ſin? And doth not the ſad example of this Age, as well as all former Ages warn you to be <hi>fearful</hi> of what you entertain? O what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, what hopeful, what confident Perſons, have dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully miſcarried, and when they once began to roll down the Hill, have not ſtopt till ſome of them arrived at Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Prophaneneſs, and others involved us all in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? And yet ſhall we not fear, but rage and be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent?</p>
               <p>And to ſee on the other ſide what darkneſs and deluſion hath faln upon thouſands of the Papal Clergy, and what their Errour hath coſt the World, ſhould make thoſe that are that way inclined alſo fear.</p>
               <p>Direct. XIX. <hi>Above all pray and labour for a truely humble mind, that is well acquainted with its own defects; and fear and fly from a proud overvaluing of your own underſtanding.</hi> Be thankful for any Knowledge that you have, but take heed of thinking it greater than it is. The Devils Sin, and the imitation of <hi>Adam,</hi> are not the way to have the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Gods Spirit. It is not more uſual with God to bring <hi>low</hi> thoſe that are Proud of <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> than to leave to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55434:114"/>
                  <hi>folly, deceit</hi> and <hi>errour,</hi> thoſe that are proud of <hi>Wiſdom</hi>; and to leave to Sin and <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> thoſe that are proud of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. A Proud underſtanding cannot be brought to ſuſpect it ſelf, but is confident of its firſt undigeſted apprehenſions: It either feeleth no need of the Spirits light, but deſpiſeth it as a fancy; or elſe it groweth conceited that all its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are of the Spirit, and is proud of that Spirit which he hath not. Nothing maketh this peremptory confidence in falſe conceits ſo common, as Pride of a knowledge which men have not. Would the Lord but humble theſe perſons throughly, they would think, Alas! <hi>What a dark deceitful mind have I? how unfit to deſpiſe the judgment of them that have laboured for knowledge far more than I have done, and how unfit to be confident againſt ſuch as know much more than I</hi>?</p>
               <p>But ſo deep and common is this Pride, that they that go in rags, and they that think themſelves unworthy to live, and are ready to deſpair in the ſenſe of Sin, do yet ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſo <hi>overvalue</hi> their own <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> that even theſe will ſtifly hold their vain and unpeaceable opinions, and ſtifly reject the judgment and arguments, of the wiſeſt and beſt that will not be as envious as they.</p>
               <p>Direct. XX. Laſtly, <hi>Keep in a Child-like, teachable, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolution, with a ſober and ſuſpended judgment, where you have not ſure evidence to turn the ſcales.</hi> When Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Except ye be converted and become as little Children, ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; As he hath reſpect to the humility of Children in general (and their inception of a new life) ſo in ſpecial he ſeemeth to reſpect them as Diſciples: ſet Children to School and their buſineſs is to hear and learn all day; They ſet not their wits againſt their Maſters and do not wrangle and ſtrive againſt him, and ſay, It is not ſo; we know better than you. But ſo abominably is humane nature corrupted by this Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Pride, that when once Lads are big enough to be from under a Tutor, commonly inſtead of Learning of others,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55434:115"/>
they are of a <hi>teaching</hi> humour, and had rather ſpeak two hours than hear one; And ſet their wits to contradict what they ſhould learn, and to conquer thoſe that would inſtruct them; and to ſhew themſelves wiſer than to learn to be more wiſe; and we can ſcarce talk with Man or Woman, but is the wiſeſt in the Company, and hardlieſt convinced of an errour.</p>
               <p>But two things here I earneſtly adviſe you: 1. That you ſpend more time in Learning than in <hi>Diſputing</hi>: Not but that diſputing in its ſeaſon is neceſſary to defend the Truth: But uſually it engageth mens wits in an eager oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others, and ſo againſt the truth which they ſhould receive: And it goeth more according to the ability of the diſputants, than the merits of the cauſe. And he that is worſted is ſo galled at the diſgrace, that he hateth the truth the more for his ſake that hath diſhonoured him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh ſo oft againſt ſuch diſputing, and ſaith that the Servant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle, and apt to teach, and in meekneſs inſtruct oppoſers.</p>
               <p>I would ordinarily if any Man have a mind to wrangle with me, tell him; <hi>[If you know more of theſe things than I, if you will be my Teacher, I ſhall thankfully hear and learn]</hi> and deſire him to open his Judgment to me in its fulleſt evidence: And I would weigh it as the time and caſe required; And if I were fully ſatisfied againſt it, I would crave leave to tell him the reaſons of my diſſent, and crave his patient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the end. And when we well underſtood each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mind and reaſons, I would crave leave then to end in peace; unleſs the ſafety of others required a diſpute to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And my ſpecially repeated counſel is, that you <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend</hi> your <hi>judgment</hi> till you have cogent evidence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it. Be no further of either ſide than you know they are in the right, caſt not your ſelf into other mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions haſtily, upon ſlight reaſons at a blind adventure. If
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55434:115"/>
you ſee not a <hi>Certainty</hi> judge it not <hi>Certain,</hi> If you ſee but a <hi>Probability,</hi> judge it but Probable. Prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good. The <hi>Bereans</hi> are commended for ſearching the Scripture,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.</note> and ſeeing whether the things were ſo which <hi>Paul</hi> had ſpoken. Truth feareth not the light. It is like Gold, that loſeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the fire. Darkneſs is its greateſt Enemy and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. Therefore look before you leap: you are bid, Believe not every Spirit,<note place="margin">1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.</note> but try the Spirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of God. Stand ſtill till you know that the ground is ſafe which you are to tread on. When Poyſoners are as Common as Phyſicians, you will take heed what you take. It's ſafer when once you have the eſſentials of Chriſtianity, to take too little than too much: For you are ſure to be ſaved if you are meer true Chriſtians; but how far Popery, Antinomianiſm, &amp;c. may corrupt your Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a controverſie. Wiſh them that urge you, to forbear their haſte in a matter of everlaſting conſequence: Theſe are not matters to be raſhly done. And as long as you are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, profeſs your ſelves uncertain; and if they will condemn you for your ignorance when you are willing to know the truth, ſo will not God. But when you are <hi>certain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve</hi> in the ſtrength of God, and hold faſt whatever it coſt you, even to the death, and never fear being loſers by God, by his Truth, or by Fidelity in your Duty.</p>

               <p>The meaning of the Text I gave you before:<q> The true
Paraphraſe of it is as followeth: As if <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid; [You overvalue your barren notions, and think that by them you are wiſe; whereas Knowledge is a means to a higher end; &amp; is to be eſteemed of as it attaineth that end; And that end is to make us Lovers of God, that ſo we may be known with Love by him; For to Love God and be beloved by him is mans felicity and ultimate end; and therefore that which we muſt ſeek after and live for in the world; and he is to be accounted the wiſeſt man that loveth God moſt; when unſanctified Notions &amp; Speculations will prove but folly.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:55434:116"/>This being the true meaning of the Text, I ſhall briefly ſpeak of it by parts, as it containeth theſe ſeveral Doctrines or Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Doct. 1. <hi>Knowledge is a means to a higher end, according to which it is to be eſtimated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doct. 2. <hi>The End of Knowledge is to make us Lovers of God, and ſo to be known with Love by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doct. 3. <hi>Therefore knowledge is to be valued, ſought and uſed, as it tendeth to this holy bleſſed end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doct. 4. <hi>And therefore thoſe are to be accounted the wiſeſt or beſt-knowing men, that Love God moſt; and not thoſe that are ſtored with unholy knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, that <hi>[Knowledge is a means to a higher end]</hi> I ſhall firſt open it, and then prove it.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Aquinas</hi> and ſome other Schoolmen make the Viſion or Knowledge of God, to be the higheſt part of mans Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And I deny not but that the three faculties of mans Soul, (<hi>Vital Activity, Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will</hi>) as the Image of the Divine Trinity, have a kind of <hi>inſeparability</hi> and <hi>coequality.</hi> And therefore each of their <hi>perfections</hi> and <hi>perfect Receptions</hi> from God, and <hi>operations on God,</hi> is the ultimate end of man: But yet they are <hi>Diſtinguiſhable,</hi> though not <hi>diviſible</hi>; and there is ſuch an <hi>Order</hi> among them, as that <hi>one</hi> may in ſome reſpects be called the <hi>Inceptor</hi> and another the <hi>Perfecter</hi> of humane <hi>operations</hi>; and ſo the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>one</hi> be called a <hi>means</hi> to the <hi>Acts</hi> of the other. And thus though the <hi>Viſion</hi> or <hi>Knowledge of God</hi> be <hi>one</hi> inadequate conception (if not a <hi>part</hi>) of our ultimate end; yet the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and <hi>Living to God,</hi> are alſo other <hi>conceptions</hi> or <hi>parts</hi> of it: yea and the more completive perfect parts, which we call <hi>finis ultimate ultimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The proof ſhall be fetcht, 1. From the Order and uſe of the <hi>Faculties</hi> of the Soul. 2. From the Objects. 3. From the conſtitution of the Acts. 4. From expreſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:55434:117"/>I. It is evident to our internal perception, 1. That the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is but the <hi>Guide</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> and its acts but mediate to determine the Will: As the <hi>Eye</hi> is to lead the <hi>Appetitive</hi> and <hi>Executive</hi> faculties, by preſenting to them their proper objects. To <hi>know</hi> is but an initial introductory act.</p>
               <p>Yea, 2. It is evident that the Soul is not <hi>Satisfied</hi> with bare <hi>knowing</hi> if no <hi>Delight</hi> or <hi>Complacency</hi> follow: For what is that which we call <hi>Satisfaction</hi> but the <hi>Complacency</hi> of the <hi>Will?</hi> Suppoſe a man to have no effect upon his <hi>Will,</hi> no <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> no <hi>Contentation</hi> in his <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and what <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi> or <hi>Deſireable Good</hi> to him, would there be, in all the <hi>Knowledge</hi> in the world? Yea when I name either <hi>[Good]</hi> or <hi>[Deſirable]</hi> every one knoweth that I name an object of the <hi>Will.</hi> Therefore if you ſtop at bare <hi>Intellection,</hi> it is not to be called <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Deſireable</hi> as to the <hi>Intellect,</hi> theſe being not proper intellectual objects: Though remotely I confeſs they are; that is, that which is called <hi>Good, Amiable</hi> and <hi>Deſireable</hi> primarily as the proper object of the <hi>Will,</hi> muſt be <hi>diſcerned</hi> to be ſuch by the <hi>underſtanding:</hi> When yet the <hi>Formal notion</hi> of the Intellects object, is but <hi>quid Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibile,</hi> which <hi>materially</hi> is <hi>Ens, Unum, Verum, Bonum:</hi> But <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is the <hi>Formal notion</hi> of the object of the will, and not only the material.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note>If any ſay that I ſeem here to take part with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> (and <hi>Cicero's Torquatus</hi>) who erred by placing the chief excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Virtue in the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of it; and conſequently mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing <hi>more Excellent</hi> which is <hi>more Pleaſant,</hi> though it be ſin itſelf; I anſwer, he that will decide that great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, muſt diſtinguiſh, 1.

Between that which is <hi>Good</hi> only to me, and that which is <hi>Good</hi> to others, and that which is <hi>Good</hi> in relation to the Supream and Final <hi>Will</hi> of God. 3. Between the <hi>Exterior</hi> and the <hi>Interior</hi> acts of Virtue. And then you ſhall
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55434:117"/>
ſee <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Torquatus</hi> eaſily reconciled, thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is certain that GOODNESS and the WILL are ſo eſſentially related to each other, that they muſt each e<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>r the others definition. To be <hi>Bonum</hi> is to be <hi>Volibile</hi>; and to <hi>Will</hi> is ever <hi>Velle Bonum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is certain that <hi>God's Will</hi> is the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of all Created <hi>Good,</hi> which hath its <hi>Eſſence</hi> in relation to His Will. And therefore if it were poſſible for <hi>Virtue</hi> to be <hi>unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant</hi> or <hi>pernicious</hi> to the poſſeſſor, it would be <hi>Good</hi> as it is <hi>ſuited</hi> and <hi>related</hi> to the <hi>Will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore it cannot be ſaid, that <hi>Virtue</hi> as <hi>Virtue</hi> is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Virtue</hi> as it <hi>pleaſeth God</hi>: But it is moſt certain that <hi>Virtue</hi> as <hi>Virtue</hi> is <hi>pleaſing to God,</hi> (as to the objective apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,) and that <hi>Virtue as pleaſing to God,</hi> and conſequently as <hi>Virtue,</hi> is Better than Virtue, as it is <hi>pleaſant</hi> to the <hi>poſſeſſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And it is certain that Virtue, as it is <hi>profitable,</hi> and <hi>juſtly pleaſing</hi> to <hi>Mankind,</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> to <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> to Publick Societies or multitudes, is <hi>better</hi> than as it is <hi>pleaſing</hi> unto <hi>one</hi>: Becauſe the Good of <hi>many</hi> is <hi>better</hi> than of one.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And it is certain that Virtue, as it pleaſeth the rational <hi>Will,</hi> is better than as it pleaſeth the meer <hi>Senſitive Appetite,</hi> which it ſeldom doth: And therefore <hi>Senſuality</hi> hath no advantage hence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And <hi>Virtue</hi> as it <hi>profiteth,</hi> though at preſent it occaſion ſorrow or diſplicence in its conſequents, is better than that which at the preſent only pleaſeth; and quickly vaniſheth. But that <hi>Profit</hi> lieth in this, that it prepareth for <hi>everlaſting</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or more <hi>durable Pleaſure.</hi> And a long <hi>Pleaſure</hi> attained by preſent ſorrow, is better than a momentany pleaſure; which is another difference between ſenſual ſinful; and ſpiritual durable delights.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And to end all this Controverſie between us and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> it is notorious, that the <hi>Internal Vital Acts</hi> of true <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> are nothing elſe radically but <hi>Pleaſure</hi> it ſelf: For it is radically and ſummarily nothing but the <hi>Love of God and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55434:118"/>
Goodneſs</hi>: And <hi>Love</hi> in its propereſt notion is nothing but the <hi>Complacency of the Will.</hi> To ſay, <hi>I love it,</hi> is but to ſay, <hi>It pleaſeth me</hi>; unleſs when you ſpeak of either ſenſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and delight, or Love as conjunct with ſome other act or paſſion. And (though <hi>Occam</hi> here ſtretch it a little too far) it is certain that the <hi>external act</hi> of man hath no <hi>Virtue</hi> in it that is Moral, but <hi>ſecondary</hi> and <hi>derived</hi> from the <hi>Will,</hi> even as far as it is Voluntary: So that the informing root of all Virtue is <hi>Will, Love,</hi> or <hi>Complacency</hi>; which <hi>Auſtin</hi> uſeth to call <hi>Delectation,</hi> aſſerting what I now aſſert. So that the Queſtion now is, Whether Virtue, which is nothing but Complacency in Good, be better as <hi>Complacency</hi> or as <hi>Virtue,</hi> that is, under <hi>one Name</hi> or <hi>another?</hi> or whether it be better as <hi>Virtue,</hi> or as <hi>Virtue?</hi> as <hi>Complacency,</hi> or as <hi>Complacency?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you think I make <hi>Cicero</hi> and the older Philoſophers fools, by feigning them to agitate ſuch a Queſtion; I anſwer, 1. If they do ſo, it is not my doing, but their own. 2. But I think <hi>Cicero</hi> meant not ſo fooliſhly, but underſtood <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> only of <hi>ſenſual</hi> pleaſure, and not of <hi>rational.</hi> 3. Or at leaſt of <hi>private pleaſure</hi> of a ſingle perſon, as oppoſite to the utility and pleaſure of multitudes. 4. And whether he had ſo much Theology as to remember that which is it that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth the whole doubt, I know not; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Virtus as Virtue is objectively pleaſing to the Will of God,</hi> and as <hi>pleaſing to God,</hi> it is better than as <hi>pleaſing to me,</hi> and all the world.</p>
               <p>So that notwithſtanding this Objection (thus fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered) the Acts of the Intellect meerly as ſuch, without their reſpect to <hi>ſome Will</hi> (either of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man</hi>) are not ſo much as <hi>formally Amiable, Deſirable</hi> or <hi>Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I further add, that the Acts of the <hi>Intellect</hi> may be <hi>forced, involuntary, diſpleaſing,</hi> and both <hi>morally</hi> and <hi>penally</hi> evil. A man may by God be forbidden to ſearch after, and to <hi>know</hi> ſome things; and to <hi>know</hi> them (as <hi>voluntarily done</hi>) may be his ſin. And all know that a man may be <hi>neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to know</hi> many things; and that knowledge may torment
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55434:118"/>
him: As to know dangers, loſſes, enmities, injuries, future evils; eſpecially ſins, by an accuſing Conſcience, and God's diſpleaſure: And Devils and damned Souls have ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>All this is true of ſome knowledge, but not of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God or Goodneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is granted then that Knowledge as ſuch is not ſufficient to be man's felicity, or final act. 2. And as to the Object, I eaſily grant that the true <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God is the <hi>initial part</hi> of man's felicity: But that is much, becauſe it ever inferreth that <hi>Love</hi> or Complacency of the <hi>Will,</hi> which is the more completive part. 3. But there is a Knowledge even of God, which being ſeparated from <hi>Love,</hi> is <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery</hi>: As the Devils and damned that believe and tremble, and hate and ſuffer, are not without all knowledge of God. So much for the firſt proof, fetcht from the order of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond proof is fetcht from the Objects: It is not meer <hi>Intelligibility</hi> that bleſſeth a man, but <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which as ſuch is the formal Object of the <hi>Will,</hi> though the <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> Object of the <hi>Underſtanding.</hi> It is a <hi>pleaſant thing</hi> for the Eyes to behold the Sun: And as pleaſant, it is good; and alſo as <hi>uſeful</hi> to further <hi>pleaſure</hi> of <hi>our ſelves</hi> or <hi>others.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing maketh a man <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Happy</hi> but as it is <hi>Good.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Goodneſs of God,</hi> (his tranſcendent perfection by which he is firſt <hi>Eſſentially Good in himſelf,</hi> and <hi>amiable</hi> to <hi>himſelf,</hi> and then <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Amiable to us all</hi>) is the ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ultimate object of mans Soul, to which his <hi>Intelligibility</hi> is ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third proof is from the Conſtitution of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

For Love it's ſaid, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18. <hi>We have known and believed the Love that God hath to us: God is Love; and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is our Love made perfect, (or in this the Love with us is perfected) that we have boldneſs in the day of Judgment. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as he is, ſo are we, in this world: There is no fear in Love, but perfect Love caſteth out fear. He that feareth is not made perfect in Love.</hi>] So that Love is the perfection of man.</p>

                  <p> The End of Knowledge is to make us Lovers of God, and ſo to be known with Love by Him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis is the ſecond Doctrine contained in the meaning of the Text. Where is included, 1. That all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Creatures (called Learning) muſt be valued and uſed but as a <hi>means</hi> to the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of God: Which is moſt evident in that the whole Creation is the work of God, bearing the Image or Impreſs of his Perfections, to reveal him to the Intellectual Creature, and to be the means of provoking us to his love, and helping us in his ſervice. To deny this therefore is to ſubvert the uſe of the whole Creation, and to ſet up Gods works as an uſeleſs ſhadow, or as an Idol in his place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is included as was afore-proved, that all our <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of God himſelf, is given us to kindle in us the <hi>Love of God.</hi> It is the Bellows to blow up this holy Fire. If it do not this it is unſound and dead. If it do this it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained its end; which is much of the meaning of <hi>James</hi> in that <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. which prejudice hindereth many from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:55434:120"/>3. This love of God hath its degrees and effects: Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge firſt kindleth but ſome weak initial act of love; which through mixtures of <hi>fear,</hi> and of <hi>carnal affections</hi> is hardly known to be ſincere by him that hath it. But afterward it produceth both ſtronger acts, and the Holy Ghoſt ſtill working as the principal cauſe, infuſeth or operateth a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated Habit. So that this holy love becometh like a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in the Soul, even a <hi>divine nature:</hi> And it becometh in a ſort <hi>natural</hi> to us to love God and goodneſs, though not as the brutiſh nature, which is exerciſed by neceſſity and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon. And this new <hi>nature</hi> of holy <hi>love,</hi> is called the new Creature, and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt dwelling in</hi> us, and the Spirit of Adoption; and is our <hi>New-name,</hi> the <hi>White-ſtone,</hi> the <hi>Witneſs</hi> in our ſelves that Chriſt is the Saviour, and that we are the Regenerate Children of God, the Pledge, the Earneſt, the Firſt-fruits, and the Fore-taſte of Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <p>And all the works of a Chriſtian are ſo far truly <hi>holy,</hi> as they are the Effects of <hi>holy love</hi>: For 1. <hi>Holy love</hi> is but a <hi>holy will</hi>; and the <hi>will</hi> is the <hi>man,</hi> in point of <hi>Morality.</hi> 2. And the <hi>love of God</hi> is our <hi>final act upon the final object</hi>; and all other gracious acts are ſome way <hi>means</hi> ſubſervient to this <hi>end:</hi> And the <hi>end</hi> is it that informeth all the <hi>means,</hi> they being ſuch only as they are adapted to the <hi>end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this ſenſe it is true which is ſaid in the Schools (though many Proteſtants miſunderſtanding it, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted it) that <hi>love</hi> is the <hi>form</hi> of all other Graces: That is, It is the heart of the new Creature; or it is that by which the <hi>man</hi> is <hi>Morally</hi> to be reputed and denominated: And it is the final Grace which animateth or informeth the reſt as means.</p>
               <p>And thus it is true, that when you will prove any Grace to be ſincere and ſaving, or any evidence certain, you muſt prove it to participate of the <hi>love of God</hi> and <hi>goodneſs,</hi> or you have failed and ſaid nothing. (Yea, you muſt prove
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55434:120"/>
it to be conjunct with predominant love, which ſetteth God above all Creatures.) And if you will prove any <hi>good</hi> work to be acceptable to God, (Prayer, Praiſe, Alms, Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, &amp;c.) you muſt prove that it cometh from this <hi>predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant love.</hi> For it is ſo far and no further acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>And their ignorance is but to be pitied, who tell you that this is to make our <hi>love of God</hi> to be inſtead of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to us, or to ſet up an acceptable righteouſneſs or merit in our ſelves: For we dream not that our <hi>love of God</hi> was a Sacrifice for our ſins, and the Expiatory Atonement and Satisfaction to Juſtice, nor that Merit which procured us Love it ſelf, or purchaſed us the Holy Ghoſt. Our meaning is that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the only proper object of <hi>love</hi>: And God loveth his Eſſential goodneſs firſt, and <hi>Created</hi> goodneſs next: And our <hi>Moral goodneſs</hi> which is his <hi>Image</hi> is <hi>holy love</hi> (produced by and joined with <hi>holy wiſdom</hi> and <hi>vitality.</hi>) And ſo though God love us <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> or as <hi>Related</hi> to him, it is as <hi>holy Members</hi> of him; and not that he loveth complacentially the haters of God for their Relation to Chriſt, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to any goodneſs in themſelves. And to ſay that Chriſt maketh us acceptable and amiable to God, is all one as to ſay that he procureth us the pardon of Sin, and the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and maketh us holy Lovers of God: Or that he is indeed our Saviour. He that commendeth <hi>health</hi> as wrought by his Phyſician, doth not ſet <hi>health</hi> inſtead of the Phyſician. Chriſt is the Phyſician; the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> or <hi>Holy Love</hi> in us, is our health: To procure and give us the Holy Ghoſt, is Chriſts Office. He pardoneth our ſin when he pardoneth the puniſhment: The privation of the Holy Ghoſt and his operations is our principal puniſhment: And therefore (not all, but) the principal part of our <hi>pardon</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the giving us the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, <hi>That if God love nothing but goodneſs, and love us no further than we are good, how then did he love us
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55434:121"/>
firſt, and while we were his Enemies? Are not Election, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Redemption and Converſion acts of love? And is not our love, the fruit of his love?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thus <hi>Names</hi> not opened, by confounding Heads, are made the matter of a thouſand Controverſies. As our <hi>love</hi> is nothing but our <hi>will,</hi> ſo the word <hi>love</hi> is taken <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and properly, or <hi>largely</hi> and leſs properly. A mans <hi>will</hi> is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as <hi>efficient</hi> or as <hi>final.</hi> As it reſpecteth a future effect, or a preſent exiſtent good. And ſo <hi>Gods will</hi> as it <hi>final,</hi> and <hi>reſpecteth things exiſtent,</hi> either, 1. <hi>In eſſe cognito.</hi> 2. Or <hi>in eſſe reali,</hi> is called <hi>complacence,</hi> and only <hi>complacence</hi> is love in the ſtrict and propereſt ſenſe. But <hi>Gods will</hi> as <hi>efficient</hi> of <hi>good,</hi> may in a laxer ſenſe be called <hi>love.</hi> Gods <hi>will</hi> is the Fountain or efficient cauſe of all good, Natural and Moral in the World. And ſo you may call Gods <hi>cauſing</hi> or <hi>making good,</hi> by the name of <hi>love,</hi> if you pleaſe; remembring that it is but the <hi>name</hi> that is queſtioned: But his complacency in <hi>good</hi> foreſeen or <hi>exiſtent</hi> is ſtrictly called his <hi>love.</hi> And ſo ſtill God loveth nothing in either ſenſe but <hi>good.</hi> For 1. He cauſeth nothing but good. 2. And he is <hi>pleaſed</hi> in nothing but good as good.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But how then doth God love his Enemies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. He maketh <hi>us men,</hi> which may be called one act of efficient love: And he Redeemeth them; and he giveth them all the good things which they poſſeſs: And he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth ſome, and maketh them lovers of him, that is, holy. And thus he <hi>willeth</hi> their <hi>good,</hi> while they are Nothing or Evil; which is called <hi>Benevolence,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> efficient.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And he hath true love of complacency in them. 1. As they have the <hi>good of humane nature.</hi> 2. And thereby are <hi>capable of grace,</hi> and all the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> which after they may perform. 3. And as they are <hi>Related</hi> to Chriſt as <hi>his Redeemed ones.</hi> 4. And as by <hi>Relation</hi> they <hi>are thoſe</hi> that God <hi>fore-knoweth</hi> will <hi>love</hi> and <hi>ſerve him</hi> here, and in the perfections of Eternal Glory. There is all this <hi>good</hi> in ſome
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55434:121"/>
Enemies of God, to be the matter of his complacency. And beyond their <hi>goodneſs</hi> he hath no complacency in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And to clear up all this, ſtill remember, that though <hi>mans will</hi> is changed by or upon the various objects, yet ſo is not the will of God. And therefore all theſe words ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no variety or change in God; but only how his ſimple immutable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eſſential will is variouſly related to and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Connotation of <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Objects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Alſo it muſt be noted, as included in the Text, that <hi>God loveth all that truly love him</hi>: For to be <hi>known of him,</hi> here meaneth, to be <hi>known with approbation</hi> and <hi>love as his peculiar people.</hi> As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.6. It is ſaid, <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous</hi>; and ſo oft: And of the wicked, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.12. <hi>Depart from me, I know you not.</hi> God <hi>owneth with love</hi> all thoſe that <hi>love him.</hi> What Parts, what Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, what Degree ſoever men are of, whatever difference elſe there be among them, if they are true lovers of God, they are certainly approved and beloved by him. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very Heart and Eſſence of the new Creature, and the Divine Nature in us, muſt needs prove that man to be Amiable to God that hath it. Other things are true marks of a Child of God, only ſo far as they participate of love: But love is the primary proper Character, which proveth us Adopted directly of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And here you may reſolve the queſtion that ſeemeth ſo difficult to many: Whether when the Scripture either by deſcribing the godly, or by promiſing Life, doth mention ſome one Grace or Duty, as the Character of a Saint, or the Condition of Salvation, it be to be underſtood with a <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> if other Graces and Duties concur, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them ſeparable? Or abſolutely, as ſuppoſing that one mark infallible, becauſe it is never ſeparated from the reſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The New Man hath 1. Its <hi>Eſſential</hi> parts; and 2. Its <hi>Integrals</hi>; and 3. Its <hi>Accidents.</hi> The <hi>Eſſentials</hi> are ever infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55434:122"/>
marks, and are inſeparable from each other: Any one of them will prove us Holy, and will prove the preſence of the reſt. Theſe <hi>Eſſentials</hi> are an united Trinity of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Holy Life, Light</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>; where each one hath the common <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which is their objective termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon God; and each is linked by participation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Holy Vitality</hi> is <hi>Vital Activity</hi> towards God, in mind, will and practice; <hi>Holy Light</hi> is that <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi> which kindleth <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>cauſeth</hi> a <hi>Holy Life. Holy Love</hi> is that complacency of the <hi>Will in God</hi> and Goodneſs, which is kindled by Holy Life and Light, and operateth in Holy practice. Any one of theſe thus deſcribed, where <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>Heart</hi> of all, is an infallible mark of <hi>Holineſs.</hi> But all other Graces and Duties which are but the Integrals of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, are in all <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> to be underſtood with a <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> that is, ſuppoſing them to be animated with <hi>Holy Love,</hi> and cauſed by Holy Life and Light (Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Belief.)</p>
               <p>And that God doth moſt certainly <hi>Love</hi> all that <hi>Love him,</hi> beſides the forementioned proofs from Scripture is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Love</hi> of God and Goodneſs is the Divine Nature: And God cannot but Love his own Nature in us: It is his Image, which (as in its ſeveral degrees) he Loveth for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and next to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Love</hi> of God is the <hi>Rectitude</hi> of Man's Soul; its ſoundneſs, health and beauty: And God Loveth the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his creatures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Love</hi> of God is the final, perfect operation of the Soul; even that end which it was created and redeemed for: And God Loveth to have his works attain their end, and to ſee them in their perfection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Love</hi> of God is the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the Soul it ſelf: And <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is <hi>Amiableneſs,</hi> and muſt needs be Loved by Him that is Goodneſs and Perfection Himſelf.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:55434:122"/>5. The <hi>Love</hi> of God is our <hi>uniting adheſion</hi> to him: And God that firſt draweth up the Soul to this Union, will not himſelf reject us, and avoid it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Love</hi> is a pregnant, powerful, pleaſing Grace: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth up our ſelves, and all that we have to God: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in duty: It conquereth difficulties: It contemneth competitors, and trampleth on temptations: It accounteth nothing too much, nor too dear for God. Love is the Soul's nature, appetite and <hi>pondus,</hi> according to which it will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily act. A man's Love, is <hi>his Will, his Heart, himſelf:</hi> And if God have our Love, he hath our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and our all: So that God cannot but Love the Soul that truly Loveth him as God.</p>
               <p>But here are ſome Doubts to be reſolved.</p>
               <p>Q. 1. <hi>What if the ſame Soul have Love and Sin mixed; or ſincere Love in a degree that is ſinfully defective, and ſo is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſomething of its contrary: God muſt hate that Sin: How then can he Love that Soul</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Remember ſtill that <hi>Diverſity</hi> is only in us, and not in God: Therefore God's <hi>Will</hi> is related and denominated towards us, juſt as its object is. All that is Good in us God Loveth: All that is Evil in us he hateth. Where <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is predominant, there <hi>God's Love</hi> is predominant, or greateſt (from this Relation and Connotation.) Where <hi>Sin</hi> is predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, God's averſation, diſplicency or hatred is the chief. And we may well expect that the effects be anſwerable.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But we are beloved as Elect before Converſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That was anſwered before. That is, God from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity purpoſed to make us Good, and Amiable, and Happy; if you will call that (as you may) <hi>his Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But we are beloved in Chriſt, for his Righteouſneſs and Goodneſs, and not for our own.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The latter is falſe: The former is thus true: For the Merits of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and Goodneſs, God will pardon our ſins, and make us Good, Holy and Happy; and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55434:123"/>
will Love us as the Holy Members of his Son; that is, both as <hi>Related to him,</hi> and as <hi>Holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But if God muſt needs Love ſincere imperfect Lovers of him as ſuch, with a predominant Love (which will not damn them) then ſin might have been pardoned without Chriſt's death, and the ſinner be loved without his Righteouſneſs, if he had but ſincerely loved God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſuppoſition is falſe, that a ſinner could have Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God without <hi>Pardon</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> purchaſed by the Death and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. God perfectly Loveth the perfected Souls in Glory for their own holy perfection: But they never attained it but by Chriſt. And God Loveth us here according to the meaſure of our Love to him: But no man can thus <hi>Love him,</hi> till his ſin be <hi>pardoned,</hi> for which he was deprived of the <hi>Spirit</hi> which muſt kindle Love. And imperfect Love is ever joyned with imperfect Pardon (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome falſly ſay to the contrary;) I mean that Love which is <hi>ſinfully</hi> imperfect.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Doth not God's Loving us make us Happy? And if ſo, it muſt make us Holy. And then none that he Loveth will fall away from him: Whereas the fallen Angels and</hi> Adam <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, and yet fell from him: How then were they beloved by him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I before told you that <hi>God's Will</hi> (or <hi>Love</hi>) is firſt <hi>Efficient cauſing Good,</hi> and then <hi>Final,</hi> being <hi>pleaſed</hi> in the <hi>Good</hi> that is <hi>cauſed.</hi> God's <hi>Efficient Will</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> doth ſo far make men <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Happy</hi> as they are ſuch, even <hi>efficiently.</hi> But <hi>God's Will</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> as it is our <hi>Cauſa finalis,</hi> and the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Object of our <hi>Love,</hi> and is <hi>pleaſed</hi> in us, and approveth us, is not the <hi>Efficient Cauſe</hi> of our <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi>; but the <hi>objective</hi> and <hi>perfect conſtitutive Cauſe.</hi> Now you muſt further note, that <hi>God's Benevolent Efficient Will</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> doth give men various <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Holineſs.</hi> To <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency he gave but ſuch a degree, and upon ſuch terms as he could loſe and caſt away; which he did. But to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55434:123"/>
the bleſſed in Glory, he giveth that which they ſhall never loſe. Theſe <hi>degrees</hi> are from God's Efficient Love or Will, which therefore cauſeth ſome to perſevere, when it left <hi>Adam</hi> to himſelf to ſtand or fall. But it is not God's <hi>Final Love of Complacency</hi> as ſuch, that cauſeth our perſeverance: For <hi>Adam</hi> had this Love as long as he Loved God and ſtood, and he after loſt it; ſo that it is not that Final Complacency which is the <hi>Terminus</hi> of our Holineſs, and Conſtitutive Cauſe of our Happineſs, which alone will ſecure the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of either of them.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Thus you make God mutable in his Love, as Loving</hi> Adam <hi>more before his fall than after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I told you, <hi>Loving</hi> and <hi>not Loving</hi> the Creature, are no changes in God, but in the Creature. It is <hi>Man</hi> that is mutable, and not God. It is only the Relation of God's Will to the Creature as varying in it ſelf, and the extrinſick deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, by connotation of a changed Object, which is changed as to God. As the Sun is not changed when you wink, and when you open your Eyes: Nor a Pillar changed when your motion ſets it ſometimes on your right hand, and ſometimes on your left.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, It muſt be noted as included in the Text, That <hi>our own Loving God is not the only or total notion of our end, perfection or felicity; but to be Known and Loved by God is the other part, which muſt be taken in, to make up the total notion of our end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>our Love,</hi> God is conſidered as the <hi>Object:</hi> But in God's <hi>Complacential Love to us,</hi> he is conſidered as Active, and his Love as an Act, and Man as the Object: But yet not as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Efficiency,</hi> but of <hi>Approbation</hi> and a <hi>Pleaſed Will</hi> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Here then the great difficulty is in reſolving which of theſe is the <hi>higheſt perfective notion of man's felicity, perfection</hi> or <hi>ultimate end; Our Love to God,</hi> or <hi>God's Love to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is <hi>mutual Love</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> which is the true and compleat notion of our End: And to compare <hi>God's Love</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:55434:124"/>
and ours as the parts, and tell which is the final principal part or notion, is not eaſy, nor abſolutely neceſſary. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That our Love to God</hi> is <hi>Objectively</hi> or as to the Object of it, infinitely more excellent than <hi>Gods Love to us</hi> as to the Object: Which is but to ſay, that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Infinitely</hi> better than man: God loveth man who is a worm: But <hi>we</hi> Love God who is perfect goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Gods Love to us</hi> as to the <hi>Agent</hi> and the <hi>Act ex parte A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentis,</hi> is Infinitely more excellent than our Love to him: For it is Gods Eſſential will which loveth us; and it is the will of a worm that loveth God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That mans <hi>Felicity</hi> as ſuch, is not the chief notion of his ultimate end: But he muſt Love God as God better than his own Felicity as ſuch, or better than God as our Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That mans true ultimate <hi>end,</hi> containeth theſe five inadequate <hi>conceptions.</hi> 1. The loweſt notion or part of it is <hi>our own holineſs and felicity.</hi> 2. The next notion of it is the perfection of the Church and Univerſe, to which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, and which we muſt value above our own; Includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Glory of Chriſts Humanity. 3. The third no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the <hi>Glory</hi> or <hi>Luſtre</hi> of Gods perfections as they ſhine forth in us and all his perfected glorious works. 4. The fourth notion is, <hi>Gods own Eſſential goodneſs</hi> as the Object of our Knowledge, Love and Praiſe. 5. The fifth and higheſt notion is, the Active Love or <hi>Complacency</hi> of Gods fulfilled <hi>Will,</hi> in us and in the <hi>whole</hi> Creation. So that the <hi>Pleaſing</hi> of Gods <hi>will</hi> is the higheſt notion of mans ultimate end. Though all theſe five are neceſſarily contained in it.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THis third Doctrine is much of the Scope of the Text: All <hi>means</hi> are for their <hi>end:</hi> So far as <hi>Knowledge</hi> is a <hi>means</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> it muſt needs hence have the <hi>meaſure</hi> of its <hi>worth,</hi> and we the <hi>motives</hi> of our <hi>deſires</hi> of it, and the <hi>direction</hi> for our <hi>uſing of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. All <hi>knowledge</hi> that kindleth not the <hi>love</hi> of God in us, is ſo narrow, and ſmall that it deſerveth not indeed the name of Knowledge: For the neceſſary things that ſuch a perſon is Ignorant of, are a thouſand times more or greater, than that little which he knoweth: For, 1. What is it that he is Ignorant of?</p>
               <p n="1">1. He hath no ſound and real Knowledge of God. For if he <hi>knew God,</hi> truly, he could not but love him: <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is ſo naturally the Object of the <hi>will,</hi> that if men well knew the infinite Good, they muſt needs love him: However there is a partial knowledge that is ſeparable from ſincere Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that <hi>knoweth</hi> not and <hi>loveth</hi> not God, neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nor loveth any creature truly and effectually either as it is <hi>of God,</hi> or <hi>Through him,</hi> or <hi>To him</hi>; Either as it beareth the Impreſs of the Glorious <hi>Efficient,</hi> or as it is <hi>order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to its end by the moſt <hi>wiſe Director,</hi> or as it is a <hi>means</hi> to lead up Souls to God, or to Glorify and pleaſe him, no nor to make man truly happy. And can he be ſaid indeed to know any Creature that knoweth it not in any of theſe reſpects that knoweth neither its <hi>Original, Order or Uſe?</hi> Doth a Dog or a Gooſe know a Book of Philoſophy, becauſe he looketh on it, and ſeeth the bulk? Doth he know a Clock or Watch, who knoweth no more of it, but that it <hi>hath</hi> ſuch Parts and Shapes, made of Iron and Braſs? It is moſt evident that an unholy perſon <hi>knoweth nothing,</hi> that is, no one
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55434:125"/>
Being, though he may know <hi>aliquid de re aliqua,</hi> ſomething of ſome Being: For he that knoweth not the <hi>Nature, Order</hi> or <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of a Being, cannot properly be ſaid to know that Being, but only <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> or ſome Accidents of it, or to have a <hi>general</hi> Knowledge that it is a Subſtance, or a ſomething, he knoweth not what. As an Epicurean can call all things compacted <hi>Atomes,</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi> An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man is juſt like one that ſtudieth the art of a Scrivener or Printer, to make the Letters, and place them by art, but never learnt to read or know the ſignification of the Letters which he maketh or compoſeth.</p>
               <p>Or if any may be ſaid to have a <hi>Speculative knowledge</hi> of all this in the Creature (the <hi>Nature, Order,</hi> and <hi>Uſe,</hi>) yet he is without the true Practical Knowledge, which is it that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is Knowledge indeed, and of uſe and benefit to man. For to be able to ſpeak or write a true Propoſition about God or the Creature, is not properly to know <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>Creature,</hi> but to <hi>know names</hi> and <hi>words</hi> concerning them: It is but a Logical Knowledge of Notions, and not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Thing it ſelf, to be able to ſay and know that this or that concerning it, is true or falſe. Nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth mankind, both in point of <hi>Learning</hi> and of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> than miſtaking the Organical or Logical Knowledge of ſecond Notions, Words, Propoſitions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and Methods, for the <hi>Real Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Things</hi> themſelves; And thinking that they <hi>know a thing,</hi> becauſe they know what to ſay of it.</p>
               <p>He knoweth not a Countrey, who is only able by the Map or hear-ſay to deſcribe it. He knoweth not Motion, Light, Heat, Cold, Sweet, Bitter, that knoweth no more than to give a true definition of it. And as this is true of things ſenſible, which muſt themſelves be perceived firſt by ſenſe, ſo is it of things ſpiritual, which muſt <hi>themſelves</hi> be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived firſt by Intellection, and not only the notions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of them. He that doth not intuitively or by internal
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55434:125"/>
immediate perception, know what it is to <hi>Underſtand,</hi> to <hi>Remember,</hi> to <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Nill,</hi> to Love and Hate, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be able to do theſe acts, doth not know what a <hi>man</hi> is, or what a <hi>Reaſonable Soul</hi> is, and what an <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Spirit</hi> is, though he could (were it poſſible) without theſe, learn the <hi>Definition</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Soul,</hi> a <hi>Spirit.</hi> A defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition or word of art ſpoken by a Parrot, or a madman prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that he knoweth the thing.</p>
               <p>Practical objects are not truly known without a Practical Knowledge of them. He knoweth not what <hi>meat</hi> is, that <hi>knoweth not</hi> that it muſt be <hi>eaten,</hi> and how to eat it. He only knoweth his clothing that knoweth how to put it on. He only knoweth a Pen, a Gun, or other inſtrument, that knoweth how to uſe it. Now the ungodly, not knowing how any creature ſignifieth the Divine perfections, nor how by it to aſcend to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of God, do indeed know <hi>nothing</hi> with a proper formal Knowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And what is it that ſuch men <hi>know</hi> or ſeem to <hi>know,</hi> which may be compared with their Ignorance? To give them their due praiſe, they know how to <hi>eat</hi> as well as a Dog, though not ſo ſubtilly as an Ox or Sheep, that can diſtinguiſh graſs before he taſte it. He can tell how to drink, tho' not by ſo conſtant a temperance as a Beaſt. He can ſpeak better than a Parrot: He can build him a houſe as apt for his uſe, as a Swallow or other Birds can do for theirs. He can lay up for the time to come, more ſubtilly than a Fox, or Ant, though nothing ſo orderly and by wonderful ſelf-conficiency, as the Bees: He can look upwards, and ſee the Birds that ſoar and fly in the Air, though he cannot imitate them: He can look into the ſurface of the Waters, and Artificially paſs over them in Ships, though he cannot live in them, or glide through them as the fiſh: He can maſter thoſe that are weaker than himſelf, as the great Dogs do the little ones, and carry away the bone from them all: He can glory in his Strength, though it be leſs than a Horſe's, an Oxe's, an
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55434:126"/>
Elephant's, or a Whale's. He can kill and eat his fellow Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, as well as a Pike among the Fiſhes, a Kite among the Birds, or a Wolf or Dog among the Beaſts: He can more craftily than the Fox entrap and enſnare them (the Fiſhes, Birds and Beaſts;) yea as artificially as a Spider doth the Flies, to make up what he wants, of the Hawk, or Dog for ſwift purſuit, or of the Lyon for rapacious Strength. He can ſing; and ſo can the Linnet, the Owſel the Lark and Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale: He can make his Bed as ſoft as the Birds their Neſts, or as other creatures that love their eaſe: He can generate and breed up his Off-ſpring, though not with that conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of affection, and accurateneſs of Skill and Induſtry, as a Hen her Chickens, or moſt other animals do their young. Yea he can live in Society, Families, Commonwealths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though much more diſorderly, contentiouſly and to the diſturbance if not deſtruction of each other, than Pigeons in their Dove-houſe or the flight of Stares, or Larks, or Lapwings, or the flocks of Sheep, and leſs accurately than the Bees do in their Hive.</p>
               <p>All this and more we can ſpeak of the praiſes of the <hi>Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom of an ungodly</hi> man, that never learnt to Know and Love his God, nor any thing truly worthy of a man: And is all this worthy the name of <hi>Knowledge?</hi> Their Character could not be fitlier given, than here it is by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: <hi>They know nothing as they ought to know.</hi> But of this more next.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THis fourth Doctrine, is alſo a diſcernable part of the meaning of the Apoſtle in the Text. His purpoſe is to humble thoſe that judge themſelves wiſe for that which is no <hi>wiſdom,</hi> but <hi>uſeleſs, ludicrous notions</hi> and <hi>ſelf-conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> And to ſhew men wherein true <hi>wiſdom doth conſiſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:55434:126"/>
Many thouſands there are that <hi>heartily love God,</hi> and are <hi>devoted</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> to his <hi>ſervice</hi> in the World, who never read Logick, Phyſicks, Metaphyſicks or Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; nor laid in that ſtock of artificial notions, which are the Glory and Utenſils of the Learned World. And yet that <hi>theſe</hi> are <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>happily wiſe</hi> and <hi>knowing,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle judgeth, and I thus further prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they <hi>know</hi> the <hi>things</hi> themſelves, and not only the names and definitions of them: As he that knoweth food by eating it, the Military Art, or Navigation by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, or a Countrey by travelling or dwelling in it. Others lick the outſide of the Glaſs, but taſte not the ſweet that is within.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe they <hi>know</hi> the <hi>greateſt and moſt excellent things: God</hi> is infinitely <hi>greater and better</hi> than the Creatures: And <hi>Heaven</hi> incomparably better than the riches and pleaſures of this Earth. To know how to Build a City, or a Navy, and how to Govern an Army or a Kingdom, is more than to know how to pick Sticks or Straws, or to dreſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs us. Underſtanding is valuable by the dignity of its objects; therefore how much doth the wiſdom of a holy Soul excell all the Craft and Learning of the ungodly? Let not the rich man glory in his riches—<hi>But let him that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth glory in this, that he knoweth God</hi>; if he ſo know him as to love him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe they know the moſt <hi>Neceſſary</hi> things, and the moſt <hi>Profitable.</hi> They know how to <hi>be Good,</hi> and how to do their duty, and how to attain their <hi>End,</hi> and how to pleaſe God, and how to eſcape damnation, and how to be happy in everlaſting joy and glory. And I think he is wiſe, that is wiſe enough to be <hi>Happy,</hi> and to attain all that the Soul of man can well deſire.</p>
               <p>But who will deſire the Wiſdom that maketh a man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better? and that will not ſave his Soul from Hell? What Soul in Hell doth think that <hi>Wiſdom</hi> brought him
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55434:127"/>
thither? It were a thouſand times better, not to know how to ſpeak or go, to dreſs or undreſs us, than not to know how to be holy and happy, and to eſcape ſin and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſery.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A holy Soul underſtandeth that which his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was made for; and for which he hath his life, and time, and teaching; which is but to <hi>be good,</hi> and <hi>Love God</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>to do good.</hi> And <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as is afore proved, as as all other means, is to be eſtimated by its end.</p>
               <p>But an ungodly man knoweth not that which he was made for. He is like a Knife that cannot cut; a Ship that will not endure the Water; a Houſe that is not fit to dwell in. What is a man's wit worth, but for its proper end? If man was made but to eat, and drink, and play, and ſleep, and build, and plant, and ſtir a while about the Earth, and have his will over others, and his fleſhly pleaſure, and then die, then the ungodly may be called wiſe: But if he be made to prepare for another world, and to Know, and Love, and Live to God, they are then worſe than Bedlams, and more dangerouſly beſide themſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A holy Soul knowing God the beginning and end, knoweth all things; Becauſe he knoweth them, 1. In the chiefeſt excellency of their natures, as they bear the Impreſs of God; 2. And in their <hi>Order</hi> as governed by him; 3. And in their <hi>Uſefulneſs</hi> as tending to him: Though neither they, nor any others, be well acquainted with their material part, which the Philoſopher thinketh that he knoweth beſt. Who think you beſt knoweth what <hi>Money</hi> is? He that knoweth the <hi>King's Impreſs,</hi> and the <hi>Value,</hi> and what it is good for, and how to get and uſe it? or he that can only tell you whether it be Copper or Silver, or Gold (not knowing <hi>well</hi> what any of theſe are,) and knoweth nothing of the <hi>Impreſs,</hi> or <hi>Value,</hi> or <hi>Uſe?</hi> I tell you, the humble holy perſon, that ſeeth God in all, and knoweth all things to be <hi>Of Him,</hi> and <hi>By Him,</hi> and <hi>To Him,</hi> and Loveth Him in and for all, and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55434:127"/>
ſerveth Him by all, is the beſt Philoſopher, and hath the greateſt, moſt excellent and profitable Knowledge. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of which, the unholy Learning of the world is well called <hi>Fooliſhneſs</hi> with God. (For I believe not that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſer who would perſwade us, that it is but the Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick conceits and pretenſions of the Gnoſticks, that the Apoſtle here and elſewhere ſpeaketh of. But I reſt ſatisfied that it is primarily the unholy Arts and Sciences of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Heathens; and ſecondarily the Platonick Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks pretenſions to extraordinary Wiſdom, becauſe of their ſpeculations about Angels, Spirits, and other inviſible and myſterious things, which they thought were peculiarly opened unto them.) Doting about queſtions that engender ſtrife, and not edification, and do increaſe to more ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is the true deſcription of unholy Learning.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Lovers of God are <hi>wiſe</hi> for <hi>perpetuity</hi>: They ſee before them: They know what is to come; even as far as to Eternity: They know what will be beſt at laſt, and what will be valued, and ſerve our turn in the hour of our extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: They judge of things as all will judge of them, and as they ſhall conſtantly judge of them for ever. But others are <hi>wiſe</hi> but for a few hours, or a preſent job: They ſee not before them: They are preparing for repentance: They are ſhamefully mutable in their Judgments; magnifying thoſe pleaſures, wealth and honours to day, which they vilifie and cry out againſt at death and to eternity! A pang of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ſight of a grave, the ſentence of death, the awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Conſcience, can change their Judgments, and make them ſpeak in other Language, and confeſs a thouſand times over that they were fools: And if they come to any thing like Wiſdom, 'tis too late, when time is paſt, and hope is gone. But the godly know the day of their viſitation, and are <hi>wiſe in time</hi>; as knowing the ſeaſon of all duties, and the duties of every ſeaſon. And as ſome Schoolmen ſay, that All things are known to the Glorified, <hi>in ſpeculo Trinitatis</hi>;

ſo I may ſay, that <hi>All things are morally and ſavingly known,</hi> to him that <hi>knoweth</hi> and <hi>Loveth God,</hi> as the <hi>Efficient, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of all.</p>
               <p>Yet, to avoid miſtakes and cavils, remember, that I take no true Knowledge as contemptible. And when I truly ſay, that <hi>he knoweth nothing as he ought to know,</hi> that doth not <hi>know</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> his God, and is not wiſe to his <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>; yet if this <hi>Fundamental Knowledge</hi> be preſuppoſed, we ſhould build all other uſeful Knowledge on it, to the utmoſt of our capacity: And from this one ſtock, may ſpring and ſpread a thouſand branches, which may all bear fruit. I would put no limits to a Chriſtian's <hi>deſires</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours</hi> to <hi>know,</hi> but that he deſire only to know <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>revealed</hi> things. Every degree of knowledge tendeth to more: And every known Truth befriendeth others; and like <hi>Fire,</hi> tendeth to the ſpreading of our knowledge, to all neighbour Truths that are intelligible. And the want of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with ſome <hi>one Truth</hi> among an hundred, may hinder us from knowing rightly moſt of the reſt; or may breed an hundred Errours in us. As the abſence of one wheel or particle in a Watch, or the ignorance of it, may put all the reſt into an uſeleſs diſorder. What if I ſay that <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> lieth more, in knowing the things that belong to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to publick good, to life, health, and ſolid comfort, than in knowing how to ſing, or play on the Lute, or to ſpeak or carry our ſelves with commendable decency, &amp;c. It doth not follow that all theſe are of no worth at all; and that in their places theſe little matters may not be allowed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired: For even Hair and Nails are appurtenances of a man, which a wiſe man would not be without; though they are ſmall matters in compariſon of the animal, vital and nobler parts. And indeed he that can ſee God in all things, and hath all this ſanctified by the Love of God, ſhould above all men value each particle of Knowledge, of which ſo holy an uſe may be made: As we value every grain of Gold.</p>

               <p>FRom hence then we may learn how to value the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of our ſelves, and others: That is Good which <hi>doth good.</hi> Would God but give me one <hi>beam</hi> more of the heavenly light, and a little clearer knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, how joyfully could I exchange a thouſand lower no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for it! I feel not my ſelf at all <hi>miſerable,</hi> for want of knowing the number and order of the Stars, the nature of the Meteors, the cauſes of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, with many hundred other queſtions in Phyſicks, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks, Mathematicks: Nor do I feel it any great addition to my happineſs, when I think I know ſomewhat of ſuch things which others know not. But I feel it is my miſery to be <hi>ignorant of God,</hi> and ignorant of my ſtate and duty, and ignorant of the world where I muſt live for ever. This is the Dungeon where my wretched Soul doth lie in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity night and day, groaning and crying out, O when ſhall I know more of God! and more of the Coeleſtial Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! and more of that which I was made to know! O when ſhall I be delivered from this darkneſs and captivity! Had I not one beam that pierceth through this Lanthorn of fleſh, this Dungeon were a Hell, even the outer darkneſs. I find Books that help me to names, and notions: But O for that Spirit that muſt give me Light to know the <hi>Things,</hi> the ſpiritual, great and excellent things, which theſe names import! O how ignorant am I of thoſe ſame things, which I can truly and methodically ſpeak and write of! O that God would have mercy on my dark underſtanding that I be not as a Clock, to tell others that which it ſelf under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not! O how gladly would I conſent to be a fool in all common Arts and Sciences, if I might but be ever the <hi>wiſer</hi> in the Knowledge of God! Did I know better Him
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:55434:129"/>
by whom I live, who upholdeth all things, before whom my Soul muſt ſhortly appear; whoſe favour is my life, whom I hope to love and praiſe for ever; what were all other things to me? O for one beam more of his Light! For one taſt of his Love! for one clear conception of the heavenly glory! I ſhould then ſcarce have leiſure, to think of a thouſand inferiour ſpeculations, which are now mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and agitated in the world.</p>
               <p>But much more miſerable do I find my ſelf, for want of more <hi>Love</hi> to the bleſſed God, who is Love it ſelf. O happy exchange! did I part with all the pleaſures of the world, for one flame, one ſpark more of the Love of God? I hate not my ſelf for my ignorance in the common Arts and Sciences: But my God knoweth, that I even abhor and loath my ſelf, becauſe I love and delight in him no more! O what a Hell is this <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>diſaffected</hi> heart! O what a foretaſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would it be, could I but feel the fervours of Divine Love! Well may that be called the <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> which ſo uniteth Souls to God, and cauſeth them to live in the pleaſures of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I dare not beg hard for more common knowledge: But my Soul melteth with grief for want of Love; and forceth out tears, and ſighs, and cries; O when will Heaven take acquaintance with my heart, and ſhine into it, and warm and revive it, that I may truly experience the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful life of holy Love! I cannot think them loathſom and unlovely, that are unlearned, and want the ornaments of Art. But I abhor and curſe thoſe hateful ſins, which have raiſed the clouds, and ſhut the windows, and hindred me from the more lively Knowledge, and Love of God. Would God but number me with his zealous Lovers, I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay, that he had made me wiſe, and initially hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. But, alas! ſuch high and excellent things will not be gotten with a lazy wiſh, nor will <hi>holy Love</hi> dwell with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in unholy and defiled Souls.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I Muſt confeſs that <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the great Enemy of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the world; and the Prince of Darkneſs, in his Kingdom of Darkneſs, oppugneth the Light, and promoteth the works of Darkneſs by it: And it is found that where Viſion ceaſeth, the People periſh, even for lack of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: And the ignoranteſt Countreys are the moſt ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But I muſt recant ſome former apprehenſions: I have thought the <hi>Armenians,</hi> the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Georgians,</hi> the <hi>Copties,</hi> the <hi>Abaſſines,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> more miſerable for want of Polite Literature, than now I judge them. Though I contemn it not as the <hi>Turks</hi> do, and the <hi>Moſcovites</hi>; yet I perceive that had men but the knowledge of the holy Scriptures, yea of the ſummaries of true Religion, they might be good and happy men, without much more. If there be but <hi>ſome</hi> few among them, skill'd in all the Learning of the world, and expert in uſing the Adverſaries weapons againſt themſelves, as Champions of the Truth, the reſt might do well with the bare Knowledge of God, and a Crucified Chriſt. It is the malice of aſſaulting Enemies, that maketh all other Learning needful in <hi>ſome</hi> for <hi>our defence.</hi> But the New Creature li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not on ſuch food, but on the bread of life, and living waters, and the ſincere Milk of the ſacred Word.</p>
               <p>The old <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and other Countreys, did many Ages keep up the life and comfort of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55434:130"/>
true Religion, even through murders and unparallel'd cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the worldly Learned Church; when they had little of the <hi>Arts</hi> and common <hi>Sciences.</hi> But neceſſary Knowledge was propagated by the induſtry of Parents and Paſtors: Their Children could ſay over their Catechiſms, and could give account of the Principles of Religion, and recite many practical parts of Scripture: And they had much Love and Righteouſneſs, and little Diviſion or Contention among them; which made the moderate Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to <hi>Crato,</hi> that he thought the <hi>Picards</hi> of all men on Earth were likeſt the Apoſtolick Primitive Churches.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Brocardus,</hi> who dwelt among them in <hi>Judea,</hi> tells us that the Chriſtians there that by the Papiſts are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hereticks, (as Neſtorians or Eutychians) were indeed good harmleſs ſimple men, and lived in Piety, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Auſterities, even beyond the very Religious ſort (the Monks and Fryars) of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhamed the wickedneſs of our Learned part of the World.</p>
               <p>And though there be ſad mixtures of ſuch Superſtitions and Traditions, as ignorance uſeth to breed and cheriſh, yet the great devotion and ſtrictneſs of many of the <hi>Abaſſines, Armenians,</hi> and other of thoſe ruder ſort of Chriſtians, is predicated by many Hiſtorians and Travellers. And who knoweth but there may be among their vulgar, more love to God and Heaven, and Holineſs, than among the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Learned Nations, where the Paſtors ſtrive who ſhall be the greateſt, and Preach up that Doctrine and Practice which is conformable to their own Wills and worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; and where the people by the oppoſitions of their Leaders, are drawn into ſeveral Sides and Factions, which as Armies, Militate againſt each other. Is not the love of God like to be leaſt, where Contentions and Controverſies divert the peoples minds from God and neceſſary ſaving Truths? And where men leaſt love one another? And where mutual Hatred, Cruelty and Perſecution, proclaim
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55434:130"/>
them much void of that love which is the Chriſtian Badge?</p>
               <p>I will not ceaſe praying for the further Illumination and Reformation of thoſe Churches: But I will repent of my hard thoughts of the Providence of God, as if he had caſt them almoſt off, and had few holy Souls among them. For ought I know they may be better than moſt of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the like I ſay of many unlearned Chriſtians among our ſelves! we know not what <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> doth dwell in many that we have a very mean eſteem of. The Breathings of poor Souls towards God by Chriſt, and their deſires after greater holineſs is known to God that kindleth it in them, but not to us.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The third Inference: By what meaſures to judge of the Knowledge neceſſary to Church Communion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Know that there are ſome that would make Chriſt two Churches; one <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Congregate</hi> (as they phraſe it) and the other <hi>Regenerate:</hi> Or one <hi>Viſible</hi> and the other <hi>Inviſible</hi>: And accordingly they ſay that <hi>profeſſed Faith</hi> is the qualification of a Member of the Church-Congregate (and Obedience to the Pope, ſay the Papiſts,) and <hi>real love</hi> is the qualification of the Church-Regenerate.</p>
               <p>But as there is but one Catholick Church of Chriſt, ſo is there but <hi>one Faith,</hi> and one <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> by which men are ſtated as Members in that Church. But as <hi>Heart-conſent</hi> and <hi>Tongue-conſent</hi> are two things, but the latter required only as the Expreſſion and Profeſſion of the former; ſo Heart-conſenters and Tongue-conſenters <hi>ſhould</hi> be the ſame men; as <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> make not <hi>two men, but one.</hi> But if the <hi>Tongue</hi> ſpeak that conſent which is not in the <hi>Heart,</hi> that Perſon is an <hi>Hypocrite</hi>; and is but analogically or equivocally called a Chriſtian or Member of Chriſt: And ſuch among the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere are not a diſtinct Church or Society, (if they were, they
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55434:131"/>
ſhould be called the <hi>Hypocritical Church,</hi> and not the <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Congregate Church.</hi>) But they are as Traytors in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or as ſtricken Ears in a Corn Field. But the true Church being <hi>One</hi> is conſidered, as <hi>conſenting</hi> with <hi>Heart</hi> and with the <hi>Tongue:</hi> As a Corn Field hath Straw, Chaff and Grain; and as a Man hath Soul and Body. So that it is the ſame Church that is viſible by Baptiſm and Profeſſion, and Inviſible by Heart-conſent or Sincerity.</p>
               <p>But it is the ſame thing (and not divers) that is in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of the ſincere, and that is to be profeſſed by the Tongue: Even that voluntary practical Faith which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in Baptiſm, and no other. The ſame Faith which is accepted to Salvation in the ſincere and inviſible Members of the Church (as they are called) muſt be profeſſed by all that will (at Age) be <hi>viſible Members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Knowledge and Belief required in Baptiſm is ſo much as prevaileth with the Perſon to give up himſelf to God the <hi>Father,</hi> Son and Holy Ghoſt, as his Reconciled Creator, his <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Sanctifier.</hi> And he that hath ſo much knowledge as will do this, hath as much as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his reception into the Church.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs he that is capable of Baptiſm, is capable of Church Memberſhip; and he that is capable of Church Memberſhip, is capable <hi>de jure</hi> as to <hi>right,</hi> of ſo much Church Communion as he is capable of by <hi>real aptitude</hi>: An Infant is not <hi>naturally</hi> capable of the actions of the Adult; nor half-witted Perſons, of the receptions and performances of the judicious; ſome cannot underſtand a Sermon, or Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or Praiſe, the twentieth part ſo well as others can do, and ſo cannot receive and do beyond their underſtanding: Some may not ſo well underſtand the nature of the Lords Supper, as to be really fit at preſent to receive it: And ſome may be unfit through ſome extraordinary doubts, opinions, or lapſes: But ſtill <hi>de jure</hi> a Church Member hath right to ſo much Church Communion as their real qualifications
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55434:131"/>
make them capable of. For that right is part of the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church member; And to be made a Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is the work of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>And here we muſt conſider of the reaſon, why God would have <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to be the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of that <hi>Faith</hi> which maketh us Chriſtians: Sometime we are called <hi>Believers,</hi> and ſaid to be Juſtified by <hi>Faith,</hi> as if it were <hi>Faith</hi> alone that were our Chriſtianity: And yet when it cometh to Church entrance, and to the ſolemn profeſſion of our faith, and reception of a Sealed and Delivered pardon, we muſt do more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that we believe with the underſtanding; We muſt give up our ſelves abſolutely by a Vow and Covenant, to God the Father Son and Holy-Ghoſt, renouncing the fleſh, the World and the Devil; which is the act of a reſolved <hi>Will.</hi> And to <hi>Will,</hi> is rationally to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Chooſe.</hi> By which Chriſt telleth us, that (as words of Knowledge in Scripture uſually imply affection, ſo) the <hi>Faith</hi> that he means and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to our juſtification, is not a meer <hi>aſſent</hi> or act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection; but it is alſo the <hi>wills conſent,</hi> and a <hi>practical Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>: As a man <hi>Believing</hi> the Skill and Fidelity of a <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> doth <hi>Deſire, Will</hi> or <hi>Chooſe him</hi> for his Phyſician, and <hi>Practically Truſt him,</hi> or caſt himſelf upon his Fidelity and care for cure. Therefore Chriſt joyneth both together, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. He that <hi>Believeth</hi> and is <hi>baptized</hi> ſhall be ſaved, not principally intending the waſhing of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience, as <hi>Peter</hi> expoundeth it; that is, [He that ſo believeth as by hearty conſent to devote and give up himſelf openly and abſolutely, and preſently to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, ſhall be ſaved.]</p>
               <p>And ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>There is one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> as part of the uniting bond of Chriſtians: That is <hi>there is one ſolemn Covenant between God and Man, in which we profeſs our Faith, and give up our ſelves to God the Father Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and are ſtated in a gracious Relation to him and one another.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:55434:132"/>And thus it is that Baptiſm is reckoned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. among the principles; And that the ancient Doctors unanimouſly conclude, that Baptiſm waſheth away all ſin, and certainly puts us into a preſent ſtate of life; That is, <hi>The delivering up our ſelves ſincerely to God in the Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi> is the <hi>condition of our right to the benefits of that Covenant from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which it is plain, that the <hi>Head</hi> is but the <hi>guide</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and that God looketh more to the <hi>Heart</hi> than to the <hi>Head,</hi> and to the <hi>Head</hi> for the <hi>Heart:</hi> And that we are not <hi>Chriſtians</hi> indeed, till Chriſt have our <hi>Hearts</hi> indeed; Nor Chriſtians by profeſſion, till by Baptiſmal Covenant and profeſſion we deliver up the <hi>Heart</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi>; Now ſo far as <hi>Conſent</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> may be called <hi>Love,</hi> fo far even <hi>Love</hi> is Eſſential to our Chriſtianity, and to <hi>this faith,</hi> which is required to our <hi>baptiſm</hi> and <hi>juſtification.</hi> And no other faith is Chriſtianity, nor will juſtify us.</p>
               <p>But to them that are here ſtalled with the great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, How <hi>Love</hi> is that grace of the Holy Ghoſt which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to believers, in the Covenant, as conſequent, if it go before it in the Covenanters, I anſwer at preſent, that they muſt diſtinguiſh between, 1. Love to Chriſt as a Saviour of our ſelves, proceeding principally from the juſt Love of our ſelves, and our Salvation; and <hi>Love to God</hi> above our ſelves, for his own Infinite Goodneſs, as our ultimate end: 2. Between the Act of Love, and a Habit; 3. Between that <hi>ſpark</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> which conſiſteth in the ſaid <hi>conſent,</hi> and is contained in true <hi>Faith</hi>; and that <hi>Flame</hi> of Love which it ſelf <hi>carryeth the name,</hi> as being the moſt eminent operation of the Soul. And if hereupon they cannot anſwer this queſtion themſelves, I muſt refer them to the Appendix of the third Chapter of my <hi>Chriſtian Directory,</hi> in which I have largely opened this caſe, with as much exactneſs as I could reach unto.</p>
               <p>All that remaineth very difficult then as to our judging of the Knowledge of men to be admitted to Chriſtian Church
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55434:132"/>
Communion, is but, what <hi>knowledge is neceſſary in the adult unto their lawful Baptiſm?</hi> And to that I ſay, ſo much as is neceſſary to an <hi>underſtanding conſent</hi> to the Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or to an hearty giving up themſelves to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son and Holy-Ghoſt: And here we muſt know that the ſame Covenanting words being comprehenſive, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in different degrees, according to mans different Capacities, even of true believers: Inſomuch that I do not think that any two men in the world, have in all notions and degrees juſt the ſame underſtanding of them. And therefore it is not the ſame diſtinctneſs and clearneſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which we muſt expect in all, which is found in ſome, or which is deſireable. When one man nameth <hi>GOD,</hi> he hath an <hi>orderly conception</hi> of his ſeveral Attributes (in which yet all men are defective, and moſt Divines themſelves are culpably ignorant:) When another man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth but of <hi>fewer of</hi> them, and that diſorderly: And yet theſe muſt not be accounted Atheiſts, or denied to believe in the ſame God, or refuſed Baptiſm, nor is it ſeveral Gods that men ſo differently believe in.</p>
               <p n="1">I. He that knoweth God to be a moſt perfect Spirit, moſt powerful, <hi>Wiſe</hi> and Good, the Father Son and Holy Ghoſt, the Creator of the world, <hi>our Owner, Governour</hi> and moſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable Lover, (Benefactor and End) I think knoweth as much of <hi>God</hi> as is of neceſſity to Baptiſm and Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p n="2">II. He that knoweth [that Jeſus Chriſt is God and man, the Redeemer of the ſinful world, and the Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, who was conceived by the Holy-Ghoſt in the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> fulfilled all righteouſneſs, was crucified as a Sacrifice for mans ſin; and being dead and buried roſe again, and aſcended into Heaven, and is the Teacher, King and Interceſſor of his Church, and hath made the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and giveth the Holy-Ghoſt to ſanctify believers, and pardoneth their ſins, and will raiſe our Bodies at laſt, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55434:133"/>
Judge the World in righteouſneſs according to his Goſpel, and will give everlaſting happineſs to the Sanctified] I think knoweth as much of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as is neceſſary to Baptiſm and Church Communion.</p>
               <p n="3">III. He that knoweth that [the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Father and the Son, the ſanctifier of Souls, by <hi>Holy Life</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> by the Holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of which he is the Inditer and the Seal] I think knoweth all that is neceſſary unto Baptiſm, concerning the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And as to the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Knowing</hi> this Trinity of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, there is great difference between, 1.

It's true that we know not the Heart immediately; and therefore muſt judge by <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Deeds:</hi> But yet it is the Knowledge of the <hi>Things</hi> (as is aforeſaid) that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, becauſe it is the <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>Things,</hi> is chiefly neceſſary. But by what <hi>words</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Knowledge,</hi> is not of equal neceſſity in itſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There being no man whoſe conceptions of God, Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt, the Covenant, &amp;c. are not guilty of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſorder, a great degree of darkneſs and diſorder of conceptions, may conſiſt with true grace in thoſe of the loweſt rank of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſecond <hi>Notions</hi> and Conceptions of things (and ſo of God our Redeemer, and Sanctifier) as they are <hi>verba mentis</hi> in the mind itſelf, are but Logical, Artificial Organs;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55434:133"/>
and are not of that neceſſity to Salvation as the conception of the matter or incomplex objects.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Many a man in his ſtudies findeth that he hath oft a general and true Knowledge of Things in themſelves, before he can put names and notions on them, and ſet thoſe in due Order, and long before he can find fit words to expreſs his mental notions by; which muſt coſt him much ſtudy after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And as Children are long learning to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and by degrees come to ſpeak orderly and compoſedly and aptly (moſtly not till many years uſe hath taught them;) So the expreſſive ability is as much matter of art, and got by <hi>uſe,</hi> in men at age: And they muſt be taught yet as Children to ſpeak of any thing, new and Strange, and which they learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not before. As we ſee in learning Arithmetick, Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and all the Arts and Sciences. Even ſo men, how holy internally ſoever, muſt by <hi>ſtudy and uſe</hi> (by the help of Gods Spirit) learn how to ſpeak of holy things, in <hi>Prayer,</hi> in Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in anſwering ſuch as ask an account of their Faith and Knowledge: And hypocrites that are bred up in <hi>the uſe</hi> of ſuch things, can ſpeak excellently in Prayer, Conference or Preaching: When true Chriſtians at firſt that never uſed them, nor were bred up where they heard them uſed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell you intelligibly what is in their minds, but are like men that are yet to learn the very Language in which they are to talk in, I know this by true experience of my ſelf, and many others, that I have examined.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore, I ſay again, if men cannot aptly anſwer me of the very Eſſentials of Religion, but ſpeak that which in its proper ſenſe is Hereſie, or unſound and falſe: Yet if when I open the queſtions to them my ſelf, and put the Article of Faith into the queſtion, and ask them <hi>(e. g.)</hi> Do you <hi>believe</hi> that there is but One God? or, are there many? Doth God <hi>know</hi> all things, or not? Is he our <hi>Owner,</hi> or not? Doth he rule us by a <hi>Law,</hi> or not, &amp;c? If they by <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay,</hi> do ſpeak the truth, and profeſs to believe it, I will not
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55434:134"/>
reject them for lack of knowledge, if the reſt concur. I meet with few cenſorious Profeſſors (to ſay nothing of Teachers) that will not anſwer me with ſome nonſenſe or falſeneſs, or ineptitude, or groſs confuſion, or defectiveneſs, if I examine them of the foregoing <hi>Notions</hi> of the very baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: As, what is a <hi>Spirit?</hi> what doth the word [God] ſignifie? what is Power in God? what Knowledge? what Will? what Goodneſs? what Holineſs? what is a Perſon in the Trinity? what is the difference between the three Perſons? How is God our End? Had Chriſt his humane Soul from the Virgin, or only his fleſh? Had he his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood from Man, if not his Soul, which is the chief eſſential part? what is the Union of the Divine and Humane Nature? wherein different from the Union of God and Saints, or every Creature? with an hundred ſuch. In which I muſt bear with ignorant falſe anſwers from eminent Profeſſors, that ſeparate from others as too ignorant for their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: And why then muſt I not bear with more in thoſe that are new beginners, and have not had their time and helps?</p>
               <p n="6">6. But if a man can ſpeak never ſo well, and profeſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo confident a belief, if he <hi>Conſent</hi> not to the <hi>Covenant</hi> and Vow of Baptiſm, to give up himſelf preſently and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to Chriſt, I muſt reject that man from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church. But if theſe two things do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in any, 1. The foreſaid ſignification of a tolerable Knowledge and Belief, by yea or nay, (Doſt thou Believe in God, &amp;c. as the Ancient Churches uſed to ask the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized;) 2. And a ready profeſſed conſent to be engaged by that holy Vow and Covenant to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; I will not deny Baptiſm to ſuch, if Adult, nor after Church Communion to them, if they are already in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>And all this is becauſe that the <hi>Will</hi> is the <hi>Man</hi>; and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man truely love Jeſus Chriſt, he is a true Believer in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55434:134"/>
Chriſt; and if any Man <hi>love</hi> God, the ſame Man is known and loved of him, and hath ſo much knowledge as will ſave his Soul. I confeſs in private Catechizing and Conference I have met with ſome ancient Women that have long lived as godly Perſons, in conſtant affectionate uſe of means, and an honeſt godly Life, and been of good repute in the Church where they lived, who yet have ſpoken downright Hereſie to me, through ignorance, in anſwering ſome queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about Jeſus Chriſt: But I durſt not therefore ſuſpend their Communion, nor condemn their former Communion: For as ſoon as I told them better, they have yielded, and I could not perceive whether it was from groſs ignorance, or from unreadineſs of notions, or from the want of memory, or what, that they ſpake amiſs before. So that I ſhall be very loth to reject one from Communion, that ſheweth a <hi>love</hi> of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> by diligent uſe of means, and an upright Life.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And he that will impartially be ruled by the Holy Scriptures, will be of the ſame mind. For no one was ever taken to be a Church Member at Age, without ſo full a <hi>conſent,</hi> as was <hi>willingly</hi> expreſt by devotedneſs to God in the Solemn Covenant: The Jews by the Sign of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Chriſtians by Baptiſm; and both by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with God were initiated: And <hi>conſent</hi> is <hi>love.</hi> But the Articles and objective Degrees of Knowledge and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief have greatly varied. The Jews were to know and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs more than the Gentiles; and the Jews ſince the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Deliverance, more than before; And <hi>John</hi> Baptized upon a ſhorter Profeſſion than the Apoſtles did; And the Apoſtles till Chriſts Reſurrection, believed not many great Articles of our Faith, not knowing that Chriſt muſt die, and be an Expiatory Sacrifice for Sin, and Sin to be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Blood; nor that he was to riſe again, and ſend the Holy Ghoſt for the work which he was ſent for, &amp;c. And <hi>Acts</hi> 19. there were Diſciples that had not heard that there
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55434:135"/>
was a Holy Ghoſt (I confidently think, twice Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.)</p>
               <p>And if we mark how the Apoſtles Baptized, with what <hi>Orders</hi> for it they received from Chriſt, it will confirm my concluſion. For Chriſt could have given a particular Creed, and Profeſſion of Faith, if he had pleaſed; but he taketh up with the General three Articles, of Believing in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. leſt any ſhould caſt out his weak ones for want of diſtinctneſs of Knowledge and Belief. And he maketh the Covenant-conſent in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm the neceſſary Thing, as the End and Meaſure of their Knowledge. He that hath Knowledge enough to cauſe him to thirſt, may come and drink of the waters of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. And he that hungreth and thirſteth after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhall be ſatisfied; and he that cometh to Chriſt he will in no wiſe caſt out.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtles Baptized ſo many thouſands in a ſhort time, that they could not examine each Perſon about a more particular Knowledge and Belief, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. &amp;c. Nor do we read in Scripture of ſuch particular large Profeſſions, as go much beyond the words of Baptiſm. And though, no doubt, they did endeavour to make the ignorant under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what they profeſt and did, and ſo had ſome larger Creed, yet was it not all ſo large, as the ſhort Creed called the Apoſtles now is; ſeveral of its Articles having been long ſince added.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken all this, not only to Miniſters, who have the Keys of Admiſſion, but eſpecially for the Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſakes, who are too much enclined to place godlineſs in <hi>words</hi> and ability to ſpeak well, in Prayer or Conference, or anſwering Queſtions, and that make a more diſtinct Knowledge and Profeſſion neceſſary than God hath made: Yea, if all the Articles of the Creed are profeſſed, when the underſtanding of them is not clear and diſtinct, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride it, and ſay, A Parrot may be taught as much; and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55434:135"/>
they ſeparate from thoſe Paſtors and Churches that receive ſuch to their Communion. Many do this of a godly Zeal, leſt ignorance and formality be encouraged, and the godly and ungodly not ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed: But their Zeal is not according to Knowledge, nor to the holy Rule; and they little know how much Pride oft lurketh unobſerved, in ſuch deſires to be publickly differenced from others, as below us, and unmeet for our Communion: And leſs know they how much they injure and diſpleaſe our gracious Lord, who took little Children in his Arms, and deſpiſeth not the weak, and carrieth the Lambs, and refuſeth no one any further than they refuſe him.</p>
               <p>I tell you, if you ſee but true <hi>love</hi> and <hi>willingneſs</hi> in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, reformed, pious and righteous Life, <hi>there is,</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is, ſaving Knowledge and Faith within; and if words do not ſatisfactorily expreſs it, you are to think that it is not for want of the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf, but for want of <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>exerciſe,</hi> and for want of well ſtudied Notions, or for want of natural Parts, Education or Art to enable them to act that part aright. But if God know the meaning of <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> and of the <hi>groans</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in his Beloved In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, I will not be one that ſhall condemn and reject a lover of God and Chriſt, and Holineſs, for want of diſtinct par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Knowledge, or of words to utter it aright.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> The fourth Inference: The aptneſs of the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, to ingenerate the Love of God and Holineſs.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF <hi>Love</hi> be the <hi>End</hi> and Perfection of our <hi>Knowledge,</hi> then hence we may perceive, that no Teacher that ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the World, was ſo fit for the ingenerating of true ſaving knowledge as Jeſus Chriſt. For none ever ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the love of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was he only that rendered God apparently <hi>lovely</hi> to ſinful man, by reconciling us to God, and rendering him
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:55434:136"/>
apparently propitious to his Enemies, pardoning ſin, and tendering Salvation freely to them that were the Sons of Death. Self-love will not give men leave to love aright a God that will damn them, though deſervedly for ſin. But it is Chriſt that hath made Atonement, and is the Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſins, and proclaimeth Gods love, even to the Rebellious: Which is more effectually to kindle holy love in us, than all the Precepts of Naturaliſts without this could ever have been. His Croſs, and his Wounds and Blood were the powerful Sermons, to Preach Gods winning love to ſinners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the benefits are ſo <hi>many</hi> and ſo <hi>great</hi> which he hath purchaſed and revealed to man, that they are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant fewel for the Flames of Love. We are ſet by Chriſt in the way of Mercy, in the Houſhold of God, under the Eye and ſpecial Influence of his love; all our ſins pardoned, our Everlaſting puniſhment remitted, our Souls renewed, our wounded Conſciences healed, our Enemies conquered, our fears removed, our wants ſupplied, our Bodies, and all that is ours under the protection of Almighty love; and we are ſecured by Promiſe, that all our Sufferings ſhall work together for our good. And what will cauſe <hi>love</hi> if all this will not? When we perceive with what love the Father hath loved us, that of Enemies we ſhould be made the Sons of God, and of condemned Sinners we ſhould be made the Heirs of endleſs Glory, and this ſo freely, and by ſo ſtrange a means, we may conclude that this is the Doctrine of Love, which is taught us from Heaven by <hi>love</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And eſpecially this work of love is promoted, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the Kingdom of Heaven to the foreſight of our Faith; and ſhewing us what we ſhall enjoy for ever; and aſſuring us of the Fruition of our Creators Everlaſting Love; yea, by making us fore-know that Heaven conſiſteth in perfect mutual endleſs love. This will both of it ſelf, draw up our Hearts, and engage all our Reaſon and Endeavours, in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55434:136"/>
beginning that work which we muſt do for ever, and to learn on Earth to love in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And beſides all theſe objective helps, Chriſt giveth to Believers the Spirit of Love, and maketh it become as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in us; which no other Teacher in the World could do. Others can ſpeak reaſon to our Ears, but it is Chriſt that ſendeth the warming Beams of holy Love into our Hearts.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>love of God</hi> and holineſs were no better than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Philoſophical Speculations, then <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> or ſuch other Maſters of names and notions, might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and <hi>Athens</hi> with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church; and the Schoolmen might be thought the beſt Improvers of Theology. But if thouſands of dreaming Diſputers wrangle the World into miſery, and themſelves into Hell, and are ingenious Artificers of their own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if the love of God and Goodneſs, be the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſtitution of the Soul, its natural content and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the buſineſs and end of life, and all its helps and bleſſings, the Soder of juſt Societies, the Union of Man with God in Chriſt, and with all the Bleſſed; and the Fore-taſte and Firſt-fruits of endleſs Glory; then Chriſt the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Love, the Teacher of Love, the Giver of Love, the Lord and Commander of Love, is the beſt Promoter of Knowledge in the World. And as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> knew that he was a Teacher come from God, becauſe no man could do ſuch works unleſs God were with him; ſo may we conclude the ſame, becauſe no man could ſo reveal, ſo cauſe, and communicate Love, the holy Love of God and Goodneſs, unleſs the God of Love had ſent him. Love is the very end and work of Chriſt, and of his Word and Spirit.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> The fifth Inference: What great cauſe men have to be thankful to God for the Conſtitution of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And how unexcuſable they are that will not learn ſo ſhort and ſweet, and ſafe a Leſſon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SO excellent and every way ſuitable to our caſe is the Religion taught and inſtituted by Chriſt, as ſhould render it very acceptable to Mankind. And that on ſeveral accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The brevity and plainneſs of Chriſtian Precepts, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodateth the neceſſity of Mankind. I ſay his <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi> leſt you think it is but his <hi>ſloth. Ars longa, Vita bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> is the true and ſad complaint of Students. Had our Salvation been laid upon our Learning a Body of true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, how deſperate would our caſe have been? For, 1. Mans great Intellectual weakneſs; 2. His want of leiſure would not have allowed him a knowledge that requireth a ſubtile wit and tedious ſtudies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Moſt men have wits of the duller ſort: Such quickneſs, ſubtilty and ſolidity, as is neceſſary to great and difficult ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, are very rare. So rare, as that few ſuch are found even amongſt the Preachers of the Goſpel: Of a multitude who by hard Studies and honeſt Hearts, are fit to Preach the Doctrine of Salvation, ſcarce one or two are found of ſo fine and exact a wit as to be fit judiciouſly to manage the curious Controverſies of the Schools. What a caſe then had Mankind been in, if none could have been wiſe and happy indeed, but theſe few of extraordinary capacity? The moſt publick and common good is the beſt. God is more merciful than to confine Salvation to ſubtilty of wit: Nor indeed is it a thing it ſelf ſo pleaſing to him as a Holy, Heavenly Heart and Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And we have Bodies that muſt have Proviſion and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: We have Families and Kindred that muſt be
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55434:137"/>
maintained: We live in Neighbourhoods and publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, which call for much Duty, and take up much time. And our ſufferings and croſſes will take up ſome thoughts. Were it but <hi>Poverty</hi> alone, how much of our time will it alienate from contemplation? whilſt great neceſſities call for great care and continual labour? Can our common poor Labourers, (eſpecially Husbandmen) have leiſure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their minds with Philoſophy or curious Speculations?</p>
               <p>Nay, we ſee by experience, that the more <hi>ſubtile</hi> and moſt <hi>vacant</hi> wits, that wholly addict themſelves to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy can bring it to no conſiderable certainty, and conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to this day, except in the few Rudiments or common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that all are agreed in. Inſomuch that thoſe do now take themſelves to be the chief or only wits, who are pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down that which through ſo many Ages, from the beginning of the World, hath with ſo great wit and ſtudy been concluded on before them; and are now themſelves no higher than new Experimenters, who are beginning all anew again, to try whether they can retrieve the errours of Mankind, and make any thing of that which they think the World hath been ſo long unacquainted with: And they are yet but beginning at the Skin or Superficies of the World, and are got no further with all their wit, than <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> with Figure, Site, Contexture, &amp;c. But if they could live as long as <hi>Methuſalem,</hi> it is hoped they might come to know that beſides <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion;</hi> there are Eſſential <hi>Virtues</hi> called <hi>ſubſtantial Forms,</hi> or <hi>active Natures,</hi> and that there is a <hi>Vis Motiva,</hi> which is the cauſe of Motion, and a <hi>Virtus Intellectiva,</hi> and Wiſdom which is the cauſe of the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Motion,</hi> and a <hi>Vital Will and Love</hi> which is the perfection and end of all: In a word, they may live to know that there is ſuch a thing in the World as <hi>Life,</hi> and ſuch a thing as Active Nature, and ſuch a thing as <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> beſides Corporeal Matter and Motion, and conſequently that man is indeed man.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55434:138"/>
But, alas, they muſt die ſooner, perhaps before they attain ſo far, and their Succeſſors muſt begin all anew again, as if none of all theſe great attempts had been made by their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, and ſo (by their method) we ſhall never reach deeper than the Skin, nor learn more than our, <hi>A B C</hi> And would we have ſuch a task made neceſſary to the Common Salvation, even for all the Poor and Vulgar, wits, which is ſo much too hard for our moſt ſubtile Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents?</p>
               <p n="2">2. And Chriſtianity is as ſuitable to us, in the <hi>Benefit</hi> and <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of it. What a happy Religion is it that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth men in nothing but receiving good to themſelves, and in <hi>doing</hi> good to themſelves and others. Whoſe work is only the <hi>Receiving</hi> and <hi>Improving</hi> of Gods <hi>Mercies,</hi> and <hi>Loving</hi> and <hi>Delighting</hi> in all that is good, rejoycing in the taſts of Gods Love on Earth, and in the Hopes of perfect Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, Love and Joy for ever. Is not this a ſweeter life, than tireſom, unprofitable Speculations.</p>
               <p>O then how unexcuſeable are our contemners of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that live in wilful Ignorance and ungodlineſs, and think this eaſy and ſweet Religion, to be a tedious and intolerable thing! What impudent Calumniators and Blaſphemers are they of Chriſt and Holineſs, who deride and revile this ſweet and eaſy way to life, as if it were a ſlavery and an irkſom toil, unneceſſary to our Salvation, and unfit for a freeman, or at leaſt a Gentleman, (or a Servant of the fleſh and world) to practiſe. If Chriſt had ſet you but ſuch a task as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> did to their diſciples; ſo many noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo many <hi>Curioſities</hi> to learn; If he had written for you as many Books as <hi>Chryſippus</hi> did; If he had made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to your Salvation, all the arbitrary notions of <hi>Lullius,</hi> &amp; all the Fanatick conceits of <hi>Campanella,</hi> and all the dreaming <hi>Hypotheſes of Carteſius,</hi> and all the Aſtronomical &amp; Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical difficulties of <hi>Ptolomy, Tycho-Brache, Copernicus</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilaeus,</hi> and all the Chronological difficulties handled by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55434:138"/>
Scaliger, Functius, Capellus, Petavius,</hi> &amp;c. And all the curioſities in Philoſophy and Theology of <hi>Cajetane, Scotus, Ockam, Gabriel,</hi> &amp;c. Then you might have had ſome excuſe for your averſation: But to accuſe and refuſe, and reproach ſo Compendious, ſo Eaſie, ſo Sweet, ſo Neceſſary a Doctrine and Religion, as that which is brought and taught by Chriſt, this is an ingratitude that hath no excuſe, unleſs Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Malignant enmity may paſs for an excuſe.</p>
               <p>Doth Chriſt deliver you from the maze of Imaginary Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities, and from the burdens of worldly wiſdom called Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and of Phariſaical Traditions, and Jewiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and make you a light burden, an eaſy Yoak, and Commandments that are not grievous, and after all this, muſt he be requited with Rejection and Reproach, and your Burdens and Snares be taken for more tolerable than your deliverance? You make a double forfeiture of Salvation, who are ſo unwilling to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Be thankful, O Chriſtians, to your heavenly Maſter, for tracing you out ſo plain and ſweet a way. Be thankful that he hath cut ſhort thoſe tireſom ſtudies, by which your task-maſters would confound you, under pretence of making you like Gods, in ſome more ſubtile and ſublime Speculations than Vulgar wits can reach. Now <hi>all</hi> that are willing may be Religious, and be ſaved: It is not confined to men of learning. The way is ſo ſweet, as ſheweth it ſuitable to the end. It is but [<hi>Believe Gods Love</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> of <hi>Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt, till you are filled with Love and its delights, and live in the pleaſures</hi> of <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and in the <hi>Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hopes of endleſs Glory</hi>:] And is not this an eaſy Yoak!

               <p>AS the ancient Gnoſticks, being puffed up with their corrupt Platonick Speculations, lookt down with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon ordinary Chriſtians, as ſilly ignorants in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of them, and yet had not wiſdom enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from the Luſts and Pollutions of the world; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo is it with abundance of the worldly Clergy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Scholars in this age. They think their Learning ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them many degrees above the Vulgar, and giveth them right to be Reverenced as the Oracles or Rabbies of the World; When yet (poor Souls!) They have not learned (by all their Reading, Studies and Diſputings) to Love God and Holineſs, better than the Riches and Preferments of the World. And ſome of them not better than a Cup of ſtrong

drink, or than the brutiſh pleaſures of Senſe and Fleſh. It is a pitiful thing to ſee the Pulpit made a Stage for the oſtentation of this ſelf-ſhaming, ſelf-condemning Pride and Folly: For a man under pretence of ſerving God, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other men to Heaven, to make it his errand to tell the hearers, that he is a very Wiſe and Learned man; who hath not wit enough to chooſe a holy, humble life, nor to make ſure of Heaven or to ſave his Soul; nor perhaps to keep out of the Tavern, or Ale-houſe the next week, nor the ſame day to forbear the venting of his worldly, carnal mind. What is ſuch Learning, but a Game of Imagination, in which the Phantaſie ſports it ſelf with names and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or worſe, the materials which are uſed in the ſervice of ſin, the fuel of pride, the blinder and deceiver of ſuch as were too ignorant before, being a meer ſhadow and name of Knowledge? What good will it do a man tormented with the Gout, or Stone, or by miſerable poverty, to know the names of various herbs, or to read the titles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries boxes, or to read on a ſign-poſt, <hi>Here is a good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary?</hi> And what good will it do a carnal, unſanctified Soul, that muſt be in Hell for ever, to know the Hebrew roots or points, or to diſcourſe of <hi>Carteſius</hi> his <hi>materia ſubtilis</hi> &amp; <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli aetherei,</hi> &amp;c.

Will it comfort a man that is caſt out of Gods preſence, and condemned to utter darkneſs, to remember, that he was once a good Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, or Logician, or Muſician, or that he had wit to get riches and preferments in the world, and to climb up to the heighth of honour and dominion? It is a pitiful thing to hear, a man boaſt of his wit, while he is madly rejecting the only felicity, forſaking God, eſteeming vanity, and damning his Soul!

                  <p> The ſeventh Inference: Why the ungodly world hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Holineſs, and not Learning.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FRom my very Child-hood, when I was firſt ſenſible of the concernments of mens Souls, I was poſſeſt with ſome admiration, to find that every where the Religious, godly ſort of people, who did but exerciſe a ſerious care of their own and other mens Salvation, were made the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and obloquy of the world; Eſpecially of the moſt viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and flagitious men, ſo that they that profeſſed the ſame Articles of faith, the ſame Commandments of God to be their Law, and the ſame Petitions of the Lords Prayer to be their deſire, and ſo profeſſed the ſame Religion, did every where revile thoſe that did endeavour to live according to that ſame profeſſion, and to ſeem to be in good ſadneſs in what they ſaid. I thought that this was impudent Hypocriſie in the ungodly, worldly ſort of men! To take them for the moſt intolerable perſons in the Land, who are but <hi>ſerious</hi> in their own Religion, and do but endeavour to perform, what all their Enemies alſo vow'd and promiſed. If religion be bad, and our faith be not true, why do theſe men profeſs it? If it be true and good, why do they hate and revile them that would live in the ſerious practice of it, if they will not practiſe it themſelves? But we muſt not expect Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when ſin and ſenſuality have made men unreaſonable.</p>
               <p>But I muſt profeſs that ſince I obſerved the courſe of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55434:140"/>
world, and the concord of the Word and Providences of God, I took it for a notable proof of mans fall, and of the verity of the Scripture, and the ſupernatural Original of true Sanctification, to find ſuch an univerſal enmity between the <hi>holy</hi> and the ſerpentine ſeed, and to find <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abels</hi> caſe ſo ordinarily exemplified, and him that is born after the Fleſh to perſecute him that is born after the Spirit. And methinks to this day it is a great and viſible help for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>But that which is much Remarkable in it is, that nothing elſe in the world (except the Croſſing of mens carnal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt) doth meet with any ſuch univerſal enmity. A man may be as learned as he can, and no man hate him for it. If he excel all others, all men will praiſe him and proclaim his excellency: He may be an excellent Linguiſt, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Philoſopher, an excellent Phyſician, an excellent Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, an excellent Orator, and all commend him. Among Muſicians, Architects, Souldiers, Seamen, and all Arts and Sciences, men value, prefer and praiſe the beſt; Yea even Speculative Theology, ſuch wits as the Schoolmen and thoſe that are called great Divines, are honoured by all, and meet, (as ſuch) with little Enmity, Perſecution or Obloquy in the world. Though I know that even a <hi>Galilaeus,</hi> a <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella,</hi> and many ſuch have ſuffered by the Roman Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that was not ſo much in enmity to their Speculations or Opinions, as through a fear leſt new Philoſophical noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould unſettle mens minds, and open the way to new opinions in Theology, and ſo prove injurious to the Kingdom and Intereſt of <hi>Rome.</hi> I know alſo that <hi>Demoſthenes, Cicero, Seneca, Lucan,</hi> and many other learned men, have died by the hands or power of Tyrants. But that was not for their Learning, but for their oppoſition to thoſe Tyrants Wills and Intereſts. And I know that ſome Religious men have ſuffered for their Sins and Follies, and ſome for their medling too much with ſecular affairs, as the Councellours
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55434:141"/>
of Princes, as <hi>Functius, Juſtus Jonas,</hi> and many others. But yet no Parts, no Excellency, no Skill or Learning is hated commonly, but honoured in the World, no not Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Learning, ſave only this practical Godlineſs and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Principles of it, which only rendereth men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable to God (through Chriſt) and ſaveth mens Souls. To know and love God, and live as thoſe that know and love him, to ſeek firſt his Kingdom and the Righteouſneſs thereof, to walk circumſpectly, in a holy and heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and ſtudiouſly to obey the Laws of God, this which muſt ſave us, this which God loveth and the Devil hateth, is hated alſo by all his Children; for the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity hath the ſame effect.</p>
               <p>But methinks this ſhould teach all conſidering men to perceive what Knowledge it is that is beſt, and moſt deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all that love their happineſs. Sure this ſort of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Wit and Art, which the Devil and the malignant World do no more diſpraiſe, oppoſe and perſecute, (though as it is ſanctified to higher ends it be good, yet) of it ſelf is comparatively no very excellent and amiable thing. I know Satan laboureth to keep out Learning it ſelf (that is truly ſuch) from the world, becauſe he is the Prince and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of darkneſs, and the Enemy of all uſeful light: And lower Knowledge is ſome help to higher, and ſpeculative Theology may prepare for practical; and the moſt groſs and brutiſh ignorance beſt ſerveth the Devils deſigns and turn. And even in Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> the Arts prepared men for the Goſpel; and Learning in the Church Reformers hath ever been a great help and furtherance of Reformation. But yet if you ſtop in Learning and Speculation, and take it as for it ſelf alone, and not as a means to holineſs of Heart and Life, it is as nothing. It is <hi>Paul</hi>'s expreſs reſolution of the caſe, that if <hi>we have all Knowledge without</hi> this holy <hi>Love,</hi> we are <hi>nothing,</hi> but as <hi>ſounding Braſs</hi> or a <hi>tinkling Cymbal,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:55434:141"/>But ſurely there is ſome ſpecial excellency in this holy <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> which the Devil and the malignant World ſo hate, in high and low, in rich and poor, in Kindred, Neighbours, Strangers, or any, where they meet with it. It is not for nothing. This is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God; this is it that is contrary to their carnal Minds, and to their fleſhly Luſts, and ſinful Pleaſures. This tells them what they muſt be and do (or be undone for ever) which they cannot abide to be or do.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore be ſomewhat the wiſer for this diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the mind of the Devil and all his Inſtruments: I will love and honour all Natural, Artificial, acquired Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in Philology, Philoſophy, and the reſt: As theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not men to the Worlds Obloquy, ſo neither unto mine or any ſober mans. In their low places they are good, and may be uſed to a greater good. But let that <hi>holy knowledge and love</hi> be mine, which God moſt loveth, and the World moſt hateth, and coſteth us deareſt upon Earth, but hath the bleſſed end of a Heavenly Reward.</p>

                  <p> The eighth Inference: What is the work of a faithful Preacher, and how it is to be done.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF that Knowledge which kindleth in us the Love of God, be the only ſaving Knowledge, then this is it that Miniſters muſt principally preach up and promote. Could we make all our hearers never ſo learned, that will not ſave their Souls: But if we could make them holy, and kindle in them the love of God and goodneſs, they ſhould certainly be ſaved. The holy practical Preacher therefore is the beſt Preacher, becauſe the holy practical Chriſtian is the beſt and only true Chriſtian. We work under Chriſt, and therefore muſt carry on the ſame work on Souls which Chriſt came into the World to carry on. All our Sermons muſt be fitted to change mens Hearts, from Carnal into
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55434:142"/>
Spiritual, and to kindle in them the love of God. When this is well done, they have learnt what we were ſent to teach them; and when this is perfect, they are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Preachers that are Enemies to the godlieſt of the people, and would make their Hearers take them all for Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, that go any further than obedience to their Paſtors, in Church-forms and Orders, Obſervances and Ceremonies, and a civil Life, are the great Enemies of Chriſt, his Spirit, his Goſpel and the Peoples Souls; and the Eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Devil, in his malignant War againſt them all. All that Knowledge, and all thoſe Formalities, which are ſet up inſtead of divine Love and holy Living, are but ſo many cheats, to deceive poor Souls till time be paſt, and their convictions come to late.</p>
               <p>I confeſs that <hi>ignorance</hi> is the calamity of our times, and people periſh for lack of Knowledge: And that the Heart be without Knowledge it is not good: And lamentable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is too viſible in a great degree, among the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſort themſelves; as their manifold differences and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours too openly proclaim: And therefore to Build up men in Knowledge, is much of the Miniſterial work. But what <hi>Knowledge</hi> muſt it be? Not dead Opinions, or uneffectual Notions, or ſuch Knowledge as tendeth but to teach men to talk, and make them paſs for men of parts: But it is the Knowledge of God and our Redeemer, the Knowledge of Chriſt Crucified, by which we Crucifie the Fleſh with all its Affections and Luſts: And by which the World is Crucified to us, and we to it. If the Goſpel be hid it is hid to them that are loſt in whom the God of this World hath blinded their Eyes; when there is no truth and mercy, and knowledge of God in the Land, no wonder if ſuch a Land be clad in mourning. When men have not ſo much Knowledge of the evil of ſin, and their own ſin and miſery, and of the need and worth of Chriſt, of the truth of Gods
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55434:142"/>
Word, of the vanity of the World, of the greatneſs, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs of God, and of certain, moſt deſirable Glory of Heaven, as ſhall humble their Souls, and turn them from the World to God, and abſolutely deliver them up to Chriſt, and mortifie fleſhly Luſts, and overcome temptations, and renew them unto the Love of God and goodneſs, and ſet their Hearts and Hopes on Heaven. This is the ignorance that is mens damnation: And the contrary effectual Knowledge is it which ſaveth Souls.</p>

                  <p> The ninth Inference: Thoſe that Know God ſo far as to Love him above all, may have comfort notwithſtanding their remaining ignorance.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Great number of upright hearted Chriſtians, who Love God ſincerely, and obey him faithfully, are yet under ſo great want of further knowledge, as is indeed a great diſhonour to them, and a hinderance of them in their duty and comfort, and to many a great diſcouragement: And O that we knew how to cure this imperfection, that Ignorance might not feed ſo many Errours, and cauſe ſo many fractions and diſturbances in the Church, and ſo many ſinful miſcarriages in its members!</p>
               <p>But yet we muſt conclude that the perſon that hath knowledge enough to renew his Soul to the Love of God, ſhall be loved by him, and ſhall never periſh, and therefore may have juſt comfort under all the imperfections of his knowledge. More wiſdom might make him a better and more uſeful Chriſtian: But while he is a Chriſtian indeed, he may rejoyce in God. I blame not ſuch for complaining of the dulneſs of their Underſtandings, the badneſs of their Memories, their little profiting by the means of Grace: I ſhould blame them if they did <hi>not</hi> complain of theſe: And I think their caſe far more dangerous to the Church and to themſelves, who have as much ignorance and know it not,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:55434:143"/>
but proudly glory in the wiſdom which they have not. But many a thouſand Chriſtians, that have little of the Notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Organical part of Knowledge, have powerful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the Power, Wiſdom and Love of God, and of the great Mercy of Redemption, and of the Evil of Sin, the Worth of Holineſs, and the Certainty and Weight of the Heavenly Glory: And by how much theſe men love God and Holineſs more than the more Learned that have leſs Grace; by ſo much they are more beloved of God, and accounted <hi>wiſer</hi> by the God of wiſdom; and therefore may rejoice in the greatneſs of their felicity. I would have none ſo weak as to under-value any real uſeful Learning: But if Phariſees will cry out againſt unlearned, godly Chriſtians, [Theſe people know not the Law and are accurſed;] Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Thankſgiving of your Lord, I thank thee, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them to Babes. And as the (reputed) fooliſhneſs of God (that is, of Gods Evangelical Myſteries) will ſhortly prove wiſer, than all the reputed wiſdom of men; ſo he that hath wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom enough to love God and be ſaved, ſhall quickly be in that World of light, where he ſhall know more than all the Doctors and ſubtile diſputers upon Earth, and more (in a moment) than all the Books of men can teach him, or all their Authors did ever (here) know. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches. But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, which exerciſe loving kindneſs and righteouſneſs in the Earth: For in theſe things do I delight, ſaith the Lord.</hi>

               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>IF ſo much knowledge will ſave a man as helpeth him to love God as God, may not Heathens or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels at leaſt be ſaved? For they know that there is one God who is Infinitely Good and Perfect, and more amiable than all the World, and the great Benefactor of man, and of the whole Creation: So that there is no goodneſs but what is</hi> in <hi>him, or</hi> from <hi>him, and</hi> through <hi>him, and finally</hi> to <hi>him: And mans will is made to love apprehended good, and followeth the laſt practical act of the Intellect, at leaſt where there is no Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but</hi> omnimoda ratio boni. <hi>And all men know that God is not only Beſt in himſelf, but Good, yea Beſt to them, becauſe that all they have is from him: And they have daily Experience of pardoning Grace contrary to their Commerit.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. To cauſe a man to Love God as God, there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary both <hi>Objective Revelation</hi> of God's Amiableneſs, and ſuch <hi>Subjective Grace</hi> which conſiſteth in a right Diſpoſition of the Soul. 2. <hi>Objective Revelation</hi> is conſidered as <hi>ſufficient</hi> either to <hi>well diſpoſed,</hi> or to an ill diſpoſed Soul. 3. This Right diſpoſition conſiſteth both in the abatement of mens Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to contrary (ſenſual) objects, and in the inclining them to that which is Divine and Spiritual. And now I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It cannot be denied but that ſo much of God's Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs or Goodneſs is revealed to Infidels that have not the Goſpel, by the means mentioned in the Objection, as is ſufficient to bring men under an <hi>obligation</hi> to love God as God, and to leave them unexcuſable that do not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore to ſuch the Impoſſibility is not Phyſical, but Moral.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And there is in that objective Revelation, ſo much ſufficiency, as that if the Soul it ſelf were ſanctified and well diſpoſed, it might love God upon ſuch revelation. (Which <hi>Amyraldus</hi> hath largely proved.)</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:55434:144"/>4. But to an unholy and undiſpoſed Soul no objective Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation is ſufficient without the Spirits help and operations.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <note place="margin">Of all this I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my Cath. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, and the applyed Epitome.</note>5. Only the Spirit of Chriſt the Mediator, as given by and from him, doth thus operate on Souls, as ſavingly to renew them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether ever the Spirit of Chriſt doth thus operate on any that hear not of Chriſts Incarnation, muſt be known either by the <hi>Scripture</hi> or by <hi>experience.</hi> By the Scripture I am not able to prove the <hi>Univerſal Negative,</hi> though it's eaſy to prove ſanctification incomparably more common in the Church, than on thoſe without, if any there have it. The caſe of <hi>Infants,</hi> and of the Churches, and the World before Chriſts Incarnation, muſt here come into conſideration. 2. And by <hi>experience</hi> no man can prove the Negative; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man hath experience what is in the Hearts of all the perſons in the World.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>May a Papiſt or an Heretick by his knowledge be a lover of God as God</hi>?</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> What is ſaid to the former queſtion is here to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed. And further, 1.

There is a ſufficiency in the Doctrine of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which they hold, to ſave them, as to <hi>Objective</hi> Sufficiency. And that God giveth not <hi>ſubjective</hi> Grace (of Sanctification) to any ſuch, notwithſtanding their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, is a thing that no man can prove, nor any ſober charitable Chriſtian eaſily believe: And experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the piety of many maketh it utterly improbable, though we know not certainly the Heart of another.</p>

And that Chriſt came not to bring the World that never hear of him nor can do, into a worſe condition than <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were in before: nor hath he repealed that Law of Grace which he before made them; nor hath God changed that Gracious Name which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed even to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. And I am ſure that <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful conjectured once, even when God told him that <hi>Sodom</hi> was ripe for deſtruction, that yet there might be fifty Righteous perſons in it; By which we may conjecture what he thought of all the World<note n="*" place="margin">Read, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And they that have ſinned under the Law (of <hi>Moſes</hi>) ſhall be judged by it; And they that ſinned without that Law ſhall be judged without it. And I know that God is LOVE it ſelf and Infinitely Good; and will ſhew us his goodneſs in ſuch Glorious Effects to all eternity as ſhall ſatisfy us and fill us with Joyful praiſe: And as for the Papiſts, I know that they are ſeduced by a worldly Clergy, and that by conſequence many of the Errours in that Church do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Fundamentals; And ſo do <hi>many Errors</hi> of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians</hi> and others among us that are taken for religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; yea and <hi>as notoriouſly</hi> as any Doctrines of the Popiſh Councils do: But I know that as a <hi>Logical Faith</hi> or <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxneſs,</hi> which conſiſteth in holding right <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> deceiveth thouſands that have no ſound belief of the <hi>things</hi> themſelves expreſſed by theſe words; So alſo Logical errors about <hi>Words, Notions</hi> and <hi>Sentences,</hi> may in unskilful men conſiſt with a <hi>Sound Belief</hi> of the <hi>Things</hi> which muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be believed.

I have already ſhewed how pitiful a thing it is, that ſo many Academical Wits, and ſo many Preachers, (to ſay nothing of the groſly proud, tyrannical and worldly Clergy) do ſpend ſo many years in ſtudies, that are uſed but in the ſervice of the fleſh, to their own condemnation, and never bend their minds to kindle in themſelves the Love of God,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55434:147"/>
nor a heavenly Deſire or Hope, nor to live in the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table proſpect of Glory: How many preach up that Love and Holineſs, (as the Trade that they muſt live by) which they never fervently preached to themſelves, nor practiſed ſincerely one hour in their lives! How many uſe to preach Funeral Sermons, and bury the dead, that are unprepared for death themſelves, and hardened in their ſecurity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy ſtate, by thoſe ſights, thoſe ſtudies, thoſe words which ſhould awaken and convince them, and which they plead themſelves for the conviction of their hearers! O miſerable Scholars! Miſerable Preachers! Miſerable Doctors and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, who ſtudy and preach to their own condemnation, and have not knowledge enough to teach them to Love God, nor to ſet more by the heavenly Glory, than this World; but by ſpiritual words do both hide and cheriſh a fleſhly and a worldly mind!

               <p n="1">1. Unholy Knowledge is but a carkaſs, a ſhadow, the activity of a vain mind, or a means without the end, and unfit to attain it. A Map is not a Kingdom, nor doth it much enrich the owner. The names of meats and drinks will not nouriſh you: And to know <hi>names</hi> and <hi>notions</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth you no title to the things ſo named.

To know that you ſhould love, and ſeek God moſt, and not to do it, is wilfully to deſpiſe him in the open light. As the privation of God's Love is the chief part of Hell; ſo the privation of our Love to God is the chief part of ungodlineſs or ſin; yea and much of Hell it ſelf. Knowledge puffeth up, but Charity edifieth. Unholy Knowledge is a powerful Inſtrument of Satan's ſervice; in the ſervice of Pride, and Ambition, and Hereſie; one Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and witty ungodly man, will merit more of the Devil by miſchieving Mankind, than many of the common unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſort: And none are ſo like impenitently to glory in this ſin: They will be proud of ſuch adorned Fetters; that they can ſin Philoſophically, and Metaphyſically, in Greek and Hebrew, and with Logical ſubtilty, or Oratorical fluency, prove againſt unlearned men, that they do well in damning their own Souls, and that God and Heaven are not worthy of their chiefeſt love and diligence; ſuch men will offend God more <hi>judiciouſly</hi> than the ignorant, and will more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly and honourably fool away their hopes of Heaven, and more ſucceſsfully deceive the ſimple: Their Wiſdom, like <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s, will ſerve turn to bring them to deſtroy themſelves: And is it any wonder if this be fooliſhneſs with God? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19.</p>
               <p>The underſtanding of a man is a faculty unfit to be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and proſtituted to the ſlavery of the Fleſh.

When they that <hi>knew God, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified him not as God, but became vain in their imagination, their fooliſh heart was darkened, and profeſſing themſelves wiſe</hi> (<hi>Philoſophers</hi> or Gnoſticks) <hi>they became fools,</hi> Rom. 1.21, 28. <hi>And as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them up to vile affections.</hi> And yet many are proud of this mortal Tympanite, as if it were a ſound and healthful

Conſtitution! And think they have the ſureſt right to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for neglecting it knowingly, and going learnedly in the way to Hell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You loſe the chiefeſt delight of knowledge: O that you knew what holy quietneſs and peace, what ſolid plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that knowledge bringeth, which kindleth and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth holy love, and leadeth the Soul to Communion with God; and how much ſweeter it is to have a powerful and experimental knowledge, than your trifling dreams?

O try a more ſerious practical Religion, and I dare aſſure you, it will afford you a more ſolid kind of nouriſhment and delight. The pleaſure of the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Divine in knowing, is but like the pleaſure of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician or other Speculator of Nature; yea below that of the Moral Philoſopher: It is but like my pleaſure in reading a Book of Travels or Geography; in compariſon of the true practical Chriſtians, which is like their pleaſure that live in thoſe Countreys, and poſſeſs the Lands and Houſes which I read of.</p>

Nay, (yet worſe) this <hi>unholy knowledge</hi> doth often make men the Devils moſt powerful and miſchievous Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For though Chriſt oft alſo ſo over-rule the Hearts of Men, and the Courſe of the World, as to make the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and gifts of bad Men ſerviceable to his Church (as wicked Souldiers oft fight in a good Cauſe, and ſave the lives of better men) yet a worldly mind is likeſt to follow the way of worldly intereſt; and it is but ſeldom that worldly intereſt doth ſuite with, and ſerve the intereſt of <hi>truth and holineſs,</hi> but more commonly is its greateſt adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: Therefore moſt uſually it muſt be expected that ſuch worldly men ſhould be adverſaries to the ſame truth and holineſs which their worldly intereſt is adverſe to. And
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55434:149"/>
hence hath ariſen that Proud and Worldly, and Tyrannical Clergy, which hath ſet up and maintained the <hi>Roman</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, under the Name of the Holy Catholick Church; and which hath by their Pope and pretended General Councils uſurped a Legiſlative and Executive Power over the whole Chriſtian World, and made great numbers of Laws with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority, and contrary to the Laws of Chriſt; multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Schiſms on pretence of ſuppreſſing them, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many things neceſſary to the Concord of Chriſtians, as hath made ſuch Concord become impoſſible; preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly voting other men to be Hereticks, while their own Errours are of as odious a kind, yea, when holy Truth is ſometime branded by them as Hereſie. And when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carry the Judgments, Conſciences and Wills of all men along in obedience to their Tyrannical Pride and Luſt, and Intereſt, they ſtir up Princes and States to ſerve them by the Sword, and Murder, and Perſecute their own Subjects, and raiſe bloody Wars againſt their Neighbours, to force them to obey theſe proud Seducers: Yea, and if Kings and States be wiſer than thus to be made their Hangmen or bloody Executioners (to the ruine of their beſt Subjects, and their own Everlaſting Infamy and Damnation) they ſtir up the fooliſh part of the Subjects againſt ſuch Rulers, and in a word, they will give the World no peace: So that I am paſt all doubt that the Ten Heathen Perſecutions ſo much cryed out of, was but a ſmall matter as againſt the Chriſtians Blood, in compariſon of what hath been done by this Tyrannical Clergy: And the crueleſt Magiſtrates ſtill ſeem to come ſhort of them in cruelty, and ſeldom are very bloody or perſecuting, but when a worldly or proud Clergy ſtirs them up to it. And all the Hereſies that ever ſprang up in the Church, do ſeem to have done leſs harm on one ſide, than by pretences of Unity, Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they have done on the other. O how unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably have been and ſtill are the Churches Sufferings, by a

I will add yet one more conſiderable miſchief; that is, that your <hi>unholineſs</hi> and <hi>carnal minds</hi> for all your Learning, corrupteth your judgments, and greatly hindereth you from receiving many excellent truths, and inclineth you to many mortal errours.

About the Attributes and Government of God, a bad man is inclined to doubt of Gods particular Providence, his holy Truth and Juſtice, and to think God is ſuch a one as he would have him to be. Whereas they that have the love of God and goodneſs, have his Attributes as it were written on their Hearts; that he is Good, and Wiſe, and Holy, and Juſt, and True, they know by an Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal certain knowledge, which is to them like Nature and Life it ſelf. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. &amp;c.</p>

               <p n="6">6. In caſes about the worſhip of God, a carnal Mind, how Learned ſoever, is apt to reliſh moſt an outſide, carnal, ceremonious way, and to be all for a dead formality, or elſe for a proud oſtentation of their own Wits, Opinions and Parts, or ſome odd ſingularity that ſets them up to be admired as ſome extraordinary Perſons, or teacheth their own Conſciences ſo to flatter them: When a Spiritual Man is for worſhipping God (though with all decent Externals, yet) in Spirit and in Truth; and in the moſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſincere and humble manner, and yet with the greateſt joy and praiſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16, 26, &amp;c.</p>

That they are worldly and unconſcionable; 2. And concerned by a perſonal Intereſt; eſpecially when they revile their Adverſaries.

There is more ſavoury worth in the experience, affections, and heavenly tendency of holy Souls, than in all the ſubtilties of Learned Wits. When a man cometh to die, who ſavoureth not more Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Sacred Scripture, and in holy Treatiſes, than in all <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Learned works? And who had not then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hear the talk and prayers of a holy perſon, than the moſt accurate Logick or Mathematicks? Alas! what are theſe but trifles to a dying man? And what they will be to a dying man, they ſhould be much to us all our life; unleſs we would never be wiſe till it is too late.</p>
               <p>And among men ſeeming Religious, it is not the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wrangler or diſputer, nor the Zealous reviler of his Brethren, that can hotly cry down on one ſide, <hi>Theſe men are Heretical</hi>; or on the other, <hi>Theſe are Antichriſtian,</hi> that are the Lovely perſons: Not they that on one ſide cry out, <hi>Away with theſe from the Miniſtry and Church as diſobedient to us?</hi> Or on the other, <hi>Away with theſe from our Communion as not holy enough to join with us?</hi> It is not they that proudlieſt <hi>perſecute</hi> to prove their Zeal, nor they that proudlieſt <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> from others to prove it; but it is they that live in the love of God and Man, that are beloved of God and Man. Nature teacheth all men to love thoſe that love them. And the Divine Nature teacheth us to love thoſe much more that love God and goodneſs.

And the moſt loving are the moſt lovely ſo be it their love be rightly guided. Doth it not kindle love in you to others, more, to hear their Breathings after God, and Grace, and Glory, and to ſee them loving and kind to all, and delighting to do all the good they can, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tenderly the infirmities of others, and practiſing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. and living at peace among themſelves, and as much as is poſſible with all men, and loving their Enemies, and bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that curſe them, and patiently bearing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving wrongs, than to come into one Congregation and hear a Prieſt teach the people to hate their Brethren as Schiſmaticks or Hereticks; or in another, and hear a man teach his Followers to hate others as Antichriſtian or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious?

               <p>IF LOVE be that which is moſt amiable in us to the God of Love, then as <hi>nothing</hi> in the World can excuſe him that is without it, nor render him lovely indeed to God and Man, ſo nothing muſt be made a pretence againſt it. And no pretence will excuſe that man, or that Society that is againſt it. Even corrections and ſeverities when they muſt be uſed, muſt come from love, and be wholly order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ends and intereſt of love. And when neceſſity calls for deſtructive Executions, which tend not to the good of him that is Executed, yet muſt they tend to the good of the Community or of many, and come from a greater love than is due to one, or elſe that which otherwiſe would be laudable Juſtice, is but Cruelty: For the puniſhment of Offenders is good and juſt, becauſe tending to the common good, <hi>Debentur Reipublicae,</hi> the Community have <hi>Jus,</hi> a Right to them as a means to their good: So that it is <hi>Love</hi> that is the <hi>Amiableneſs</hi> of Juſtice it ſelf.</p>
               <p>If any think that Gods Juſtice is a croſs inſtance, let him conſider, 1. That though the moſt publick or common good be our end next the ultimate, yet the true ultimate end of all things, is God himſelf: And the love of God is the higheſt love: And Gods Juſtice is not without that love of himſelf, and tendeth to that good which he is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving, which is but the fulfilling or complacency of his own will, which is but improperly called his Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 2. And we little know how many in another World, or in the renewed Earth, are to be profited by his Juſtice

Phyſick, Blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Diſmembring may be uſed for Life: But to take away Life, except neceſſarily for a Good that is better than that life, is Murder: And what is it that is better than the Life of Religion in all matters of Religion?

               <p n="1">1. The great Tyrants of the World, ſuch as in ſeveral ages have been the Plagues of their own and neighbour Nations, care not what havock they make of Religion, and of mens lives, by Bloody Wars and Cruel Perſecutions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſtroying many thouſands, and undoing far more thouſands of the Country Families where their armies come, and ſacrificing the lives of the beſt of their ſubjects by butcheries or flames? And what is the pretence for all this? Perhaps they would be Lords of more of the World, and would have larger
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:55434:153"/>
Kingdoms: Or more honour: Perhaps ſome Prince hath ſpoken a hard word of them, or done them ſome wrong: Perhaps ſome ſubjects believe not as they bid them believe; or forbear not to worſhip God in a manner which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them: Perhaps <hi>Daniel</hi> will not give over praying for a time, or the Apoſtles will not give over preaching, or the three Confeſſors will not fall down to the Golden Image; and ſo <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> or the other Rulers ſeem deſpiſed: And their wills and honour are an Intereſt that with them ſeemeth to warrant all this. But how long will it ſeem ſo?

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy ſet up Inquiſitions, force men by cruelties to ſubmit to their Church Keys, whoſe very nature is to be uſed without force, and they ſilence, yea torment the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, and have murdered thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of his faithful people raiſed rebellions againſt Princes and Wars in Kingdoms; and taught men to hate Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Rebels, Factious, and what not? And what pretence muſt juſtify all this? Why the Intereſt of the Pope and Clergy, called in ignorance or craft by the name of the <hi>Holy Church, Religion, Unity,</hi> and ſuch other honourable name. But muſt their Church live on Blood? and holy Blood? And be built or preſerved by the deſtruction of Chriſts Church? Muſt their doctrine be kept up by ſilencing faithful Miniſters? and their worſhip by deſtroying or undoing the true worſhippers of Chriſt? Are all theſe precious things which die with Love, no better than to be ſacrificed to the Clergies Pride and Worldly luſts?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Among many Schiſmaticks and Sectaries (that are not miſcalled ſo, but are ſuch indeed) their Diſcipline conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in ſeparating from moſt other Chriſtians, as too bad

(and that is, too <hi>unlovely</hi>) to be of their Communion; and their Preaching is much to make thoſe ſeem bad (that is, unlovely) that are not of their way; and their worſhip is much ſuch as reliſheth of the ſame envy and ſtrife, to add affliction or reproaches to their Brethren; or to draw the people from the Love of others unto them; And their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary talk is back-biting others for things that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, and reporting any lie that is brought them, and telling the hearers ſomething of this Miniſter, or that perſon or the other, that is unlovely, as if Satan had hired them to Preach down Love, and prate and pray down Love, and all this in the name of Chriſt: And the third chapter of <hi>James</hi> is harder than Hebrew to them; they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, but though they tear it not out of the Bible, they leave it out of the Law in their Hearts, as much as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts leave the Second Commandment out of their Books. And it is one of the marks of a good man among them to talk againſt other parties, and make others odious, to ſet up them. And what are the <hi>Pretences</hi> for all this? Why <hi>Truth and Holineſs.</hi> 1. Others have not the <hi>Truth</hi> which they have. And 2. Others are not againſt the ſame <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Church Orders</hi> and ways of worſhip which they are againſt; and therefore are ungodly, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian or men of no Religion.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Truth</hi> ſeldom dwelleth with the Enemies of Love and Peace: They that are Strangers and Enemies to it indeed do often cry it up, and cry down thoſe as Enemies to it that poſſeſs it: The wiſdom that hath bitter envying and heart-ſtrife is from beneath; and is earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh. I admoniſh all that care for their Salvation that they ſet up nothing upon love killing terms: If you are Chriſts diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples you are taught of God to love each other, you are taught it as Chriſts laſt and great Commandment: You are taught it by the wonderful example of his life, and ſpecially, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.14.

Hath Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you any thing before it, except the Love of God? You ſay, if ſuch and ſuch men be ſuffered, this and that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and inconvenience will follow: But is it a greater thing than Love that you would maintain? Is it a greater evil than the deſtruction of Love that you would avoid? Did not Chriſt prefer mercy before Sabbath reſt, and before the avoiding familiarity with ſinners? Pretend nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Love that is not better than Love.</p>

He that ſaith he loveth God, and hateth his Brother, is a Liar? What you do to his Brethren you do as to Chriſt: If you can find as full a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Salvation to thoſe that obſerve your Canons, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, Orders, or are of your Opinion and Sect, as I can ſhew you for them that Love Chriſt and his Servants, then prefer the former before Love.</p>
               <p>I know that the Love and Good of Church and State and of many muſt be preferred before the love and good of few. But take heed of their hypocriſie that make theſe alſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent when they are not; and make publick good and peace a meer pretence for their <hi>Perſecutions</hi> on one ſide, or their <hi>Schiſms</hi> on the other.

its own intereſt and name: It is as in love to the Church &amp; to mens Souls that the Inquiſition hath murdered ſo many, and the Laws <hi>de Hereticis comburendis</hi> have been made and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.

Which the primitive Chriſtians expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſelling all, and living in a Community of love, and ſtedfaſtly continuing in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and breaking of bread and Prayer? What are all Gods mercies for but that as by Love tokens we ſhould taſt that he is Love and Good, and ſhould by that taſt be inclined to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns</hi> of <hi>Love?</hi> Nay what are Civil Societies, but loving Communions, if uſed according to their natures. Did they not love each other, ſo many Bees would never hive and work together, nor ſo many Pigeons dwell peaceably in one Dove-houſe, nor fly together in ſo great flocks. What is the whole Chriſtian Faith for, but the doctrine of holy love believed, for the kindling and exerciſe of our love? what is faith itſelf but the bellows of love? What is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of all good works, and gifts and endowments, but to be the exerciſes of love to God and man, and the incentives of our brethrens Love? Without love all theſe are dead Carkaſſes, and as nothing, and without it we our ſelves are as nothing; yea though we give all that we have to the poor, or give our bodies like martyrs to be burnt, or could ſpeak with the tongue) the Orthodoxneſs and Elegancy) of Angels, we were but as ſounding braſs and as a tinkling Cymbal. <hi>James</hi> knew what he ſaid, when he ſaid that <hi>Faith without works is dead,</hi> becauſe <hi>without love</hi> it is dead, which thoſe works are but the body or the fruit of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This life of <hi>Love</hi> is the perfection of mans faculties as to their intended end and uſe. As all the operations of the lower faculties, (Vegetative and Senſitive) are ſubordinate to the uſe and operations of the <hi>Intellectual</hi> part, which is the higher, ſo all the Acts of the Intellect itſelf, are but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient and <hi>Dirigent</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> (or <hi>Love</hi>) and <hi>Practice.</hi> The underſtanding is but the Eye by which the Soul ſeeth what to <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>chooſe</hi> or refuſe, and what to <hi>do</hi> or to avoid. <hi>Love</hi> is the higheſt act of our higheſt faculty; And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:55434:156"/>
in the higheſt infinite good, is the higheſt of all the acts of Love. This is the State of the Soul in its Ripeneſs and Mellow Sweetneſs, when it is delightful, embracing its moſt deſired object, and is bleſſed in the fruition of its ultimate end. All other <hi>Graces and Duties</hi> are Servants unto this. They are the <hi>parts</hi> indeed of the ſame new creature, but the Hands and <hi>Feet</hi> are not the <hi>Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. For <hi>Love</hi> is the very foretaſt of <hi>Heaven</hi>; the beginning of that felicity which ſhall there be perfect. In Heaven all Saints ſhall be <hi>as One</hi>; and all united to their glorious Head, as he is united to the Father (diſparities allowed,) <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. And what more uniteth Souls than <hi>Love?</hi> Heaven is a ſtate of Joyful Complacence; and what is that but <hi>Perfect Love?</hi> The Heavenly work is perfect <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Praiſe:</hi> And what are theſe but the actions and the breath of Love?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore they that live this life of Love, are fitter to die, and readier for Heaven, than any others. Belief is a foreſight of it; but <hi>Love</hi> is a foretaſt; the firſt fruits, and our earneſt and pledge. He that <hi>Loveth</hi> God, and Chriſt, and Angels, and Saints, and perfect Holineſs, and Divine Praiſe, is ready for Heaven, as the Infant in the womb is ready for birth, at the fulneſs of his time: But other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whoſe Love is true, but little to their <hi>fears,</hi> and damped by darkneſs, and too much love of the body and this world, do go as it were by untimely birth to Heaven; and thoſe in whom the love of the body is predominant, come not thither (in that ſtate) at all. The God of Grace and Glory will meet that Soul with his felicitating embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who panteth and breatheth after him by Love: And as <hi>Love</hi> is a kind of Union with the Heavenly Society, the Angels, who love us better than we love them, will be ready to convey ſuch Souls to God. As the living dwell not in the graves among the dead, and the dead are buried from among the living; ſo holy Souls, who have this life of Love, cannot be among the miſerable in Hell, nor the dead in ſin among the bleſſed.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:55434:156"/>6. Therefore this life of <hi>holy Love,</hi> doth ſtrengthen our <hi>Belief</hi> it ſelf. Strong Reaſons that are brought for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of Souls, and the future Glory, are uſually loſt upon unſanctified hearers; yea with the Doctors themſelves that uſe them: When they have perſwaded others that there is a Heaven for Believers, and that by Arguments in themſelves unanſwerable, they have not perſwaded their own hearts; but the predominant Love of <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> doth byaſs their underſtandings, and maketh them think that they can confute themſelves. Their guſt and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prevaileth againſt Belief: And therefore the greateſt Scholars are not always the ſtrongeſt Believers. But <hi>holy Love,</hi> when it is the <hi>Habit</hi> of the Soul, as it naturally aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; ſo it <hi>eaſily believeth</hi> that God, that Glory to which it doth aſcend. The guſt and experience of ſuch a Soul aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it that it was made for Communion with God, and that even in this life ſuch Communion is obtained in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and therefore it eaſily believeth that it is <hi>Redeemed</hi> for it, and that it ſhall perfectly enjoy it in Heaven for ever. Though Glory be here but ſeminally in Grace, and this world be but as the womb of that better world for which we hope, yet the life that is in the Embrio and ſeed, is a confirming Argument for the perfection which they tend to. O that men knew what <hi>holy Love</hi> doth ſignifie and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel! As the ſeed or Embrio of a man becometh not a Beaſt or Serpent; ſo he that hath the habitual <hi>Love</hi> of God, and Heaven, and Holineſs, is not capable of Hell, no more than the Lovers of worldlineſs and ſenſuality are capable of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Communion with God, and of his Glory. God doth not draw mens Hearts to Himſelf, nor kindle Heavenly deſires in them in vain. He that hath the Spirit of Chriſt, hath the Witneſs in himſelf, that Chriſt and his Promiſes of Life are true, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. And what is this <hi>Spirit,</hi> but the Habit of Divine and Heavenly <hi>Love,</hi> and its concomitants? May I but feel my Soul inflamed with the fervent Love of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55434:157"/>
the Heavenly Perfection, ſurely it will do more to put me quite out of doubt of the certainty of that bleſſed ſtate, than all Arguments without that Love can do.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And <hi>holy Love</hi> will be the ſureſt Evidence of our Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; which many old Writers meant, that called it, The <hi>Form of Faith and other graces:</hi> As <hi>means,</hi> as <hi>means,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by their aptitudinal reſpect unto the <hi>End</hi>; ſo <hi>Love,</hi> as it is the <hi>Final Act</hi> upon God the <hi>Final Object,</hi> thus <hi>inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> all ſubordinate <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> as they are means. And as all <hi>Morality</hi> is ſubjected in the <hi>Will</hi> as the proper pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary ſeat, and is in the Intellect, executive power, and ſenſes only by participation, ſo far as their acts are imperate by the <hi>Will</hi>; ſo <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Volition</hi> being really the ſame thing, it may accordingly be ſaid, that nothing is any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acceptable to God, than it is <hi>Good</hi>; and nothing is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Good any further than it is <hi>voluntary</hi> or <hi>willed</hi>; and to be <hi>willed</hi> (as <hi>Good,</hi> as <hi>End,</hi> or as <hi>Means</hi>) and to be <hi>Loved,</hi> are words that ſignifie the ſame. No preaching, praying, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. no fear of puniſhment, no belief of the Truth, &amp;c. will prove us ſincere and juſtified, any further than we can prove, that all this either cometh from, or is accompanied with <hi>Love,</hi> that is, with a <hi>Conſenting Will. With the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10. And, <hi>If thou believe with all thy heart, thou mayeſt be baptized,</hi> ſaith <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>My Son, give me thy heart,</hi> is Wiſdom's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation. All's nothing without the heart, that is, <hi>without willingneſs</hi> or <hi>Love.</hi> They that love moſt are ſurelieſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and have moſt holineſs or grace, how unskifull ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may be in their expreſſions. The ſealing Spirit of Adoption, is the Spirit of Love, and the Abba Father, and the unexpreſſed groans of filial Love, are underſtood and acceptable to God. A <hi>Loving Deſire</hi> after God and Holineſs, is a better Evidence, than the moſt taking Tongue, or largeſt Knowledge.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This life of <hi>Holy Love</hi> will make all our Religion and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55434:157"/>
Obedience <hi>eaſy to us</hi>; It will give us an alacrity to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and a <hi>pleaſure</hi> in the practice of it; and ſo our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience will be <hi>hearty, willing</hi> and <hi>univerſal.</hi> Who is <hi>averſe</hi> to that which he <hi>Loveth</hi> (unleſs for ſomething in it which he hateth?) All men go willingly and readily to that which they truly Love. Therefore it is ſaid that the <hi>Law</hi> is not made for a Righteous man: that is, a man that Loveth Piety, Temperance and Juſtice, and their ſeveral works, ſo far hath no need of Threatning Laws and Penalties to conſtrain him to it: And he that hateth ſin, ſo far hath no need of Legal Penalties to reſtrain him from it. Thus is the Law ſaid to be <hi>written in our Hearts</hi>; not as it is meerly in our <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>memory,</hi> but as the matter commanded is truly Loved by us, and the ſin forbidden truly hated. Even our Horſes will carry us cheerfully that way which they Love to go, and go heavily where they go againſt their Wills. Win mens Love, and the life and lips and all (according to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) will follow it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And ſuch perſons therefore are likeſt to <hi>perſevere</hi>: men go unweariedly (if they be but able) where they go with Love. Eſpecially ſuch a Love, which groweth ſtronger as it draweth nearer the ſtate of perfection which it loveth; and groweth by daily renewed experiences and mercies, as Rivers grow bigger as they draw nearer to the Sea. We eaſily hold on in that we Love; But that which men loath, and their hearts are againſt; they are quickly weary of: And the weary perſon will eaſily be perſwaded to lie down: The root of a Apoſtaſie is already in thoſe perſons, who Love not the end which they pretend to ſeek, nor the work which they pretend to do.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Laſtly, holy Love is a <hi>pregnant, ſpreading, fruitful</hi> grace: It kindleth a deſire to do good to others, and to draw men to Love the ſame <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> which we love. It made Gods word to be to <hi>Jeremy</hi> as a <hi>burning Fire ſhut up in his Bones, he was weary of forbearing, Jer.</hi>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:55434:158"/>
20.9. As fire kindleth fire, and is the active principle of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation (as I ſuppoſe) ſo Love kindleth Love, and is a kind of generative principle of Grace. Gods Love is the firſt cauſe; but Mans Love maketh them meet Inſtruments of Gods Love: For Love will be oft praiſing the God and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs which is loved; and earneſtly deſireth that all others may Love and praiſe the ſame. The Soul is not indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, till its Love is won to God and Goodneſs: A man may be terrified into ſome auſterities, ſuperſtitions or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, but he is not further holy than his Heart is won. And as every thing that generateth is apt to produce its like, ſo is Love, and the words and works of Love. And as Love is the Heart of Holineſs, ſo muſt it be of all fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preaching and converſation, whatever the <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Actions</hi> are, they are like no farther to win Souls, than they demonſtrate the Love of God, and of Holineſs, and of the hearers or ſpectators. As among amorous and vain perſons ſtrong Love appearing though by a look or word, doth kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the like more than all complements that are known to be but feigned and affected words; ſo uſually Souls are won to God, as by the Preachers words and works of Love, the love and lovelineſs of God in Chriſt, are fullieſt made known.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhould we reach this excellent Life of holy Love, which doth ſo far excel all knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I have ſaid ſo much of this in the firſt part of my <hi>Chriſtian Directory,</hi> and other writings, that I muſt here ſay but little of it, leſt I be overmuch guilty of repetitions. Briefly,</p>
               <p>Direct. I. <hi>Believe Gods Goodneſs to be equal to his Greatneſs.</hi> Gods three great primary Attributes are coequal, <hi>viz. His Power,</hi> his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and his <hi>Goodneſs</hi>! And then look up to the Heavens and think how Great and Powerful is that God that made and continueth ſuch a frame, as that Sun, and thoſe Stars, and thoſe Glorious unmeaſureable Regions where they are: Think what a World of Creatures God
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:55434:158"/>
maintaineth in life, on this little lower Orb of Earth, both in the Seas and on the Land. And then think, O what is the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> which is equal to all this Power!</p>
               <p>Direct. 2. <hi>Conſider how communicative this Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is: Why elſe is he called LOVE it ſelf?</hi> Why elſe made he all the World? And why did he make the Sun ſo Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious? Why elſe did he animate and beautify the Univerſe, with the Life and Ornaments of Created Goodneſs? All his works ſhine by the ſplendor of that excellency which he hath put upon them; all are not <hi>equal,</hi> but all are <hi>Good,</hi> and their inequality belongeth to the Goodneſs of the Univerſe. The Communicative Nature with which God hath endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all active Beings, (and the moſt Noble moſt) is an Impreſs of the Infinite communicative LOVE. Fire would commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate its Light, Heat and Motion to all paſſive objects which are capable of receiving it: How pregnant and fertile is the very Earth, with plants, flowers and fruits of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful variety, uſefulneſs and beauty! What plant is not natured to the propagation of its kind, yea to a plenteous multiplication? How many Seeds which are <hi>Virtual Plants,</hi> doth each of them bring forth at once; and yet the ſame plant, with all its off-ſpring, perhaps liveth many years for further multiplication: ſo that did not the far greateſt part of Seeds yearly periſh, there muſt be very many ſuch Earths to receive and propagate them: This Earth hath not room for the hundredth part: To ſhew us that the Active natures even of Vegetatives, do quite exceed in their pregnant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative activity, the receptive capacity of all paſſive matter: which teacheth us to obſerve that all created Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients are unconceiveably too narrow to receive ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative Influences, as Infinite pregnant LOVE can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, were there ſubjects to receive them.</p>
               <p>It is wonderful to obſerve in all ſorts of Animals, the ſame multiplying communicative inclination! and what uſe the God of nature maketh even of ſenſual LOVE to all
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:55434:159"/>
Generation? Uniting and Communicative LOVE is in all Creatures the incentive Principle of Procreation. And what a multitude of young ones will ſome one Creature Procreate, eſpecially Fiſhes to admiration? So that if other Fiſhes, with Men and other Creatures did not devour them, all the Waters on Earth could not contain them.</p>
               <p>Yea our <hi>Moral Communicativeneſs</hi> alſo hath the ſame indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: He that knoweth much would fain have others know the ſame; ſecret knowledge kept to our ſelves only hath its excellent uſe; but it ſatisfieth not the mind, <hi>niſi te ſcire hoc ſciat alter,</hi> unleſs others know that you have ſuch knowledge, and unleſs you can make them know what you know: Holy Souls therefore have a <hi>fervent,</hi> but a <hi>regular</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and endeavour by communicative Teaching to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wiſe: But proud Heretical Perſons, that overvalue their conceits, have an irregular Fornicating Luſt of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and adulterouſly invade the charge of others, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that none can do it ſo wiſely and ſo well as they. Men will compaſs Sea and Land to make a Proſelyte; and Tares and Weeds are as much inclined to propagation as the Wheat. There is a marvellous deſire in the Nature of man to make others of their own Opinion; and when it is governed by Gods Laws, it is greatly beneficial to the World.</p>
               <p>And even in <hi>Affections,</hi> as well as <hi>Knowledge,</hi> it is ſo: We would have others love thoſe that we love, and hate what we hate. Though where, by the inſufficiency of the narrow Creature, Men muſt loſe and want that themſelves, which they Communicate to others, ſelfiſhneſs forbiddeth ſuch Communication.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſs all the Creatures in their ſeveral Ranks, have ſome ſuch Impreſſes from the Creator, by which his tranſcendent perfections may be ſomewhat obſerved. That God is now ſo <hi>Communicative</hi> as to give to all Creatures in the World, whatever <hi>Being, Motion, Life, Order, Beauty,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:55434:159"/>
Harmony, Reaſon, Grace, Glory,</hi> any of them poſſeſs is paſt all queſtion to conſidering ſober reaſon. Which tempted <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to think that the World was Eternal, and ſome Chriſtians to think that though this preſent Heaven and Earth were Created, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. is ſaid, yet that from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity ſome Intellectual World at leaſt, if not alſo Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, did flow from the Creator as an Eternal Effect of an Eternal Cauſe; or an Eternal Accident of the Deity: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not receive it, that a God ſo <hi>unſpeakably Communicative now</hi> (who hath made the <hi>Sun</hi> to be an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of his Communicativeneſs,) ſhould from all Eternity be ſolitary and <hi>not communicative,</hi> when yet <hi>to all Eternity</hi> he will be ſo. But theſe are queſtions which uncapable Mortals, were far better let alone than meddle with, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we deſire rather to be <hi>loſt</hi> than to be <hi>bleſſed</hi> in the Abyſs of Eternity, and the thoughts of <hi>infinite pregnant</hi> LOVE.</p>
               <p>But it is ſo <hi>natural</hi> for man and every <hi>Animal</hi> to <hi>love</hi> that <hi>love</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> which is <hi>beneficent,</hi> (not only to <hi>us,</hi> but to all) rather than a meer ſelf-lover, that doth no good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that it muſt needs conduce much to our <hi>love of God,</hi> to conſider that <hi>he is good to all, and his mercy is over all his works</hi>; and that as there is no light in the Air but from the Sun, ſo there is no goodneſs but from God in all the World, who is more to the Creation than the <hi>Sun</hi> is to this lower World. And a Sun that lighteth all the Earth, is much more precious than my Candle: A <hi>Nilus</hi> which watereth the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is more precious than a private Well: It is the Excellency of Kings and publick Perſons, that if they are good, they are good to many: And O what innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Animals in Sea and Land, beſides the far greater Worlds of nobler Wights do continually live by <hi>one God of Love</hi>! Study this <hi>Univerſal, Infinite Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Direct. 3. <hi>Eſpecially ſtudy Divine LOVE and Goodneſs in the Face of our Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt, and all the Grace which he hath purchaſed and conferreth.</hi> As we may ſee that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55434:160"/>
of the Stars in a Teleſcope, which without it no Eye can diſcern; ſo may we ſee that glory of the love of God, by the Goſpel of Jeſus, which all common natural helps are inſufficient to diſcover to ſuch minds as ours. <hi>LOVE</hi> is the great Attribute which Chriſt came principally to manifeſt, (as was afore-ſaid) <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1, &amp;c. And <hi>love</hi> is the great Leſſon which he came to teach us; and <hi>love</hi> is the <hi>new nature</hi> which by his Spirit he giveth us. And <hi>love</hi> is the great duty, which by Law and Goſpel he requireth of us. Love hath wrought its Miracles in Chriſt to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the underſtandings of Men and Angels. There we may ſee God in the neareſt condeſcending Unity with Man: In Chriſt we may ſee the <hi>divine wiſdom</hi> and <hi>word</hi> incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in ſuch Fleſh as ours, conceived in a Virgin by the power of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Love</hi>; by which <hi>Spirit</hi> this <hi>Incorporate Word</hi> did Live, Preach, Converſe familiarly with Man; work Miracles, heal Diſeaſes, ſuffer reproachful Calumnies and Death; Riſing, Triumphing, Aſcending, Interceeding, ſending the Embaſſies of Love to the World, calling Home the greateſt ſinners unto God, reconciling Enemies, and making them the Adopted Sons of God, forgiving all ſin to penitent Believers, quickening dead Souls, illuminating the Blind, and ſanctifying the Wicked by the Spirit of Life, and Light, and Love; and making it his Office, his Work, his Delight and Glory, to reſcue the miſerable Captives of the Devil, and to make Heirs of Heaven of thoſe that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to Hell, and had forſaken Life in forſaking God. As this is ſhining, burning love, ſo it is <hi>approaching</hi> and <hi>ſelf-applying</hi> love; which cometh ſo <hi>near us,</hi> in ways and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ſo neceſſary to us, and ſo <hi>exceeding congruous</hi> to our caſe, as that it is eaſier for us to perceive and <hi>feel</hi> it, than we can do things of greater diſtance. The clearer the Eye of Faith is, by which we look into this myſterious Glaſs, the more the wonders of Love will be perceived in it. He never knew Chriſt, nor underſtood the Goſpel, that wondered
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:55434:160"/>
not at Redeeming ſaving love; nor did he ever learn of Chriſt indeed, that hath not learned the Leſſon, Work and Life of love.</p>
               <p>Direct. 4. <hi>Keep as full Records as you can of the particular Mercies of God to your ſelves; and frequently peruſe them, and plead them with your frozen Hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are not the chiefeſt reaſons of Chriſtian love; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſuch poor inconſiderable Worms, that to do <hi>good to one of us,</hi> is a far ſmaller matter, than many things elſe that we have to think of for that end. But yet when <hi>love</hi> doth chuſe a particular Perſon for its object, and there beſtow its obliging Gifts, it helpeth that Perſon far more than others to returns of thankfulneſs and love: It's that place, that Glaſs which the Sun doth ſhine upon, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect its Beams, rather than thoſe that are ſhut up in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Self-love</hi> may and muſt be <hi>regulated</hi> and <hi>ſanctified,</hi> to the furthering of higher love. It is not unmeet to ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 116.1. <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard the voice of my ſupplication.</hi> We ſhould ſay as heartily, <hi>I love the Lord becauſe he hath proſpered, recovered, comforted my Neighbour:</hi> But this is not all ſo eaſie as the other: And where God by perſonal application, maketh our greateſt duty eaſie, we ſhould uſe his helps.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But if it be ſelfiſhneſs as ſome tell us, to love one that loveth us, better than another of equal worth, who doth not love us, is it not ſelfiſhneſs to love God on ſo low an account as loving us? God may ſay well, I love thoſe that love me,</hi> Prov. 8.17. <hi>becauſe to love him is the higheſt virtue, but to love us is as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable as we are.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. You may <hi>love</hi> another the more for <hi>loving you</hi> on ſeveral accounts. 1. As it is a duty which God requireth him to perform (but ſo you muſt love him equally for lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others alſo.) 2. As he rendereth himſelf more <hi>congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>obliging</hi> to you, by chuſing you for the ſpecial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his love, by which he taketh the advantage of your
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:55434:161"/>
natural ſelf-love, to make your love to him both <hi>due and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> (as is ſaid of the reflection of the Sun-beams before.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. But two things you muſt take heed of, 1. That you under-value not your Neighbours good, but love another for loving your Neighbours alſo, and doing them good; and he that arriveth at that impartial Unity as to make the ſmalleſt difference between his Neighbour and himſelf, doth ſeem to me to be arrived at the ſtate that is likeſt to theirs that are One in Heaven. 2. And you muſt not <hi>over-love</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man by a fond partiality for his love to you; as if that made a bad man good, or fitter for your love: They that can love the <hi>worſt</hi> that <hi>love them,</hi> and cannot love the <hi>beſt that</hi> ſet <hi>light by them</hi> (<hi>deſervedly,</hi> or <hi>upon miſtake</hi>) do ſhew that <hi>ſelf-love</hi> overcometh the love of God. But God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>loved too much,</hi> though he may be loved too <hi>ſelfiſhly</hi> and carnally. His greateſt Amiableneſs is his Eſſential Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Infinite Perfection: The next is his Glory ſhining in the Univerſe, and ſo in the Heavenly Society, eſpecially (Chriſt and all his Holy Ones;) and ſo in the publick bleſſings of the World, and all Societies. And next his goodneſs to your ſelves, not only as parts of the ſaid Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but as Perſons whoſe Natures are formed by God himſelf, to a capacity, of <hi>Receiving</hi> and <hi>Reflecting Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who findeth not by Experience that God is moſt loved, when we are moſt ſenſible of his former love to us, in the thankful review of all his Mercies, and moſt aſſured or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of his future love in our Salvation. Therefore make the renewed Commemoration of Gods Mercies, the incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of your love.</p>
               <p>Direct. 5. <hi>But yet could you get a greater Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion not only with Saints as Saints, but with Mankind as Men, it would greatly help you in your Love to God:</hi> For when you love your neighbours as your ſelves, you would love God for your neighbours mercies, as well as for your own. And if you feel that God's Love and ſpecial mercies to one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:55434:161"/>
even your ſelves, can do ſo much in cauſing your Love, what would your Love amount to, if thouſand thouſands of perſons to whom God ſheweth mercy, were every one to you as your ſelves, and all their mercies as your own? Thus graces mutually help each other. We love Man, becauſe we love God; and we love God the more for our love to Man.</p>
               <p>Direct. 6. <hi>Eſpecially dwell by Faith in Heaven where Love is perfect, and there you will learn more of the work of Love.</hi> To think believingly that <hi>Mutual Love</hi> is Heaven it ſelf, and that this is our Union with God, and Chriſt, and all the holy ones, and that Love will be an everlaſting employment, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and felicity, this will breed in us a deſire to begin that happy life on Earth. And as he that heareth excellent Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick will long to draw near, and joyn in the conſort or the pleaſure; ſo he that by Faith doth dwell much in Heaven, and hear how Angels and bleſſed Souls do there praiſe God in the higheſt fervours of rejoycing Love, will be inclined to imitate them, and long to partake of their felicity.</p>
               <p>Direct. 7. <hi>Exerciſe that meaſure of Love which you have in the conſtant Praiſes of the God of Love.</hi> For exerciſe exciteth, and naturally tendeth to increaſe, and Praiſe is the duty in which pure Love to God above our ſelves and all, even as good and perfect in himſelf, is exerciſed. As Love is the Higheſt Grace, or Inward Duty; ſo praiſe is the Higheſt <hi>Outward Duty,</hi> (when God is praiſed both by Tongue and Life.) And as <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> make one <hi>Man,</hi> of whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence Generation is the cauſe; ſo <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi> (of <hi>Mouth</hi> and <hi>Works</hi>) do make one <hi>Saint,</hi> who is Regenerated ſuch by <hi>Believing</hi> in the Redeemer, who hath power to give the Spirit of Holineſs to whom he pleaſeth. But of this more afterwards.</p>
               <p>Direct. 8. <hi>Exerciſe your Love to Man, eſpecially to Saints, in doing them all the good you can; and that for what of God is in them.</hi> For as this is the fruit of the Love of God, and the evidence of it; ſo doth it tend to the increaſe of its cauſe:
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55434:162"/>
Partly as it is an exerciſe of it, and partly as it is a duty which God hath promiſed to the reward. As it is the Spirit of Chriſt, even of Adoption, which worketh both the lov<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </argument>
               <p>IT is of greateſt importance to all Mankind, to know what is <hi>beſt</hi> for them, and in what they ſhould place and ſeek their comforts: To place them moſt with the <hi>Proud,</hi> in the applauding thoughts or words of others, that magnifie them for their wit, their beauty, their wealth, or their pomp and power in the world, is to chuſe ſomewhat leſs than a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow for felicity, and to live on the Air; even an unconſtant Air: And will ſuch a life be long, or happy? Should not a man in miſery rather take it for a ſtinging deriding mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or abuſe, to be honoured and praiſed for that which he hath not, or for that which is his ſnare, or conſiſteth with his calamity? Would not a Malefactor at the Gallows take it for his reproach to hear an Oration of his happineſs? Will it comfort them in Hell to be praiſed on Earth? This common reaſon may eaſily call, An empty Vanity.</p>
               <p>To place our Comforts in the <hi>delights</hi> of <hi>Senſuality,</hi> had ſomewhat a fairer ſhew of Reaſon, if Reaſon were made for nothing better; and if theſe were the noble ſort of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that advanced man above the brutes; and if they would continue for ever, and the end of ſuch mirth were not heavineſs and repentance, and they did not deprave and deceive mens Souls, and leave behind them diſappointment and a ſting. But he is unworthy the honour and pleaſures
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:55434:162"/>
of Humanity, who preferreth the pleaſures of a beaſt, when he may have better.</p>
               <p>To place our Comforts in thoſe Riches, which do but ſerve this Senſuality with proviſions, and leave poſterity in as vain and dangerous a ſtate as their progenitors were, is but the foreſaid folly aggravated.</p>
               <p>To place them in <hi>Domination,</hi> and having our <hi>Wills</hi> on others, and being able to do hurt, and exerciſe revenge, is but to account the Devils happier than men, and to deſire to be as the Wolf among the Sheep, or as the Kite among the Chickens, or as the great Dogs among the little ones.</p>
               <p>To place them in much <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Arts and Sciences, as they concern only the Intereſts of the body in this life; or as Knowledge is but the delight of the natural phantaſie or mind, doth ſeem a little finer, and ſublime, and manly, but it is of the ſame nature and vanity as the reſt. For all <hi>Knowledge</hi> is for the guidance of the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi>; and therefore <hi>meer knowing</hi> matters that tend to <hi>Pride, Senſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Wealth</hi> or <hi>Domination,</hi> is leſs than the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of ſenſual pleaſures in the things themſelves. And the contemplation of ſuperiour Creatures, which hath no other end than the delight of <hi>knowing,</hi> is but a more refined ſort of vanity, and like the minds activity in a dream.</p>
               <p>But whether it be the <hi>Knowledge</hi> or the <hi>love of God,</hi> that man ſhould place his higheſt felicity in, is become among the Schoolmen and ſome other Divines, a controverſy that ſeemeth ſomewhat hard. But indeed to a conſidering man, the ſeeming difficulty may be eaſily overcome: The <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will and Executive activity,</hi> are not ſeveral Souls, but ſeveral faculties of one Soul; And their Objects and Order of operation eaſily tell us, which is the firſt, and which the laſt which tendeth to the other as its end, and which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is the moſt delightful and moſt felicitating to the man, <hi>viz.</hi> That Truth is for <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and that <hi>Good as Good</hi> is the amiable, delectable and felicitating object; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:55434:163"/>
that the Intellect is the guide of the <hi>Will,</hi> and Faith and Knowledge are for Love and its Delight. And yet that mans felicity is in <hi>both</hi> and not in <hi>one alone,</hi> as one faculty alone is not the whole Soul, (though it be the whole Soul that acteth by that faculty.) Therefore the later School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have many of them well confuted <hi>Aquinas</hi> in this point.</p>
               <p>And it is of great importance in our Chriſtian practice. As the deſire of more <hi>Knowledge</hi> firſt corrupted our nature, ſo corrupted nature, is much more eaſily drawn to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>knowledge,</hi> than after <hi>love.</hi> Many men are bookiſh that cannot endure to be Saints: Many can ſpend their lives in the ſtudies of Nature and Theology, and Delight, to find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Knowledge, who are Strangers to the Sanctifying, Uniting, delightful exerciſe of holy love. Appetite is the <hi>pondus</hi> or firſt Spring of our moral actions, yea and of our natural, though the ſenſe and intellect intromit or illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Object. And the firſt act of natural Appetite (Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and Intellectual) is neceſſitated. And accordingly the Appetite as <hi>pleaſed</hi> is as much the <hi>end</hi> of our Acts and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as the Appetite as <hi>Deſiring</hi> is the beginning: Even as (<hi>ſi parvis magna,</hi> &amp;c.) Gods <hi>Will</hi> as Efficient is the abſolutely firſt cauſe, and his <hi>will</hi> as <hi>done</hi> and <hi>pleaſed</hi> is the ultimate end of all things. It is Love by which man cleaveth unto God, as Good, and as our ultimate end. Love ever ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth knowledge; and is its end and perfection. Neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but both together are mans higheſt State; Knowledge as diſcerning what is to be Loved, and Love as our uniting and Delighting adherence to it.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Labour therefore with all your induſtry, to <hi>know God</hi> that you may <hi>love</hi> him; It is that <hi>love</hi> that muſt be your <hi>comforting</hi> grace, both by <hi>ſignification,</hi> and by its proper <hi>Effective Exerciſe.</hi> 1. True love will prove that your <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> are true and <hi>ſaving,</hi> which you will never be ſure of, without the Evidence of this and the conſequent
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:55434:163"/>
Effects. If your expreſſive art or gifts be never ſo low, ſo that you ſcarce know what <hi>to ſay</hi> to God or man, yet if you ſo far know God as ſincerely to <hi>love him,</hi> it is certainly true ſaving knowledge, and that which is the beginning of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Knowledge, Belief, Repentance, Humility, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Patience, Zeal, Diligence, &amp;c. are ſo far, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſure marks of Salvation, as they <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>prove</hi> true <hi>love</hi> to God and Man, Predominant. It is a hard thing any otherwiſe to know whether our Knowledge, Repentance, Patience, Zeal or any of the reſt be any better than what an unjuſtifyed perſon may attain: But if you can find that they <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>come from,</hi> or <hi>accompany</hi> a ſincere Love of God, you may be ſure that they all partake of ſincerity, and are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſigns of a Juſtified Soul. It is hard to know what ſins for number, or <hi>nature,</hi> or <hi>magnitude,</hi> are ſuch as may or may not conſiſt with a State of ſaving grace. He that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the ſins of <hi>Lot, David, Solomon</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> will find the caſe exceeding difficult: But this much is ſure, that ſo much ſin may conſiſt with a Juſtified State, as may conſiſt with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere love to God and Goodneſs. While a man truly loveth God above all, his ſin may cauſe <hi>Correction,</hi> but not <hi>DAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATION</hi>; unleſs it could extinguiſh or overcome this Love. Some queſtion whether that the ſin of <hi>Lot</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> for the preſent ſtood with juſtification: If it excuſſed not predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant habitual love, it intercepteth not juſtification: If we could tell whether <hi>any</hi> or <hi>many</hi> heathens that hear not of Chriſt, <hi>have</hi> the true <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> we might know whether they are ſaved.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, becauſe that <hi>the will is the man</hi> in Gods account; And as <hi>Voluntarineſs</hi> is eſſential to <hi>ſin,</hi> ſo a <hi>Holy Will</hi> doth prove a <hi>Holy perſon.</hi> God hath the <hi>heart</hi> of him that loveth him. He that <hi>loveth</hi> him would fain pleaſe him, glorify him, and enjoy him: And he that loveth <hi>holineſs</hi> would fain live a holy life.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is that Divines ſay here that <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> is a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55434:164"/>
certain ſign of grace, becauſe it is an act of <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> And it is true, if that deſire be greater or more <hi>powerful</hi> than our <hi>Averſeneſs,</hi> and than our <hi>deſire</hi> after contrary things, that ſo it may put us on neceſſary duty, and overcome the <hi>luſts</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi> which oppoſe them: Though <hi>cold wiſhes</hi> which are conquered by greater <hi>unwillingneſs</hi> and <hi>prevailing luſts,</hi> will never ſave men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as love is our more comforting <hi>Evidence,</hi> ſo it is our moſt comforting <hi>Exerciſe.</hi> Thoſe acts of religion which come ſhort of this, come ſhort of the proper <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of true religion. They are but either lightnings in the brain that have no <hi>heat</hi>; or a feaveriſh <hi>zeal</hi> which deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or troubleth, but doth not perform the acts of life; or elſe (even where <hi>love</hi> is <hi>true,</hi> but <hi>little</hi>; and oppreſt by <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>grief,</hi> and <hi>trouble,</hi>) it is like Fire in green Wood, or like young green Fruits, which is not come to mellow ripeneſs. Love of Vanity is diſappointing, unſatisfactory and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting: Moſt of the Calamities of this life proceed from creature-love: The greateſt tormentor in this world is the inordinate love of life; and the next is the love of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and accommodations of life; which cauſe ſo much care to get and keep, and ſo much fear of loſing, and grief for our loſſes, eſpecially fear of dying, that were it not for this, our lives would be much eaſier to us (as they are to the fearleſs ſort of brutes.) And the next tormenting affection is the love of Children, which prepareth men for all the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that followeth their miſcarriages in Soul and Body: Their unnatural ingratitude, their Lewdneſs, and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and Prodigality, their Folly and Impiety would no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much torment us, were they no more loved than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. And our deareſt Friends do uſually coſt us much dearer than our ſharpeſt enemies. But the love of God and Satisfying everlaſting good is our very life, our pleaſure, our Heaven on Earth. As it is <hi>Pureſt</hi> and <hi>Higheſt,</hi> above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe of the <hi>Object,</hi> ſo is it yet more <hi>pleaſant</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting,</hi>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:55434:164"/>
becauſe it includeth the <hi>hopes of more,</hi> even of thoſe greater delights of heavenly everlaſting love, which as a pledge and earneſt it doth preſignify. As in nature, concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the ſtirring the Child in the womb do ſignify that ſame life is begun, which muſt ſhortly appear and be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the open world. So the ſtirrings of holy love &amp; deſires towards God, do ſignify the beginning of the heavenly life.</p>
               <p>Humility and Patience, and diligent obedience do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us by way of <hi>Evidence,</hi> and as removing many hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of our comfort, and ſomewhat further they go. <hi>But Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> do comfort us by way of direct effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency: <hi>Faith</hi> ſeeth the matter of our Joy; <hi>love</hi> firſt <hi>taſteth</hi> it ſo far as to ſtir up deſires after it. Then <hi>Hope</hi> giveth ſome pleaſure to us in <hi>expecting</hi> it. And laſtly, complacential love delightfully embraceth it, and is our very Joy itſelf, and is that bleſſed union with God and holy Souls, the amiable Objects of true love, which is our felicity it ſelf. To work out our comforts by the view of <hi>Evidences</hi> and <hi>Signs,</hi> is a neceſſary thing indeed, but it requireth a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſearch, by an underſtanding and compoſed mind; and it's often much hindered and interrupted, by mens ignorance of themſelves, and weakneſs of grace, and darkneſs or ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Evidence, and divers paſſions, eſpecially <hi>fear</hi> (which in ſome is ſo Tyrannical that it will not ſuffer to believe or feel any thing that is comfortable.) But love taketh in the ſweetneſs of that good which is its object, by a <hi>nearer</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> way, even by immediate taſte; As we feel in the exerciſe of our Love to a dear Friend, or any thing that is amiable and enjoyed.</p>
               <p>The readieſt and ſureſt way therefore to a contented and comfortable life is, (to keep clear indeed our evidence, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſincere Obedience, but) eſpecially to bend all our Studies and Religious endeavours, to the kindling and exerciſe of <hi>holy love,</hi> and to avoid all (though it may come on religious pretence of humiliation or fear) which tendeth to quench or hinder it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:55434:165"/>I. In Health and Proſperity as you live upon Gods love, be ſure that you do not atheiſtically overlook it, but take all as from it, and ſavouring of it. The hand of divine love perfumeth each mercy with the pleaſant odour of itſelf, which it reacheth to us. Every bit that we eat is a love token, and every hour or minute that we live; All our health, wealth, Friends and Peace are the Streams which ſtill flow from the Spring of unexhauſted love. Love ſhineth upon us by the Sun; love maketh our Land fruitful, or Cattel uſeful, our Habitations convenient for us, our Garments warm, our Food pleaſant and nouriſhing; Love keepeth us from a thouſand unknown dangers night and day: It giveth us the comforts of our Callings, our Company, our Books, our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Recreations; It bleſſeth means of Knowledge to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and means of Holineſs to our <hi>Wills,</hi> and means of Health and Strength to our bodies: Mercies are <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to us when we <hi>taſt Gods love in them, and love him for them,</hi> and are <hi>led up by</hi> them to <hi>himſelf,</hi> and ſo love him ultimately for himſelf, even for his Infinite Eſſential Goodneſs. As God is the efficient life of our mercies, and all the world without his Love could never give us what we have, ſo is Gods <hi>love</hi> the <hi>Objective life</hi> of all our mercies, and we have but the Corps or Carkaſs of them, and love them but as ſuch, if we love not in them the Love that giveth them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And even in <hi>adverſity</hi> and <hi>pain,</hi> and <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> whilſt Gods love is unchanged, and is but changing the way of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, our thoughts of it ſhould be unchanged alſo. We muſt not think that the Sun is loſt when it is ſet, or clouded: we live by its influence in the night, though we ſee not its light, unleſs as reflected from the Moon: Our Mothers brought us into the World in ſorrow; and yet they juſtly accounted it a mercy that we were born: Our lives are ſpent in the midſt of ſorrows; &amp; yet it is a mercy that we live: and though we die by dolour, all is ſtill mercy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, which faith perceiveth contrary to ſenſe: And here
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55434:165"/>
is the greateſt and final victory which Faith obtaineth againſt the fleſh, to believe even the ruine of it to be for our good. Even <hi>Antonine</hi> the Emperor could ſay that it was the ſame good God who is the cauſe of our birth and of our death: one as well as the other is his work, and therefore good: It was not a Tyrant that made us, and it is not a Tyrant that diſſolveth us. And that is the beſt man, and the beſt will, which is moſt pleaſed with the Will of God, becauſe it is his Will. Yet juſt ſelf-love is here a true coadjutor of our joy: for it is the will of God that the Juſtified be Glorified. And Infinite love is ſaving us when it ſeemeth to deſtroy us.</p>
               <p>To live upon the comforts of Divine love in <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> and when <hi>death</hi> approacheth, is a ſign that it is not the welfare of the <hi>body</hi> that we moſt eſteem, and that we rejoice not in God only as the preſerver and proſperer of our fleſh, but for himſelf and the bleſſings of immortality.</p>
               <p>It is a mercy indeed which a dying man muſt with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs acknowledge, if God have given him a clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the excellent myſteries of Salvation: knowledge as it kindleth and promoteth love, is a precious gift of grace, and is with pleaſure exerciſed, and may with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be acknowledged. But all other knowledge is like the Vanities of this World, which approaching death doth take down our eſteem of, and cauſeth us to number it with other forſaking and forſaken things: All the unſanctified learning and knowledge in the World, will afford no ſolid peace at death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather aggravate natures ſorrows, to think that this alſo muſt be left. But love and its comforts (if not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by <hi>ignorance</hi> or ſome <hi>ſtrong temptation</hi>) do <hi>then</hi> ſhew their immortal nature: And even here we feel the words of the Apoſtle verified, of the vaniſhing nature of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the perpetuity of holy love, whilſt all our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knowledge will not give ſo much comfort to a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, as one act of true love to God and Holineſs kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in us by the communication of his love. Make it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:55434:166"/>
the work of your Religion, and the work of your whole lives, to poſſeſs your minds with the livelieſt ſenſe of the infinite goodneſs and amiableneſs of God, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to live in the conſtant exerciſe of Love.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And though ſome men hinder love by an over fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful queſtioning whether they have it, or not; and ſpend that time in doubting, and complaining that they have it not, which they ſhould ſpend in exciting and exerciſing it, yet reaſon requireth us to take heed leſt a carnal mind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us with any counterfeits of holy love: Of which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written more in my <hi>Chriſtian Directory,</hi> I ſhall here give you but theſe brief inſtructions following.</p>
               <p>It is here of grand importance, I. To have a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of God as he muſt be loved; II. And then to know practically how it is that love muſt be exerciſed towards him.</p>
               <p n="1">I. GOD muſt be conceived of at once, both 1. As in his eſſence, 2. And as in his relations to the <hi>world</hi> and <hi>to our ſelves,</hi> 3. And as in his <hi>works.</hi> And thoſe that will ſeparate theſe, and while they fix only on one of them leave out the other, do not indeed love God as God, &amp; as he muſt be loved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To think in general that there is <hi>an infinite eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life, Light</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and not to think of him as relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world, as its Creator, Preſerver and Governor, nor as related to us and to mankind as our <hi>Owner, Ruler</hi> and <hi>Benefactor,</hi> is not to think of him as a God to us or to any but himſelf: And a love thus exerciſed cannot be true ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And becauſe his relations to us reſult from his works, either which he hath done already, or which he <hi>will</hi> do hereafter, therefore without the knowledge of his <hi>works,</hi> and their goodneſs, we cannot truly know and love God in his relations to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And yet when we know his <hi>works,</hi> we know but the <hi>medium,</hi> or that in which he himſelf is made known to us;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55434:166"/>
And if by them we come not to know him and love him in his perfect Eſſence, it is not God that we know and love. And if we knew him only as <hi>Related to us and the World,</hi> (as that he is our <hi>Creator, Owner, Mover, Ruler and Benefactor,</hi>) and yet know not what he is in his <hi>eſſence</hi> that is thus related <hi>viz,</hi> that he is (the <hi>Perfect, Firſt, Being, Life, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi>) this were not truly to know and love him as he is God. Theſe conceptions therefore muſt be conjunct.</p>
               <p>God is not here known to us but by the revelation of his <hi>works</hi> and <hi>word,</hi> nor can we conceive of him but by the <hi>ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude</hi> of ſome of <hi>his works</hi>: not that we muſt think that he is juſt ſuch as they, or picture him like a creature; for he is infinitely above them all: but yet it is certain that he hath made ſome impreſſions of his perfections upon his works; and on ſome of them ſo clear as that they are called his <hi>Image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing is known to us but either, 1. By ſenſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately perceiving things external and repreſenting them to the phantaſie and intellect, or 2. By the Intellects own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of other things by the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of things ſenſed; 3. Or by immediate internal Intuition or <hi>Senſation</hi> of the acts of the Soul in it ſelf: 4. Or by reaſons collection of the nature of other things, from the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> and effect of ſuch perceived operations.</p>
               <p n="1">I. By the external Senſes, we perceive all external ſenſed things, and we <hi>imagine</hi> and <hi>know</hi> them as ſo perceived.</p>
               <p n="2">II. By the Intellection of theſe, we conceive of other things as like them, forming Univerſal conceptions, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them to ſuch individuals as are beyond the reach of our Senſes. (As we think of Men, Trees, Beaſts, Fiſhes, &amp;c. in the <hi>Indies</hi> as like thoſe which we have ſeen; and of ſounds there as like thoſe which we have heard, and of the taſte of Fruits by the ſimilitude of ſuch as we have taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">III. How <hi>Senſe</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Intellection</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Volition</hi> it ſelf, and internal <hi>Affections</hi> are perceived, is no ſmall controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55434:167"/>
among Philoſophers. That <hi>we</hi> do <hi>perceive</hi> them, (by the great wiſdom and goodneſs of our Creator) we are ſure; but <hi>how</hi> we do it we can ſcarce deſcribe, as knowing it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the experience of that perception it ſelf than by a knowledge of the Cauſes and Nature of the acts. It is moſt commonly ſaid that the Intellect knoweth its own acts by <hi>Reflection,</hi> or as <hi>Ockam,</hi> by <hi>Intuition,</hi> and that it knoweth what <hi>Senſe</hi> is, and what <hi>Volition</hi> by ſome <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> of them in the phantaſie which it beholdeth. But ſuch words give no man a true knowledge of the thing enquired of, unleſs withal he read the ſolution experimentally in his own Soul. I know not what the meaning of a <hi>Reflect</hi> act is: Is it the ſame act which is called <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>Reflect</hi>? And doth the Intellect <hi>know</hi> that it knoweth by the very ſame act by which it knoweth other things? If ſo, why is it call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Reflect,</hi> and what is that reflection? But the contrary is commonly ſaid, that divers objects make divers acts, and therefore to know <hi>e.g.</hi> that this is Paper, and to know that <hi>I know</hi> this, are two acts, and the latter is a reflecting of the former. But the former act is <hi>gone,</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi> in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that it is done, and therefore is in it ſelf no intelligible object of a reflecting act: But as <hi>remembred</hi> it may be known, or rather that remembring is knowing what is paſt, by a marvellous retention of ſome impreſs of it which no man can well comprehend, ſo as to give an account of it: And why may not the ſame memory which retaineth the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Record of an Act paſt an hour or many years ago, be alſo the Book where the Intellect readeth its own Act as paſt immediately in the foregoing inſtant? But ſure this is not the firſt <hi>knowing</hi> that <hi>we know?</hi> Before the act of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, the Intellect immediately perceiveth its own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular acts: And ſo doth the ſenſe: By one and the ſame act we ſee and perceive that we ſee; and by one and the ſame act (I think) we <hi>know</hi> and know that we <hi>know,</hi> and this by a conſciouſneſs or internal ſenſe which is the immediate act
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:55434:167"/>
of the Eſſence of the faculty: And chuſe whether you will ſay that ſuch <hi>two objects</hi> may conſtitute one act? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will ſay that the latter (the act it ſelf) is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be called an object: For the various ſenſes of the word <hi>object</hi> muſt be conſidered in the deciſion of that: Mans Soul is Gods Image: When God knoweth himſelf and his own knowledge, and when he willeth or loveth himſelf, and his own will or love, here we muſt either ſay that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his knowledge and will is not properly to be called an <hi>Object,</hi> or elſe that the <hi>Object</hi> and the Act are purely the ſame, without the leaſt real difference; but we name them differently as inadequate conceptions of one Being: And why may it not be ſo in a lower ſort in the Soul that is Gods Image? That is, that the underſtandings moſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal act, <hi>viz.</hi> the knowing or perceiving when it knoweth any thing <hi>that it knoweth.</hi> It is not really compounded of an act and an object (as the knowledge of diſtinct objects is;) but that either its act is not properly to be called <hi>its object,</hi> or that act and object are not two things, but two inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate conceptions of one thing.</p>
               <p>And how doth the Soul perceive its own <hi>Volitions</hi>? To ſay that <hi>Volitions</hi> which are acts of the <hi>Intellectual Soul</hi> muſt be ſenſate, and ſo make a <hi>Species</hi> on the phantaſie, as ſenſate things do, and be known only in that <hi>Species,</hi> is to bring down the higher faculty, and ſubordinate it to the lower, that it may be intelligible; while it is certain that we ſhall never here perfectly underſtand the ſolution of theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, is it not pardonable, among other mens conjectures, to ſay, That the noble faculty of Senſe (becauſe Brutes have it) is uſually too baſely deſcribed by Philoſophers? And that <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Volition</hi> in the rational Soul are a <hi>ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior eminent</hi> ſort of ſenſation tranſcending that of Brutes; and that <hi>Intelligere</hi> &amp; <hi>Velle</hi> are <hi>eminenter ſentire</hi>; and that the <hi>Intellect</hi> doth by underſtanding other things, eminently ſee or ſenſe, and ſo underſtand that it underſtandeth: And
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:55434:168"/>
that the will doth by willing <hi>feel</hi> that it willeth: When I conſult my Experience, I muſt either ſay thus, or elſe that <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Volition</hi> ſo immediately ever move the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſenſe, that they are known by us only as acts compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that ſenſe.</p>
               <p>But I am gone too far before I was aware.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Soul thus <hi>knowing</hi> or <hi>feeling</hi> its own acts, doth in the next place rationally gather, 1. That it hath <hi>power</hi> to perform them, and is a ſubſtance ſo empowered. 2. That there are other ſuch ſubſtances with the like acts. 3. And there is one prime tranſcendant ſubſtance, which is the cauſe of all the reſt which hath infinitely nobler acts than ours.</p>
               <p>And thus <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> concur to our knowledge of God, by ſhewing us, and perceiving that Image in which by ſimilitude we muſt know him. The Fiery, Ethereal or Solar Nature is (at leaſt) the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of <hi>Spirits:</hi> And by condeſcending ſimilitude God in Scripture is called LIGHT, and the FATHER of LIGHTS, in whom is no darkneſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and inviting us to think of his <hi>Glory</hi> by the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Light.</hi> But <hi>Intellectual Spirits</hi> are the higheſt Nature known to us, and theſe we know intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by moſt near perception: By the ſimilitude of theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt conceive of God.</p>
               <p>A Soul is a <hi>ſelf-moving Life</hi> or <hi>vital Subſtance</hi>; actuating the Body to which it is united. God is ſuper-eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Eſſential-Life,</hi> perfect in himſelf, as living Infinitely and Eternally, and giving <hi>Being</hi> to all that is, and <hi>Motion</hi> to all that moveth, and <hi>Life</hi> to all that liveth.</p>
               <p>A reaſonable Soul is Eſſentially <hi>an underſtanding power:</hi> And God is ſuper-eminently <hi>an Infinite underſtanding know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> himſelf and all things perfectly.</p>
               <p>A reaſonable Soul is Eſſentially a rational Appetite or <hi>Will,</hi> neceſſarily loving himſelf, and all that is apprehended every way, and congruouſly good. God is ſuper-eminently
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55434:168"/>
an Infinite <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> neceſſarily loving himſelf; and <hi>his</hi> own Image, which yet he freely made by communicative Love.</p>
               <p>All things that were made by this Infinite Goodneſs, were made good and very good. All his works of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Providence (however miſconceived of by ſinners) are ſtill very good. All the good of the whole Creation is as the heat of this Infinite, Eternal Fire of Love. And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the World <hi>good,</hi> in the good of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>Order,</hi> and the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>mutual Love,</hi> he doth by his continual influx maintain and perfect it. His <hi>Power mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> his <hi>Wiſdom governeth,</hi> and his <hi>Love felicitateth.</hi> And man he <hi>moveth</hi> as man, he <hi>Ruleth</hi> him by Moral Laws as man; and he is his perfect Lo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er, and perfect amiable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and <hi>End.</hi> As our Creator making us in this natural ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and Relation; as our Redeemer reſtoring and advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to bleſſed Union with himſelf; and as our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier and Glorifier preparing us for, and bringing us to Coeleſtial perfection. And thus muſt God be conceived of that we may love him: And falſe and defective conceptions of him, as the great impediments of our love: And we <hi>love</hi> him ſo little, (much) becauſe we ſo little know him: And therefore it is not the true knowledge of God, which <hi>Paul</hi> here maketh a competitor with love.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And as we <hi>know</hi> God by <hi>aſcending</hi> from his Works and Image, in the ſame <hi>order</hi> muſt <hi>our love</hi> aſcend. The <hi>firſt acts</hi> of it will be towards God in his <hi>works,</hi> and the next will be towards God in his Relation to us, and the higheſt towards God as Eſſentially perfect and amiable in himſelf.</p>
               <p>I will therefore now apply this to the Soul that feareth leſt he <hi>love not God,</hi> becauſe he perceiveth not himſelf either to <hi>know or love</hi> him immediately in the perfection of his Eſſence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Do you truely love the <hi>Image</hi> of God on the Soul of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:55434:169"/>
Man? That is, a Heavenly Life, and <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Love?</hi> Do you not only from bare conviction <hi>commend,</hi> but <hi>truly love</hi> a Soul devoted to God, full of his love, and living in obedience to his Laws, and doing good to others according to his power? This is to love God in his Image! God is Infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, or <hi>Love</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To love true <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> as ſuch is to love God in his Works.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially with theſe two qualifications; 1. Do you love to have <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> as <hi>Univerſal</hi> as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible? Do you long to have Families, Cities, Kingdoms and all the World, made truly <hi>Holy, Wiſe and</hi> united in Love to one another? The moſt <hi>Univerſal Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is moſt like to God: and to love this is to love God in his Image.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do you love <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in your ſelves, and not in others only? Do you long to be liker to God in your capacity, and more near him and united to him? That is, Do you long to know him, and his will more clearly and to enjoy a holy communion with him and his holy ones in the fulleſt mutual love, (loving and being beloved) and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light your Souls in his joyful praiſes, in the communion of Saints? This is certainly the love of God. Our union is by love; he that would be united to God and his Saints in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that would fain know him more, and love him better, and praiſe and obey him joyfully in perfection, doth undoubtedly love him.</p>
               <p>And here I would earneſtly caution you againſt two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deceits of men by counterfeit love. I. Some think that they love God ſavingly becauſe they love him as the God of <hi>Nature,</hi> and cauſe of all the <hi>Natural Being, Order and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> which is in the whole frame of Heaven and Earth; This is to love <hi>ſomewhat of God,</hi> or to love him <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> in <hi>one reſpect</hi>: But if they love him not alſo as he is the <hi>Wiſe and Holy, and Righteous Ruler of Mankind,</hi> and as he requireth,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:55434:169"/>
                  <hi>us to be holy,</hi> and would <hi>make us holy,</hi> and love not to <hi>pleaſe</hi> his <hi>Governing will,</hi> they love him not as God with a ſaving love. I have elſewhere mentioned the ſaying of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> (after Pope) in his <hi>Quodlib.</hi> that an unholy perſon may not only love God as he is the glorious cauſe of the World and natural good, but may rather chooſe to be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf annihilated, and be no man, than that there ſhould be no God, were it a thing that could be made the matter of his choice: And indeed I dare not ſay that every man is holy who had rather be annihilated than one Kingdom ſhould be annihilated, when many Heathens would die to ſave their Countrey or their Prince; much leſs dare I ſay that all ſhall be ſaved that had rather be annihilated than there ſhould be no world, or be no God: But (ſaith the foreſaid Schoolman) it is the love of God as <hi>our holy Governour,</hi> and a love of his <hi>holy will,</hi> and of <hi>our conformity</hi> thereto, that is ſaving love.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And I fear that no ſmall number do deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in thinking that they love <hi>Holineſs</hi> as the <hi>Image</hi> of God in themſelves and others, when they underſtand not truly what Holineſs is, but take ſomething for it that is not it. <hi>Holineſs</hi> is this <hi>Uniting love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> of <hi>more perfect Union!</hi> To love <hi>Holineſs,</hi> is to love this love it ſelf; to love all of God that is in the World, and to deſire that all men may be united in holy love to God and one another, and live in his praiſe and the obedience of his will. But I fear too many take up ſome opinions that are ſtricter than other mens, and call ſome things <hi>Sin</hi> which others do not, and get a high eſteem of ſome particular Church order, and form of manner of worſhiping God, which is not of the eſſence or holineſs, and then they take themſelves for a holy people, and other men for prophane and looſe, and ſo they love their own Societies, for this which they miſtake for holineſs; and inſtead of that unite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love which is holineſs indeed, they grow into a factious
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:55434:170"/>
enmity to others, reproaching them as rejoicing in their hurt as taking them for the enemies of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as God muſt be loved in his Image on his ſervants, ſo muſt he in his Image on his <hi>word.</hi> Do you love the <hi>holy Laws</hi> of God, as they expreſs that holy <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> which is his perfection? Do you love them as they would rule the World in Holineſs, and bring mankind to true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and mutual love? Do you love this word as it would make <hi>you Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi>; and therefore love it moſt when you <hi>uſe</hi> it moſt, in reading, hearing, meditation and practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſurely to love the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> of Gods Laws and Promiſes, is to love God in his Image there imprinted, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in that Glaſs where he hath purpoſely ſhewed us that of himſelf which we muſt love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But no where is Gods Image ſo refulgent to us, as in his Son our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: In him therefore muſt God be loved: Though we never ſaw him, yet what he was, even the holy Son of God, ſeparate from ſinners, the Goſpel doth make known to us: as alſo what wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous love he hath manifeſted to loſt mankind! In him are all the treaſures of Wiſdom and Goodneſs: both an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and a doctrine and law of wiſdom, holineſs and peace he hath given to the World: In this Goſpel, Faith ſeeth him, yea ſeeth him as now Glorified in Heaven, and made Head over all things to the Church; the King of love, the great high Prieſt of love, the Teacher of love, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of the Fathers perſon: Are the thoughts of this glorious Image of God now pleaſing to you, and is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, holineſs and love of Chriſt now amiable to you in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving? If ſo, you Love God in his bleſſed Son. And as he that hath ſeen the Son hath ſeen the Father, ſo he that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Son loveth the Father alſo.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet further, the glory of God <hi>will</hi> ſhine moſt clearly in the Celeſtial glorified Church, containing Chriſt and all the bleſſed Angels and Saints who ſhall for ever ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:55434:170"/>
of God and Love, obey and praiſe him, in perfect Unity, Harmony and Fervency! You ſee not this heavenly Society and Glory, but the Goſpel revealeth it, and Faith believeth it: Doth not this bleſſed Society and their holy work, ſeem to you the moſt lovely in all the world? Is it not pleaſing to you to think in what perfect joy and concord they love and magnify God, without all ſinful ignorance, diſaffection, dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſcord or any other culpable imperfection? I ask not only whether your opinion will make you ſay that <hi>this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and State is beſt</hi>? but whether you do not ſo really eſteem it as that it hath the pleaſing <hi>deſires</hi> of your Souls? Would you not fain be one of them and be united to them, and joyn in their perfect Love and Praiſe? If ſo, this is to Love God in that moſt glorious appearance where he will ſhew forth himſelf to man to be beloved.</p>
               <p>But here true believers may be ſtopt with doubting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are unwilling to <hi>die,</hi> and till we die this glory is not ſeen. But it's one thing to love Heaven and God there manifeſted, and another thing to love <hi>death</hi> which ſtandeth in the way. Nature teacheth us to loath death as death, and to deſire, if it might be, that this Cup might paſs by us? Though faith make it leſs dreadful, becauſe of the bleſſed State that followeth: But he that loveth not blood-letting or Phyſick, may love health. It is not <hi>death,</hi> but God and the heavenly perfection in glory which we are called to Love. What if you could come to this glory, without dying as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> did, would you not be willing to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p n="5">5. And he that loveth God in all theſe his appearances to man, in his works and Image on his Saints, in the wiſdom, holineſs and goodneſs of his word, in the wiſdom, love and holineſs of his Son, and in the perfection of his glory in the heavenly Society, doth certainly alſo love him in the higheſt reſpect, even as he is himſelf that bleſſed eſſence, that perfect greatneſs, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, or Life, Light and Love,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:55434:171"/>
which is the beginning and end of all things, and the moſt amiable object of all illuminated minds, and of every Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied will, and of all our harmonious praiſe for ever. For whatever become of that diſpute, whether we ſhall ſee Gods eſſence in itſelf, as diſtinct from all created glory, (the word <hi>ſeeing</hi> being here ambiguous) it is ſure that we can even now have abſtracting thoughts of the Eſſence of God as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from all creatures, and our knowledge of him then will be far more perfect.</p>
               <p>It ſhould be moſt pleaſant to every believer to think that <hi>GOD IS</hi>; Even that ſuch a perfect glorious being is exiſtent: As if we heard of one man in another land whom we were never like to ſee, who in wiſdom, love, and all perfections excelled all men that ever were in the world, the thoughts of that man would be pleaſing to us, and we ſhould love him becauſe he is amiable in his excellency. And ſo doth the holy Soul when it thinketh of the infinite amiableneſs of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the higheſt Love of the Soul to God, is in taking in all his amiableneſs together, and when we think of him as related to our ſelves, as our Creater, Redeemer, Sanctifier and Glorifier, and as related to all his Church and to all the world, as the cauſe and end of all that is amiable, and when we think of all thoſe amiable works which theſe Relations do reſpect, his Creation and Conſervation of the whole world, his Redemption of mankind, his Sanctifying and Glorifying of all his choſen ones, his wonderful mercies to our ſelves for Soul and Body, his mercies to his Church on earth, his unconceivable mercies to the glorified Church in Heaven, the Glory of Chriſt, Angels and Men, and their perfect Knowledge Love, and joyful praiſes, and then think what that God is in himſelf that doth all this? This Complexion of conſiderations cauſeth the fulleſt Love to God. And though unlearned perſons cannot ſpeak or think of all theſe diſtinctly and clearly as the Scripture doth
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55434:171"/>
expreſs them, yet all this is truly the Object of their Love, though with confuſion of their apprehenſions of it.</p>
               <p>But I have not yet done, nor indeed come up to the point of tryal. It is not every kind or degree of Love to God in theſe reſpects that will prove to be ſaving. He is mad that thinks there is no God: And he that believeth that there is a God doth believe that he is moſt powerful, wiſe and good, and therefore muſt needs have ſome kind of Love to him. And I find that there are a ſort of Deiſts or Infidels now ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up among us, who are confident,
<q>That all, or almoſt all men ſhall be ſaved, becauſe ſay they, all men do love God. It is not poſſible ſay they that a man can believe God to be God, that is, to be the <hi>Beſt,</hi> and to be love itſelf, and the cauſe of all that is good and amiable in Heaven and Earth, and yet not love him: The will is not ſo contrary to the underſtanding, nor can be. And ſay the ſame men, he that loveth his neighbour, loveth God; for it is for his goodneſs that he loveth his Neighbour, and that goodneſs is Gods goodneſs appearing in man: He that loveth Sun and Moon, and Stars, Meat and Drink, and pleaſure loveth God, for all this is Gods goodneſs in his works; and out of his works he is unknown to us; and therefore they ſay, that all men Love God, and all men ſhall be ſaved, or at leaſt all that love their Neighbours; for God by is us no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to be loved.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For anſwer to theſe men, 1. It is falſe that God is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to be loved than as in our Neighbour: I have told you before undeniably of ſeveral other reſpects or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of God, in which he is to be loved: And he that is not known to us as <hi>ſeparate</hi> from all Creatures, is yet known to us as <hi>diſtinct</hi> from all Creatures, and is, and muſt be ſo loved by us: Elſe we are Idolaters if we ſuppoſe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be God themſelves, and love, and honour them as God: Even thoſe Philoſophers that took God for the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Soul of the World, yet diſtinguiſhed him from the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55434:172"/>
World which they thought he animated, (and indeed doth more than animate.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it is falſe that every one loveth God who loveth his Neighbour, or his Meat, Drink and fleſhly Pleaſure, or any of the accommodations of his ſenſe. For Nature cauſeth all men to love life, and ſelf, and pleaſure for themſelves: And theſe are beloved even by Atheiſts that believe not that there is a God! And conſequently ſuch men love their Neighbours not for God, but for <hi>themſelves,</hi> either becauſe they are <hi>like them,</hi> or becauſe they pleaſe them, or ſerve their intereſt, or delight them by ſociety and converſe, as Birds and Beaſts do love each other that think not of a God. And if all ſhould be ſaved that ſo love one another, or that love their own pleaſure, and that which ſerveth it, not only all wicked men, but moſt Brute Creatures ſhould be ſaved. If you ſay, they <hi>ſhall not be damned,</hi> it's true, becauſe they are not Moral Agents, capable of Salvation or Damnation, nor capable of Moral Government and Obedience; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore even the Creatures that kill one another are not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for it: But certainly as man is capable of Salvation or Damnation, ſo is he of ſomewhat more as the means or way, than Brutes are capable of, and he is ſaved or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ſomewhat which Brutes never do. Many a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand love the pleaſure of their ſenſe, and all things and perſons which promote it, that never think of God or love him. And it is not enough to ſay that even this <hi>natural good</hi> is of God, and therefore it is God in it which they love; for it will only follow that it is ſomething made and given by God which they love, while they leave out God himſelf. That God is Eſſentially in all things good and pleaſant which they love, doth not prove that it is God which they love, while their thoughts and affections, do not include him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſe it were ſo that to love the Creature were to love God, is not then the <hi>hating</hi> of the <hi>Creature</hi> the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:55434:172"/>
of God? If thoſe ſame men that love Meat and Drink, and ſenſual Delight, and love their Neighbours for the ſake of theſe, or for themſelves, as a Dog doth love his Maſter, do alſo hate the holineſs of Gods Servants, and the holineſs and juſtice of his Word and Government, and that holineſs and order of Heart and Life which he commandeth them, do not theſe men hate God in hating theſe? And that they hate them, their obſtinate averſation ſheweth, when no reaſon, no mercy, no means, can reconcile their Hearts and Lives thereto.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I therefore ask the Infidel Objector, whether he ſhall be ſaved that loveth God in one reſpect, and hateth him in another? That loveth him as he cauſeth the Sun to ſhine, the Rain to fall, the Graſs to grow, and giveth Life and Proſperity to the World, but hateth him as he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of thoſe Laws, and Duties, and that holy Government, by which he would bring them to a voluntary right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and make them holy, and fit for Glory, and would uſe them in his holy Service, and reſtrain them from their inordinate Luſts and Wills? How can <hi>love</hi> prepare or fit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man for that which he hateth or doth not love: If the love of fleſhly intereſt and pleaſure prepare or fit them to ſeek that, and to enjoy it, (the little time that it will endure) how ſhould this love make them fit for Heaven, for a Life of holineſs with God and Saints? It is this that they <hi>love not,</hi> and will <hi>not love,</hi> (for if they truely loved it they ſhould have it;) yea, it is this that they hate, and will not accept or be perſwaded to. And what a fond conceit then is it to think that they ſhall have Heaven that never loved it, no nor the ſmall beginnings here of the Heavenly Nature and Life, and all becauſe they loved the pleaſures of the Fleſh on Earth, and loved God and their Neighbours for promoting it?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yea, I would ask the Infidel, whether God will ſave men for rebelling againſt him? Their love to their Fleſh and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55434:173"/>
to the Creature, as it is inordinate, and taketh Gods place, and ſhutteth out the <hi>love</hi> of Holineſs and Heaven, is their great Sin and Idolatry? And ſhall this be called a ſaving love of God? What groſs ſelf-deceit hath ſenſuality taught theſe men?</p>
               <p n="6">6. I grant them therefore that all men that believe that there is a God, do love ſomewhat of God, or <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> or in ſome partial reſpect have ſome kind of love to God. But it is not a love to that of God, which muſt ſave, felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and glorifie Souls: Meat and Drink, and fleſhly Sports do not this; but Heavenly Glory, Wiſdom, Holineſs and Love to God, and Man for God, and this they love not, and therefore never ſhall enjoy: Nay, that of God which ſhould ſave and felicitate them they hate, and hated holineſs is none of theirs, nor ever can be, till they are changed. And ſo much to the Infidels Objection.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I add therefore in the laſt place to help men in the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of their love to God, that their love muſt have theſe two qualifications.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They muſt love that of God which maketh man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and is indeed the end of his Nature, and Sanctification; And that is, not only the comforts of this tranſitory natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life and Fleſh, but the fore deſcribed Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, in perfect knowledge, love and praiſe. 2. This love to God muſt be predominant, and prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the power of alluring objects, which Satan would uſe to turn our Hearts from him, and to keep out holy Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly love. Damning ſin conſiſteth in loving ſomewhat that is good and lovely, and that is of God; but it is not <hi>ſimply in loving it,</hi> but in loving it <hi>inordinately,</hi> inſtead of God or greater things, and out of its due time and rank, and meaſure, and ſo as to hinder that love which is our holineſs and happineſs. Moral Good conſiſteth not in meer <hi>Entity,</hi> but in <hi>Order</hi>; and <hi>diſorderly Love</hi> even of real good is ſinful Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:55434:173"/>Therefore when all is ſaid, the old mark which I have many and many times repeated, is it that muſt try the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of your love;
<q>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> If 1. <hi>in the eſteem</hi> of a <hi>believing mind,</hi> 2. And in the <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>adherence of a reſolved will,</hi> 3. And in the careful, ſerious endeavours of your lives, you prefer the <hi>knowing, loving,</hi> obeying and joyful praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, begun here and perfected in Glory, as the benefit of our Redemption by Chriſt, before all the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of this fleſhly life, the pleaſures, profits and honours of this World, that is, before the pleaſures of ſin and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality for this tranſitory Seaſon.</q>
Or in Chriſts words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. If you SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD, AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS, and truſt him to ſuperadd all other things. This is that love of God and goodneſs which muſt ſave us: And he that loveth God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in theſe high reſpects, a little, and loveth his fleſhly pleaſure ſo much more, as that he will not conſent to the regulating of his Luſts, but will rather venture or let go his Salvation than his ſins, hath no true ſaving love to God.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>There is ſcarce any Fornicator, Drunkard, Glutton, Swearer, or other raſh and ſenſual ſinner, but believeth that God is better than the creature, and that it were better for him to live to God in love and holineſs, than to live in ſinful pleaſures: and therefore though he live in ſin againſt this knowledge, it ſeemeth that with the rational will he loveth God and Goodneſs beſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he judgeth them beſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is one thing, <hi>what the judgment ſaith</hi>; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing, <hi>how it ſaith it.</hi> A ſpeculative judgment may drowſily ſay, that <hi>God and Holineſs are beſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> when yet it ſaith it but as a dreaming opinion, which prevaileth not with the <hi>will</hi> to chooſe them, having at the ſame time ſo ſtrong an apprehenſion of the pleaſures of ſin as carryeth away the will and practice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is one thing therefore to love God under the notion
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:55434:174"/>
of <hi>being beſt,</hi> and another thing to <hi>love him beſt.</hi> For the will can croſs ſuch a notion of the underſtanding; at leaſt by an omiſſion, as appeareth by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the will (or elſe had been neceſſitated.) The ſame underſtanding which ſluggiſhly ſaith, <hi>God or Holineſs is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> yet may more clearly and vehemently ſay <hi>[Luſt is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, or Pleaſure of the fleſh is good]</hi> and being herein ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſtrong apprehenſions of <hi>ſenſe</hi> and fantaſie, the will may follow this ſimple judgment, and neglect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is one thing for the underſtanding to ſay, that <hi>God is more amiable to one that hath a heart to love him, and a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpoſition</hi>; and another thing to ſay, <hi>he is now more amiable to me:</hi> thoſe can ſay the firſt, that cannot truly ſay the latter, and therefore love not God as beſt, and above all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is one thing for the underſtanding ſometimes under conviction to ſay, <hi>God and Holineſs are beſt for me, and I ought to love them beſt,</hi> and then to lay by the <hi>exerciſe of this judgment in the ordinary courſe of life,</hi> (though it be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted) and to live in the continual apprehenſion of the goodneſs of ſenſual pleaſure; and another thing to keep the judgment that <hi>God and Holineſs are beſt,</hi> in ordinary <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.</hi> For the will doth not always follow the judgment that we <hi>had before,</hi> but that which we have at preſent: and that which we <hi>exerciſe not,</hi> we <hi>have not</hi> at that time in act: and it is not a meer <hi>power</hi> or <hi>habit</hi> of knowledge which rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>will,</hi> but the <hi>preſent act.</hi> Many a man is ſaid to <hi>know</hi> that which he doth not <hi>think of,</hi> when indeed he doth <hi>not know it at</hi> that <hi>time,</hi> but only <hi>would know it if he thought of it:</hi> As a man in his ſleep is ſaid to know what he knew awake, when indeed he knoweth it not actually till he be awake.</p>

for that will command the moſt frequent acts: but I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to the conſideration of the judicious, whether an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>habit</hi> of drowſy <hi>knowledge,</hi> or <hi>belief that God and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are beſt,</hi> may not be ordinarily kept out of act, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with a prevailing habit of ſenſuality or love of forbidden pleaſure in the will, and with a privation of prevalent habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love to God and Holineſs. I ſuppoſe with moſt ſuch ſinners this is the true caſe: the underſtanding ſaid lately, <hi>It is beſt for thee</hi> to <hi>love God, and live to him,</hi> and <hi>deny thy luſt:</hi> And it oft forgetteth this, while it ſtill ſaith with ſenſe, that fleſhly pleaſure is deſireable: and at other times it ſaith, Though God be beſt, <hi>thou maiſt venture at the preſent on this pleaſure</hi>; and ſo lets looſe the corrupted will, reſerving a purpoſe to repent hereafter, as apprehending moſt ſtrongly at the preſent, that juſt now ſenſual delight may be choſen, though <hi>holineſs</hi> will be beſt hereafter.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But if a habit will not prove that we ſincerely love and prefer God, how ſhall any man know that he loveth and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him, when the beſt oft ſin; and in the act of ſin God is not actually preferred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I told you that a habit of true love will prove ſincerity, though not a habit of <hi>true opinion</hi> or <hi>belief,</hi> which is not brought into lively and ordinary act: uneffectual faith may be habitual. Yea ſuch an uneffectual counterfeit half love, which I before deſcribed to you, may be habitual, and yet neither act nor habit ſaving.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sins of godly men are not prevalent abſolutely againſt the <hi>being, operation</hi> or <hi>effects of the love of God and Holineſs</hi>; For even when they ſin, theſe live, and are predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in all other things, and in the main bent and courſe of life; but only they prevail againſt ſome <hi>Degree</hi> of holy <hi>love,</hi> perhaps both in the act and habit for ſuch ſins are not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs,</hi> but <hi>imperfection</hi> of <hi>godlineſs</hi> and the <hi>effects</hi> of that <hi>imperfection.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. When godly men fall into a great extraordinary ſin,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55434:175"/>
it is not to be expected that they ſhould comfortably diſcern the ſincerity of their love to God either by that ſin, or in that ſin; but they may diſcern it, 1. By the <hi>courſe</hi> of a godly life, where the prevalency of the habit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the power and ſtream of acts; and 2. By their <hi>Repentance</hi> for, and abhorring and forſaking of that ſin, which ſtopt and darkened their love to God. And theſe two together <hi>viz, A reſolved courſe of living unto God,</hi> and <hi>Repentance and Hatred of every ſin which is againſt it, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of greater ſins,</hi> will ſhew the ſincerity and power of holy love.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But then one that ſinneth daily,</hi> e. g. <hi>by paſſion, or too much love to the World, or creatures, and by omiſſions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall never be ſure that he ſincerely loveth God, becauſe this is a courſe of ſin, and he cannot have ſuch aſſurance till he forſake it.</hi>

The <hi>Paſſion</hi> of <hi>fear</hi> or of <hi>anger,</hi> or of <hi>ſorrow</hi> may be inordinate, and yet God lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beſt, becauſe the will hath ſo weak a power over them, that a man that is guilty of them may truly ſay, I would fain be delivered from them. And ſome inordinate love of life, health, wealth, friends, honour, may ſtand with a more prevailing love of God, and the prevalency be well perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But what <hi>greater</hi> actual ſin (as <hi>Noahs</hi> or <hi>Lots</hi> Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery and Murder, <hi>Peters</hi> denial of Chriſt) are or are not conſiſtent with true love to God, is a caſe that I have elſewhere largely handled, and is unmeet for a ſhort deciſion here.</p>

               <p>And many a Chriſtian miſtaketh his affection to the thing it ſelf, becauſe of his ſtrangeneſs to the place and to the change that death will make. If the weakeſt Chriſtian could have without dying, the clear knowledge of God, the communion of Faith and Love by his Spirit; could he love God but as much as he would love him, and anſwerably taſt his love, in every prayer, in every promiſe, in every Sacrament, in every mercy; could his Soul keep a continual ſabbath of delight in God, and in his Saints and Holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, this ſeemeth to him more deſireable and pleaſing than all the treaſures of the World.

have not his Light and Preſence, how forlorn, Erroneous and Comfortleſs wilt thou be? He knoweth thy <hi>heart,</hi> and knoweth thy Enemies, Temptations and Dangers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beſt knoweth how to guide thee, and what to put into his Laws and into thy duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He <hi>knoweth</hi> what <hi>place,</hi> what ſtate of Life, of Health, of Wealth, of Friends, is beſt for thee. None of theſe are known to thee: He knoweth whether eaſe or pain be beſt: The fleſh is no fit judge, nor an ignorant mind: That is beſt which will prove beſt at laſt; Which he that foreknoweth all events knoweth. That therefore is beſt which infinite Wiſdom and Love doth chooſe. Eaſe and Pain will have their end: It is the end that muſt teach us how to eſtimate them: And who but God can foretell thee the end?</p>
               <p>He knoweth whether Liberty or Impriſonment be beſt: Liberty is a Priſon if ſin prevail, and God be not there. A Priſon is a Pallace if God by his Love will dwell there with us. There is no thraldom but ſin and Gods diſpleaſure, and no true liberty but his Love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He knoweth whether Honour or Diſhonour be beſt for thee: If the eſteem of men may facilitate their reception of the ſaving truth of God which is preached to them, God will procure it if he have work to do by it: If not, how little is it to be regarded? What doth it add to me to be highly eſteemed or applauded by men, who are haſting to the duſt, where their thoughts of me and all the world are at an end? When I ſee the Skulls of the dead who perhaps once knew me, how little doth it now concern me what thoughts of me were once within that Skull? And as for the immortal Soul, if it be in the world of light, it judgeth as God judgeth by his Light: If in hell, I have no more cauſe to be troubled at their malice than at the devils? And I have little cauſe to rejoyce that thoſe damned Souls did once applaud me.</p>
               <p>Oh miſerable men that have no better than the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:55434:177"/>
reward, to be ſeen and honoured of men! Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is the felicitating honour! He will own all in me that is his own, and all that he owneth is everlaſtingly honoured. <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the Righteous, Pſal.</hi> 1.6. For it is his way: The way which he preſcribed them, and in which he did Conduct them. Good and evil are now ſo mixed in me, that it is hard for me fully to diſcern them: But the all-ſeeing God doth diſcern them) and will ſeparate them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thy Heavenly Father knoweth whether it be beſt for thee to abound or want: And with what meaſure of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things it is fitteſt for thee to be entruſted! Abundance hath abundant ſnares and cares, and troubling employments which divert our thoughts from things of real and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual worth: Proviſion is deſirable according to its uſefulneſs to our work and end: It is far better to need little and have <hi>little,</hi> than to have much and need it all: For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be got, or kept, or uſed, without ſome troubleſome and hurtful effects of its vanity and vexation. Let the fooliſh deſire to be tired and burdened with Proviſion, and loſe the prize by turning their helps into a ſnare, and miſs of the end by over-loving the way: My Father knoweth what I want, and he is always able to ſupply me with a word: It doth not impoveriſh him to maintain all the World. His ſtore is not diminiſhed by Communication. The Lord is my Shepherd, what then can I need? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1. How oft have I found that he careth for me, and that it is better to be at his finding and proviſion, than to have been my own Carver, and to have cared for my ſelf? Bleſſed be my bounteous Father who hath brought me ſo near to the end of my Race, with very <hi>little care</hi> for proviſion in my way, and with <hi>leſſer want!</hi> Neceſſaries I never wanted, and ſuperfluities are not wanted. Bleſſed be that wiſe and gracious Lord, that hath not given me up to greedy deſires; nor enſnared and burdened me with
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:55434:178"/>
needleſs plenty. How ſafe, how eaſie and comfortable a life is it, to live in the Family of ſuch a Father, and with a thankful careleſneſs to truſt his will, and take that porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as beſt which he provideth for us? And into what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery do fooliſh Prodigals run, who had rather have their portion in their own hand, than in their Fathers?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thy heavenly <hi>Father knoweth</hi> with what kind and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Tryals and Temptations it is fit that thou ſhouldſt be exerciſed! It is his work to permit and bound, and order them: It is thy work to beg his grace to overcome them, and watchfully and conſtantly to make reſiſtance, and in Tryal to approve thy faithfulneſs to God: <hi>Bleſſed are they that endure Temptations; for when they are tryed they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Crown of life, James</hi> 1. If he will try thee by bodily pain and ſickneſs, he can make it turn to the health of thy Soul: Perhaps thy diſeaſes have prevented ſome mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul-diſeaſes which thou didſt not fear. If he will try thee by mens malice, Injury or Perſecution, he knoweth how to turn it to thy good; and in ſeaſon to bring thee out of trouble: He will teach thee by other mens wickedneſs to know what grace hath cured or prevented in thy ſelf; and to know the need of truſting in God alone, and appealing to his deſireable Judgment: He that biddeth thee when thou art Reviled, and Perſecuted, and loaded with falſe reports for righteouſneſs ſake, to rejoyce and be exceeding glad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great reward in heaven, can eaſily give thee what he doth Command, and make thy ſufferings a help to this exceeding joy.</p>
               <p>If he will try thee by <hi>Satans moleſting Temptations,</hi> and ſuffer him to buffet thee, or break thy peace by Melancholy diſquietments and vexatious thoughts (from which he hath hitherto kept thee free) he doth but tell thee from how much greater evil he hath delivered thee, and make thy fears of Hell a means to prevent it, and call thee to thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to ſeek for ſafety and peace in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:55434:178"/>If it pleaſe him to permit the malicious tempter to urge thy thoughts to blaſphemy or other dreadful ſin (as it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily falleth out with the Melancholy,) it telleth thee from what malice grace preſerveth thee, and what <hi>Satan</hi> would do were he let looſe: It calleth thee to remember that thy Saviour himſelf was tempted by <hi>Satan</hi> to as great ſin as ever thou waſt, even to worſhip the Devil himſelf; And that he ſuffered him to carry about his body from place to place, which he never did by thee: It tells thee therefore that it is <hi>not ſin to</hi> be <hi>tempted</hi> to ſin, but to <hi>conſent</hi>; And that <hi>Satans</hi> ſin is not laid to our charge: And though our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is ſuch, as that we ſeldom are tempted but ſome culpable blot is left behind in us, (for we cannot ſay as Chriſt, that <hi>Satan</hi> hath nothing in us:) Yet no ſin is leſs dangerous to mans damnation, than the Melancholy thoughts which ſuch horrid vexatious Temptations cauſe; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the perſon being diſtempered by a diſeaſe, is not a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer in what he doth; and alſo becauſe he is ſo far from <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>deſiring</hi> ſuch kind of ſin, that it is the very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his life; They make him weary of himſelf, and he daily groaneth to be delivered from them. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that <hi>Love</hi> is the damning malignity of ſin; and that there is no more ſin than there is will; And that no ſin ſhall damn men which they had rather leave than keep; and therefore forgiveneſs is joyned to Repentance: Drunkards, Fornicators, Worldlings, Ambitious men, love their ſin: But a poor Melancholy Soul that is tempted to ill thoughts, or to deſpair, or terrour, or to exceſſive griefs, is far from loving ſuch a ſtate. The caſe of ſuch is ſad at preſent: But O how much ſadder is the caſe of them that are Lovers of pleaſure more than of God, and proſper and delight in ſin.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God knoweth <hi>how long</hi> it is beſt for me to <hi>live.</hi> Leave then the determination of the time to him; All men come into the word, on the condition of going out again: Die
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55434:179"/>
we muſt; and is it not fitter that God chooſe the time than we? Were it left to our wills how long we ſhould live on Earth, alas how long ſhould many of us be kept out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by our own deſires? And too many would ſtay here till miſery made them impatient of living. But our lives are his gift, and in his hand, who knoweth the uſe of them, and knoweth how to proportion them to that uſe; which is the juſteſt meaſure of them. He choſe the time and place of my birth, and he chuſeth beſt: Why ſhould I not willingly leave to his choice alſo, the time and place, and manner of my departure. I am <hi>known of him</hi>; and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns are not deſpiſed by him. He knoweth me as his own, and as his own he hath uſed me, and as his own he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.18. <hi>The Lord knoweth the days of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and their inheritance ſhall be for ever.</hi> And if he bring me to death through long and painful ſickneſs, he knoweth why, and all ſhall end in my Salvation. <hi>He knoweth the way that is with me, and when he hath tryed me, I ſhall come forth as Gold, Job</hi> 23.10. He forſaketh us not in ſickneſs or in death. <hi>[Like as a Father pityeth his Children, the Lord pityeth them that fear him; For he knoweth our frame, he remembreth that we are duſt: As for man his days are as graſs; as a flower of the Field, ſo he flouriſheth: For the wind paſſeth over it, and it is not, and the place thereof ſhall know it no more: But the mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to them that fear him.]</hi> If the Ox ſhould not know his owner, nor the Aſs his Maſters Crib, the owner will know his own and ſeek them. That we <hi>underſtand and know the Lord,</hi> is matter of greater joy and glorying, than all other wiſdom or riches in the world, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.24. But that he <hi>knoweth us</hi> in Life and Death, on Earth and in Heaven, is the top of our rejoycing. <hi>The Lord is good, and ſtrength in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that truſt in him, Nah.</hi> 1.7. Sickneſs may ſo change my fleſh that even my Neighbours ſhall not <hi>KNOW ME</hi>; and Death will make
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55434:179"/>
the change ſo great, that even my friends will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſee ſuch an unpleaſing, loathſome ſpectacle: But while I am carried by them to the place of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I may not be an annoyance to the living, I ſhall be there in the ſight of God, and my Bones and Duſt ſhall be owned by him, and none of them forgotten or loſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It may be that under the temptations of Satan, or in the languiſhing weakneſs or diſtempers of my fleſh, I may doubt of the love of God, and think that he hath withdrawn his mercy from me; or at leaſt may be unmeet to taſt the ſweetneſs of his love, or to meditate on his truth and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: But God will not loſe his knowledge of me, nor turn away his mercy from me. <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord knoweth them that are his, and let him that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. He can call me his <hi>Child,</hi> when I doubt whether I may call him Father: He doubteth not of his right to me, nor of his graces in me, when I doubt of my ſincerity and part in him. <hi>Known unto God are all his works, Act.</hi> 15.18. What meaneth Paul thus to deſcribe a ſtate of grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Now after ye have known God, or rather are known of of God?</hi> but to notify to us, that though our <hi>knowledge</hi> of God be his grace in us, and our evidence of his love, and the beginning of life eternal, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3.) yet <hi>that we are loved and known of him</hi> is the firſt and laſt, the foundation and the perfection of our ſecurity and felicity. He knoweth his Sheep, and none ſhall take them out of his hand. When I cannot through pain or diſtemper remember him, or not with renewed Joy or Pleaſure, he will remember me, and delight to do me good, and to be my Salvation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And though the belief of the unſeen World be the principle by which I conquer this, yet are my conceptions of it lamentably dark: A Soul in fleſh, which acteth as the form of a body, is not furniſhed with ſuch images, helps,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:55434:180"/>
or light, by which it can have clear conceptions of the ſtate and operations of ſeparated Souls: But I <hi>am known of God,</hi> when my knowledge of him is dark and ſmall: And he knoweth whither it is that he will take me, &amp; what my ſtate and work ſhall be! He that is preparing a place for me with himſelf, is well acquainted with it and me: All Souls are his; and therefore all are known to him: He that is now the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> as being <hi>living</hi> with him while they are <hi>dead to us,</hi> will receive my departing Soul to them, and to himſelf, to be with Chriſt, which he hath inſtructed me to commend into his hands, and to deſire him to receive. He that is now making us <hi>living Stones</hi> for the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and his heavenly temple, doth know where every one of us ſhall be placed. And his <hi>knowledge</hi> muſt now be my ſatisfaction and my peace. Let unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſay, <hi>How doth God know? Pſal.</hi> 73.11. But ſhall I doubt whether he that made the Sun, be Father of lights, and whether he know his dwelling, and his continued works? <hi>Be ſtill</hi> O my Soul, <hi>and know that he is God, Pſal.</hi> 40.10. and when he hath guided thee by his counſel he will take thee to Glory; and in his Light thou ſhalt have Light: And though now <hi>it appear not</hi> (to ſight, but to Faith only) <hi>what we ſhall be</hi> yet we known that we ſhall ſee him as he is, and we ſhall appear with him in glory.</p>
               <p>And to be KNOWN of God undoubtedly includeth his PRACTICAL LOVE, which ſecureth our Salvation and all that tendeth thereunto. It is not meant of ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge only as he hath of all things, or of ſuch as he hath of the ungodly. And why ſhould it be hard to thee, O my Soul, to be perſwaded of the <hi>love</hi> of God?</p>
               <p>Is it ſtrange that he ſhould <hi>love thee</hi> who is <hi>Eſſential Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love:</hi> Any more than that the Sun ſhould ſhine upon thee, which ſhineth upon all capable recipient objects, though not upon the uncapable, which through interpoſing
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:55434:180"/>
things cannot receive it? To believe that <hi>Satan or wicked men, or deadly Enemies</hi> ſhould love me, is hard: But to believe that the God of love doth love me, ſhould in reaſon be much eaſier than to believe that my Father or Mother, or deareſt friend in the World doth love me: If I do not <hi>make and continue my ſelf uncapable</hi> of his complacence by my wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful continued refuſing of his grace, it is not poſſible that I ſhould be deprived of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I love them that love me.</hi> Pſal. 146.8. <hi>The Lord loveth the righteous.</hi> John 16.27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why ſhould it be hard to thee to believe that he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee, who doth good ſo univerſally to the World, and by his love doth preſerve the whole Creation, and give all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures all the good which they poſſeſs? When his mercy is over all his works, and his Goodneſs is equal to his wiſdom and his power, and all the World is beautified by it, ſhall I not eaſily believe that it will extend to me? <hi>The Lord</hi> is good <hi>to all,</hi> Pſal. 145.9. Luk. 18.19. <hi>None is good</hi> (<hi>eſſentially, abſolutely</hi> and <hi>tranſcendently</hi>) but he alone, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.5. <hi>The Earth is full of the goodneſs of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 52.1. <hi>The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God endureth continually:</hi> He is good and doth good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.68. And ſhall I not expect good from ſo good a God, the cauſe of all the good that is in the World?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why ſhould I not believe that he will love me, who ſo far loved the <hi>World,</hi> yea his Enemies, as to give his only begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life? <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. Having given me ſo precious a gift as his Son, will he think any thing too good to give me? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. yea ſtill he followeth his Enemies with his mercies, not leaving himſelf without witneſs to them, but filling their hearts with food and gladneſs, and cauſing his Sun to ſhine on them, and his Rain to fall on them, and by his goodneſs leading them to repentance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why ſhould I not eaſily believe his love, which he hath ſealed by that certain gift of <hi>love, the Spirit</hi> of Chriſt
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:55434:181"/>
which he hath given? The giving of the Holy Ghoſt is the ſhedding abroad of his love upon the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. I had never known, deſired, loved, or ſerved him ſincerely but by that Spirit: And will he deny his name, his mark, his ſeal, his Pledge, and Earneſt of Eternal life? Could I ever have truly loved Him, his Word, his Ways and Servants, but by the reflection of his love? ſhall I queſtion whether he love thoſe whom he hath cauſed to love him? When our love is the ſureſt gift and token of his love, ſhall I think that I can love him more than he loveth me, or be more willing to ſerve him than he is willing and ready to reward his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24. and 4.13.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Shall I not eaſily hope for good from him, who hath made ſuch a covenant of Grace with me in Chriſt? Who giveth me what his Son hath purchaſed, who accepteth me in his moſt beloved, as a member of his Son? Who hath bid me, <hi>ask</hi> and <hi>I ſhall have</hi>? And hath made to Godlineſs, the promiſe of this life and that to come, and will with-hold no good thing from them that walk uprightly? Will not ſuch a Goſpel, ſuch a Covenant, ſuch promiſes of love ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me that he loveth me, while I conſent unto his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant terms?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Shall I not eaſily believe that he <hi>will love</hi> me, who <hi>hath loved</hi> me while I was <hi>his Enemy,</hi> and called me home when I went aſtray, and mercifully received me when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned? Who hath given me a life full of precious mercies, and ſo many experiences of his love as I have had? Who hath ſo often ſignified his love to my Conſcience? So often heard my prayers in diſtreſs, and hath made all my life, notwithſtanding my ſins, a continual wonder of his mercies? O unthankful Soul, if all this will not perſuade thee of the love of him that gave it! I that can do little good to any one, yet have abundance of friends and hearers, who very eaſily believe that I would do them good, were it in my power,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:55434:181"/>
and never fear that I ſhould do them harm! And ſhall it be harder to me to think well of Infinite Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than for my neighbours to truſt me and think well of ſuch a wretch as I? What abundance of love-tokens have I yet to ſhew, which were ſent me from Heaven to perſwade me of my Fathers love and care.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Shall I not eaſily believe and truſt his love who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me eternal glory with his Son, &amp; with all his holy ones in Heaven? Who hath given me there a great Interceſſor to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Heaven for me, and me for it and there appeareth for me before God? Who hath already brought many millions of bleſſed Souls to that glory, who were once as bad and low as I am? And who hath given me already the Seal, the Pledge, the Earneſt and the Firſt-fruits of that Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Therefore, O my Soul, if men will not know thee, if thou were hated of all men for the cauſe of Chriſt and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; If thine uprightneſs be imputed to thee as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious crime; If thou be judged by the blind, malignant World, according to its gall and intereſt; If friends miſunderſtand thee; If Faction and every evil cauſe which thou diſowneſt, do revile thee, and riſe up againſt thee: It is enough, it is abſolutely enough, that <hi>thou art known of God</hi>: God is All; and All is nothing that is againſt him, or without him: If God be for thee who ſhall be againſt thee? How long hath he kept thee ſafe in the midſt of dangers? and given thee peace in the midſt of furious Rage and Wars? He hath known how to bring thee out of trouble, and to give thee tolerable eaſe, while thou haſt carried about thee night and day the uſual cauſes of continual torment! His loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better than life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. but thou haſt had a long unexpected life, through his loving kindneſs. In <hi>his favour is life, Pſal.</hi> 30. And life thou haſt had by and with his favour. Notwithſtanding thy ſin, while thou canſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:55434:182"/>
ſay, thou <hi>loveſt him,</hi> he hath promiſed that all ſhall work together for thy good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. And he hath long made good that promiſe: Only ask thy ſelf again and again as Chriſt did <hi>Peter,</hi> whether indeed thou <hi>love</hi> him? And then take his love as thy full, and ſure, and everlaſting portion; which will never fail thee, though fleſh and Heart do fail; For thou ſhalt <hi>dwell in God</hi> and <hi>God in thee</hi> for <hi>evermore</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.12, 15, 16. Amen.</p>
