            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter our appearance at the Seſſions at <hi>Kingston,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been Priſoners at the <hi>White Lion</hi> in <hi>Southwark</hi>
above nine weeks, we were indicted, <hi>for unlawfully
and tumultúouſly gathering and aſſembling our ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
by Force and Arms, &amp;c. under pretence of performing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worſhip, &amp;c.</hi> Which Indictment, <hi>Richard Onzlow</hi> (who
ſate Judge of the Seſſions) ſaid, was according to a Statute
made in the 35th year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (the late Act of
Parliament, made purpoſely againſt the Meetings of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
and others, being by them laid aſide) whereunto, although
moſt of us were willing to plead, and deſired a Tryal, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Innocency as to what was laid to our charge; which,
although it was at firſt, promiſed us; yet at laſt, would not be
granted us; but except we would give Bond to anſwer at the
next Quarter-Seſſions, we were to return to Priſon again, and
there to remain till that time: At length, through urgency
and importunity for a preſent Tryal, that Juſtice might not be
delayed (as it ought not to have been) the Seſſions was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
till the 28th day of the 8th month; and becauſe we
could not come under Bond for our appearance, contrary to
our Chriſtian Liberty and Conſciences, we were remanded to
Priſon till that time. So when we, to the number of thirty two
perſons, appeared before the Court, in the Seſſions-houſe at
<hi>Magarets-hill,</hi> on the 30th day of the ſame month, for Tryal;
the former Indictment (unto which, for not giving Bond to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to plead, were committed) was laid aſide, and another
Indictment was drawn up againſt us, and preſented to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103768:3"/>
Grand Jury upon the ſame Statute; the form whereof is as
followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Surrey.</hi> THe Jurors for our Lord the King do preſent upon
their Oath, that <hi>Arthur Fiſher,</hi> late of the Pariſh of
S. <hi>Olave,</hi> in the Burrough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi>
Yeoman; <hi>Nathaniel Robinſon</hi> of the ſame, Yeoman; <hi>John
Chandler</hi> of the ſame, Yeoman, and others, being wicked, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and ſeditious Sectaries, and diſloyal perſons, and above the
age of ſixteen years: who on the 29th day of <hi>June,</hi> in the year of
the Reign of our Lord <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, by the grace of God,
King of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth;
have obſtinately refuſed, and every one of them hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately
refuſed, to repair unto ſome Church, Chappel, or uſual
place of Common-Prayer, according to the Laws and Statutes of this
Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> in the like Caſe ſet forth and provided,
(after forty dayes, next after the end of the Seſſion of Parliament
begun and holden at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on the nineteenth day of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
in the year of the Reign of our Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> late Queen of
<hi>England,</hi> the thirty fifth, and there continued until the diſſolution
of the ſame, being the tenth day of <hi>April</hi> in the 35th year above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid)
To wit, on the third day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the year of the Reign
of the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> the fourteenth aboveſaid, in
the Pariſh of S. <hi>Olave</hi> aforeſaid, in the Burrough of <hi>Southwark</hi>
aforeſaid, in the County aforeſaid; of themſelves, did voluntarily
and unlawfully joyn in, and were preſent at an unlawful Aſſembly,
Conventicle, and Meeting at the ſaid Pariſh of S. <hi>Olave,</hi> in the
County aforeſaid, under colour and pretence of the exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
againſt the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in contempt of our ſaid Lord the King that now is, his Laws,
and to the evil and dangerous example of all others in the like caſe
offending, againſt the Peace of our ſaid Lord the King that now is,
his Crown and Dignity, and contrary to the form of the Statute in
this ſame caſe ſet forth and provided.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Indictment being read, it was replied, That this was
not the ſame Indictment with that at <hi>Kingston,</hi> unto which
we deſired to plead: <hi>Richard Onzlow</hi> anſwered, that they had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103768:3"/>
quaſhed or nulled that, and that they had power to quit one
Indictment, and to draw up another, if the former were not
ſufficient: Then it was required that we might be tryed by
the late Act of Parliament; Whereto he anſwered, They
might try us by what Act they would, that was in force. So,
after we ſaw their bad intent towards us, the Country was
bid to take notice, that there was another Indictment formed
againſt us at <hi>Kingston,</hi> to which, we pleaded, <hi>Not guilty;</hi>
and ſome (that is, ſix <hi>Baptiſts)</hi> were tryed and cleared by that;
which they perceiving, refuſed to try us according to their
Promiſe; but adjourned the Court, that ſo they might draw
up another, and that, for ought we knew, if ſome of us ſhould
be cleared by this, they would draw up another, that ſo they
might enſnare us: To which <hi>Richard Onzlow</hi> ſaid, we ſhould
all be tryed by this. Then it was deſired, that that Statute
might be read, to ſee whether it contained all the particulars
of this laſt Indictment: So then he cauſed but a part of the
Statute to be read, ſaying to the Clerk, it was enough: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
the penalty, and other particulars, were concealed from
the Priſoners, and from thoſe that were to be of the Jury.
Then it was openly declared, as a Teſtimony againſt that
wicked Law, that the Parliament that made that Act, did at
that time, take counſel againſt the Lord, and againſt his
Anointed. Alſo, that it was made in the time of ignorance,
when that people were newly ſtept out of Popery, but now
there was more knowledge. Alſo, by this, the Reader may
take notice, how unjuſtly and falſely the firſt Indictment was
framed on the ſame Statute, which mentions nothing of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuouſly
gathering and aſſembling together, or by Force
and Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or of performing Religious Worſhip.</p>
            <p>After this, we were urged to plead, <hi>guilty,</hi> or <hi>not guilty,</hi> to
the Indictment. Then one deſired a Copy of the Indictment,
and the Court promiſed it him; but inſtead of giving him the
Copy, they thruſt him out of the Court, becauſe he did not
plead <hi>guilty,</hi> or <hi>not guilty,</hi> before he had the Copy, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they promiſed it him, and ſo bad, <hi>take him Goaler;</hi>
and bad the Clerk to give the Copy to another, becauſe he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
it, it being in Latine. Then calling another, who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103768:4"/>
ſtanding in the fear and counſel of the Lord, not daring to
anſwer haſtily, they bad, <hi>take him Goaler.</hi> Theſe, with others,
to the number of <hi>ten,</hi> were violently haled out of the Court,
as taken (as they ſay) <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> or for guilty, and thereupon
were ſoon ſent back to Priſon again. The reſt of us, being
<hi>twenty two</hi> in number, knowing our ſelves to be moſt falſly
charged, were free to joyn iſſue, and plead, <hi>not guilty:</hi> Then
the Jury-men were called, who were men fit for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
yet were we hardly allowed the liberty of common Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors,
(as alſo the liberty that the Court allowed to the
ſix Baptiſed perſons at <hi>Kingston,</hi> as was re-minded to <hi>Richard
Onzlow)</hi> which is, to except againſt many perſons, without
ſhewing any cauſe; but we paſſed five, before we excepted
againſt any; and when we excepted againſt one, <hi>Richard Onz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
ſeemed to be offended, and ſaid, we muſt ſhew a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
cauſe, or elſe we ſhould not except againſt him; it was
anſwered, Where we ſaw envy and prejudice, or a light, vain
deportment in any man, it was a cauſe ſufficient; but he did
not like of ſuch a reaſon. Then another was excepted againſt,
which he would allow of, without ſhewing a reaſon: to which
it was anſwered, that that man was heard to ſay, <hi>that he hoped
ere long, that the</hi> Quakers <hi>ſhould be arraigned at the Bar, and be
baniſhed to ſome Land where there was nothing but Bears:</hi> at
which the Court made a great laughter, and the man was put
by: So, we made little more exception, ſeeing what manner
of perſons we were to chuſe out of. Then they were ſworn,
and two Witneſſes were called, who could but teſtifie at
moſt, that ſuch perſons, whoſe names were ſpecified in writing,
they took in ſuch a place met together, but that no words
were ſpoken. After this, we ſpake to particulars contained
in the Indictment, on this wiſe. Firſt, the Jury was bid
to take heed, how they did ſport or dally with holy things;
and that thoſe things which concerned their and our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
could not be denied, but to be <hi>holy things:</hi> and as a
man was not to ſport with the health of his Neighbour; ſo
not to ſport with the Liberty of, or Baniſhment of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
And whereas we were accuſed for <hi>wicked, dangerous,
and ſeditious Sectaries;</hi> that was not true: for we were not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103768:4"/>
wicked, becauſe we lived <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the
world;</hi> and that it was ſo, we appeal to themſelves: neither
were we ſeditious; for that was to be tumultuous; but we
were peaceable. And whereas we were charged, <hi>for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bear the Common-Prayer without any lawful cauſe, for one
month after the 29th of</hi> June <hi>laſt;</hi> we made it appear, that
there was none to hear if we would have come; for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Book
was not quite printed for ſeveral weeks after the
ſaid 29th of <hi>June,</hi> (yea, they made haſte to have it finiſhed
by that which is called <hi>Bartholmew-tide,</hi> which was the time
enjoyned by the late Act of Parliament, for the Prieſts to
reade it) Alſo, that it was the rigor of the Law, or <hi>ſummum
Jus,</hi> which was confeſſed by themſelves to be <hi>ſumma Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
or the greateſt wrong, for the Act to be in force againſt
as before the publiſhment thereof, as <hi>Rich. Onzlow</hi> ſaid, it
was, and would have it to be: whereby the Reader may take
notice, how like unto the blind and cruel Aegyptians, this
Court of Juſtice (ſo called) did act; who required their full
tale of Brick of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and yet would not allow them
Straw. They would have us alſo, to prove, that we had come
to hear Common-Prayer, they having no Witneſs to prove
the contrary, if it had been read; Whereto it was replyed,
That it was according to the Law of the Land, in all Criminal
Cauſes, for poſitive Evidence to be brought againſt the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
accuſed; which <hi>Rich. Onzlow</hi> could not poſitively deny:
wherefore he told the Jury afterwards, that he thought we muſt
prove we did come, becauſe the coming to Common-Prayer
did excuſe the meeting. But let the Reader know, that the
Judge of a Court is to declare the Law by a poſitive Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and according to knowledge, and not his own thoughts.
It was alſo inſiſted on the word, <hi>Heretique,</hi> that it was ſuch
a one, who after Conviction of his Error, wilfully took it up
and maintained it againſt the Truth; and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaid, <hi>ſuch a one was condemned in himſelf. Rich. Onzlow</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> off that, with the word <hi>Sectary,</hi> the word <hi>Heretique</hi> not
being in the Indictment, although in effect, it is both as one:
for that word which in the <hi>Acts,</hi> is rendred <hi>Sect,</hi> is <hi>'Aireſis,</hi>
or <hi>Hireſie.</hi> Then it was anſwered, that a <hi>Sectary</hi> is taken for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103768:5"/>
one that divided or ſeparated in contempt, which he did not
deny; but we did not ſeparate in contempt of any man. And
indeed Reader, if thou art not wilfully blind, thou canſt not
but conclude, that whatſoever is done in Conſcience to God,
is not done in obſtinacy or contempt. Thou mayeſt alſo here
take notice, of the great partiality of theſe men, who in what
might make againſt us, would keep exactly to the form of words
in the Indictment; but would not keep to the form of words
therein, although eſſential to the thing in hand, in what made
for the juſtification of our Cauſe, as plainly appears by this:
for whereas we were charged <hi>for an unlawful Aſſembly, Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
and Meeting, under colour and pretence of the exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
we inſiſted on the word <hi>pretence,</hi> as that it came from
a word which ſignified to <hi>cover over;</hi> So that a pretence is a
falſe cover, and ſo, to cover Danger and Sedition under meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together; which was falſe; for we came from a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and not from a pretence, as our Conſciences bare us
witneſs, namely, to wait upon the Lord, as being in his fear
where-ever we are, according to thoſe ſayings, <hi>Be thou in the
fear of the Lord all the day long. And wait upon thy God continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And that a good intent was good in it ſelf.</hi> Now although a
man might do evil, that good might come of it, which he
ought not to do; yet, Whoever did really good, that evil might
come thereof? For, <hi>ex vero, nil niſi vera ſequuntur;</hi> Of Truth,
nothing but true things do follow. Alſo, that the word, intent,
was not mentioned in the Indictment. And as for <hi>pretence,</hi>
they could not prove any thing either by word or deed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might gather any pretence; for there was an <hi>exerciſe
of Religion</hi> mentioned in the Indictment: Now we truly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that an <hi>exerciſe,</hi> as to man, did imply ſome viſible action,
either of the tongue, hand or knee; for the Mind was as
inviſible Being, and therefore the exerciſe therereof was not
diſcerned by man: but at the time of our aſſembling, there
was no action, either of Prayer, Exhortation, Doctrine, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
Thankſgiving, or the like; therefore there was <hi>no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.</hi>
One thing alſo is not to be forgotten; that when it
was queried, How could the going a ſtones caſt or two from
ones dwelling, only to a place, be a breach of the King's Peace?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103768:5"/>
               <hi>Rich. Onzlow</hi> anſwered impertinently thereunto, unto this
purpoſe, ſaying, Yes; for if a man did go over or thorow an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's
Ground, he committed a treſpaſs, although he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe: But the Reader may obſerve, that this was a going
in the High-way, and not out of the Common-path, to our
own proper place and ground: neither was it a fit ſimilitude;
becauſe we were charged in the Indictment with <hi>Wickedneſs,
Danger,</hi> and <hi>Sedition, under colour and pretence of an exerciſe
of Religion</hi> as aforeſaid, and ſo in truth, it was a wreſting of
Judgment. Alſo, it was minded to the Jury, that the doors
were open, which, according to their own Law, is ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
from a Conventicle, which is taken for a meeting to a
bad intent, and wherewith we were charged. This was the
ſubſtance of what was pleaded to the Particulars charged
againſt us in the Indictment, from the firſt to the laſt, till
the Jury brought in their ultimate Verdict (ſo called) which
appeared to be ſo ſufficient for a juſt defence unto impartial
Judges, and a judicious and conſciencious Jury, that the
ſtanders-by generally thought we ſhould have been brought in
<hi>not guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jury going out of the Court, they continued a certain
time; then coming again, the Bayliff ſaid they had a Verdict:
They being asked, if they were agreed? ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi> They
asked, whether <hi>Arthur Fiſher</hi> and the reſt of the Priſoners at
the Bar, were guilty, or not guilty? They ſaid, <hi>They were
guilty in part,</hi> and <hi>not guilty in part.</hi> Then <hi>Richard Onzlow</hi>
ſaid, they muſt either be guilty of the whole Indictment, or
elſe not guilty; They anſwered, they could not find us guilty of
the whole, but only guilty of meeting; which meeting; they
ſaid, they could not find to be upon pretence of Worſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there were no words ſpoken: Neither could they find
as guilty for not coming to hear Common-Prayer, becauſe it
was not to be heard before their Impriſonment: but this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
would not be accepted of, although <hi>Richard Onzlow</hi> had
told them, that if they could not find us guilty of all, then,
not guilty: and they ſaid, they could not find us guilty but in
part; So that, according to his own words, we ought to have
been cleared; but <hi>Judgment was turned backward, and Equity
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103768:6"/>
could not enter;</hi> but they would force the Jury to bring in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Verdict. Then one of the Juſtices that committed us,
was ſworn, as to what our Confeſſion was when we were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
who ſaid, we confeſſed, we met in the fear of the
Lord; and this was the beſt Evidence that he could give:
then the Jury was ſent out again, where they ſtayed long, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
that the Court adjourned until the third hour, about
which time, they ſate again, and asked if the Jury were agreed:
the Bayliff ſaid, No; but ſaid he, Maſter <hi>Pound</hi> is here now;
whereupon <hi>Richard Onzlow</hi> caſting his eye up toward the
window (the Jury being in an upper room) ſaid, his Evidence
was nothing now: The Reader may take notice, that this
<hi>Pound</hi> was the Conſtable that accompanied the Souldiers to
fetch us out of the Meeting. Then in a little ſpace after,
the Jury came again, and being asked as before, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
to the ſame effect; which Verdict would no more
ſatisfie the Court, than the former: Then <hi>Pound</hi> was called
and ſworn, whoſe Evidence, <hi>Richard Onzlow</hi> had ſaid to be
nothing now; neither did we judge it legal to ſwear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
for either party, after the Jury had gone out twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
but we knowing our Cauſe to be juſt, and our ſelves
innocent, we mattered not what any could ſay or ſwear againſt
us; and his Evidence, as to what he ſaw, agreed with the
others; but they asked him, if he heard us ſay, we met to
worſhip God, or upon pretence of Religious Exerciſe: he
ſaid, he heard us ſay nothing; but we did not deny that we
met to worſhip God; So they took it for granted: But it was
told them, that a not denying, was not a confeſſing of any
thing: and we ſpake to the Jury to mind the fear of the Lord
(it was alſo told them, <hi>He that juſtified the Wicked, and he that
condemned the Righteous, both thoſe were abomination to the Lord)</hi>
inſomuch that <hi>Richard Onzlow</hi> told one of us, he ſhould be
bound to his Good-behaviour. And thus, all people may
take notice of the unjuſt dealings of the Rulers of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for when it ſeemed very probable that we ſhould have
been cleared, becauſe the Evidence could prove nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, <hi>Richard Onzlow</hi> ſaid, Well, my Maſters, if ye be
not found guilty now, ye will be found guilty ſhortly: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103768:6"/>
he manifeſted the intent of his heart; for his words did
imply, that if the Jury did clear us, we ſhould be enſnared by
ſome other means; for he knew not, that all we ſhould ever
be brought to any more ſuch Tryals. Then the Jury going
out again, returned quickly. Then it was asked, as before,
whether <hi>Arthur Fiſher,</hi> and the reſt of the Priſoners, were
guilty as they ſtood indicted, or not guilty? they ſaid, <hi>Guilty.</hi>
How are they guilty, ſaid he? Guilty of meeting, ſaid the
Foreman: But ſaid <hi>Richard Onzlow,</hi> are they guilty accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the form of the Indictment? he anſwered, Yes.
Then they cryed, Look to them Jaylor. Then they began to
hale us away, without paſſing any Sentence upon us: Then
we deſired to hear our Sentence, which <hi>Richard Onzlow</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
as followeth: <hi>That we ſhould return to Priſon again,
and there lye three months without Bail; and if in caſe we did
not make Submiſſion according as the Law directs, either at or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the end of the aforeſaid three months, that then we ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
this Realm; but in caſe we refuſed to make Abjuration, or
after Abjuration made, ſhould forbear to depart this Realm, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the time limited, or ſhould return again without Licence, we
ſhould be proceeded againſt as Felons.</hi>

was not to be caſt in any Suit; and of this, ſeven of them ſaid,

               <p>There was alſo an honeſt man, who was at the hearing of

was by <hi>Submiſſion.</hi> Then the Priſoner asked him, what their
Submiſſion was? He ſaid, to come to Common-Prayer, and
reſrain theſe Meetings: Unto whom, when the ſaid Priſoner
had given his Reaſons (in the fear, power and wiſdom of God)
of denial of both, and being deſirous to hear the penalty; he
ſaid, we muſt abjure the Land: To whom when the Priſoner
anſwered, <hi>to abjure is to forſwear:</hi> one of the Juſtices (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)

               <p>Other things were uttered amongſt us, as chriſtianly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing
a good Confeſſion before their Judgment-Seat; and if

declare a diſowning of it, and that the Light of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to

            </head>
            <p>TO every Individual, as well the Promoters of, as Conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
unto that <hi>unjuſt Verdict,</hi> theſe few lines are directed;
deſiring that ye may reade them with patience and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and conſider what you have done, and repent and humble
your ſelves before the Lord, before it be too late, even before
the Anger of the Lord (who is <hi>patient and long-ſuffering)</hi> break
forth upon you, and you be utterly cut off and periſh in your
ſins, and you be for ever deprived of the preſence of the Lord,
and have your portion amongſt Murderers and Unbelievers,
which will aſſuredly be your portion, except you repent. And
truly, this I can ſay, that my ſoul hath been grieved, and my
ſpirit full of heavineſs for you, and with tears have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
the Lord never to lay this ſin to your charge, having
learned <hi>to bleſs them that curſe, and pray for them that deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
uſe us:</hi> But truly, your ſin is very great; for you have not
only made your ſelves Murderers (if the Lord prevent it not)
of <hi>twenty two Perſons,</hi> to the ruining of our Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
but alſo have made your ſelves a Preſident unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the like caſe; you being the firſt and moſt hardly that
ever durſt bring in ſuch a Verdict amongſt us in our Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And now I deſire to expoſtulate a little with you, to
know what was the very ground and cauſe of your ſo dealing,
ſeeing there was no Evidence to prove any thing againſt us.</p>
            <p>And firſt, you the Promoters, Was this your end, to have
the Righteous cut off from the Earth, that ſo you might live
in Swearing, Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, and all manner of
Prophaneſs and Debauchery, without once being reproved?
Or, was it for fear of Finement or hope of Favour? or, did
you expect ſome Reward? or, did you believe that your bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103768:8"/>
us in <hi>guilty,</hi> would (as it did) extend to the depriving
of us both of Liberty, Life and Eſtate? and did you hope to
be ſharers thereof? or to advantage your ſelves by deſtroying
of us? Which of theſe was the reaſon? deal plainly with
your own hearts and conſciences, and think not to hide any
thing from the all-ſeeing eye of the Lord, nor from ſuch as
walk in his Light, and abide in his Counſel.</p>
            <p>And now to you the Conſenters, who for a ſeaſon withſtood
your fellows, I have a few words to write; That although
your end was not ſo bad, nor your envy ſo great as the others,
yet your reward will be the ſame, and you muſt drink of the
ſame Cup, except you ſpeedily repent; and it is well if a
place of repentance be found for you; for, you have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betrayed the Lives of honeſt men, but alſo have betrayed
your own Conſciences, and done deſpight againſt the Spirit
of Grace that ſtrove in you, and through cowardiſe and ſlaviſh
fear conſented to condemn the Innocent: for the Scribes and
Phariſees could not compaſs the death of Chriſt until <hi>Judas</hi>
betrayed him; no more could thoſe blood-thirſty-men have
compaſſed ours, but by your conſent. Oh that you would
conſider, and lay theſe things to heart, and remember the
ſaying of the Servant of the Lord; <hi>What is required of thee,
O man, but to do juſtly, ſhew mercy, and walk humbly with thy
God?</hi> but you have dealt unjuſtly, you have ſhewed no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and now for you to repent and walk humbly with your God,
would indeed be the rejoycing of my ſoul, who deſires, that
the Lord may ſhew mercy unto you all, though you have not
done juſtly towards me nor the reſt of my Brethren.</p>

holden at <hi>Margarets Hill</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi>
upon the <hi>11th.</hi> day of the <hi>9th.</hi> Month, <hi>1662.</hi> as
followeth.</head>
            <p>THe Court being ſate, there was brought; before them
<hi>thirteen</hi> of the People of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who
being brought to the Bar, an Indictment was read, which
was grounded upon an Act of Parliament of the thirty fifth year
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, for the puniſhment of wicked and ſeditious
Sectaries.</hi> The Indictment being read, the Priſoners were
asked, <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>not guilty?</hi> Several of the Priſoners ſeeing
their wicked intent, had not freedom to anſwer to that limited
form of words, [viz. <hi>guilty,</hi> or <hi>not guilty]</hi> we ſaid, it was all
one whether we plead or not, ſeeing they had determined what
to do, as we had experience in the former Tryal, yet we ſpake
to the ſame effect, denying the ſubſtance of the Indictment,
and declaring it to be a pack of lyes and forgeries. Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of us being ſuffered no further to plead, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
back to Priſon, and but five only remaining whose
Plea the Court accepted; whoſe Plea could hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
for, when they asked us, <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>not guilty?</hi> ſome
of us anſwered, That we did believe that they knew in their
own conſciences that we were not guilty of that Indictment,
and that it was lies and forgeries, and that we were not
guilty of that Charge. They ſaid, it was a ſign our Cauſe
was not good, we were ſo loth to put our ſelves upon a
Tryal. We anſwered, we did not queſtion the honeſty of
our Cauſe, but we did queſtion the honeſty of thoſe that were
to try our Cauſe; and that we knew that ſuch men who <hi>fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
God, and trembled at his Word,</hi> could not judge us <hi>Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers</hi>
in this matter. Reply was made; Were not thoſe men
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103768:9"/>
that feared God? (meaning the Jury) We replyed to <hi>John
Lenthal,</hi> that if he could ſay, in Truth and Righteouſneſs,
that he was <hi>a man that feared God, and trembled at his Word,</hi>
we would refer our Cauſe to him; but if he was not ſuch
a one, he was not fit to ſit there as Judge over us: And
whereas we declared againſt the Forgery contained in the
Indictment, they ſaid, we were uncivil: We ſaid, it was
not uncivil to ſay <hi>a Lye was a Lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jury being called and ſworn, they alſo ſwore two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.
The firſt ſwore we were at a Meeting at <hi>Horſey-Down,</hi>
to the number of about three-ſcore. The Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
what we were doing? He ſaid, we were doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor he heard nothing ſpoken.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Witneſs, whoſe name is <hi>Croſſwell,</hi> he ſwore we
were met at <hi>Horſey-Down,</hi> to the number of about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and that a Woman was preaching before he came into
the Meeting, and continued ſpeaking a good while after he
came in; although the former Witneſs, being asked how
long he came in after <hi>Croſſwell.</hi> He ſaid he came in within
three minutes after him, and heard nothing ſpoken; And
when it was demanded of <hi>Croſſwell,</hi> what was ſpoken; he could
give but a ſlender account, but ſaid ſhe ſpoke out of <hi>Jeremiah.</hi>
But this Teſtimony was forged by the Devil the father of
lyes in the heart of this his ſervant, which was ſignified to
the Jury; and alſo, that this <hi>Croſſwell,</hi> who lives at the <hi>Horns</hi>
in <hi>Kent-ſtreet,</hi> is generally known to be a very wicked man,
and to keep a wicked houſe of entertainment for Drunkards
and all manner of wicked perſons; who was a Conſtable
at the time when we were brought to Priſon, he took us out
of our peaceable Meeting, where we were in ſilence waiting
upon the Lord, which was teſtified in open Court; and this
falſe Witneſs was objected againſt, as not being a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Witneſs, becauſe he is known to be a man of a wicked
Converſation, and one that is a Common Swearer, and not
making conſcience of an Oath. It was alſo pleaded to the
Jury, that they ought to take notice of the Confutation of
the Witneſſes; the firſt affirming <hi>that nothing was ſpoken,</hi> the
laſt affirming <hi>that a Woman ſpake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:103768:9"/>
It was alſo queſtioned, whether that Court had any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Authority to proceed againſt us, ſeeing it is enacted in
a Statute, made and provided in the firſt year of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth, That no matters of Religion, or Cauſes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
ſhall be judged Errour, Hereſie, or Schiſm, but by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Authority by especial Commiſſion, by Letters Patents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Great Seal of</hi> England. The Court ſaid, that Statute
of the thirty fifth was ſince. To which it was anſwered,
that this Statute of the firſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,
but is yet in force. <hi>John Lenthal</hi> ſaid, that ſhould
not hinder their proceedings. <hi>John Lenthal</hi> asked us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were met together? We ſaid, the end of our
meeting together, was to wait upon the Lord, to feel his
Power and Preſence in our hearts, and that we were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wicked, ſeditious, nor Hereticks, but were in the fear
and counſel of God, bearing Teſtimony againſt thoſe things
in our Converſation, whereof we were accuſed in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>John Lenthal</hi> ſaid, directing his ſpeech to the Jury,
that one Witneſs ſaid, we were at the Meeting; and the other
ſaid, that a Woman ſpake; and thirdly, that we confeſſed that
we were there worſhipping of God, which he charged againſt
us as matter of fact; They alſo charged us of obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to hear the <hi>Common-Prayer:</hi> Some of us ſaid, we were
in Priſon before it was in being: Others of us bid them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Evidence that we did not hear it. They anſwered, that
we ſhould prove that we did hear it. We ſaid, that did
not belong to us, nor the Law doth not require it.</p>
            <p>Then we, directing our ſpeech to the Jury, bid them take
notice of the Confutation of the Evidence, and that it was a
weighty matter they went upon; that not only our Liberty, but
our Lives alſo were concern'd in it, for they ſought our Blood;
and that the End and Iſſue of it was to take away our Lives;
for we ſee the end of their Proceedings, by this Act, is, to
make us <hi>abjure the Realm,</hi> which is, <hi>to ſwear,</hi> which we muſt
rather die than do; <hi>(Oh! muſt you ſo,</hi> ſaid the Cryer) We
ſaid, we were innocent men, fearing God, and becauſe of
that they ſought our lives; but if we had been Drunkards or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103768:10"/>
Swearers, we might have our Liberty. They ſaid, if we
would conform, we might have our Liberty. It was anſwered,
we might obtain our Liberty for our bodies for a time, and
bring our ſouls in bondage to all eternity. So they ſent forth
the Jury, who remained together till the Court adjourned to
Dinner, and after they were ſet again, the Jury came down;
the Court asked them if they were agreed? They ſaid, No.
Some of them queſtioned, whether a Woman ſpeaking might
be called the Worſhip of God. <hi>John Lonthal</hi> ſaid, it was all
one for that, whether Men or Women: But after ſome time,
the Jury came in again, and brought us in <hi>guilty,</hi> as the
Court ſaid. We demanded their Verdict, but they would
give us no anſwer. Then <hi>John Lenthal</hi> pronounced the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<hi>That we muſt return to Priſon for three months, without
Bail or Mainprize; if in that time we did not recant, we muſt
abjure the Realm.</hi> We asked them what benefit we might
obtain by ſuch Submiſſion? They anſwered, we might have
our Liberty. We anſwered, that they could afford us no
more than the Divil offered Chriſt; <hi>All this will I give thee,
if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> One of them ſaid, that
was not a fit compariſon. Whereupon we anſwered, If
we ſhould ſay that with our mouthes, which we did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
with our hearts, we ſhould be Hypocrites and Children
of the Devil, falling down to worſhip him. So as we paſſed
from before the Court, we bid them remember <hi>Cain,</hi> who
was the firſt that perſecuted about Sacrifice and Worſhip, who
flew his righteous Brother.</p>
            <p>Now let the impartial Reader take notice of the ſlender
ground that either the Jury had to bring us in guilty of that
Indictment, or the Court to paſs ſuch a cruel Sentence, there
being only two Witneſſes. The firſt ſwore, that a Woman
was ſpeaking before he came into the Meeting; and a good
while after; and the other came within three minutes after,
and heard nothing ſpoken. This was all the Evidence that
was againſt us, as the Auditors that were preſent at the Court
can witneſs. Now whether this Evidence was a ſufficient
ground for ſuch a Verdict (ſo called) and Sentence, let all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103768:10"/>
ſober-minded people judge: they could not prove us either
<hi>wicked, dangerous, ſeditious,</hi> nor <hi>Sectaries;</hi> neither have the
effects of our meeting ever at any time tended to any ſuch
conſequence; but our Meetings do, and alwayes have ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to Peace, and to the rooting out the ground of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Sedition, and Hereſie; therefore not guilty of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.
Secondly, There was no Evidence againſt us, that
we did obſtinately refuſe to hear Common-Prayer; neither
was it in being at thoſe places which they call Churches and
Chappels, till after we were in Priſon; therefore we are not
guilty of this Indictment. Thirdly, They did not ſwear that
we were met in pretence of Worſhip; therefore we are not
guilty of this Indictment. Fourthly, The Evidence did not
ſwear that we were met in Contempt of the King, his Laws
and Statutes; for we were met in the Fear and Counſel of
God, which is not an <hi>evil,</hi> but a <hi>good Example</hi> to others; not
againſt the <hi>Peace,</hi> but againſt the <hi>ground of ſtrife;</hi> not againſt
the <hi>King's Honour and Dignity,</hi> but in the <hi>ground of all true
Honour and Dignity;</hi> therefore not guilty of that Indictment:
Our Meeting-doors were open; and therefore by the Law not
a <hi>Conventicle,</hi> which is to plot and contrive miſchief, which
it is manifeſt to all People was not our intent; therefore not
guilty of that Indictment, nor deſerving ſuch a cruel Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>Now all People who have any ſence or ſeeling of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of God's Spirit in their hearts, may ſee and diſcern that
this perſecuting ſpirit is no other, but that which was in <hi>Cain</hi>
when he ſlew his Brother about Sacrifice and Worſhip; for,
no other but that ſame ſpirit hath perſecuted about Religion
and Worſhip, from <hi>Cain</hi> to this day; who, becauſe of that
ſpirit, are and ever have been driven out of God's preſence,
as <hi>Cain</hi> was, and ſo are become open Enemies to that Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Life in all the Faithful, which was in <hi>Abel,</hi> whoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
God accepteth at this day, as he did his.</p>

GIve ear, O King, O Parliament, O Judge,</l>

            <l>Behold! all People of the Engliſh Nation,</l>
            <l>A Law ſet forth againſt the Separation,</l>
            <l>Made by a Council, Signed by a Queen,</l>

            <l>Which blames a harmleſs People, by its Lies,</l>

            <l>The while, let's talk a littl' of your abuſe,</l>
            <l>To leave y' at leaſt the more without excuſe:</l>
            <l>What have we ſaid, or done? we fain would know</l>

            <l>That ye ſhould thus us ſentence right or wrong,</l>
            <l>Sure, not by God's Law, but your own ſo ſtrong:</l>
            <l>Did ever men juſt Judgment more pervert,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in name, but <hi>Hypocrites</hi> in heart!</l>
            <l>If we ſhould hold our peace; the Stones might cry</l>
            <l>With rumbling voices to the Heavens hie.</l>
            <l>What do ye ſay to Chriſt and Chriſtians</l>
            <l>In Ages paſt, inhabiting all Lands,</l>
            <l>Who ſeparated from the wicked train</l>

            <l>What to the Sect declar'd of in the <hi>Acts?</hi>

            <l>And <hi>Paul</hi> accus'd by th'<hi>Jews</hi> of heinous facts?</l>

See then how like your Fathers ye do walk,</l>
            <l>Who of the Scriptures then did prate and talk,</l>
            <l>Who juſtified the Saints that went before,</l>
            <l>And yet condemn'd the preſent ones as ſore.</l>
            <l>Repent, repent, be humbled in the duſt,</l>
            <l>And bite thoſe tongues that did condemn the Juſt:</l>
            <l>Yea, rather rent your hearts, which took content</l>
            <l>To Priſon, Baniſh, kill the Innocent:</l>
            <l>For if we felt not Light, Life, Truth and Love,</l>
