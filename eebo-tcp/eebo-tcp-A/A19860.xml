            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

like a bige mouſe and lept vpon her left knee, caſt her backward, took

of her head, that it was verye ſore for 2 Dayes after.</p>
            <p>Sixe times within thoſe 6. weekes the ſperit would not ſuffer her to
eate or drincke, it tooke awaye alſo her ſtomake. if ſhee offered to
drincke (at the earneſt motion of others) it caſt her and the drincke
downe to gether. At other tymes ſhee did eate greedily, ſloſſinge vp
her meate like a greedy dogge, or hogge, that her mother and her
freindes, weare aſhamed of her. ſtyll ſhee was hungrye and cryed for
more, ſaying ſhee had nothing, though ſhe ſpared no kinde of meate:
allwas fiſh that cam to nett. After abundance of meate her belly ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
neuer the fuller, that ſhe marueiled which waye it went.</p>
            <p>The 10 of febuari it pulled her as ſhe thought in an hundred peeces.
ther came out of her mouth ſuch a ſtincking ſmoke, and breath that
ſhee could not endure it her ſelfe. her voyce and crying were quite
altered, and ſo continued till night. But her breath ſtank ſoe yll a day
and a nyght after, that her neighboures could not enduer to come
neare her.</p>
            <p>Often her ſences were taken a way, and ſhe maid as ſtyfe as iron, and
oft as dead even breathleſſe. it made her ſpeake ſharplye, haſtely,
and by ſnatches: ſomtimes it made a loud noyſe in her bellye, like that
in the bellye of a great troting horſe.</p>
            <p>The two next nights before the day of her examination concerning
<hi>Hartlay,</hi> appeared the deuill in the likneſſe of <hi>Hartlay</hi> requeſting her
to take heed what ſhe ſayd, and to ſpeake the truth, for the time was
come promiſſing her ſiiluer and gould. ſhe anſwered (thinking it to
be <hi>Hartlay</hi>) that the truth ſhe had ſpoken already, &amp; that ſhe would
not favour him neither for ſiluer nor gold: the 2 night he departed ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
doe as thou wilt. the day before <hi>Hartlay</hi> his execution was a ſore
day vnto her, after which euery day ſhe went to morning prayer, &amp;
was neuer troubled in the Church ſave the 1 day, wheron it took her
about the middeſt of the ſermon, in heaving vp her ſhoulders, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing
her of her ſences after the recouery of her ſences, it tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the vſe of her leggs: and thus it moleſted her in the Church, to
the admvration of the people, about an hower and halfe.</p>

After this time ſhe had more eaſe in the day then ſhe was wont, but
in the night ſhe lay ſtif and ſtark quaking and trembling, till the day
ſhe came to <hi>Cleworth.</hi>

according to the counſel before giuen him, procured firſt one preac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
then an other to ſee them: but they knew not well what to ſay
to their affliction. After hauing intelligence by D. Dee his butler
of the like greuous affliction of <hi>Thomas Darling</hi> his vncles ſon, an re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery
vpon the aduice giuen by my ſelf, he requeſted <hi>D. Dee</hi> his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

his owne alſo, which preuayled not with me.</p>
            <p>Thervppon he procured other letters wherof one was from a Iuſtice
of peace therby, and ſent the ſecond time vnto me. Then I crauinge

at an exerciſe: yealded to M. <hi>Starchyes</hi> requeſt, &amp; about 3. wekes after

and my ſelf, came to <hi>Cleworth.</hi> VVhither when we were come M
<hi>Starchy</hi> tould vs, that his ſonn had bene well, about a fortnight, and
his daughter 4. dayes: and ſurely to ſe to they were at that inſtant as
well and free from any poſſeſſion by Sathan, as any other: which we
ſuſpected to procede, from the ſubtilty of the diuel, &amp; ſo it proued.
Shortly after our comming, as we ſat at dinner, came in <hi>Margaret
Hardman</hi> and hir ſiſter, &amp; <hi>El: Holland</hi> on after another like players to
bid vs welcom: foraſmuch as no body ſent for me ſaid one of them,
I am come of my owne accord. And hauing thus ſpoken ſhee was
throwen backward on a forme, and ſo all 3. were frangely &amp; greuoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

mouing there was alſo in their inward parts: (eſpecially in <hi>M. Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>)
as was eaſily harde of vs that were preſent. <hi>I</hi> remember alſo

hang the diuel? <hi>I</hi> wis no: they might hang Ed: but they conlde not
hang the diuel: no maruel though the rope brake: for they were two
<hi>Ed:</hi> and the diuel. By that which <hi>I</hi> hard of his fits (wherof wee haue

though they neither knew nor ſpeake to any other, yet <hi>Iane</hi> they
knewe, and ſpeake to her onlye in theſe wordes, thou wilt ſhortlye

as ſhecarien vp hot Ianoks, ſhe thought that ſhe could ihaue eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp
a Ianoke, &amp; often did eat much by ſtealth, being paſſyng hungry like
<hi>M Byrom,</hi> and the children, who likwiſe were ſometymes exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglye

came, her belly began to ſwell greatly, ſo that ſhe compared her bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
to a womans great with child. when it abated a little, a breath
came vp her throat, which cauſed yelling, after it fell downe into hir
body like a cold ſtone, as it did with <hi>M</hi> By. and as ſone as tydings
came that we were come, preſently her belly was fallne, and as litle
as in former time and ſo continued.</p>
            <p>Not long after our comming all 7. being had into a chamber, the one

The next morning all 7. being had into a faire larg parlor, &amp; laid ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on

with faſting &amp; hearing the word, all the parties afflicted remayninge
in their fits the ſaid whole day. Towards the end wherof, they all of
the ſudden began to be moſt extreamly torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, beting vp &amp; downe

order which all the day had ben kept, confuſedly euery on with voice

lord was pleaſed to heare vs, ſo as. 6. of them were ſhortly delyuered,
wherin we with them reioyced, &amp; praiſed god for the ſame.</p>
            <p>The firſt that was diſpoſſeſed was M. <hi>Byrom,</hi> then all the reſidu (ſaue
<hi>Iane Aſhton</hi>) one ſhortly after an other, betwen. 5. and. 6. at night. ſhe
began to be vexed by ſathan about. 4, or. 5, in the morning and neuer
had reſt vntill her deliuerance. All that day ſhe hard only a humming
and a ſound but knewe nothing what was ſaid: ſhe could thus heare
but not ſee. Somtime ſhe ſawe &amp; then marueyled what the company
did ther, and how ſhe got thither: howbeit ſhe heard euery idle word
that the children poſſeſſed had, ſhe was more extreamly handled
that daye then any before, though ſhe had had many ſore daies. She
was euer full of payne, and it ſemed to her as though her hart
would haue burſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe ſtrayned vpmuch fleamy and bloudy matter
Laſtly ſhe lay as dead for the ſpace of half an houre, taking no breath.
Then ſtart ſhe vp moſt ioyfully, magnifying god, with ſuch. a chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

            <p>VVhen theſe 6 were deliuered, ſome deſired to know how they aſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
themſelues therof, and they anſwered as followeth. <hi>M Byr:</hi> ſaid
that ſhe felt it come vp from her bellye towardes her breſt, thence to
her throat:<note place="margin">in like ſort <hi>William So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> had aſore throat after the departur of the ſpirit:</note> when it left her throate it gaue her a ſore lug, and all this
whyle a darke miſt dazeled her eyes. Then ſhe felt it to go out of her
mouth, but it left behind it aſore throat &amp; afilthy ſmel, that aweke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her meate was vuſauary. It went out in the liknes of a crowes head
rounde, (as to her ſemed) and ſate in the corner of the parlor, with
darknes about it a whyle. Then went it with ſuch a flaſh of fyer out of
the windowe, that all the Parlor ſemed on fyre, to her onlye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Starchie:</hi> ſaid it went from hym lyke a man with a bulch on his
blacke very yll fauored. and preſently he returned to haue reentered,
but he withſtood hym ſtrong in faith. the ſame in effect ſaid <hi>M Hard.
Anne Starchy</hi> ſaid, he went like a foule vgly man, with a white beard
and a great bulch on his breſt as big as a mans head. and ſtraitway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to haue reentered, but ſhe faithfully reſiſted, Euen ſo ſaid <hi>El.
Hol.</hi> the whit beard excepted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>El. Hard</hi> ſaid, it was like an vrchin, and went through a very litle
hole (as ſhe thought) out of the parler, but out of hand returned a
gaine in a very foule ſhape promiſing her golde, and whatſoeuer ſhee
would deſier, if ſhe would giue him leaue to enter againe, but ſhe
yealded not. then he threatened to caſt her into a pit, ſaying ſomtime
thou wilt go a lone. he ſaid alſo, he would caſt her into the fyre, and
breake her neck, but ſhe reſiſting he departed like an vrchine.</p>
            <p>And thus the firſt dayes worke was happily ended. But behold the
ſlight of the wyly ſerpent, for when we were all at reſt, the ſperits ſett
vpon the 5 little children, like ſo many wulues the ſeely Lambes. the
poore children being newly recouered, and ſuddenly inuaded, wereſo
frighted that they claſped faſt about their middles that lay with them
and hid their faces with ther bed clothes. M. <hi>Dickons</hi> was called down
who comming ſaw them reſiſting, and encouraged them to ſtandfaſt
neuer to yeald, but to pray and reſiſt with faith. &amp; ſhortly they were
well and fell a ſlepe.</p>
            <p>The next day we inquired how the were aſſalted. M. <hi>By.</hi> ſaid it cam

promyſing her enought if ſhe wold conſent, and that he would lye

caſt her to the ground, and departed twiſe as byg, and foule as hee

            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Starchy</hi> ſayd he came in the former likenes, making many large
proffers, baggs of gould &amp;c. But when he ſawe he nothing preuayled

he deſyred her to open her mouth, as he opened his, ſhewing her two
bagges, one of ſiluer an other of gold, promiſing her 9 times as much
but not preuayling he ran away as a beare that breakes looſe from the

her out of the windowe, and into the fyer if euer ſhe ſtood neare it,
and ſo departed: very foule &amp; with an horrible ſcryke.</p>

diſpoſſeſſion were wanting. After ſhe had herein yelded to the diuell

by trad of life a muſitian: about 8 or 9 yeares paſt, as he iournyed

accompanyed with an old woman dwelling in the ſaid <hi>Bellyn,</hi> found
an hat with a copper band. the woman requiering the ſame, he gaue
her the hat though vnwillingly, but the band he vtterly refuſed to
giue, ſuppoſſing it to be of gould. wher vpon ſhe threatning him ſaid
<hi>that it had bene as good for him to haue giuen it her.</hi> After this in the

into a great feare. and thus he continued frighted for a time. ſhortlye
after <hi>M. Brackenberic</hi> his maſter remoued to <hi>Holme,</hi> neare to <hi>Newark</hi>

he was taken agayne &amp; caſt into a throne buſh about 60. yards diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

in theſe two places he lay for the ſpace of ſom 4 houres, as he perceiu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed

he went. when in his returne he drewe nere <hi>Holme</hi> he begane to be
ſicke. from ſicknes he came to carie himſelf after that ſtrang manner
by fyts, that his maſter ſuppoſed hym to playe the counterfeite, and
theirvpon he whypped him. But notwithſtanding all the whipping
was vſed (which he felt not at all) he continued after that ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

after he had bene about 5 weekes at <hi>Nottingham</hi> afflicted after his
accuſtomed and ſtrang manner, and that the ſaid apoynted day was

About the 20. day of March. 1596. his aforeſaid maiſter <hi>Thomas

About the begining of October. 1597. the ſaid <hi>Somers</hi> (being at <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi>
in the houſe of his maiſter <hi>Thomas Porter</hi> did vſe ſuch ſtrang
and ydle. kinde of geſtures in laughing, dauncing &amp; ſuch like lighte
behauiour, that he was ſuſpected to be madd: ſundry times he refuſed
all kynd of meate for a long ſpace togither, inſomuch as he did ſeeme
therby to pyne away, ſomtimes he ſhaked as if he had had an ague
there was hard a ſtrange noyſe or flapping from within his bodye
he was often ſeene to gather himſelf on a round heape vnder his bed-cloathes:
and being ſo gathered to bounſe vp a good height from the
bed, alſo to beate his head and other parts of his body againſt the
ground and bedſtead in ſuch earneſt manner and ſo violentlye that,
the beholders did feare that thereby he woulde haue ſpoyled hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
if they had not by ſtrong hand reſtrayned hym: and yet thereby
receyued he no hurt at all. In moſt of his fitts he did ſwell in his body
and in ſome of them did ſo greatly exceede therein, as he ſeemed to
be twice ſo byg as his naturall body. Oft alſo was hee ſeene to haue a
certayne varyable ſwelling or lumpe to a greate bignes ſwiftlye run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:9806:12"/>
vp and doune betwene the fleſh and ſkyn through all the parts
of his body: and many tymes when that ſwelling was, theis or the like
words were hard out of his mouth. <hi>I will go out at his eyes or eares or
toes</hi> at which ſpeaches the ſaid ſwelling euidently appearing in ſuch
partes, did ymediatly remoue and vaniſh away. This ſwelling did not
only run from eye to eye, from cheke to cheke, and vp &amp; doune along
ſtill in the body: but beſides being now in the one leg preſently it wold
be in the other, and ſo of the armes in like manner: &amp; looke in which
arme or leg it ſtayed (as often it did for a certain ſpace) the ſame mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber
was innexible and excedingly heauy as it had bene ſomuch iron.
Thus it went with him though not in al, yet in mani of his fits wheri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouer
and beſides theſe things, he was ſtrangely handled: for ſuddenlye

vpon the ground, or fall doune, drawing then his lips awry, gnaſhing
with his teeth, wallowing and foming. In ſundry of his ſits he did vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo ſtrang &amp; fearfull ſcriking as cannot be vttered by mans power;
and was of ſuch ſtrength as ſometimes 4 or 5 men though they had
much aduantage againſt him by bynding of him to a chaire, yet could
they not rule him: and in ſhewing that ſtrength he was not percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to pant or blowe, no more then if he had not ſtrayned his ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gth,
nor ſtrugled at all. Sometimes he cryed extreamly, ſo as teares
came from him in great abundance: preſently after he would laughe
aloude &amp; ſhrill, his mouth being ſhutt cloſe. And being demaunded
concerning thoſe accidentes, he proteſted he knewe of no ſuch mater,
neither felt he any payne. Moreouer, he was often times caſt into the
fyre ſome bare part of his body alſo lying in the fyer: and yet was not
burned, and ſomtimes caſt violently againſt the ground, &amp; agaynſte
the wall or poaſtes of the houſe without any hurt of his body, &amp; did
many wayes ſeeke to deſtroy himſelfe: by reaſon whereof they were
driuen to take away his knife, gyrdell, garters &amp;c. yea with the ſheete
of his bed he had like to haue ſtrangled hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mſelfe. wherevpon as alſo
through the increaſing of his fits they were conſtreyned to watch hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
continually euen day &amp; night. His behauiour generally towardes all
that came, was very pleaſant, moſt impudent alſo &amp; ſhameleſſe with

of ſome queſtion or ſpeach vſed by ſome in ther ſimplicitie &amp;
ignorance: as <hi>that his dame had ſent him, that his name was Lucye, that
he was king, that he was prince of darknes. you thinke I haue no power of
him, yet I can vſe his tongue, his teeth, lyppes, handes, legges, his bodye and
all partes of him.</hi> and as the ſpirit named each part, he vſed it. and this
ſpeache with the action was verye common. <hi>was I?</hi> (ſaid he to one
<hi>Iohn Wiggin</hi>) <hi>neuer in heauen?</hi> yea quoth he, but God for thy pryde
thrwe thee downe into hell there to remayne. One <hi>Iohn Sherwood</hi>
charging him to tell who ſent him thither, he anſweared a woman. he
charged him againe to tell wher ſhee dwelt: he anſweared in <hi>Worceſter
ſhire.</hi> whether is ſhee liuyng or dead? dead ſaid he. wherfore did ſhee
ſend thee? for a hatt and hat band. Then the boye when the fite was
done was queſtioned with, concernynge theſe thinges: wherevnto
he returned for anſweare that which is ſet downe in the beginnynge
of this ſtorye, which he had concealed vntyll that tyme. Herevnto
<hi>I</hi> myght add certayne direct anſweares he mayde in lattyn to thoſe
ſpeaches, which in lattin were vſed unto hym, a little greeke alſo he
ſpeake, beynge ignorant in thoſe Languages, altogether in the one,
and vnderſtandyng little or nothynge in the other.</p>
            <p>In goyng thus with the boye, I was importined in his behalfe, firſt
by two letteres, after by another from the <hi>Maior,</hi> and theirevpon I
went vnto hym. As when and about the tyme I condiſended to goe
(beynge 14. myles of hym) he ſpeake theirof to them which were
about hym: ſo when I was come to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> he inſtanſtlye tould
the ſame, and foretould my comminge vnto him when I drewe neare
the houſe, as he had alſo foretould <hi>M Aldridge</hi> (the preacher of the

            <p>Towardes that evening I came being the 5 of Nouember, he ſeemed
to be ſicke, and his ſicknes greatlye to increaſe vpon him, ſoe as they
feared he would haue dyed, or had bene dead, for he laye an hower
with his face and handes blacke, cold as ice, noe breath being perceiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

hereof was brought to me, by one of they neighbour women <hi>Ioahn

of the Deuyll, and that the boye was nothinge leſſe then either dead

diuers times clapping his handes on his thighes for ioye: and at
the end of ſome of them, as killing and ſtealing, he ſhewed how he
brought them to the gallowes, making aſigne therof. during this
time which continued about an houre, as he was altogether ſilent, ſo
was he moſt actiue, though his eyes were cloſed, and in many things
he did, ther was great and neceſſarie vſe of ſight. In a word, theſe
thinges were in ſuch liuly and orient coloures painted out (as I may

and we beleue them, though they receiue their ſkill from the wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of men, which are ſubiect to error. How much more ought we
to beleue that the aforeſaid 10. perſons were ſicke of the diſeaſe wee
treate of, to wit poſſeſt with diuels: ſeing we haue not 3. or 4. but ſo
many ſignes thereof, and thoſe not taken out of the bookes of men:
which may yea often do erre and deceiue, but out of the boke of god
the word of truth.</p>
               <p>And here this I affirme, that the ſpirit of god in deſcrihing at large the
manner of their handling and vexation by ſathan who were poſſeſſed
in Chriſt's time according to that we haue heard, doth not ſett it
downe only as a matter of fact, but in reporting the ſame did beſides
thereby purpoſe, (as I conceiue) to giue a rule and leaue a direction,
to his church, whereby to diſcerne of poſſeſſion in the time to come,
to the end of the world: implying therein thus much, that when wee
ſhall ſee one handled after the ſame manner. that thereby wee learne
and from thence gather, that the ſaid party is poſſeſſed with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
ſpirit. And for confirmation hereof ſerueth excellently the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
of Chriſte to the father of the poſſeſſed child, after he had ſeene
his ſonne in one of his fits:<note place="margin">Mark 9. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Euangelicall ſignes are not ſuch <hi>Thyreus</hi> proueth thus: yf to be blynde

and others, or gnaſh the teeth, or foame, or be of ſupernaturall

is moſt falce, therfore the other alſo.</p>
               <p>To the propoſition or firſt part of this reaſon <hi>I</hi> anſwer, that to be bl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynde,
or to be dumbe, or deafe, or to be feirce and cruell towards him
ſelfe and others, &amp;c. without any further trouble or vexation, is no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of poſſeſſion: but yf any of theſe meete with other ſignes of this
ſupernaturall diſeaſe, it greatly confirmeth the ſame vnto vs, and is a
good ſigne therof. As for inſtance of foming: when foming is alone &amp;
ſeuered from other markes, it is no ſigne of one poſſeſſed: for in the
falling ſicknes a man fometh, and yet hath not an vncleane ſpirit in hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
But let it meete in the ſame perſon with diuers other tokens of one
poſſeſſed, though not all: ſo as the ſame man which fometh, doe alſo
gnaſhe his teeth, wallowe, be caſte into the fyre be of ſupernaturall
ſtrength and knowledge, then and in ſuch caſe (I ſay) it is a very ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
ſigne thereof. And this may be made playn by the like. An ague
cough, and ſtich, are the ſignes of a plurify: ſeauer theſe, ſo as a man
hath onely one of them, and that which of them ſoeuer it is, can giue
no aſſurance to the ſick perſon or phiſitian of the pluriſy: but let them
concure &amp; mete togither, &amp; they ſignifie that, &amp; as it were proclayme
him to be ſick of the ſaide diſeaſe. Euen ſoe it is in this caſe: if <hi>Thyreus</hi>
had ſaid that no one of the ſignes mentioned in the goſpell, was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9806:26"/>
as appeareth by that is ſaid before of <hi>Edmund Hartlaye</hi> the <hi>coniurer,</hi>
who in his coniuring and raiſing vp of the diuell, deuided his circle in
to 4. partes, making a <hi>croſſe</hi> at euery deuiſion? and how falleth it out
that the diuels then ſhew them ſelues, and that they can abide and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be there preſent, in the preſence &amp; vew of ſo many <hi>croſſes:</hi> It

&amp; preſent themſelues, though alas in much <hi>feare &amp; trembling,</hi> whence
cometh it alſo that <hi>coniurers</hi> haue aſwell good ſtore of <hi>croſſes</hi> in theire
bookes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iurations, as the papiſts in theire <hi>exorciſmes?</hi> Surelye by
that arte of theirs which they learne and get out of their ſaid bokes ſo
<hi>becroſſed</hi> they attaine by vertue &amp; ſtore of the ſaid <hi>croſſes</hi> ſome pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and authority ouer the diuels, which they after exerciſe ouer them
ſo that the papiſts onli haue not power ouer the diuels, as they affirm
wherof you ſhall heare hereafter. Here we may behold the iuſt iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of god vpon them: who becauſe they will not receiue &amp; truſt to
the ſignes the lord hath giuen in his word, which are the only certaine
&amp; ſufficient ſignes to ſignify ſathan his poſſeſſing of men: ſuch as who
ſoeuer truſteth vnto them, &amp; will be directed by them cannot error
be deceiued herein: ſuch as in whomſoeuer they are, the ſame perſon
is for certainty poſſeſſed, and ſuch alſo as without which we can not
certainly knowe when ſathan poſſeſſeth man: therefore I ſay becauſe
they will not beleue and receiue theſe ſignes, the Lord ſendeth them
ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould beleue lying, fooliſh, &amp; ridiculous
ſigns, ſhewed forth or giuen by ſathan in all deceiuablenes.</p>
               <p>Thus haue I ſufficiently prooued out of the word of god the poſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſion
of the parties wee intreate of, and diſproued what is or may
be obiected againſt it. Ther are beſids ſome other reaſons which may
further confirme the ſame vnto vs: As firſt, in that they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
vppon the prayers and faſtes which were vſed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
we may thereby bee the rather perſwaded that they had euill
ſpirits within them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where we muſt remember that it was not thus
once, but ſundry times, not with one perſon alone, but with diuers.
Now whence came it that ſuch certaine and preſent deliuerance came
to the aboue named partyes ſo afflicted as is aforeſaide, vpon the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge
of this ſaide meanes? Surely hence, becauſe they being ſicke,
of this ſupernaturall diſeaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I meane hauing vncleane ſpirits within
them, had the ſupernaturall meadycyne applyed vnto them, whych
God hymſelfe for the cureynge theireof hath lefte and ordeayned:
which beynge ſoe, it is noe marueyle though they were preſentlye
healed. For what meadicyne is ſoe ſoueraigne, as that which is of the
Lords owne appoyntment? had they bene ſicke of any other diſeaſe,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9806:27"/>
and namely had they bene vexed by ſome outward operation of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
as of neceſſity they muſt if they were not poſſeſt: they had not
vndoubtedly all of them bene ſo preſentlie deliuered as they were.</p>
               <p>For howſoeuer god hath appoynted vs to faſt when we are in any af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fliction
of body or mynd, neither ſhall it be done in vaine: yet he hath
no where promiſed that the ſame ſhall proſper to the deliuering of vs
from the ſaid affliction,<note place="margin">math 17. 21.</note> as he hath in this caſe of poſſeſſion, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and by name. <hi>This kind</hi> (ſaith our ſauiour) <hi>goeth not out, but by pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er,
and faſting:</hi> therein ſecretly promiſing, that praier and faſting being
vſed, euill ſpirits doe and ſhall goe out. Againe how came it to paſſe
that we in our prayers inſtantly calling vpon god, that he woulde be
pleaſed to caſt ſathan forth of them whoe lay ſo miſerably vexed, by
the diuell before vs, (that their bodyes might not be receptacles for
the vncleane ſpirits, but temples for the holy ghoſt to dwell in) that
they were therevpon, and euen then deliuered according to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
and ſupplications ſo made, if they were not poſſeſſed?</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges conſidered, I ſe not how any can doubt or once call in

touching this worke of god, I meane and that it is a bleſſed thinge to

vexations by ſathan: and among others he maketh mention of

<hi>Roome</hi> where Orphanes were kept, became <hi>Demoniacks:</hi> whereof ſaith
he, not one of them was recouered two yeares after yea it may be not
at all, which ſure is more ſtrange then their poſſeſſion: conſidering the
great power and authority the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> haue ouer diuels, euen the
ſame with the Apoſtles if you will beleue them: as hereafter you ſhall
heare. Alſo of later time and nearer vs, euen at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> a greate
towne in <hi>Holland</hi> Anno 1566. there were as he declareth at large 30
children or thereabouts in 8. or 10. weekes poſſeſſed with diuels.</p>
               <p>But to let the dead and their writings goe, let vs inquire of the liuing:
Aſke of our trauailers what they haue ſeene &amp; credibly heard in other

<hi>by rebuke,</hi> that is, by a charge or comaundement to depart, is caſte
out, in which caſe the party is healed, or made whole of this vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

very ſame we haue in the firſt of <hi>S. Marke</hi> verſe 25. and a little after
it followeth: verſe 27. <hi>he commaundeth the foule ſpirits with authority,

wrought a miracle: now what did he? he comaunded the dyuells

               <p>The myracle then is by aword, or commaunde to caſte the diuell
out, and this is ceaſed with other myracles, but to be poſſeſſed of the

which god (we all know) hath not reueled: but in truth the contrary.
But what leadeth men to ſay that men were therefore poſſeſt that <hi>the

it is euident that by their eiection theſe things were performd
By the ſame reaſon I may inferr, that men were therefore ſicke, had
the palſy, lunatick, lame, blynd, deafe, and dumbe, for the diuinity and
goſpell of Chriſt were confyrmed as well in the myraculous healynge
of the perſons ſoe afflicted, as in the diſpoſſeſſinge of diuells. And yet
not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding no man is ſo abſurd as thence to gather and conclud,
that ther are or can be none ſick now, none hauing the palſy, none lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natycke,

and ineuuitablye of the former ground, as that of the ympoſſibility of

the goſpell, might be confirmed by the healynge of thoſe which were

               <p>To ſpeake more playnlye therfore, as in the bodilye diſeaſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmityes
of thoſe men which our Sauiour cured, a cauſe of the ſame
was, that in the curynge of them it might be euydent that he was the
Meſſias, as appeareth in general by <hi>math</hi> 8. 16. 17. in perticular by the

that if any ſuch thing were, then not our ſight alone but all our ſences

that were diſpoſſeſſed that <hi>the ſpirits crying with a loud voice came out
of many that were poſſeſſed.</hi> I report me to thoſe that were preſent whi
ther ymediatly before the diſpoſſeſſion of the aforeſaid perſons, they
heard not (for the ſpace of a quarter of an houre or thereabouts) the
moſt fearefull, ſtrange, vnnaturall, and loude cryes, that euer came to
their eares: and to them at <hi>Nottingham</hi> whither they eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then crying
out as men mightily aſtoniſhed at that they heard &amp; ſawe, <hi>Somers</hi> was
not heard farr aboue them all, although they were in nomber ſome
150. Tormented they were in their fits all the tyme of their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
more extreamly the day of their deliuerance, and moſt of all a
little before. In like manner cryes or ſcrikings they ſent out manye,
in the time of their poſſeſſion,<note place="margin">3 after the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; egreſſe of the ſpirit, the poſſeſſed lyeth as dead.</note> but neuer of that loudnes &amp; continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
to thoſe went from them at the inſtant the ſpirits went forth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly I demaund of the ſame perſons (which were to the nober
of ſome 40. at <hi>Cleworth:</hi> and 150. at <hi>Nottingham</hi>) whither according
to that is ſaid heere in <hi>S. Marke,</hi> they did not ymediatly after the end
of their torments and crying, <hi>ly as dead,</hi> and ſo continued for a good
ſpace. The reaſon hereof I take to be this for that the ſpirit, at his laſt
farewell (as I may ſay) tormenting the party to his vtmoſt: the body
after thoſe greuous torments lyeth at reſt, as it deſiereth and thus
lying, the party ſemeth to be as dead: wherein the cruelty &amp; mallice
of ſathan doth notably appeare: who when hee ſeeth that he can not
continue in man to torment him ſtill after his accuſtomed manner
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9806:32"/>
as he deſiereth, will yet do what he can to vexe him at his departure
or going out. Theſe 3. tokens or ſigns of diſpoſſeſſion were often ſene
and hard in <hi>K. Wright,</hi> who being not only poſſeſſed, but by her owne
defalt, in that the vcleane ſpirit returninge, found her empty, ſwept, &amp;
garniſhed, and ſo prepared and ready to receiue &amp; entertaine him, ſo
far was ſhe from reſiſting of him) repoſſeſſed, and that ſundry times,
at her ſeuerall diſpoſſeſſions, was euer extreamly tormented, ſchrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fearefully or cryed out, and then laye as dead.</p>
               <p>Hence I collect the diſpoſſeſſion of theſe Demoniakes: for as when
we ſee one handled after the ſame manner as they weare, who in the
ſcriptures are ſaid to be poſſeſſed with ſathan, we muſt needs confeſe,
that the ſame party is verily poſſeſed, even ſo, when we ſee one ſo aff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ected
and vſed as they were, who are ſaid in the ſcripture to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſeſſed,
we cannot chouſe, but ſay that they alſo beinge ſo affected are
diſpoſſeſſed in like manner, for <hi>Deſimilibus idem ſit Iudicium.</hi> And no
doubt but the holy ghoſt, in the particuler deſcribinge of the manner
of poſſeſſion &amp; diſpoſſeſſion, did leaue aſpeciall doctrine &amp; direction
to the Church in ſucceſciue ages, how to diſcerne &amp; to be aſſuered in
the like caſes. Thus doe I the rather Iudge, becauſe otherwiſe (yf the
partye now diſpoſſeſſed weare not ſo affected, as they were, who are
mentioned in the goſpell) when the people of God haue only praied,
or faſted &amp; praied, a long time together, they cannot knowe that the
party is deliuered, although it be ſo: For the eaſe of the party will not
ſuffice, becauſe that is vſuall with Demoniaks, ſeing the diuill vexeth
them, but at certaine times only, being otherwiſe out of their fites, as
well as any other body. ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e ſpeciall caſes excepted, wher the ſpirit mak
eth them blind, dumbe, deafe: or gathereth them all of a heape, ſo as
they goe * bowed together as we read in the goſpell,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 11.</note> or lame (as in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hath bine ſene in <hi>Th. Dar,</hi> who was lame and depriued of the
vſe of his legs for 13. weekes together or their abouts) wherfore it is
evident that yf in the diſpoſſeſſing of a man, the ſpirit ſhould not <hi>crie
aloud, rent him ſore,</hi> &amp; cauſe the party to <hi>lye as dead</hi> (which are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apparant ſigns of his egreſſe) then could not the party poſſeſſed be
diſcerned to be diſpoſſeſſed, and ſo God ſhold not haue that praiſe,
nor man receiue that profite by ſuch agreat worke, which othewiſe by
the certaine knowledg therof they ſhould. But now that God in his
infinite wiſdom, hath recorded theſe ſigns in his worde, and left them
for a direction vnto his Church herein, he hath prouided a remidi for
our weaknes, and furtherance of his owne glorye. furthermore I haue

Now this returne of Satan, and indeuoring to enter in againe, (reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
ſome of them alſo) as it argueth both their poſſeſſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion,
ſo likewiſe their expulſion of the wicked ſpirits by the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of God, in his appointed meaines. Greatly therfore doe they for
get themſelues, and that which in holy ſcripture is written concerning
this matter who hereby are offended, taking hence occaſion to think
and to ſpeake, that Somers was not poſſeſſed, but that he was a verye
counterfeite, or that he was not diſpoſſeſſed, becauſe he cane doe the
ſame thinges againe. Knowe wee not that the deuill beinge gone out
of a man, if returninge (which he will certainly doe) he finde him <hi>emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
ſweept and garmſhed,</hi> it is impoſſible to keepe him out, but he will
<hi>enter in and dwell there,</hi> yea <hi>with more and worſe</hi> then himſelfe? or cane
we be ignorant hereof, that <hi>Som.</hi> is emptie, ſwept, and garniſhed, if we
conſider of his intollerable ingratitude, for that mercy of God receiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
his abominable lyeing, ſlaundering, &amp; obſtinacie therin, to ſpeake
nothing of thoſe lewd prankes he playd in the <hi>Biſhope of Londons houſe
viz. stealing, whoring, running awaye &amp;c.</hi> as I haue bene credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
Seeing then that theſe thinges agree and fall out iuſt accordinge
to the ſcriptures, and that herein we ſe ſtill the ſcriptures fulfilled: why
are we not rather hereby confyrmed, then ſtumble therat as a rocke
of offence? neither is it to any purpoſe to obiect here as ſome do, that
this ſcripture is to be vnderſtod of aſperitual deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce out of the po
wer of the deuill. For howſoeuer that is ſaide here, is moſt true being
vnderſtod ſpirituallye, I meane of the ſpritualll deliuerance from the
power of Sathan: yet it is certayne the Lord onlye ſpeaketh of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
deliuerance, which is confirmed partlye by the occaſion and co
herence of this ſcripture, ariſing of the eiection of Sathan out of one
whom corporallye he had poſſeſſed, (and not ſperituallye more then
other men,<note place="margin">Luk 11. 4 &amp; 23</note>) as is noted by <hi>Luke:</hi> but chiefly by the text it ſelfe: wher
in <hi>the vncleane ſpirit</hi> is ſayde to <hi>goe out of a man, ſecondly, to enter in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">vers 25.</note>
both which ſpeaches are neuer vſed in the ſpirituall ſence: but
often, yea vſually in the other. And becauſe that is and hath bene ſaid
by me concerning Satan returne to repoſſeſſe the partie out of whom
he is caſt, is ſo vnſauerye vnto many, even as if there were noe ſuch
thinge reueiled, but was ſome conceit of myne. Let vs therfore add to
this ſcripture for further proofe therof, and confyrming of this truth,
that ſpeach of the Lord in the 9. of <hi>Marke: I charge thee, thou dumbe
and deafe ſpirit, come out of him, and enter no more into him.</hi> which charg
of <hi>entering no more into the child,</hi> our Sauiour would neuer haue giuen,
had not he knowne that Sathan would haue attempted it, and other
wiſe haue entered into him if he could: as beinge the propertie of the
diuill, to ſeeke to enter into them againe, out of whom he hath bene
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9806:33"/>
caſt. And ſurelye how can it be otherwiſe conſideringe the nature of
Satan, and his extreame malice towards man, eſpecially towards ſuch
as haue bene taken out of his power: whervpon it is ſaide before, that
<hi>ſeekinge reſt,</hi> after he is caſt out one, that is, ſeekinge ot praye vpon
and ſpoyle men, for that onlye bringeth <hi>reſt</hi> and quyet vnto him. <hi>he
findeth none,</hi> that is, none doth pleaſe or ſatiſfie him, in reſpect of the
recouering that man out of whom he hath bene caſt, ſuch and ſo vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
is his malice towardes him he hath loſt, and hither doth it carye
him. VVe maye likwyſe obſerue for the further confirmatyon of the
former expoſition, that in this place of <hi>Marke,</hi> (wher we cannot deny
but that Chriſt ſpeaketh of diſpoſſeſſion, and coporall poſſeſſion) is
mention of the <hi>ſpirits goinge out, and entringe in,</hi> as in the forme: ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and therefore the premiſes well wayed, and theſe ſayinge of the
Lord in <hi>Marke and Mathewe</hi> compared together, ther is great reaſon
we ſhould vnderſtand that of the vncleane ſpirits returne accordinge
to the letter. The *want of this returne of the ſpirits, doth among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

this was not generally true of all ſpirits for that there were ſome kind

In whether now of theſe reſpects ſoeuer they Apoſtles vſed prayer in
the miracles they wrought whatſoeuer they were, it is cleare that ther
faith being ſtrong, much more being ſo ſtrong as might be, they need
not to haue vſed prayer. yf then the Apoſtles ſaith being great, they
neede not to haue prayed, as in the doinge of other miracles, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the caſting out of ſatan, but as they ſaw it profitable to others:
much leſſe nede they to haue vſed prayer and faſtynge. And if theire
faith beinge ſtrong, they could and did worke miracles, and namlye
caſt out diuels without any prayer at all, and ſome of the worſt kynd
in all liklihood, there were in that great number they caſt forth: much
more their faith beinge ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they could and did worke miracles and
caſt out diuils of they worſt kynd without prayer and faſtyng. That
therfore, which <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Thyreus</hi> here affirme can not be true.</p>
               <p>Againe the wordes of our ſauiour are againſt this interpretation.<note place="margin">math. 17. 20.</note>

becauſe of the words ve. 21. exclud the ſame. As if Chriſt had ſaid: yf
your faith be as agraine of muſtard ſeed: ye ſhall not onlye be able to
doe the ſame. that I now haue done, &amp; yow through the want of faith
could not doe: but any thing els whatſoeuer, though it were as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and impoſſible a thinge as it is to remoue a mountaine. They A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
then by vertue of their miraculous faith could doe any thing,
and therfore caſt out any diuill.</p>
               <p>Moreouer when we conſider of the power &amp; authority that Chriſt
gaue they Apoſtls ouer vncleane ſpirits, to caſt them out, and how ac
cording to the ſame, they preuayled ſo mightelye agaynſt the deuils,
which were ſoe ſubdued vnto them, as that the <hi>cariynge of kerchefs or
handkerchefs from their bodyes,</hi> cauſed they euill ſpirites to goe out of
men: we cannot ſe how their faith not failyng them, Beelzebub ſhold
be able to withſtand theire liulye voyce and commaund giuen in the
name of Ieſus Chriſt, though no prayer &amp; faſting were vſed by them.
Finally, we muſt remember that this power of they Apoſtles ouer vn
cleane ſpirits,<note place="margin">Actes 19. 12. chap. 9. 1.</note> was not thus bounded and limited by Chriſt who gaue
it them, but reached it ſelfe further, even to and ouer all euill ſpirites
whatſoeuer, as <hi>Luke</hi> witneſſeth ſayinge. <hi>then called he his twelue diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

diſeaſes:</hi> ſo that if he were adiuil they had power to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

leſt this pretenſe ſhould be left vnto vs, that they had power ouer all
wicked ſpirits, in that by faſtynge and prayer (though not otherwiſe)
they were able to caſt out the worſt kind of ſpirits, as others without
that meanes: we muſt remember that with this power ouer diuils yea
<hi>all diuils,</hi> Chriſt ioyneth the healing of diſeaſes: as appeareth alſo by
the 10 of <hi>Math.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">verſe 1.</note> when it is ſaid that <hi>Ieſus calling his twelue diſciples vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

tue of the aforeſayd guifte and power, they were able and did with a
word, withont any more adoe, heale the ſicke, cleanſe they, leapers, re
ſtore ſight to they blynd, &amp;c. even ſo by vertue of the ſame gift and
power, with their word or commaund in the name of Ieſus, (without
any further adoo by faſtinge and praying,) they were able to caſt out
all deuils, and did as occaſion offered, yf their faith failed not, which is
further confirmed out of <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>verily verily I ſay vnto you, he that be

many. that Chriſt hauing ſhewed his diſciples in they wordes before,
that it came through the defect and weaknes of their faith, that they

the ſame are meaines appoynted of God thervnto: and when wee ſee
that the haue the ſame effect with many, that they are ordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines

perticular ordinances of God are mentyoned in the ſcriptures: even
ſo when we ſee that by prayer, and faſtynge and prayer: Sathan is caſt
out of ſome, and they therby deliuered from all theire vexations and
torments which before from him they had indured, and that not ſom
fewe but ſundry at this time, and many heretofore in former ages, as
in <hi>Turtullian, Criprian, Chriſoſtome,</hi> there times: we may hence gather
and aſſure our ſelues, that God hath appoynted prayer and faſtynge,
and prayer, as meanes (and that ordinarye) to caſt out the diuill of the
bodyes of men when he is in them, and as a ſupernaturall meadicine
to heale this ſupernaturall diſeaſe, whervnto the bodye of man is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

ſhoulde be wrought) for it is a wonderful worke and not only aboue

in <hi>Turkey</hi> or amonge the <hi>Pagans</hi> in the faith and that without al mean
es it is certain that that mans conuertion was miraculus: and yt when
one in the church is brought to the faith by the miniſtri of the word,
his conuerſion is not miraculus. That a child ſhould be conceaued &amp;
ſo framed in the wombe of the mother as it is &amp; after brought forth
aliuinge creature, indewed with reaſon and vnderſtandinge, is a thing
greatly to be wondred at, yet foraſmuch as the ſame is brought to paſ
by a meane ordained of God to that ende, no man counteth it a mi-racle
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9806:40"/>
for then looke how many children weare borne, we ſhoulde haue ſo
many miracles. but imagin a childe conceaued without the knowledg
of man: as the conception of our Sauiour was, then euery on wil grant
ſuch conception to be miraculus. The like may be ſaide of the contin

is alſo to be vnderſtood of others prayinge in the like caſe:) For then
without prayer the miracles could not haue bene wrought, which we
muſt be farr from imagining: but in regard of the people which were
preſent, as they ſaw it profitable for them and this is exprſlye noteed
by our Sauiour, for it is ſaid, that he prayed <hi>becauſe of the people that
ſtood by,</hi>

his prayinge would haue the people more fully vnderſtand then they
could by the charge he commonly vſed, that that he did, was not by
his godlines or power, but by the power of him one whom he called.
It is to be obſerued alſo: that howſoeuer they vſed ſome ſhort prayer
before, to the end aforſayde, yet when they came to the doinge of the
worke, they did not ſupplycate: but commaund ſuch a thinge to be
done, as hauing power and ahthoritie thervnto. (the one from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the other from chriſt.) <hi>Lazarus come forth: Tabitha ariſe:</hi> and it was
ſo. But in our caſe we continued ſtill in intrating and beſeechyng the
Lord: who in his good time was plaſed to doe accordyng to that wee
deſiered: whereby we witneſſed vnto men, that we haue receiued no
guift or power to caſt out diuils, as the Apoſtles had, and that we doe
no miracle, but only deſier Chriſt ſittinge at the right hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

to haue expelled deuils. And a third is, It is reported in hiſtories that
they haue often bene deluded when they haue gone about to caſte
out deuills. wherby it is cleare that they denye to vs, all expulſion of

               <p>But ſeeinge the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> glory ſo much in the diſpoſſeſſing of

with them, as they beare the world in hand it is. wher they muſt firſt
knowe that it is not denied or doubted off by vs, but graunted, that
by their exorciſts &amp; exorciſing the poſſeſſed, among them haue eaſe
and deliuerance from the evill ſpirits formerlie vexing and poſſeſſing
them: but the doubt and queſtion is, whether the caſt and driue out
Sathan. For my owne parte I will not denye, but that a true deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the poſſeſſed may in the papacie. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I conſider that

by a papiſtes an Idolater, may not obtaine the like, I meane a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
bleſſinge of the Lord, or the remouing of a temporall Iudgment.
Yet notwithſtanding, when on the other ſide I turne my eve to the
meanes they vſe, I cannot but thinke, that when their poſſeſſed are
helped, they ſpirites are not caſt out, but of themſelues goe forth, as
ſeruinge greatly for their owne advantage, and vpholdinge of there

ſuch a caſe conſidering it is the beſt and ſureſt meanes that god him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

though the hand of god lye and remayne vpon vs, or many of vs &amp;
many bleſſings be wanting vnto vs: when we are wantinge and come
ſhort in the performance of this duty: for who knoweth not that as
the papiſts are too common and ſuper ſtitious herein on the one ſide
ſo we on the other are too ſhort and prophane: It ſauoreth of preciſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes,
and of the ſpirit, to be giuen much to faſting and prayer. Is not
this the faſting that god hath choſen to looſe the bandes of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,<note place="margin">Iſa 58, 6. 7,</note>
to take of the heauy burthen, and to let the oppreſſed goe free?
Is there any better abſtinence then this? And is not this the true faſte?

this faſting or preciſe abſtaining from all meate and drinck, and
