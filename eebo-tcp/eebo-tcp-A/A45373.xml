            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> was concerned in the Designe of Bringing in of Popery and Arbitrary Government, may appear by these following Particulars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>FIrst, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1669, when he knew that the Duke had changed his Religion, he procured an Act in <hi>Scotland</hi> for Asserting the Kings Supremacy; which he made the Presbyterian-party believe was to empower the King to put down Episcopacy, and set up Presbytery, (the very words of it.) The disposal of the External Government of the Church, is put absolutely in the Kings Power; as also all Ecclesiastical Meetings and Meeters are to be ordered by the King.</p>
               <p>Now the acknowledgment of the Pope is a great part of the Ecclesiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; besides, the other words are so comprehensive, that all Popery may be brought in at that door. Soon after this, he entered into a firm Friendship with the Head of the Popish party.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>At his next Session of Parliament, which was after Madam's being at <hi>Dover,</hi> in 1670, to shew his farther Kindness to that Religion, he put in words in the 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Act of that Session, against Withdrawers from publick Worship; which secured Papists from all troubles: for the Act runs onely against his Majesties Subjects of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; for that Papists are expressly Excepted, and the words he put in with his own hand in the draught of that Act.</p>

               <head>III.</head>
               <p>Whereas he first procured the Act that was past <hi>Anno</hi> 1667, that offerred the King an Army of 22000 men to be brought into <hi>England</hi> for any Cause in which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties

Honour, Power, and Greatness was concerned; which was generally passed as a Complement, and continued so till the year 1669, that other designe being projected in <hi>England</hi> by the Papists.</p>
               <p>He to be ready to second that, raised this Army, and procured another Act, which is the second in the first Session of the Parliament held by him; by which the former Act was not onely confirmed, but it was ordered that this Army should obey the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Council, without naming the King at all: which, as he has managed it, is upon the matter himself. And of late, before the discovery of the Plot, he designed to convert the 22000 men to a standing Army, as an Addition to the new Forces raised last Summer, to be constantly maintained by all Subjects; contrary to the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the first or second Acts of Parliament relating to that purpose, and directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Fundamental Constitutions of the Nation, to impose Burthens upon it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consent of Parliament.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="part">
               <head>IV.</head>
               <p>When he went down <hi>Anno</hi> 1673, to see if he could draw down this Army to <hi>England</hi> (finding he could not effect it, that Nation not being able to support this Tyranny longer) he first wearied the Members of Parliament with often Adjournments, and finding in the end that Artifice and other tricks would not do, he dissolved the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he might proceed there, consonant to the Councel he gave here; and set up a Bare-fac'd Arbitrary Power there, which he has so much advised and pressed here; and has ever since taken all the ways he could fall on to force the Nation to a Rebellion, by illegal Imprisonments, unjust Accusations, false Reports made to the King, taking away from the Subjects the right of Propriety, their limitable Jurisdictions by the Councils order, grounded upon Letters procured by him from the King, and put in execution by his brother <hi>Halton,</hi> by wrongful turning out Bishops, Ministers of State, Magistrates, and others, by cruel and illegal Sentences, Banishments, and Fines; some whereof he disposed to Pensioners Relations of his own, by Grants obtained from the King here, which bear date before the Fines were judicially imposed in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And likewise by bringing a man to die, whom he had perswaded to confess upon hopes of Life; and afterwards forswore that he had promised, though it stands yet registered upon the Councils Book. By sending Shipfuls to be Slaves in English Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which he justified here at Council-board in <hi>Whitehal.</hi> By imposing Bonds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Law. And above all, by sending an Army of 9 or 10000 men, most of them Highlanders, to lie upon Free quarter, and rob and spoil a Country that was in no Rebellion, nor could any colour of saying they intended any, be ever found now or since. This he did last year, thinking that would certainly make them rebel, and so give a just Cause for keeping up a standing Army both there and here. And that being at the time when the Papists thought the Plot so neer perfection, was certainly in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with them having prepared above 8000 Horse and Foot, with Officers of his own stamp, to execute his designe. It is more than probable that it was for the Intelligence his Lady gave of this, that the Cardinal of <hi>Norfolk</hi> sent his thanks to her.</p>

               <p>Whereas there are but few Papists in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he hath given these all the Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he could. The Earl of <hi>Aboins,</hi> who was oft complained of to the Council by the Bishops for keeping many Priests in his house, and being a main Stickler for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, he made a Privy-Counsellor, and gave him a Pension, though he has never since gone to Church, nor received the Sacrament. The Earl of <hi>Northdale,</hi> another furious Papist, in Command of the new Forces he raised (and so is Lord and King) and both those two were last year employed by him in the plundering of the West of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. And there being in <hi>Scotland</hi> but five Noblemen that are Papists, four of them have been supported and maintained by him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>He was a principal Instrument in procuring the Toleration of Popery, and courted them into sworn Friendship with the Lord <hi>Clifford;</hi> and preferred the Declaration and other the Kings Edicts at the Council-board, to Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He pressed the King to break with his Parliament, and maintain the Declaration, and to take the Great Seal from the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> for giving him better Councel; of which he has often boasted. He became also an Enemy to the Earl of <hi>Arlington,</hi> upon the same account, and has ever since had an intire friendship with the Lord Treasurer, for promoting those ends he supported the last year against the just Complaints the Scotch Lords made for Free Quarter, and other barbarous usages which they met with, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

So much did he contribute to serve the French Kings designes; and particularly in the year 1667. when complaints were made to the King by Spanish Ministers, that <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Leavies for <hi>France</hi> were a breach of Treaty, His Majesties Commissioners orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Proclamation to be sent down immediately for the discharging of them; but the Duke of <hi>Lauderdaile</hi> dispatcht an Express to his Brother <hi>Halton</hi> secretly, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him that the Proclamation was coming, and that it should be kept up, until the Leavied Souldiers should be shipt and sent away, and then published; which was accordingly performed. But for all the hast they made to sayl, the wind detained some of their Vessels in the Road after the Proclamation, and did drive others back, which had been a good way gone, yet none durst stop or trouble them, for fear of <hi>Halton,</hi> who had always promoted those Leavies, and had signed particular War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to several Prison-keepers, for delivering their Prisons to the French Officers. He lived at that time in such intimacy with the French Embassadour, that they were never asunder. He sent his Nephew to make Campaigne in the French Army, and wrote to the English Embassadour to present him to the King; and tell him, <hi>That he had sent the dearest thing he had to his service, and if he had anything dearer he would have sent it.</hi>
