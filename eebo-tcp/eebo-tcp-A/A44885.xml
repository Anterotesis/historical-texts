            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:51345:3"/>
Asia, having been most diligently searched into by the <hi>Portugals;</hi> as the Northerne parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> have in like manner been by our owne Country-men. Among whom, the first that adventured on the discovery of these parts, were, <hi>Sir Hugh Willoughby,</hi> and <hi>Richard Chanceler:</hi> after them, <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Borough.</hi> And farther yet, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these, did <hi>Arthur Pet,</hi> and <hi>Charles Jackman</hi> discover these parts.

            </p>
            <p>When their attempts succeeded not this way; their next designe was then to try<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what might be done on the Northerne Coasts of <hi>America:</hi> and the first undertaker of these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>oyages was <hi>Mr. Martin Frobisher:</hi> who was afterwards seconded by <hi>M John Davis.</hi> By meanes of all which Navigations, many errours of the Ancients, and their great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance was discovered.</p>
            <p>But now that all these their endeavours succeeded not, our Kingdome at that time
<pb facs="tcp:51345:4"/>
being well furnished, in ships, and impatient of idleness: they resolved at length to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon other parts. And first <hi>Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey Gilbert,</hi> with great courage &amp; Forces attempted to make a discovery of those parts of <hi>America,</hi> which were yet unknown to the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> but the successe was not answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Which attempt of his, was afterward more prosperously prosecuted, by that honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Gentleman, <hi>Sir Walter Rawleigh:</hi> by whose meanes <hi>Virginia,</hi> was first discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto us, the Generall of his Forces being <hi>Sir Richard Greenvile:</hi> which Countrey was afterwards very exactly surveighed and described by <hi>M. Thomas Harriot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither have our Country-men within these limits bounded their Navigations For <hi>Sir Francis Drake,</hi> passing through the Straites of <hi>Megellane,</hi> and bearing up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Westerne Coasts of <hi>America,</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as far as <hi>50.</hi> degrees of Northern Latitude. After whom, <hi>Mr. Thomas Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish,</hi> tracing the same steps, hath purchased himself as large a monument of his fame, with all succeeding ages. I shall not need to reckon with these, our Countryman, <hi>Sir John Mandivel,</hi> who almost <hi>300.</hi> years since, in a <hi>33.</hi> yeares Voyage by land, took a strict
<pb facs="tcp:51345:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
view of all <hi>India, China, Tartary,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> within the Regions adjoying.</p>
            <p>By these, &amp; the like expeditions by Sea, the matter is brought to that pass, that our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Nation may seem to contend, even with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>Portugall</hi> himself, for the glory of Navigation. And without all doubt, had they but taken along with them, a very reasonable competency of skill in Geometry, and Astronomy: they had by this, gotten themselves a farr more honourable name at Sea, then they. And indeed, it is the opinion of many understanding men, that their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours have taken the lesse effect, meerely through ignorance in these Sciences. That therefore there might be som smal accrwment to their study and paines, that take delight in these Arts; I have composed this smal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise: which, that it may be for their profit, I earnestly desire. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two kinds of Instruments, by which Artificers haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the figure of this so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and various fabricke of the whole Universe, might most apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee expressed, and, as it were, at once presented to the view. The one, exhibiting this Idea in a round solid, is called a</hi> Globe, <hi>or</hi> Sphaere: <hi>The other, expressing the same in a plaine, they tearme a</hi> Planisphaere, <hi>or</hi> Map, <hi>Both of which, having been long since invented by the Ancients, have yet even to our times, in a continued succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, received still more ripenesse and perfection. The Sphaere or</hi> Globe, <hi>and the use thereof, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by</hi> Diodorus Siculus <hi>to have been first found out by</hi> Atlas <hi>of</hi> Libya: <hi>whence afterward sprung the Fable, of his bearing up the Heavens with his shoulders. Others attribute the inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the same to</hi> Thales. <hi>And it was afterward brought to perfection by</hi> Crates, <hi>(of whom</hi> Strabo <hi>makes mention)</hi> Archimedes, <hi>and</hi> Proclus; <hi>but most of all, by</hi> Ptolomy; <hi>according to whose rules, and observations especially, succeeding times composed their</hi> Globes, <hi>as</hi> Leontius Mechanicus <hi>affirmes. And now there hath been much perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:51345:10"/>
added to the same, in these our later times, by the industry, and diligence</hi> Gemma Frisius, <hi>and</hi> Gerardus Mercator; <hi>as it may appear by those Globes, that were set forth at</hi> London, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 1593. <hi>so that now there seemes not to bee any thing that may be added to them. The</hi> Planisphaere <hi>indeed is a fine invention, and hath in it wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full variety of workm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nship, if so bee, that the composition of it be rightly deduced out of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall, and Opticall principles: and it wants not it's great delightfullnesse, and beauty also. But yet that Other, being tbe more ancient, hath also the priority in Nature, and is of the most convenient forme; and therefore more aptly accommodated for the understanding and fancy, (not to speak any thing of the beauty, and gracefulnesse of it) for it representeth the things themselves, in proper ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuiue figurs. For as concerning the figure of the Heavens, whether it were round, was scarcely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever questioned by any. So likewise, touching the figure of the Earth, notwithstanding many, and sundry opinions have, been broached among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philosophers, some of them contending for a plain, others an hollow, others a Cubic all, and some a Pyramidall forme: yet this opinion of it's Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with greatest consent of reason, at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, the rest being all exploded. Now wee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it to be round, yet so, as that wee also admit of it's inequalities, by reason of those so great emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences of hills, and depression of vallies.</hi> Erato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes, <hi>as hee is cited by</hi> Strabo <hi>in his first book, saith, that the fashion of the Earth is like that of a Globe, not so exactly round as an artificiall Globe
<pb facs="tcp:51345:10"/>
is, but that it hath certain inequalities. The earth cannot be said to be of an exact orbicular forme, by reason of somany high hilles, and low plaines: as</hi> Pliny <hi>rightly observes. And</hi> Strabo <hi>also in his first book of his</hi> Geography, <hi>saith, that the Earth and the water together, make up one sphaericall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, not of so exact a forme, as that of the Heavens, although not much unlike it. This assertion of the roundnesse of the Earth, with the intervening Sea, is confirmed also by these reasons. For first, that it is round from East to West is proved by the Sun, Moon, and the other Stars, which are seen to rise, and set. first with those that inhabit more Eastwardly, and afterward with them that are farther West. The Sun riseth with the</hi> Persians <hi>that dwell in the Easterne parts, foure hours soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then it doth with those that dwell in</hi> Spaine, <hi>more Westward: as</hi> Cleomedes <hi>affirmes. The same is also proved by the observing of Eclipses, especially those of the Moon; which although they happen at the same time, are not yet observed in all places at the same houre of the day or night, but the hour of their appearing is later with them, that inhabite Eastward, then it is with the more West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne people. An Eclipse of the Moon, which</hi> Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy <hi>reports</hi> lib. 1 Geogr. cap. 4. <hi>To have been seen in</hi> Arbela, <hi>(a town in</hi> Assyria,) <hi>at the fift houre of the night; the same was observed at</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage <hi>at the second houre. In like manner an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse of the Sun, which was observed in</hi> Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia <hi>to be betwixt</hi> 7. <hi>and</hi> 8. <hi>of the Clock; was seen by</hi> Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>bulo, <hi>a Captain in</hi> Armenia, <hi>betwixt</hi> 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>and</hi> 11. <hi>as it is related by</hi> Pliny. <hi>Now that it is
<pb facs="tcp:51345:11"/>
also of a sphaericall figure from North to South, may be clearly demonstrated by the risings, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, elevations and depressions of the Stars, and Poles. The bright Star that shines so resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, in the upper part of the sterne of the Ship,</hi> Argo, <hi>and is called by the</hi> Greeeks <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>is scarcely to bee seen at all in</hi> Rhodes, <hi>unlesse it bee from some eminent high place: yet the same is seen very plainly in</hi> Alexandria, <hi>as being elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Horizon, about the fourth part of a signe: as</hi> Proclus <hi>affirms in the end of his book,</hi> de Sphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. <hi>For I read it,</hi> Conspicuè cernitur; <hi>not as it is commonly,</hi> Prorsus non cernitur; <hi>notwithst an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that both the Greek text, and also the Latine translation are against it. Another argument may bee taken, from the figure of the shadow, in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse of the Moon, caused by the interposition of the Earths opacous body: Which shadow being Sphaericall, cannot proceed from any other then a round Globous body: as it is demonstrated unto us out of Opticall principles. But this one reason is beyond all exception: that those that make toward the Land at the Sea, shal first of all descry the tops of the hilles onely, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d afterwards, as they draw nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to shore, they see the lower parts of the same, by little and little: Which cannot proceed from any other cause, then the gibbosity of the Earths su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for those other opinions of the hollow, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicall, Pyramidall, and plaine figure of the Earth, you have them all largely examined both in</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (Ptolomies <hi>Interpreter)</hi> Cleomedes, <hi>and almost in all our ordinary Authours of the Sphaere:
<pb facs="tcp:51345:11"/>
together with the reasons why they are rejected. Yet that old conceit of the plainnesse of the Earths superficies, is again now at last,</hi> tanquam Cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be recocta, <hi>set forth in a new dresse, and thrust upon us by</hi> Franciscus Patricius; <hi>who by some few eold arguments, and misunderstood experiments, endeavours to confirme his own, and consequently to overthrow that other received opinion of the sphaericall figure of the Earth. I shall onely light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch at his chiefest arguments; my present purpose and intention, suffering mce not to insist long on the confutation of them. And f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rst of all, the great beight of Hills, and the depression of vallies, so much disagreeing from the evennesse of the plain parts of the Earth, scem to make very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the roundnesse of the Earth. Who can hear with patience, saith hee, that those huge high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of</hi> Norway, <hi>or the mountaine</hi> Slotus, <hi>which lies under the Pole, and is the highest in the world, should yet be thought to have the same su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>he Sealying beneath it? This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being the chiefest reason, that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y seem to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the opinion of the Earth, and Seas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up one sphaericall body; let us examine it a little more nearly, and consider, how great this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality may bee, that seems to make so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the evennessc of this Yerrestitall Globe. Many strange, and almost incredible things are reported by</hi> Aristotle, Mela, Pliny, <hi>and</hi> Solinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, <hi>an Hill in</hi> Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, <hi>and of</hi> Casius <hi>in</hi> Syria, <hi>as also of another of the same name in</hi> Arabia, <hi>and of the monntaine</hi> Caucasus. <hi>And among the rest, one of the most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
<pb facs="tcp:51345:12"/>
things which they have observed of the mountain</hi> Athos, <hi>is, that whereas it is situate in</hi> Macedony, <hi>it casts a shadow into the market place at</hi> Myrrhina, <hi>a Town in the Island</hi> Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos; <hi>from whence</hi> Athos <hi>is distant</hi> 86. <hi>miles. But for as much as</hi> Athos <hi>lies Westward from</hi> Lemnos, <hi>as may appeare out of</hi> Ptolomies <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, no marvail that it casts so large a shadow: seeing that wee may observe by dayly experience, that as well when the Sunriseth, as when it sets, the shadowes are always extraordinary long. But that which</hi> Pliny, <hi>and</hi> Solinus <hi>report of the same mountain, I should rather account among the rest of their fabulous Stories; where as they affirm it to be so high, that it is thought to be above that region of the aire whence the rain is wont to fall. And this opinion (say they) was first grounded upon a report that there goes, that the ashes which are left upon the Altars on the top of this hill, are never washed away, but are found remaining in heapes upon the same. To this may be added ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther testimony, out of the Excerpts of the seventh booke of</hi> Strabo, <hi>where it is said, that those that inhabite the top of this mountain, do see the Sun three hours sooner, then those that live neare the Sea side.

But to proceed yet a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, least wee should seem too sparing herein, and to restrain them within narrower limits then wee ought: we will adde to the height of hills, the depth also of the Sea.

is indeed a very ridiculous one.

But this observation of his, hee onely nakedly proposed, without any demonstration at all. But I have observed, that the Starrs have not (as</hi> Hipparchus <hi>and</hi> Ptolomy <hi>dreame) gone on to the subsequent parts: and that the</hi> Cynosure, <hi>or Polar Star was at the same distanoe from Pole in</hi> Eudoxus <hi>his time, as it is at this day. For proof of which assertion I have collected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny instances. which being granted, the procession of the AEquinoctiall point must necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51345:33"/>
so the Poles of the AEquinoctiall must be divers from the Poles of the world. for the Pole of the World is immoveable; but this moveable. Besides, all the Meridian circles do passe through the Poles of the AEquinoctiall: and in the superficies of stone Dialls, the Meridian line, which is drawn for the placing of the Sun Diall, is understood to passe through the Poles of the AEquinoctiall; which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by all men, and is most true. But because the Poles of the AEquinoctiall are moveable, the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian line. that passeth through the same, must bee moveable also. And therefore it necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that after some certain number of yeares, there wil be no further use of these Meridian lines in the designing of the hours in Dialls; but a new Meridian line must be taken, and the situation of the Diall altered, though not the Diall it self. We may therefore conclude, that the Sun Dialls, after some certain time, will prove false, unlesse the Meridian line be rectified. This is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the very principles of the Mathematitcks. But besides this, we have some notable instances out of the Ancients, which do manefestly evince, that after some tearm of yeares, Sun Dialls doe not agree to their first designations: all which I have diligently collected. These things thus demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I proposed them to these Mathematicians, that, because the whole businesses of the Magneticall Needle had dependance upon these Meridians, they would consider, whether or no, this doctrine, by me first proposed, might open the way to the matter in hand, &amp;c.</hi>

This is the testimony of <hi>Strabo,</hi> which is the very same that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Merinus</hi> affirme; saving that both in this place, and elsewhere, he always assignes 700. Furlongs in the Earth, to a degree in the Heavens, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine of <hi>Eratosthenes:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as both <hi>Marinus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> allow but 500. onely: os which wee shall speak more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

                  </hi> 51. ½ <hi>but it doth not appear by any certain testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to have been ever greater. Whence may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that</hi> Aratus, <hi>whome we have set in the first place, who assignes</hi> 24. <hi>gr. speakes with the largest, and as it were, at randome, and (as our learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour hath also observed of</hi> Strabo, Proclus <hi>and</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontius Mechanicus) <hi>not so accurately as he should have.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are also two other lesser circles des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed in an equall distance from the Poles, to that of the Tropickes from the AEquator?
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51345:37"/>
which circles take their denomination from the Pole on which they border. So that one of <note place="margin">The Arct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ique, and Antarct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ique circles.</note> them is called the <hi>Arctick</hi> or North circle; and and the oppsite circle the <hi>Antarctick</hi> or South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne. In these circles the Poles of the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique are fixed, the Solsticiall Colure crossing them in the same place. <hi>Strabo, Proclus, Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> all Greek Authors, and some of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines also, assigne no certain distance to these circles from the Poles: but make them various and mutable, according to the diversity of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Pole, or diverse position of the Sphaere: so that one of them must be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be described round about that Pole which is elevated, and to touch the very Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and is therefore the greatest of all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels that are alwayes in sight: and the other must be imagined, as drawn in an equall dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the opposite Pole; and this is the greatest of those Parallels that are alwaies hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>PONT. <hi>The Arctique, and Antarctique cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles do shew,</hi> 1. <hi>The Poles of the Zodiaque and their distance from the Poles of the world,</hi> 2. <hi>They doe distinguish the frigid</hi> Zones <hi>from the Temperate, and with the Tropiques and AEquator they helpe to divide the whole Heaven into five parts or regions which they call</hi> Zones.</p>
               <p>Besides these circles expressed in the <hi>Globe,</hi> there are also some certain other circles in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar use with the Practicall Astronomers, which they call <hi>Verticall</hi> circles. These are <note place="margin">The Verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call circles,</note> greater circles drawn from the <hi>Verticall</hi> point

through the Horizon, in what number you please: and they are called by the <hi>Arabians A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuth,</hi> which appellation is also in common use among our ordinary Astronomers. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of these circles is supplied by the help of a Quadrant of Altitude, which is a thin plate of brass divided into 90. degrees. This Quadrant must be applied to the <hi>vetrex</hi> of any place, when you desire to use it, so that the lowest end of it, noted with the number of 90. may just touch the Horizon in every place. This Quadrant is made moveable, that so it may be fastened to the verticall point of any place.</p>
               <p>PONT. <hi>Concerning the moveableness or muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Arctique, and Antarctique Circles,</hi> Joseph Scaliger <hi>reports himself to be the first that observed it, out of the Ancient Greek Authors: as you may see in his Comentaries upon</hi> Manilius, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, and published by himself a little before his death. Neither doth he think that any ancient La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Author within</hi> 400. <hi>yeares after those Greek Writers, nor scarcely any before</hi> Sacrobosco's <hi>time, can be found to have determined them to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable. But because there are many excellent things to be met withall in that pssage of his, and that he sets down the same by way of demonstration; I have thought it not impertinent, seeing our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath given a touch at it, to set down</hi> Scaliger's <hi>opin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Fur such an Arctick circle there cannot be, but only to those that inhabit</hi> Syene <hi>by the Nile: for with them, the Pole is elevated</hi> 23. <hi>gr.</hi> 30. <hi>m. These things considered, the Arctick cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ought not to have any place in the Materiall</hi> Globe, <hi>unlesse it be made for the inclination of some certain place: otherwise there can be no such Arct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icke circle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These things, when I first proposed in</hi> Aquitaine, <hi>where were many, both learned and unlearned, Noble and Paedants, it cannot be imagined with with what scorne and hissing they entertained them. And at length, when my constancy would not give place to their stubborne ignorance; I thought I should have been beaten among them. Yet at last, having nothing to defend themselves with, they said, that, however it were, these circles were use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the distinction of the Zones. At which answere of theires, I had much adoe to forbeare laughing. For this division of the world into Zones, is quite cashiered in these our times, when as the whole world hath at length been fully discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51345:40"/>
by the Navigations of the</hi> Portugals <hi>and</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. <hi>And for this purpose, to confute these Mathematicians, I alledged these words of</hi> Strabo, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Polybus <hi>therefore did not, (saith he) in making certain Zones, which are to be limited by the Arcticke circles: two of which line under the said Arctiques, and other terminated betwixt the Arctiques, and the Tropiques. For this is a Maxime: That determinate things cannot bee bound by uncertain and indeterminate limits. This their Philosophy therefore is vaine and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous. But yet their impudence ends not so. For you shall hardly meet with any of those Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, that will not presently conclude him madd, that should but dare to descend any whit from the doctrine of</hi> John de Sacrobosco, <hi>in the point of these circles. Yet one of them, not long since, being as it seemes, advised thereto by the former edition of</hi> Manilius, <hi>confesseth by the way, and as it were unwillingly, that the Ancients made other use of the Arcticke circle s; then wee now doe. And yet he would not be thought to have learned this of me: notwithstanding these kind of fellows are the most ignorant in matters of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, in the world. Who should be the first broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of this ridiculous conceit, I cannot guesse, otherwise, then that it must needs bee some latine Writer, and thaet</hi> 400. <hi>yeares later then any of the Greeke Authors. And I know not whether
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51345:40"/>
any other taught this doctrine before</hi> John de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobosco: <hi>ceartainely he is the most ancient I can readily think on. As therefore our men are in an errour, in making the Arcticke to bee an Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table circle, so likewise are the Ancients, and those among us that follow them, to be blamed, for making this circle to be Parallel to the other three: whereas the Parallel circles in a Sphaere have the same Pole with the Sphere it self. But the Pole of the Arctique is the same alwayes with the Pole of the World: whereas the Pole of the other three altereth, as do the Tropicall, and Equinoctiall points. For the AEquinoctiall and Tropicall points doe anticipate their places in the Zodiaque: insomuch, that in a certain tearme of yeares, they are removed forward a degree. Now the AEqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, and Tropicall circles, are no other then what are described by those points, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are moveable. Therefore are their Poles also moveable. But wee shall suffer for these things too, I doubt not, untill that length of time shall have beaten this into the heads of such men, with whom strength of reason is able to prevaile nothing at all:</hi>

one point, and is seen also above the earth. And the Antarctique he defines thus. The Antartique is a circle equall and Parallel to the Arctique, and lies wholy hid under the earth. These circles therefore, in the opinion of</hi> Proclus, <hi>are moveable, andare described by a point that toucheth the Horizon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Pole that is nearest to it: and they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so changed, with the Horizon, as often as a man mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth either Northward or Southward.

The next is, that with those that inbabite within twenty three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and an halfe of the Pole, (which is as much as the Suns greatest declination from the AEquator) the Arctique circle will bee the same with the Tropique of</hi> Cancer, <hi>and the Antartique with that of</hi> Capricorne. <hi>So that they will have but two lesser circles or Parallels, which will make but three Zones in all, two cold ones; and a torrid. For in this confusion of the circles, there will be no distinction betwixt the cold, and the temperate Zones, And which is more, they that dwell under the AEquator. will have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51345:41"/>
no Arctiques at all. Lastly there are certain acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents proper to, certain Climates, which cannot he assigned them, unlesse there bee fixed and certain limets set to distinguish the cold Zones from the temperate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for example, If it be enquired, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties are incident to those that inhabite betwixt the Tropique of</hi> Cancer <hi>and the Arctique circle: and what to those under the Arctique circle it self: and lastly, what betwixt the Arctique circle and the Pole of the World. To these questions there can be no answere made without these fixed Arctique cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Besides this, it would take away much light and futhera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These and the like inconveniences are easily avoided, by placeing the Arctique circle, as usually it is, on the Poles of the Zodiaque.

The first is of those, that have etheir Pole for their Verticall point: for with these, the AEquator and Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon are Parallel to each other, or indeed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but one circle betwixt them both. The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> is of those whose <hi>Zenith</hi> is under the AEquator. The third agreeth to all other places else. The first of these situations is called, a Parallel Sphaere: the second a Right: and the third an Oblique Sphaere. Of these severall kinds of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, the two first are simple: but the third is manifold and diverse, according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of latitude of places. Each of these have their peculiar properties.</p>

               <p>Those that in habite in a Parallel Sphere, see not the Sun or other Stars, either rising or set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or higher or lower, in the diurnall revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Besides, seeing that the Sun in his yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motion traverseth the whole Zodiaque, wich is divided by the AEquator into 2. equall parts: one whereof lieth toward the North, and the other toward the South: by this means it comes to passe, that while the Sun is in his course through those signes that are nearest their verticall Pole, all this while hee never setteth, and so maketh but one continued Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall day; which is about the space of six months. And so contrarywise, while he run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth over the other remoter signes, lying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the opposite Pole, hee maketh a long continuall night of the like space of time, or thereabout. Now at such time as the Sun iu his diurnall revolution shall come to touch the

               <p>The affections of a Right Sphere are these. All the Sarrs are observed to rise and set in an equall space of time: and continue as long above the Horizon, as they doe under it. So that the day and night is alwaies here of equal length.</p>

               <p>PONT. <hi>That in a right Sphaere all the Stars do both rise and set that is, are all generally seene above the Horizon, and in like manner doe also all set by turnes; so likewise that boath the Poles, both Arctique and Ant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> in a Right Sphaere, the fight can hardly reach both the Poles, by reason of the extuberancy of the earth. Which is also confirmed by the Testimony of</hi> Johannes Lerius <hi>a</hi> Burgonian, <hi>who in his history of his voyage into the New world, whether thus.</hi> Non modo sub AEquinoctiali po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus uterque non apparet, &amp;c. <hi>Under the AEqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall (saith he) not only both the Poles are invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and do not appear, but neither one nor other can be seene, till a man hath passed on two degrees from the AEquator. But whether this assertion of his, or the contrary of some of our Countrymen, who have also sailed through those parts, be to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the more accurate and trne, I leave to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to determine,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Oblique Sphaere hath these properties. Their dayes are sometimes longer then the Nights, some times shorter, and sometimes of equall length. For when the Sun is placed in the AEquinectiall points, which (as wee have said) happeneth twice in the yeare; the daies and nightes are then equall. But as hee draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nearer to the elevated Pole, the dayes are observed to increase, and the nights to decrease; till such time as hee comes to the Tropique, when as he there maketh the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest dayes and the shortest nights in the yeare. But when he returneth toward the Opposite Pole, the dayes the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> decrease, till he toucheth the Tropique, that lieth nearest the same Pole:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51345:44"/>
at which time, the nights are at the longest and the dayes shortest. In this position of Sphaere also, so me Starrs are never seen to set; such as are all those that lie within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of a Circle described about the Elevated Pole, and touching the Horizon: and some in like manner, are never observed to appeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Horizon: and these are all such Starrs as are circumscribed within the like circle drawn about the Opposite Pole.
<figure/>
These Parallel circles (as wee have said) are those which the Greeks, and some of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines also, call the Artictique and Antarctique circles, the one alwaies appearing, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alwaies lying hid. All the other Starrs, which are not comprehended within these two circles, have their riseings and settings by course. Of which those that are placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>between
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51345:45"/>
the AEquator and this alwayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent circles, continue a longer space in the upper Hemisphaere, and a lesse while in the lower. So on the contrary, those that are nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the Opposite circle, are longer under the Horizon, and the lesser while above it Of all which affections this is the Cause. The Sun being placed in the AEquator, (or any other Starr) in his daily revolution describeth the AEquinoctiall circle: but being without the AEquator, he describeth a greater, or lesser Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, according to the diversity of his decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the AEquator. All which Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels, together with the AEquator it self, are cut by the Horizon, in a Right Sphaere, to right angles. For when the Poles lie both in the very Horizon, and the <hi>Zenith</hi> in the AEquator: it must needs follow, that the Horizon must cut the AEquator in right angles, because it passeth through its Poles. Now because it cutteth the AEquator at right angles; it must also neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily cut all other circles, that are Parrallel to it, in right angles: and therefore it must needs divide them into two equall parts. So that if halfe of all these Parallels, as also of the AEqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, be above the Horizon, and the other halfe lye hid under it; it must necessarily follow, that the Sun and other Starrs must bee as long in passing through the upper Hemis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaere, as though the lower. And so the daies must be as long as the nights, as all the Stars in like manner will be 12. hours above the Horizon, and as many under it. But in an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51345:45"/>
Sphaere, because one of the Poles is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above the Horizon, and the other is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed under it: all things happen cleane o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. For seeing that the Horizon doth not passe through the Poles of the AEquator: it will not therefore cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> the Parllaels in the same manner, as it doth the AEquator: but those Parallels that are nearest to the elevated Pole, will have the greatest portion of them above the Horizon, and the least under. But those that are nearest the opposite Pole, will have the least part of them seen, and the greatest part hid: only the AEquator is still divided into two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall parts, so that the conspicuous part is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to that which is not seen. And hence it is, that in all kinds of Obliquitie of Sphaere, when the Sun is in the AEquator, the day and night is alwayes of equal length. And as he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth toward the elevated Pole, the days encrease; because the greater Arch, or portion of the Parrallels are seen. But when he is nearer the hidden Pole, the nights are then the longest, because the greatest segiment of those Parallels are under the Horizon. And by how much the higher, either Pole is elevated above the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon of any place, by so much, the daies are the longer in Summer, and the nights in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>PONT. <hi>The position or siauation of a Sphaere is rightly distinguished by our Author, into three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For if it be demanded, (saith</hi> Clavius) <hi>what manner of Sphaere they may be said to have, that inhabite under the Poles: we must make answer, an Oblique. But both</hi> Clavius, <hi>and</hi> Sacrobosco <hi>are herein deceived. For those that have such a position of Sphaere, as that they dwell under the Pole, the AEquator with them doth not make Oblique An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with the Horizon: because the Horizon and AEquator there, make both but one circle. This kind of Sphaere therefore may more rightly be called a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, or Neutrall Sphaere: because that it's Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall point falleth upon the Pole of the Sphaere.</hi> But Joseph Scaliger <hi>hath given it the aptest appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, in his Notes, upon</hi> Manilius.

                  <hi>Where he saith, that every Sphaere may be said,</hi> aut jacere, sedere, aut stare, <hi>either to lye, sit, or stand.

                  <hi>and is like a Mill. for in this Position, the AEqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, supplying the office of the Horizon, and as it were, turned round about, is just like a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill, both in habit, and manner of turning about, But we cannot so properly call it a Right Sphaere because of the right Angles that it makes with the AEquinoctiall, as passing through it's Poles: because that that appellation seemes to suit more
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51345:46"/>
fitly with a standing Sphaere, in which the AEqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall is the same with the Horizon and Arctique circle. Lastly there is but one Right, or Lying Sphaere because there is but one AEquinoctiall: and there are but two standing Sphaeres; because there be but two Poles.

               <p>Neither did this opinion, (although in a manner generally received a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Ancients) concerning the number and bounds of the Zones, even then want its opposition. For <hi>Parmenides</hi> would have that Zone, which they call the Torrid, to be extended farr beyond the Tropiques: so that he made it almost as large againe, as it ought to have been: but is withall reprehended for it by <hi>Posidonius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knew that about halfe of that space which is contained betwixt our Summer Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pique and the AEquator, was inhabited.

Secondly, They have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall AEquinoxe. Thirdly, They have the Sun verticall unto them twice in a yeare, namely, when hee entered into ♈ and ♎ Fourthly, In the Suns periodicall motion through the Zodiaque, look how much he goeth Southward from their Zenith, in his returne hee declines as farr north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward srom the same.

Seventhly, They have five different kindes of shadows: to wit, Eastward, Westward, North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Southward, and Perpendicular. And therefore the Inhabitants of this Zone are called</hi> Amphiscij, <hi>that is to say, having their shadowes cast on both sides: The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties os those that inhabit toward the utmost border of the Torrid Zone, and being os the Northern Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But if the intermediate Starrs, those that are Northward from the AEqnator, or a longer time above the Horizon, then they are under it: in like manner, as the other that decline more Southward, their Nocturnall Arch is greater then the Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: onely those in the line itself, do rise and set in an equall space of time. Secondly, Their Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dayes and nights are unequall. Thirdly, The Sun is in their Zenith but once in the yeare, and that is in the beginning of</hi> Cancer: <hi>so that it never as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends more Northward, but at all other times is Southward to them. Fourthly, They have two Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices: one, when the Sun is in the begining of</hi> Cancer, <hi>which is their Verticall point: and the other when the Sun entereth into the begining of</hi> Capricorne, <hi>at which time the Sun hath the least elevation.

First, Very many Stars with them are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver observed to set: for the higher the Pole is eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the more Stars there are which alwaies appear; and so, in like manner, there are as many in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Haemisphaere that never rise. Secondly, Their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall dates and nights are equall. Thirdly, The
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51345:52"/>
Sun is never in their Verticall point: but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at Noon Southward from them. Fourthly, They have one Summer, and one Winter, and two Solstices.

               <p>They therefore which are <hi>Perioeci</hi> in respect of us, are <hi>Antoeci</hi> to our <hi>Antipodes:</hi> &amp; those that are <hi>Antoeci</hi> to us, are <hi>Perioeci</hi> to our <hi>Antipodes:</hi>

The ground of which their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour perhaps may be, in that they conceived us and our <hi>Antoeci</hi> to have the same Horizon, but that ours was the uppermost Hemisphaere, and theirs the lower: the like they conceived of our <hi>Perioeci.</hi> But this is an errour unworthy of those that are but mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But herein we differ, that the seasons of the yeare are cleane contrary. For when we have Summer, they have Winter: and our long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est day, is the shortest with them. We also inhabite temperate <hi>Zones</hi> both of us, though different from each other in the time and seasons.</p>
               <p>But with our <hi>Antipodes</hi> all things are quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, both daies and nights, with their beginnings and endings, as also the seasons of the yeare. For at what time we, through the benefit of the Sun, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy our Summer and the longest day: then is it winter with them, and the dayes at the shortest. So likewise when the Sun riseth with us, it setteth with them; and so contrary wise when it setteth with us, it riseth with them. For we inhabite the upper Hemisphaere, and they the lower, divided by the same Horizon.</p>

A Climate they define to be a space of earth comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betwixt any two places, whose longest dayes differ in quantity halfe an houre. And a Parallel is a space, wherein the dayes increase in length a quarter of an houre: so that every Climate containeth two Parallels.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto, hath our discourse been concerning those things which are common to both <hi>Globes:</hi> We will now descend to speak of those that properly belongs to each of them in particular. And first of those things that only concern the <hi>Coelestiall Globe:</hi> as namely the Stars, with their severall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations.</p>
               <p>The whole number of Starrs hath been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, by the Ancient Astronomers, who first applied themselves to the diligent observing of the same, into two kinds. The first is of the Planets, or wandering Stars: the other of the fix'd. The first of which, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called Planets or Wanderers because they observe no constant distance or situation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in respect of each other, nor in respect of those that are called fixed Starrs. And these were so called, because that they were obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51345:57"/>
alwayes to keep the same situation and distance from one another, as is at large proved <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> in his <hi>Almagest, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. out of his owne observations, diligently compared with those delivered by <hi>Hipparch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>

               <p>PONT. <hi>The Starrs are divided into Planets, or wandring Starrs, and fixed: not as if these were indeed fixed in one certain place, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without motion, and the other only moveable and erraticall: but these appellations are onely given then comparatively; in which sence also they are to be understood. For seeing that the fixed Starrs were observed alwayes to keep the same places in the eighth Sphaere, and the same distance srom each other: notwithstanding that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in continuall motion, caused by the vertue of the first Moveable, which carrieth them about in the space of twenty foure hours. But the Planets, besides this motion, have a proper motion of their owne, so that they keep neither their the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the fixed Starrs, nor yet the same aspect to each other: for these reasons were the one called Fixed, and the other Planets. For otherwise if the Planets be considered severally, each one by himselfe, there is nothing more certain then their periodicall motion. So that</hi> Tully, <hi>alluding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, would have the Planets to bee called</hi> Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, <hi>by</hi> Antiphrasis, quam minimè erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the fixed Starrs, and their Constellations.</head>
               <p>ANd here, in the next place, we intend to speak of the Fixed Starrs, and their <hi>Aste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismes,</hi> or <hi>Constellations,</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and <hi>Sidera,</hi> signes. Concerning the number of which Constellations, as also of their figure, names, and number of the Starrs they consist of, there is diversity of opinion among Authors. For <hi>Pliny</hi> in his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> book, 41. chap. reckoneth the whole number of the signes to be 72. But <hi>Ptolomy Alfraganus,</hi> and those which follow them, acknowledge but 48. for the most part: notwithstanding some have added to this number one, or two more; as <hi>Berenices Haire,</hi> and <hi>Antinous. Germanicus Coesar,</hi> and <hi>Festus Avienus Rufus,</hi> following <hi>Aratus,</hi> make the number lesse. <hi>Julius Higinus</hi> will have them to be but 42. reckoneing the <hi>Serpent:</hi> and <hi>The man that holdeth it,</hi> for one signe: and he omitteth the little <hi>Horse:</hi> and doth not number <hi>Libra</hi> among the signes: but he divideth <hi>Scorpio</hi> into two signes, as many others also doe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he reckon the <hi>Crow,</hi> the <hi>Wolf,</hi> nor the <hi>South Crown</hi> among his Constellations, but onely names them by the way. The <hi>Bull</hi> also. which was described to appear but half, by <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them: the same is made to be wholy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, both by <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> and also before them, by <hi>Nicander,</hi> if we may believe <hi>Theon, Aratus</hi> his Scholiast: who also place the <hi>Pleiades</hi> in his back.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:51345:60"/>
Concerning the number also of the Starrs, that goe to the making up of each Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Authors do uery much differ from <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi> as namely, <hi>Julius Higinus,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator upon <hi>Germanicus,</hi> (whether it bee <hi>Bassus</hi> as <hi>Philander</hi> calles him: or whether those Commentaries were written by <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> himself, as some desire to prove out of <hi>Lactantius)</hi> and sometimes also <hi>Theon,</hi> in his Commentaries upon <hi>Aratus;</hi> and <hi>Alfraganus</hi> very often.</p>
               <p>Now if you desire to know what other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son there is, why these Constellations have been called by these names. save onely, that the position of the Starrs doth in some sort seeme to expresse the formes of the things sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the same: you may read <hi>Bassus,</hi> and <hi>Julius Higinus,</hi> abundantly discoursing of this argument out of the fables of the <hi>Greekes. Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> assures us, (if at least we may believe him) that <hi>Hipparchus</hi> was the man that first deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to posterity the Names, Magnitude, and Places of the Stars. But they were called by the same names, before <hi>Hipparchus</hi> his time, by <hi>Timochares, Aratus,</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus.</hi> Neither is <hi>Hipparchus</hi> ancienter then <hi>Aratus,</hi> as <hi>Theon</hi> would have him to be. For the one flourished about the 420. yeare from the beginning of the Olympiads: as appeareth plainly out of his life written by a Greek Author. But <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parchus</hi> lived above 600. year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51345:61"/>
testifie. Besides that, there are extant cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Commentaries upon the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus</hi> and <hi>Arratus,</hi> which goe under <hi>Hipparchus</hi> his name: unlesse perhaps they were written by <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> (as some rather think) who yet was before <hi>Hipparchus.</hi>
               </p>

Neither are those men at all to be regarded, that condemne these usual names of the Starrs, and Constellations, as unfit to be used by Christian men. For seeing they are now used, without the least shew of superstirion, and that there is very great necessity of these Appellations, in as much

as without them there could be no agreement or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in these Arts and cience (for these very names are used all the world over, where ever the same Arts are taught or professed) I see no reason but that we may lawfully use these names, til such time as, the true names, wherewith the great Creator of all things, at the first called every Star as</hi> David <hi>witnesseth in the</hi> 146 Psalm <hi>be made known unto us.

               <p>All these Constellations (together with their names in Arabique, as we find them partly set down by <hi>Alfraganus,</hi> partly by <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his Commentaries upon <hi>Manili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and <hi>Grotius,</hi> his Notes upon <hi>Aratus</hi> his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterismes, but especially as <hi>Jacobus Christman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> hath delivered them unto us out of the <hi>Arabique Epitome</hi> of the <hi>Almagest)</hi> we will set down in their order.

It is also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Schomlek,</hi> which <hi>Scaliger</hi> thinks is read by transposition of the letters, for <hi>Mosclek,</hi> which signifieth the bending of the taile.

               <p>THE first is <hi>Cetus,</hi> the Whale, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Arabique <hi>Elkaitos,</hi> consisting of 22. Starrs. That which is in number the second, is commonly called <hi>Menkar,</hi> but more rightly; as <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith, <hi>Monkar Elkaitos,</hi> the nose or snout of the Whale: and the 14. <hi>Boten Elkaitos,</hi> the belly of the Whale: and the last of all save one, <hi>Deneb El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaitos,</hi> the taile of the Whale.</p>
               <p>The secondis <hi>Orion,</hi> which the Arabians call sometimes <hi>Asugia,</hi> the mad-man; which name is also applied to <hi>Hydra:</hi> and sometimes <hi>Elgeuze.</hi> Now <hi>Geuze</hi> signifieth a <hi>Wall-nut:</hi> and perhaps they allude herein to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine word <hi>Jugula,</hi> by which name <hi>Festus</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Orion:</hi> because he is greater then any of the other Constellations, as a Wall-nut is big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then any other kind of Nut. The name <hi>Elgeuze</hi> is also given to <hi>Gemini.</hi> This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation is also called in Arabique <hi>Algibbar,</hi> which signifies a strong man, or Gyant. It consisteth of 38. Stars, among which that which is the second, and is placed in his right shoulder, is called <hi>Ied Algeuze,</hi> that is, <hi>Orion's</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>nda, as <hi>Christmannus</hi> thinketh: but more commonly <hi>Bed Elgeuze,</hi> and perhaps it should
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51345:71"/>
rather be <hi>Bet Elgeuze,</hi> that is the bright Star in <hi>Orion.</hi> The third Star is called by the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonsines Bellatrix,</hi> the Warrier. That which is in his left foot, and is the 35. in number, is called <hi>Rigel Algeuze,</hi> or <hi>Algibbar,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> foot.</p>
               <p>PONT. <hi>In the</hi> 9. cap. <hi>of</hi> Job. vers. 9. <hi>there is mention made of</hi> Orion, <hi>as we said before. Now the word in the Originall is</hi> Kesil, <hi>which signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Madnesse; Rage, and Instability: and it is so called perchance, because that when this Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion riseth with the Sun, it causeth great store of tempestuous weather in all places: whence it is stled by the Poëts,</hi> Nimbosus &amp; Aquosus Orion. <hi>Now we must note, that this word</hi> Kesil <hi>in Hebrew, (which is rendred</hi> Orion <hi>by</hi> Hierome <hi>and others) doth answere to the Arabique word</hi> Asugia, <hi>which signifieth likewise a Bold or Furious fellow as our Author saith. In like manner there is mention made of</hi> Orion <hi>again in the</hi> 38. Chapter <hi>of</hi> Job, verse 13. Nunquid cohibebis delicias Pleiadum, aut lora Orionis dissolves: <hi>Canst thou bind the sweet inflences of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? notwithstanding, Interpreters do not all agree in rendering this plaee. Look also in the Prophet</hi> Amos. cap. 5. ver. 8.</p>
               <p>The third is <hi>Eridanus,</hi> in Arabique <hi>Alvahar,</hi> that is to say, the River: whence <hi>Nar,</hi> the name of a River in <hi>Hetruria,</hi> is conceived, by some, to have been contracted. It hath in it 34. Starrs: among which that which is the 19. is commonly called in Arabique <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getener,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:51345:72"/>
but <hi>Scaliger</hi> rather thinkes it should be red <hi>Anchenetenar,</hi> which signifieth the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or crooking of a River. The 29 Star is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so called <hi>Beemim,</hi> or rather <hi>Theemim,</hi> which signifieth any two things joyned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> no, this name may not be as well applied to any two Stars standing close by one another. And the the last bright Starr in the end of it, is called <hi>Acharnahar,</hi> as if you should say, Behind the River, or, in the end of the River and it is commonly called <hi>Acarnar.</hi>

               <p>The sixth is the little Dog, called in Greek <hi>Procyon,</hi> and in Latine <hi>Antecanis,</hi> because it ris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before the great Dog.

much erred from the right, in setting down the true reason of the same: we doe therefore the more willingly make this digression. For some there are, who (out of the extraordinary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they have in Phylosophy, and Optickes) would very willingly perswade us, that either we conceive them to be more, then indeed they are, and that our sense onely is deceived: or else (which is altogether as ridiculous) that the aire being in winter more pure and thin, making them more conspicuous, which otherwise in the Summer, when the ayre is more grosse, do alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getherlye hid.

               <p>There are also observed many Stars in the Southern parts of the world: which because they could not be seen by our Artists in these parts of the World, we have therefore no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledg left us concerning the same. So in like manner, among those which we have hitherto spoken of, many of them cannot bee seen by those that inhabit any whit neare the North Pole. But concerning those Stars that appeare about the South Pole of the World, I will here set you down a very admirable story, which <hi>Franciscus Patricius Senensis</hi> relateth in the end of his <hi>Nova Philosophia,</hi> out of the Navigations of <hi>Americus Vespuccius.</hi> And it is thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain therefore, that these Stars were of greater magnitude, then any man can conceive: and especially three <hi>Canobi,</hi> which I saw, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; two whereof were very bright ones, but the third was somewhat obscure, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And a little after, he proceeds. But the Pole it selfe is encompassed about with three
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51345:76"/>
Stars, which represent the figure of a right-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled Triangle: among which, that which is in the midst, is in circumference, 9. gr. and a halfe: and when these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ise, there appeares, on the left hand of them, another bright <hi>Canobus</hi> of notable magn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tude.</p>
               <p>And a little after, he saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After these there follow three other very faire Stars, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemost of which hath in Diameter 12. degrees and an halfe; and in the midst among these, there is seen another <hi>Canobus.</hi> After this there follows 6. other bright Stars which excell all the other Stars, in the eighth Sphaere for bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: the middlemost of them, having 32. gr. in Diameter. These Stars are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by another greater, but darker <hi>Canobus:</hi> all which Stars are observed in the Milky way.</p>
               <p>To this he addeth, out of <hi>Corsalius,</hi> his that followeth. <hi>Andreas Corsalius</hi> also affirmeth, that there are two clouds, of a reasonable brightnesse, appearing near the Pole; betwixt which there is a Star distant from the Pole, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a 11 gr. over which, he saith; there is seen a very admirable figure of a Crosse, standing in the midst of 5. Stars that compasse it about, with some certain others that moue round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And now, that you have heard this so strang and admirable relation of the Stars about the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51345:77"/>
Antarctique Pole, <hi>Auditum admissi risum tenea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis?</hi> For <hi>Vespuccius</hi> hath here forged three <hi>Canobi,</hi> whereas <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and all the Ancient Greekes never knew but one, and that is it wich is placed in the stearne of the ship <hi>Argo,</hi> And here it is very well worth our noting, that <hi>Patricius</hi> (as far as I am able to gather out of his writings) out of <hi>Vespuccius</hi> his ill expressed language, and by him worse under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, hath very excellently framed to himself a strange kind of Star, that hath in apparent Diameter; 32. degrees: whereas the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sun it self hardly attaineth to 32. minutes.</p>
               <p>But those things which out of our owne cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledg and experience in above a years voyage on Sea, in the yeares, 1591. and 1592. we have observed beyond the AEquator, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Southern parts of the world, we will here set down.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, there are but three Stars of the first magnitude that I could perceive, in all those parts, which are never seen here in <hi>England.</hi> All which, notwithstanding, <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> saw, in <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> The first of these is that bright Star in the stearn of <hi>Argo,</hi> which they call <hi>Canobus.</hi> The second is in the end of <hi>Eridanus.</hi> The third is in the right foot of the <hi>Centaure.</hi> To which if you will add for a fourth, that which is fixed in the <hi>Centaures</hi> left knee, I shall not much stand against it. But other Stars of the first magnitude, then these which I have named, that part of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51345:77"/>
world canot shew us. Neither is there to bee found scarcely two or three at the most, of the second magnitude, but what <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had seen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and indeed there is no part of the whole Heavens, that hath so few Starrs in it, and those of so small light, as this neare about the Antarctique Pole. We had a sight also of those Clouds <hi>Andreas Corsalius</hi> speakes of, the one of them being almost twice or thrice as big as the other, and in colour, something like the <hi>Via Lactea,</hi> and neither of them very farr distant from the Pole. Our Mariners use to call them <hi>Magellanes Clouds.</hi> And wee saw also that strange and admirable Crosse which he talkes of, which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> call <hi>Crusero,</hi> and our Countriemen, the <hi>Crusiers.</hi> And the Stars of which this Crosse consists, were not unknown to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> also: for they are no other, then the bright Stars which are in the <hi>Centaures</hi> feet. All which things I did the more diligently and oftener observe, for that I remembred that I had read in <hi>Cardan</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, strange relations of the wonderfull magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Stars about the South Pole, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the stories he have now alledged out of <hi>Patricius.</hi>

               <p>Concerning the quantity of the Earth, which was inhabited, there was great diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of opinions among the ancient. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> defined the longitude of it to be, from West to East, beginning at the Meridian which pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through the fortunate Islands, and ending at that which is drawn through the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of the <hi>Sinae,</hi> or Chineans countrey. So that it should contain halfe the AEquator, which is 180 degrees, and 12. AEquinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all houres, or 90000. furlongs measured by the AEquator. And he determined the bounds of the Latitude to be, toward the South, that Parrallel which lyeth 16. gr. 25. m. Southward of the AEquator: and the Northern limets he made that Parallel which passeth through <hi>Thule</hi> or Iseland, being distant from the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall 63. degrees. So that the whole Latitude of it containeth in all, 79. gr. 25. m. or 80. whole degrees, which is neare upon 40000. furlongs. The exent of it therefore from East to West, is longer, then it is from North to South, under the AEquinoctiall, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then more by halfe as much, and under
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51345:86"/>
the most Northen Parallel, almost by a fifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth part. Good reason therfore had the Ancient Geographers, as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> conceiveth in his <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Geograph.</hi> to call the extent of it from West to East, the Longitude of it; and from North to South, the Latitude. <hi>Strabo</hi> also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the Latitude with <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to be 180. degrees in the AEquator, as likewise <hi>Hipparchus</hi> doth also: notwithstanding there is some difference betwixt them, in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the furlongs. For these last have set down the Longitude to be of 126000. sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs under the AEquator: herein following <hi>Eratoshenes,</hi> who reckoneth 700. furlongs to a degree. But <hi>Strabo</hi> maketh a Latitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great deale lesse; that is, something lesse then 30000. furlongs: and hee bounded it on the South with the Parallel, drawn through <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namomifera,</hi> which is distant. Northward from the AEquator 8800. furlongs: and on the North with that Parallel, which passeth through these parts which are 4000. furlongs, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, more Northward then <hi>Britaine.</hi> And this Parallel that passeth through the Region called <hi>Cinamomifera, Strabo</hi> makes to be more Southward then <hi>Taprobane,</hi> or at least, to passe through the most Southern parts of the same. But herein he betrayeth his own notable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for as much, as the most Southern part of this Island, is extended farr beyond the AEquator; as both <hi>Ptolomy</hi> affirmeth in his <hi>Geography, lib.</hi> 7 <hi>cap.</hi> 4. and is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the late Navigations of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals.</hi>

               <p>So great is the difference of opinions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the compasse of the Earth: and yet is every one of these opinions grounded on the authority of great men. In this so great diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity therefore, it is doubtfull whom we should follow. And if you should desire to know the cause of all these dissentions; even that also is altogether as uncertain. <hi>Nonius,</hi> and <hi>Peuce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> would perswade us, that certainly the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs they used were not of the same quantity. <hi>Maurolycus,</hi> and <hi>Philander</hi> conceive the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of furlongs to rise out of the diverse measure of Pases. And therefore <hi>Maurolycus</hi> takes great paines to reconcile them; but in vaine: for they seem not capable of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement. They t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It is true: we assent to them herein: but withall desire to heare of some diversity of furlongs also, or at least, of feet. The Greekes (as I conceive) measured not their furlongs by Pases: but by feet, or rather <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51345:93"/>
sixe feet, which wee commonly call a fadome, and is a measure in familiar use with our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, in sounding the depth of the Sea, or other waters. This word notwithstanding is translated by many, a Pase: but how rightly, I leave it to learned men to judge. <hi>Xylander</hi> in his translation of <hi>Strabo,</hi> alwayes rendereth it, an Ell. In like manner a furlong is defined by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> a very ancient Greek Author, to consist of 600. feet: the same also is affirmed by <hi>Suidas,</hi> by much later then hee. Yet <hi>Heroe Mechanicus</hi> (or at least his Scholiast) one, as I conceive, of the lowest rank of Ancient Writers:) will have a surlong to contain 100. fadomes; a fadam foure Cubits: a Cubi a foot and a halfe, or twenty four digits: But you will say perhaps, that <hi>Censorinus</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth three severall kinds of furlongs: the first of which is the <hi>Italian,</hi> consisting of 625. feet: which he would have us understand to be that which is commonly used in measuring the Earth. The second is the <hi>Olympian:</hi> contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning 600. feet: and the third and last is the <hi>Pythean,</hi> consisting of 1000. feet. But to let passe this later, if wee doe but looke more nearly into the matter, we shall find the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and <hi>Olympian</hi> furlongs, howsoever they differ in names, yet to be no other but the self same thing. For the <hi>Italian</hi> furlong, which containeth 625. Romane feet, (according as <hi>Pliny</hi> testifieth, in his second book and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty third Chapter) will be found to be equall to the <hi>Olympian,</hi> consisting of 600. Grecian
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51345:93"/>
feete. For 600. Grecian feet, are equall to 625 Romane: for as much as the Grecians foot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Romane by a twenty fourth part: as much as in the difference betwixt 600. and 625.</p>
               <p>Amongst these so great diversities of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let us give our conjecture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>iso, both what may be the cause of so great disagreement, and also which of them we may most safely follow. We will therefore passe by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whose as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion is onely defended by a great name. And for <hi>Cleomedes</hi> his opinion, of the Earths being in compasse 200000. furlongs, we should scarse vouchsafe to mention it, but that <hi>Archimedes</hi> also had taken notice of the same, as of a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not altogether disallowed in his time. Let us therefore examine <hi>Eratosthenes,</hi> and <hi>Posido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> whose opinions seem to be grounded on more certain foundations. The cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of their disagreement I conceive to bee in that neither of them had measured exactly the distance of those places which they layd down to work on, but took them upon trust, from the common reducing received of Travailers: save only, that of the two, <hi>Posido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> is the more extravagant. Whereas on the contrary <hi>Ptolomy</hi> grounded his opinion on the distances of places exactly measured, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self affirmeth; when he saith: That the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the known parts of the world is 79, degrees, and 45. minutes. Or supposing it to be full 80. degrees; it will then contain 10000. furlongs, allowing for every degree

               <p>But <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> is much taxed by <hi>Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> for his strange mistakes and grosse igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in setting down the distance of plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For hee reckons betwixt <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 13000. furlongs, whereas (saith <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo)</hi> it is not above 9000. So likewise <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> is to bee blamed, for setting down the distance betwixt <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> to bee 5000. furlongs, and that from the relation of Mariners, whereas some of them would have it to be but 4000. and others 5000. as <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> confesseth in <hi>Strabo:</hi> but addeth moreover, that he himself had found by Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otericall instruments, that it was but 3750. And <hi>Strabo</hi> would have it to be something lesse then that, namely 3640. furlongs. So that hence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e may safely conclude, that <hi>Ptolomies</hi> opinion, being grounded upon the more exact and accurate dimensions of distances, (as bim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self professeth (must necessarily come nearer the truth then the rest.</p>

Or that <hi>Cnidus</hi> is in the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Climate? <hi>Ptolomy</hi> acknowledgeth as much: for hee makes it to have not above 36. gr. 15. m. of Latitude, in the fifth book of his <hi>Geography.</hi> But is not <hi>Ptolomy</hi> out also in assigning the Latitude of <hi>Cnidus?</hi> That the Latitude of <hi>Rhodes</hi> is no greater then <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi> hath set it, may be proved even out of <hi>Proclus</hi> himself: for he makes the longest day at <hi>Rhodes</hi> to be 14. hours and an halfe.

Now <hi>Proclus</hi> his words are these, In the Horizon of <hi>Rhodes</hi> (saith he) the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tropique is divided by the Horizon in such sort, as that if the whole circle bee divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into forty eight parts, twenty nine of the

                  </gap>om <hi>Posidonius. Eratosthenes</hi> his obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations also do very much contradict <hi>Posido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> For <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> saith, that he found by Sciotericall Gnomons, that the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> was 3750. fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. But let us examine this a little better. The difference of Latitude betwixt these two places he found Scioterically, after his manner, to be something more than 5. degrees. And to this difference, (according to his assumed mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the compasse of the Earth, wherein he allows 700. furlongs to a degree) hee attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes 3650. furlongs. Neither is there any
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51345:96"/>
other way of working by Sciotericall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (that I know) in finding out the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of furlongs betwixt two places; unlesse we first know the number of furlongs agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either to the whole circumference of the Earth, or else to the part of it assigned. Let us now see if we can prove, out of the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> himself, that neither <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> his opinion concerning the measure of the Earths circumference, much lesse <hi>Eratost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> his owne can be defended. And here we shall not examine his observation of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Latitude betwixt <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Syene,</hi> that so we might prove out of his own assumptions, that the whole compasse of the Earth cannot be above 241 620. furlongs: as it it demonstrated by <hi>Petrus Nonius,</hi> in his <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>De Nauigatione.</hi> Neither doe we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, how truely hee hath set down the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of these two places to bee 5000. fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs: whereas <hi>Solinus</hi> reckoneth not from the very Ocean to <hi>Meroë</hi> above 620. miles, which are but 4960. furlongs. Now <hi>Mercë</hi> is a a great deal farther then <hi>Syene.</hi> Neither will wee question him at all, concerning the small difference that is betwixt him and <hi>Pliny,</hi> who reckons from the Island <hi>Elephantina</hi> (which is 3. miles below the last Cataract, and 16. miles above <hi>Syene)</hi> to <hi>Alexandria</hi> but 486. miles so that by this reckoning, betwixt <hi>Syene</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> there will not be above 4560. furlongs. But we will proceed a contrary way to prove our assertion. This one thing therefore
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51345:96"/>
we require to be granted us; Which is: that looke how great a space the Suns Diameter taketh up in his Orb; for the like space on the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall Globe</hi> shall the <hi>Gnomons</hi> be without any shadow at all, while the Sun is in their Zenich. Which if it be granted, (as it is freely confessed by <hi>Posidonius</hi> in <hi>Cleomedes,)</hi> we have then got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the victory.</p>
               <p>Now it is assimed by <hi>Eratosthenes,</hi> that the Sunne being in the begining of Cancer, and so directly in the Verticall point at <hi>Syene;</hi> both there, and for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Let us now therefore see, how great a part of this Orb the Sunns Diameter doth subrend. For by this meanes, if this position of <hi>Eratosthenes,</hi> which wee have now set down, bee true, we may easily finde o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, by it, the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the Earth. <hi>Firmicus Maternus</hi> makes the Diameter both of the Sun and Moon to be, no lesse then a whole degree. But he is too farr from the truth: and assigneth a greater quantity, either then he ought, or we desire. The AEgyptians sound by Hydroscopicall instruments, that the Diameter of the Sunne takes up the Seven hundred and fifty parts of his Orbe. So that if 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>0. furlongs on Earth answer to the seven hundred and fiftieth part of the whole circumference of the same: the whole circuit of it then will bee but 225000. furlongs.

yet the instruments themselves, by which the observations are to be made, can be every way so exact and sure, as not to faile. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> by the same Dioptricall instruments, as also by the manner of Eclipses, sound the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sun to contain 30. m. 20. sec. and to bee equall to the apparant Diameter of the Moon, when shee is at the greatest distance from the earth, which is, at the full Moon, and in Conjunction with the Sunn. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he would have this magnitude to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly the same, and invariable: <hi>Proclus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves not of him herein, as appeares in his 3. <hi>cap.

Now therefore if wee work upon this ground here laid before us, and take the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter to be 32. in, it will then follow, that if 300 furlongs answere to 32. minutes, the whole circuite of the Earth will bee but 202500. furlongs: which falls short of that measure which <hi>Posidonius</hi> hath set down, but much more of that which <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> hath delivered.

               <p>The way of measuring, used here with us, is by Miles, and Latitudes: of the former whereof 60. and of the later 20. answering to a degree.

so likewise the measure of a Mile, which is 5000. feet, by 60. (which is also the number of miles that we reckon for a degree,) they wil both produce the same number of feet, <hi>viz.</hi> 300000. So that from these grounds we may certainly conclude, that the common computation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among our Mariners, doth agree most exactly with that of <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> also make 60. miles to bee the measure of a degree: but their measure is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less then <hi>Ptolomies.</hi> The <hi>Grecians</hi> reckon 15. miles to a degree: one of their miles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 4. <hi>Italian:</hi> so that this reckoning of theirs falls <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For according to their computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a degree containeth not above 480. fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, every <hi>Italian</hi> Miles consisting but of 8. furlongs: (unless perhaps you rather approve of <hi>Polibius</hi> his opinion, who,) as he is cited by <hi>Strabo</hi> (over and above 8. furlongs, will have 2. <hi>Plethra,</hi> which is the thid part of a furlong, to be added to every mile: which is the just mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of our English mile.) Yet <hi>Appian</hi> saith that 15. <hi>Germane</hi> miles, are as much, as 60. <hi>Itslian:</hi> and 60. <hi>Italian</hi> miles contain 480. furlongs: which is lesse then <hi>Ptolomies</hi> measure by 20. fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, which make up two <hi>Italian</hi> miles, and an halfe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> reckon to a degree, some of them 16. leagues and two third parts: and some seventeen and an halfe. But how their measure stands, compared with the Grecian furlongs, or with the English, Italian, or Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

miles, I have not yet certainly learned. Yet <hi>Nonius</hi> seemeth to equall the Spanish league with the <hi>Schoenus,</hi> or <hi>Parasanga:</hi> which if it be so, then those that allow 16. leagues and 2. thirds to a degree, have the same measure that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hath deliuered: but those that allow 17. and an half, make it somewhat too large.</p>
               <p>It only now remaineth to see, what is the doctrine of the <hi>Arabians</hi> concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Of which the most ancient have assigned to the whole circumference of the Earth, 2400. Miles, or 8000. <hi>Parasangae:</hi> so that after this computation, a Degree must contain 66. Miles, with two third parts. And this measure is used by <hi>Alhazenus,</hi> in the end of his book, <hi>De Crepusclis. Alfraganus,</hi> and some of the later Arabick writers, since <hi>Almamons</hi> time, do generally account 20400. Miles to be the just measure of the <hi>Terrestriall Globe:</hi> So that one degree containeth, by this reckoning, 56, Miles and a third part. And it is reported by <hi>Abilfedea,</hi> in the beginning of his Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, how that, by the command of <hi>Almanon,</hi> King of the <hi>Arabians.</hi> or Caliph of <hi>Babylon</hi> there were certain men employed, who should observe in the plaine field of <hi>Singar</hi> and the adjoyning Sea coasts, (meaning the places in a direct linetoward the Pole, (how many Miles answered to a degree: and that they found, by just computation, that in going the space of one degree, there were spent full 56.

Now a <hi>Parasanga</hi> (as it appeares plainly out of <hi>Herodotus Xenophon,</hi> and others) containeth thirty furlongs: so that, by this account, every mile must compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ten furlongs. And for confirmation of this, we may observe, that, among the Greekes, there were two kinds of Cubits in use; the one, the common or ordinary Cubit, which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned two foot and an halfe of <hi>Grecian</hi> measure, or twenty foure digitt, of which sixteen went to a foot. The other was the Kings Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, in use among the <hi>Persians:</hi> which was greater than the common Cubit by three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth. Now <hi>Alfraganus</hi> affirmeth that the <hi>Arabian</hi> mile contained 4000. Cubits, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary measure. So that if this Cubit be equall to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cubit, one of their miles will then contain 6000. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> feet, which makes up ten furlongs. Now whereas the <hi>Parasanga</hi> is reckoned by some to contain 40. furlongs, and by others 60. yet no body alloweth to it lesse then 30. with which later account if wee should; with <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus, Xenophon,</hi> and others, rest our selves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

(neither indeed is it our intention to stand long in disputing, whether or no in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse places, the measure of the <hi>Parasanga</hi> were also different, as <hi>Strabo</hi> seemes to think, who observed the very same difference in the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians <hi>Schoenus,</hi> when as being conveighed on the River <hi>Nilus</hi> from one City to another, he obserued that the Egyptians in diverse places, used diverse measures of their <hi>Schoenus:)</hi> I say, if we should rest upon their determination, who assigne but 30, furlongs to a <hi>Parasanga;</hi> then one of the <hi>Arabian</hi> miles will containe tenn furlongs at the least.

Starrs, as the</hi> Virgins Spike, <hi>or the like. For if we take any two places which are situated under the same Meridian, and the distances in a right line exactly known, so that in both places the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian Altitude of the same Star be certainly known also: the difference of it's Altitude will be the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of degrees of distance betwixt the same places, Wherefore seeing it is certainly known, as we have already said, how many miles answer to a degree, it is very easie then to gather how many miles the circumference of the whole Earth is also As for example: suppose</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Edenburg <hi>in</hi> Scotland <hi>to be under the same Meridian, and the Elevation of the Pole at</hi> London <hi>to be</hi> 52. <hi>degrees, and at</hi> Edenburgh 56. <hi>gr.</hi> 20. <hi>m.

It remaineth now that we come to the practise of it, and declare it's several uses And first of all, it is very necessary for the practise both of Astronomy, Geography, and also the Art of Navigation. For by it there is an easie and ready way layd down, for the finding out both of the place of the Sun, the Longitudes, Latitudes, and Positions of places, the length of daies and houres; as also for the finding of the Longest Latitude, Declination, Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion both Right and Oblique, the Amplitude of the rising and setting of the Sunne and Starrs, together with almost an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the like things.

numbers, and the doctrines of Triangles, Plains, and Sphaericall bodies, is a thing very well known to those that are acquainted with the Mathematicks, But this way of proceeding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that it is very tedious and prolix, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise doth it require great practise in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks. But the same things may be found out readily and easily, by the help of the <hi>Globe,</hi> with little or no knowledg of the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks at all.</p>
               <p>PONT. <hi>For the better understanding of those things which shall bee spoken hereafter, there are two things especially to be promised: the first whereof is, concerning the position of the</hi> Globe, <hi>and the other Climates.

For which purpose especially there is usually placed a Nauticall Compasse in the bottome of the frame. When you have thus placed your</hi> Globe, <hi>so that it may be turned about any way at pleasure, yet so that the base or foot bee not moved out of its place, the next thing that is to bee enquired after, is the Latitude of the place Wherein you live: which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is greater, or lesser, you must elevate the Pole of your</hi> Globe <hi>above the Horizon propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally. As for example, if the Latitude be</hi> 50. 51. <hi>or</hi> 52. <hi>grad. or lesse Northward, then must you elevate the Arctick Pole just so many

degrees above the Horizon. And so likewise if the latitude be Southern, you must do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> the like by the Antartick or South Pole. But under the AEquator, where there is no latitude at all, both the Poles must bee placed in the very Horizon, at opposite points.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>A Climate is a space of the habitable parts of the Earth, comprehended betwixt two circles Parallel to the AEquator, in which space there is halfe an hours difference in the longest day. Now those that inhabit under the AEqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor have a perpetuall AEquinoxe, for the day with them is alwaies twelve hours longer, and the night as much. But as their situation is removed from the AEquinoctiall nearer to either Pole, the further they are from the AEquinoctiall, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the the inequality of the Artificiall day and night: out of which variation of Artificiall daies, the diversity of Climates also is takon and distiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished. For wheresoever this difference amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to halfe an houre, there presently beginnes another Climate. Now the ancient Geographers constitutede in every Clime, three Parallels, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> which the two outwardmost, namely the first and the third, do comprehend and terminate every Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate: and the second divideth it in the midst. So that the proportion betwixt the Clime and the Parallels was Duple; for the Climes, as wee have said, were distant from each other halfe an houres space in the length of the day, but the Parallols were distinguished by quarters of an houre.</hi>

                  <hi>Yet some there are that do not approve of this distinction of Climates, among whom is</hi> John Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas. <hi>in his</hi> lib. 24 System. Geograph. cap. 2. probl. 12. <hi>And the reasons they alledg are these.</hi> 1. <hi>Because of their great in equality, in so much that the latitude of the first is above</hi> 570. <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish miles, whereas the last of all is scarce a mile.</hi> 2. <hi>Because that the increase of hours is but a weake ground to build upon, and of no great use: seeing it is as easie to enquire out the length of the day, as the number of the Climate. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee thinkes, it were farr better, that every Hemisphaere were equally distinguished by tenn degrees into nine Climates. So that the first Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate should begin at the AEquinoctiall, and end where the Elevation of the Pole is tenn gr. which might be called the</hi> AEthiopian <hi>Climate. The second should reach to the</hi> 20. <hi>gr. and should bee named the</hi> Arabian <hi>Clime: because that part of</hi> Arabia Foelix <hi>is situated therein. The third should reach to the</hi> 30 <hi>gr. and be called the</hi> AEgyptian. <hi>The fourth the</hi> Syrian, <hi>ending at the</hi> 40. <hi>gr. The fifth the</hi> Italian, <hi>to the</hi> 50. <hi>gr. The</hi> 6. <hi>the</hi> English, <hi>or</hi> Germane, <hi>extending to the</hi> 60. <hi>gr. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth the</hi> Suecian, <hi>or</hi> Lapland <hi>Climate, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the</hi> 70. <hi>gr. The eighth, the</hi> Frozen <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, ending at the</hi> 80. <hi>gr. And the Ninth and last, the</hi> Polar <hi>Climate, reaching to the Pole it selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So likewise the same Method might bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on the othes side of the</hi> AEquinoctiall: <hi>and then by this meanes each Hemisphaere should have nine Climates: whereof seven would be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

found to bee distant from the AEquator at the least 27 degrees.

               <p>Now the Longitude of any place, is defined to be, an Arch, or portion of the AEquator in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted betwixt the Meridian of any place assigned, and the Meridian that passeth through Saint <hi>Michales</hi> Island (which is one of the <hi>Azores)</hi> or of any other place, from whence the Longitude of places is wont to bee determined.</p>
               <p>Now if you desire to know the Longitude of any place expressed in the <hi>Globe:</hi> you must apply the same place to the Meridian and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve at what place the Meridian cutteth the AEquator, reckon the degree of the AEquator from the Meridian of Saint <hi>Michaels</hi> Island to that place: for so many are the degrees of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of the place you look for.</p>

But the most certain way of all for this purpose, is confessed by all learned Writers to be, by the Eclipses of the Moon.

                     </gap> Tables, or of any other learned Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians calculation; and see, what hour such an Eclipse of the Moon shall happen at that place, for which the said Tables or</hi> Ephemerides <hi>were made. Then afterward you must observe the same Eclipse in that place, whose longitude you desire to know, Now if the time of the Eclipse agree with that other, for which the Tables were made, then you may conclude that both places have the same lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and are situate under the same Meridian. But is the number of the hours be more, then the place you are in, is suuate more Eastward, you must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore substract the less number out of the greater, and the remainder must be converted into degrees and minutes, multiplying the hours by fifteen and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the minutes of hours (if there be any) by
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51345:106"/>
foure; for so will the number of degrees arise: and if there remain any minutes after the divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they must bee multiplyed again by fifteen, and so will the number of the minutes of degrees arise, by which these places are distant from each other: which distance is called the difference of longitude. This difference must bee added to the Longitude of that place for which the Tables were calculated, if the other place be more Eastward: otherwise if it bee more Westward, it is to bee substracted from the longitude of the other. An example herof is thus proposed by</hi> Adrianus Metius <hi>in his</hi> Doctrina Sphaerica. <hi>I find (saith hee) out of the Prute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Tables, by exact calculation, that there will be an Eclipse of the Moon in the yeare</hi> 1598. <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eleventh day of</hi> February, <hi>at foure of the Clock and sixteen minutes, in the morning, and that at</hi> Regiomont, <hi>a City in</hi> Borussia, <hi>whose longitude or distance from the</hi> Canary Islands, <hi>is</hi> 41. <hi>gr.</hi> 16. <hi>m. For this Longitude where these Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles calculated. Now I set my self to observe this same Eclipse at</hi> Marpurg, <hi>and find it to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at three of the Clock and twelve minutes, on the same day of</hi> February. <hi>Now because the number of hours here is lesse, it appeares that</hi> Marpurg <hi>is more Westward then</hi> Regiomont. <hi>Therefore I take away a lesse number from the greater, that is.</hi> 3. <hi>h.</hi> 12. <hi>m. from</hi> 4. <hi>h.</hi> 16. <hi>m. and the remainder is</hi> 1 <hi>h.</hi> 4. <hi>minutes: which sheweth the difference of longitude in hours, which makes up sixteen degrees. Therefore I again substract these degrees of difference from the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of</hi> Regiomont, <hi>as being more Eastward
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51345:107"/>
then</hi> Marpurge; <hi>and so I find the Latitude of</hi> Marpurge <hi>from the</hi> Canary <hi>Island, to be</hi> 25. <hi>gr.</hi> 16. <hi>minutes.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He latitude of a place, is the distance of the Zenith, or the verticall point thereof from the AEquator. Now if you desire to find out the latitude of any place expressed in the <hi>Globe,</hi> you must apply the same to the Meridian, and reckon the number of the degrees that it is distant from the AEquator: For so much is the Latitude of that place. And this also you may observe, that the Latitude of every place is alwayes equall to the elevation of the same place. For look how many degrees the verticall point of any place is distant from the AEquator, just so many is the Pole elevated above the Horizon: as you may prove by the <hi>Globe,</hi> if you so order it, as that the Zenith of the place be 90. degrees distant every way from the Horizon,</p>
               <p>PONT. <hi>Seeing that the Latitude of every place is alwayes equall to the elevation of the Pole: It will not be amisse to shew, how the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pole, or the Latitude of any region may be found out, by the observing of the same fixed Star in the Heavens, which is so neare the Pole, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51345:107"/>
Star; both which must necessarily happen in the Meridian: the least whereof will be beneath the Pole, and the greatest above it. Which done, you must adde the least altitude of it to the greatest; and so the halfe of the degrees thus numbered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will bee the latitude of the Pole, and latitude of that plaee. An example whereof may be this. The first Star of the three in the taile of the great Beare is in his least altitude observed at</hi> London <hi>to be about</hi> 11. <hi>gr. and the greatest altitude of the same, when it is above the Pole, is found to be neare upon</hi> 92. <hi>degrees. Both which numbers being added together, do make up</hi> 103. <hi>halfe of which Summ, namely</hi> 51⅓. <hi>is the true elevation ond Latitude of</hi> London.</p>

And the other end of the Quadrant, that

toucheth upon the Horizon, will shew on what wind or quarter of the World the one place is, in respect of the other, and what Angle of Position (as they call it) it hath. For the Angle of Position is that, which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended betwixt the Meridian of any place, and a greater circle passing through the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niths of any two places assigned: and the quantity of it, is to be numbred in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</p>
               <p>As for example. The Longitude of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> is twenty six degrees, and it hath in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern latitude 51. degrees, and an halfe.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51345:108"/>
First you must substract the lesser Latitude from the greater, resolving a degree in minutes, if the substraction cannot be done otherwise convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Then multiply the degrees by</hi> 15. <hi>and divide the minutes by</hi> 4. <hi>and the summ produced will be the distance of those two places in common</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>miles, one whereof containeth foure of our</hi> English <hi>miles. As for example:</hi> Basile <hi>in</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many <hi>and</hi> Geneva <hi>have both the same longitude. but differ in Latitude, which at</hi> Basile <hi>is</hi> 47. <hi>gr.</hi> 30. <hi>m. and at</hi> Geneva 45. <hi>gr.</hi> 45. <hi>m. Therefore substracting the lesser from the greater, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder will bee</hi> 1. <hi>gr.</hi> 45. <hi>m. which being reduced into</hi> Germane <hi>miles, will amount to</hi> 26. <hi>and a quarter or a mile. which is the distance of these two places assigned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if the place proposed bee in diverse Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheres, then the degrees and minutes of Latitude must first be added together, and so the whole resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into miles, as formerly hath been said. As for example: The</hi> Cape of good hope <hi>in</hi> Africa, <hi>and</hi> Constantinople <hi>are almost situate under the same meridian, but in diverse Hemisphaeres. Now the elevation of the Pole Articke at</hi> Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople <hi>is</hi> 43. <hi>gr. or thereabout: and at the</hi> Cape of good hope, <hi>the Antarctick Pole is elovated aboue</hi> 35. <hi>gr. the whole summ therefore is</hi> 73. <hi>degrees. that is to say</hi> 1170. Germane <hi>miles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The distance of places differing onely in longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is found thus. First substract the lesse num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from the greater: then look in the Table here under written, how many miles answere to a degree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51345:109"/>
in the first columne descending, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of miles over against it. Then lastly let the difference of longitude be multiplyed into miles and minutes: and you have your desire. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> Naples <hi>and</hi> Ilium <hi>or</hi> Troy, <hi>are in the same latitude of fortie one gr. where eleven</hi> Germane <hi>miles, and nineteen minutes answer to a degree of that Parallel: but these places differ in longitude, which at</hi> Naples <hi>is</hi> 39. <hi>gr.</hi> 30 <hi>m but at</hi> Troy. 55. <hi>gr.</hi> 50. <hi>m. Naw the difference betwixt them is</hi> 16 gr. 20. m. <hi>which is as much as</hi> 184. Germane <hi>miles, and fifty scruples: the just distance betwixt these two places.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving first learned the day of the Month, you must looke for the same in the Calendar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the Horizon of your Globe.

and the degree of the same, that the Sun is in, at that time. But if it be Leap-yeare, then for the next day after the 28th of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you must take that degree of the signe, which is a scribed to the day follwing it. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if you desire to know, what degree of the Zodiack the Sun is in, 29th of February, you must take that degree which is assigned for the first of March and for the first of March, take the degree of the second; and so forward. Yet I should rather counsell, if the piace of the Sun be accurately to bee known, that you would have recourse to some Ephemrides, where you may have the place of the Sun exactly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for every day of the yeare. Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can the practise by the Globe, in this case be so accurate, as often times it is required to bee.</p>
               <p>Now when you have found the place of the Sunne, apply the same to the Meridian, and reckon thereon how many degrees the Sunne is distante from the AEquator, for somany will the degrees bee to the Sunnes declination for the day assigned. For the Declination of the Sunne, or of any other Starre, is nothing else but the distance of the same from the AEquator, reckoned on the Meridian. But the Sunnes Declination may be much more exactly found, out of those Tables which Mariners use, in which the Meridian Altitude, or Declination of the Sun for every day in the yeare, and the quantity of it is expressed. One thing I shall
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51345:112"/>
give you notice of by the way; and that is that you make use of those that are latest made, as nere as you can. For all of them, after some certain spaces of time, will have their errours. And I give this advertisement the rather, for that I have seen some, that having some of these Tables, that were very ancient, and written out with great care and diligence, (which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing would differ from the later Tables, and indeed from the truth it self, often times at least 10. <hi>m.</hi> and sometimes more) yet would they alwaies use them very constantly and with a kind of religion. But these men take a great deale of paines and care to bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves no small errours.</p>
               <p>PONT <hi>You also find out the Suns greatest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, by his greatest and least Altitude both in Summer and Winter, by substracting the least out of the greatest. For then halfe that which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, will be the declination you seek for So</hi> Regio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montanus <hi>at</hi> Vienna <hi>found the Meridian Altitude of the Sun, at the Summer Solstice to be</hi> 65. gr. 30. m. <hi>and the least Altitude of it, on the Winter Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, to be</hi> 18. gr. 30. m. <hi>when therefore; he had deducted the least number,</hi> 18. gr. 30. m. <hi>out of</hi> 65. gr. 30. m. <hi>be found the remainder to be</hi> 47. gr. 0. m. <hi>the halfe of which was the Suns greatest decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, namely</hi> 23. gr. 30. m. <hi>which is the number of degrees now commonly received: notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath been since observed by some in our time to be somewhat lesse.</hi>

And the Globe standing in this
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51345:113"/>
position, the Elevation of either of the Poles, will shew the Latitude of the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you are. An example whereof may be this.</p>
               <p>On the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> according to the old Julian account, the Sunne is in the first degree of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and hath his greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination 23<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> degrees. And on the same day, suppose the Meridian Altitude of the Sunne to be 50. degrees. We enquire therefore now, what is the Latitude of the place where this observation was made. And this wee finde out, after this manner. We apply the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Cancer</hi> to the Meridian, which w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> move up and down, till the same degree bee elevated above the Horizon 50 degrees: which is the Meridian Altitude of the Sunne obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Now in this position of the Globe, wee find the North Pole to bee elevated 63 <hi>gr.</hi> and an half: So that we conclude this to be the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the place, where our observation was made.</p>
               <p>The like way of proceeding do Mariners also use, for the finding out of the Latitude of places by the Meridian Altitude of the Sunne, and their Tables of Declinations: But I shall not here speak any further of this, as well for that, the explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereof doth not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly concern our present intention: as also because it is so well known to every body, as that the handling of it in this place would be needlesse and superfluous.</p>
               <p>The like effect may bewrought in observing
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51345:113"/>
the Meridian altitude of any other Starre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the <hi>Globe.</hi> For if you set your <hi>Globe</hi> so, as that the Starre you mean to observe, be so much elevated above the Horizon, as the Meridian Altitude of it is observed to be: the elevation of the Pole above the Horizon will shew the latitude of the place. But here I should advise, that the latitude of places bee rather enquired after, by the Meridian Altitude of the Sun, then of the fixed Starres: because the declinations, as we have already shewed, are very much changed, unlesse they bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to their proper places by later observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Some there are that undertake to performe the same, not only by the Meridian Altitude of the Sun or Starre, but also by observing it at two severall times, and knowing the space of time or Horizontall distance betwixt the two observations. But the practise hereof is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixe and doubtfull: besides that by reason of the multitude of observations that must bee made, it is also subject to many errours and difficulties. Notwithstanding the easiest way of proceeding, that I know, in this kind, is this that followeth.</p>

                  <p>FIrst having taken with your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes the complement of the Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of your first Observation, (now the complement of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is nothing else, but the difference of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees by which the altitude is found to be lesse then 90 degrees,) you must set one of the fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Then having made your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond observation, and observed the space of time betwixt it and the former, apply the place of the Sunne to the Meridian, turning the <hi>Globe</hi> toward the East, until that so many degrees of the AEquator have passed by the Meridian, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51345:114"/>
after this turning about of the <hi>Globe.</hi> And then setting he foot of your Compasses in the very Intersection, describe an Arch of a circle with the other foot of the Compasse extended to the complement of the second observation, which Arch must cut the former circle. And the common Intersection of these two circles, wil shew the vertical point of the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you are: so that having reckoned the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it from the AEquator, you shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently have the latitude of the same.</p>
                  <p>The same may be effected, if you take any Starre, and work by it, after the same manner: or it you describe two circles mutually cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing each other, to the complements of any two Starrs.</p>
                  <p>PONT. <hi>The Meridian altitude of the Sunne, being found by the help of of the Meridian circle, it will be very easie to find out the latitude of the place or elevation of the Pole, in any region what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. For seeing the Zenith or Vertex of every place is distant aquarter of a circle that is</hi> 90. <hi>degrees from the Horizon: if then, the Sun being in either of the AEquinoctiall points, the Meridian altitude be substracted from</hi> 90 <hi>degrees; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder wil be the distance betwixt the Zenith of the place and the AEquinoctiall circle: which will be the latitude of the same place. And the reason also of this deduction is manifest, because that the AEquinoctiall Altitude of the Sun, is nothing else, but the Elevation of the AEquator, the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof is always equali to the elevation of the Pole. But this will appear more plaine by an
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51345:115"/>
example, which shall be thus. The AEquinoctiall altitude of the Sunne at</hi> Rome <hi>is</hi> 40. <hi>degrees: which being substracted from</hi> 90 <hi>gr. the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is</hi> 42. <hi>gr. is the elevation of the Pole, and the latitude of</hi> Rome. <hi>So likewise here at</hi> London <hi>in the Meridian altitude of the Sunne, when he is in the AEquinoctiall, is found to bee</hi> 38 <hi>degrees and an half: which being deducted out of</hi> 90 <hi>gr. which is the Quadrant of a circle, there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ll remain</hi> 15½ <hi>gr. which is the latitude of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>and the elevation of the Pole.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The same also may be done, by observing any one of the fixed Sarres, which is is so neare the Pole, as that it never sets in that Country, whose latitude you seek. For you must observe both the greatest and least altitude of the same Starre; both which will happen in the Meridian: the least of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Pole, and the greatest above it. Which done, you must adde the least altitude to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and so dividing the whole into two parts, the half will be the altitude of the Pole.

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> How to find the Right and Oblique Ascension of the Sunne and Starrs, for any Latitude of place, and time assigned.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Ascension of the Sun or Stars, is the degree of the AEquator that riseth with the same above the Horizon. And the Descension of of it, is the degree of the AEquator, that goes under the Horizon with the same. Both these is either Right, or Oblique. The Right Ascension or Descension is the degree of the AEquator that ascendeth or descendeth with the Sunne, or other Starre in a Right Sphaere: and the Oblique is the degree that ascendeth, or descendeth with the same in an Oblique. The formes of these is simple and of one kind only: because there can be but one position of a Right Sphaere. But the later is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and manifold, according to the diverse Inclination of the same.</p>
               <p>Now if you desire to know the Right As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension or Descension of any Starre, for any time and place assigned apply the same star to the Meridian of your <hi>Globe:</hi> and that degree of the AEquator that the Meridian crosseth at that situation of the <hi>Globe,</hi> will shew the Right Ascension and Descension of the same, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so divideth each Hemisphaere in the midst at the same time with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:51345:116"/>
And if you would know the Oblique As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension or Descension of any Starr, you must first set the <hi>Globe</hi> to the latitude of the place, and then place the Starre at the Easterne part of the Horizon: and the Horizon will shew in the AEquator the degree of Oblique Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And if you turn it about to the Well side of the Horizon, the same will also shew in the AEquator the Oblique Descension of that Star. In like manner you may find out the Oblique Ascension of the Sun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> or any degree of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipticke, having first found ou, in the manner we have formerly shewed the place of the Sun. And hence also may be found the difference of the Right and Oblique Ascension, whence ariseth the diverse length of dayes.</p>
               <p>As for example. The Sunne entreth into Capricorn on the eleventh day of <hi>December,</hi> according to the old account. I would now therefore know the Right and Oblique Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this degree of the Ecliptick, for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of fifty two degrees. First therefore, I apply the first degree of Capricorn to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian: where I find the same to cut the AEqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at 270. gr. which is the degree of the Right Ascension. But if you set the <hi>Globe</hi> to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of fifty two degrees, and apply the same degree of Capricorn to the Horizon; you shall find the 303 gr. 50. m. to rise with the same. So that the difference of the Right Ascension 270. and the Oblique 303. gr. 50. m. will bee found to be 33. gr. 50. minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:51345:116"/>
PONT. <hi>This Ascension and descension is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so called the Astro nomicall rising and setting of the Stars: and that inrespect of the Arches and parts of the Ecl ptick, or Stars, either above or beneath the Horizon. Now an Arch of the Ecliptick or Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke is tobe understood two manner of ways name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Continued, or Discrete. A continued Arch, is when it is reckoned in the AEquator in a continued Series from the beginning of</hi> Aries, <hi>and so forward into the consequent signes. A Discrete Arch is so called because it is not reckoned from the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of</hi> Aries, <hi>but from any other point in the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator: as if you should say, an Arch from the</hi> 14. <hi>gr. of</hi> Gemini <hi>to the</hi> 14. <hi>gr. of</hi> Taurus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beside, this Right Ascension is called also the greater Ascension, because that in it, a greater Arch of the AEquator riseth above the Horizon, then of the Zodiack: &amp; it is called Right, because that in this, the Angle which is made by the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon and Eclipticke, is nearer to a Right Angle, then that that is made by any other part of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipticke with the same. And that is said to bee a greater Arch or portion of the AEquator, which is more than</hi> 30. <hi>degrees in the Ascension or Descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: and that is called a lesser Arch, which falls short of thirtie, degrees in rising or setting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In a Right Sphaere foure signs onely ascend Rightly, which are</hi> Gemini, Cancer, Sagitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius and Capricornus: <hi>all the rest ascend Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In an Oblique Sphaere six signes rise Rightly
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51345:117"/>
and the other six Obliquely. The right are these,</hi> Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Sagitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius: <hi>and all the rest Obliquely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oblique ascension, is when a lesse Arch or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the AEquator riseth, then of the Zodiaque: or else, that Starre may be said to rise Obliquely, with whom a lesse portion of the AEquator ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth above the Horizon. And so the Oblique des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention or setting of a Starre is, where a lesse por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the AEquator descendeth with it. As for example. At</hi> Rome <hi>with the Arch of</hi> Libra, <hi>which containeth</hi> 30. <hi>gr. in the Zodiaque, there riseth an arch of the AEquinoctiall of</hi> 37 <hi>gr So that this sign is said there to rise rightly: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that a greater Arch of the AEquator ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with it, then of the Zodiaque, But then, at the same place, with the Arch of</hi> Aries, <hi>there arise only</hi> 17. <hi>gr. of the AEquator. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that</hi> Aries <hi>riseth Obliquely at</hi> Rome. <hi>In our position of Sphaere also here at</hi> London, <hi>which is Oblique, like as that at</hi> Rome <hi>with</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra <hi>there ariseth an Arch of the AEquinoctial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutaining about</hi> 41. <hi>gr. but with the Arch of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>there ariseth not above</hi> 13 <hi>degrees. Therefore in our Sphaere</hi> Libra <hi>ascendeth or riseth rightly, but</hi> Aries <hi>Obliquely.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> How to find the hour of the day, as also the Amplitude of rising and setting of the Sun and Starres, for any time or Latitude of place.</head>
               <p>THe Sunne, we see, doth rise and set at severall seasons of the yeare, in diverse parts of the Horizon. But among the rest it hath three more notable places of rising and setting. The first whereof is in the AEquator, and this is called his AEquinoctiall rising and setting. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is in the Summer Solstice, when he is in the Tropique of <hi>Cancer:</hi> and the third is in the Winter solstice, when he is in the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pique of <hi>Capricorne.</hi> Now the AEquinoctiall rising of the Sun is one and the same in every
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51345:119"/>
Climate. For the AEquator alwayes cutteth the Horizon in the same points, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways just 90 gr. distant on each side from the Meridian. But the rest are variable and change according to the diverse inclination of the sphaere: and therefore the houres are unequal also.</p>
               <p>PONT. <hi>And here you are to understand, that the Amplitude of the Sunnes rising and setting, is an Arch of the Horizon intercepted betwixt the AEquator, and the place of the rising and setting of the Sun. And it is either Northerne or South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne. The Northern Amplitude, is when hee sets and riseth on this side of the AEquator, toward the North Pole: and the Southern when he sets or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth on the contrary side. Now when the Sun is in the AEquator, he hath no amplitude at all: but when he is in the Solsticall points, he hath then the greatest amplitude of all: of which that in the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pique of Cancer is called the AEstivall, or summer solsticiall amplitude; and the other the Brumall or Winter solsticiall amplitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And here it is to be noted that in all places the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive amplitude of any Starre is equall to the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall amplitude of the same. And likewise, that two stars being equally distant from the AEquator the one Northward, and the other Southward, or both of them Northward or Southward, have equal amplitude of rising and setting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if you desire to know the houre, or distance of time, betwixt the rising and setting of the Sunne, when he is in either of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51345:119"/>
or in any other intermediate place, and that for any time or latitude of place: you shal work thus. First, set your <hi>Globe</hi> to the latitude of your place; then having found the place of of the sunne, for the time assigned, apply the same to the Meridian, and withall you must set the point of the Houre-Index at the figure twelve in the Houre-circle. And having thus done, you must turn about the <hi>Globe</hi> toward the East part, till the place of the sunne touch the Horizon: which done, you shall have the Amplitude of the sunns rising also in the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, which you mustr eckon, as we have said, from the East point, or place of interse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt the AEquator and Horizon. And then if you but turn the <hi>Globe</hi> about to the West side of the Horizon, you shal in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have the hour of his setting, and Occidental Amplitude.</p>
               <p>And if at the same time, and for the same latitude of place, you desire to know the hour and Amplitude of rising and setting, or the greatest elevation of any other starre expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the <hi>Globe:</hi> you must turne about the <hi>Globe,</hi> (the Index remaning still in the same position, and situation of the Index as before) till the said starre come to the Horizon, either on the East or West: and so shall you plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have the hour and latitude that the starre riseth or seteth in, in like manner as you had in the sunne. And then if you apply the same to the Meridian, you shall also have the Meridian Altitude of the same starre. An
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51345:120"/>
example of the Amplitude of the Suns rising and setting may be this.</p>
               <p>When the Sunne enters in to <hi>Taurus</hi> (which in our time happen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> about the eleventh of <hi>April</hi> according to the <hi>Julian</hi> account) I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know, the hour and Amplitude of the Sunns rising, for the Northernlatitude fiftie one degrees. Now to find out this, I set my <hi>Globe</hi> so, that the North Pole is eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above the Horizon fiftie one degrees. Then I apply the first degree of <hi>Taurus</hi> to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and the Hour-Index to the twelfth hour in the Hour-circle. Which done, I turn about the <hi>Globe</hi> toward the East, till that the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Taurus</hi> touch the Horizon: and then I find that this point toucheth the Horizon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the twenty fift degree Northward from the East point. Therefore I conclude that to bee the Amplitude of the Sunne for that day. In the mean time, the Index strikes upon halfe an hour after four: which I take to be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of the Starrs.

                  </gap>n the Sunne riseth. The Acronychal or Evening rising of a Starre is, when it riseth on the Opposite part, when the Sunne setteth. And the Acronychall setting of a Starre, is when it setteth at the same time with the Sun. The Heliacall rising of a starre (which you may properly call the Emersion of it) is, when a starre that was bid before by the Sun beams beginneth now to have recovered it selfe out of the same, and to appear. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the setting of such a starre (which mav also fitly be called the occultation of the same) is, when the Sun by his own proper motion overtaketh any Starre, so that by reason of the brightnesse of his beams it can no more be seen.</p>
               <p>PONT. <hi>Concerning the rising and setting of the Starrs, which is considered in respect of the Horizon and AEquator, hath been spoken alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the seventh</hi> Chapter: <hi>where we also shewed, that that kind of rising and setting of the Starres was called astronomicall. But in this place the rising of the Starres is considered in relation onely
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51345:121"/>
to the Horizon and Sunnes aspect, but not of the AEquator; and therefore it is also commonly called, the Poëtioall rising and setting of the Stars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as touching the last of these kinds, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Authors are of opinion that the fixed Stars of the first magnitude do begin to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves after their Emersion out of the Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames, when as they are yet in the upper He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphaere, and the Sun is gone down twelve degrees under the Horizon. But these of the second magnitude require that the Sun is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed 13, gr. and those of the third, require fourteen; and of the fourth, fifteen; of the fifth, sixteen; of the sixth, seventeen, and the cloudy and obscure Starres require eighteene degrees of the Suns depression. But <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hath determined nothing at all in this case: and withall very rightly gives this admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap ult Almag.</hi> that is a very hard matter to set down any determination thereof. For as he there well noteth, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the unequall disposition of the air, this distance also of the Sunne, for the Occultation and Emersion of the Starres, must needs bee unequall. And one thing more we have to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our suspition of the incertain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y of this received opinion, and that is, that <hi>Vitellio</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth nineteen degrees of the Suns depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion under the Horizon, before the Evening twilight be ended. Now that the obscure and cloudy Starre, should appeare ever, before the twilight be down, I shall very hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb facs="tcp:51345:121"/>
to believe. Notwithstanding how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the truth of the matter be, wee will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the common opinion.</p>
               <p>Now therefore if you desire to know at what time of the year any Starre riseth or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the morning or the evening in any Climate whatsoever: you may find it out thus. First, set your Globe to the latitude of the place you are in, and then apply the Starre you enquire after, to the Eastern part of the Horizon and you shall have that degree of the Eclipticke; with which the said Starre riseth Cosmically, and setteth Acronychally: and on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site side, on the West, the Horizon will shew the degree of the Ecliptick, wih which the same Starre riseth Acronychally, and setteth Cosmically. For the Cosmicall rising, and Achronicall setting and so likewise the Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nycall rising, and Cosmicall setting of a Starre are all one: according to those old verses,
<q>
                     <l>Cosmicè deseendit signum, quòd Acronychè surgit.</l>
                     <l>Chronychè descendit signum, quod Cosmici surgit.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But these things are to bee explained more fully. For a Starre doth not always rise and set with the same degree of the Eclipticke. For the Southern Starrs do anticipate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with which they rise, at their setting: but the Northern Starrs come after it: that is, if the elevation be of the Articke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ole.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51345:122"/>
Otherwise it is quite contrary, if the South Pole be elevated. Now having found the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Ecliptick with which the Star you enquire after, doth rise and set; if you seek for the same degree of the signe in the Horizon of your Globe, you shall presently have the moneth and day expressed, wherein the Sunne commeth to the same degree and signe.</p>
               <p>And as for the Heliacall rising and setting of a starre, you may find it thus. Having set your Globe to the Latitude of your place, you must turn about the starre proposed to the West side of the Horizon, and withall on the opposite East part observe what degree of the Ecliptick is elevated above the Horizon 12, 13, 14. or any other number of degrees, that the magnitude of your Starre shall require for distance from the Sunne. And when the Sun shall bee in the Opposite degree to this, then that starre will set Heliacally, that is to say, it will bee quite taken out of our sight by the brightnesse of the Sunne beames. Now, if on the other side, you apply the same starre to the East, and finde out the Opposite degree in the Eclipticke on the West part; that is, the same number of degrees above the Horizon: when the sunne commeth to this place, the same starre will rise Heliacally, or recover it selfe out of the sunnes beames. And so, if you but finde the same degrees of the Eclipticke among the signes on the Horizon of your Globe, you have the Moneth and the day
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51345:122"/>
when the Sunne will be in those degrees. And the same also is the time of the Emersion and Occultation of the Starre you enquire after. But we will here propose an example of the Occultation of some fixed Starre of the first magnitude: which done, the Emersion of the same is also found by the contrary way of working.</p>
               <p>And the Starre wee propose, shall be, that bright Starre in the mouth of the Great Dog, which is called <hi>Sirius:</hi> whose Occultation we desire to know for the Latitude of 51. gr. Northward. Now this Starre, being of the first magnitude, begins to bee hid, whenas it toucheth the Horizon in the upper Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphaere, and the Sunne is at the same time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed under the Horizon but 12. degrees. If therefore you apply this Starre to the West part of the Horizon (having first set your Globe to the latitude of 51 degrees) and on the Opposite East side, observe what degree of the Ecclipticke is just 12 degrees above the Horizon (now this degree is very neare the 11. gr. of <hi>Scorpius)</hi> when the Sunne shall come to the Opposit: degree in the Eclipticke, which is the 11. of <hi>Taurus,</hi> that Starre will set Heliacally, and be hid by the Sun-beames. But the Sun comes to this degree of <hi>Taurus</hi> about the 22. of <hi>Aprill:</hi> therefore wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Dogge Starre sets Heliacally about that time. And if you worke in the same manner, applying the Starre to the East part of the Horizon, you shall have the time of

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> How to finde the beginning and end of the <hi>Twilight,</hi> for any time and Latitude of place.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Twilight</hi> is defined to bee a kind of imperfect light betwixt the Day and the Night, both af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the setting; and before the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Sunne. Of which the first is called the <hi>Evening Twilight,</hi> and the other the <hi>Morning.</hi> Now the beginning of the one, and the ending of the other are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at the same equal space of time from the rising and setting of the Sun: notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the continuance of each of them is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times greater, and sometimes lesse. For in Summer the Twilights are much longer then in the Winter. The measure of them they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make to be, whenas the Sunne is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed 18 degrees under the Horizon. But, as <hi>P. Nonius</hi> rightly observeth, there cannot bee any certain Measure or Tearme assigned them by reason of the various disposition of the air, and the elevation of the vapours that are exhaled out of the earth; which the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor saith, he findes to be also diverse, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times higher, and sometimes lower. <hi>Vitelio,</hi> and <hi>Alhazenus</hi> before him, would have it to bee when the Sun is depressed under the Horizon
<pb facs="tcp:51345:125"/>
nineteen degrees. But how ever the truth be, we shall follow the common rceived opinion herein. Now therefore, if you desire to know upon these grounds here laid down, at what hour the Twilight begins and endeth, at any time or latitude of place; you must do thus. First, set your <hi>Globe</hi> to the latitude of that place, and apply that degree of the Ecliptick, wherein the Sunne is at that time, to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, and withall direct the point of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex to twelve in the Hour-circle: Then mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the degree of the Eclipticke, that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opposite to the place of the Sun, turn about your <hi>Globe,</hi> till such time as the opposite degree of the Sunne be elevated eighteen <hi>gr.</hi> above the Horizon toward the West part of it: and forthwith the Index will shew in the Houre-circle the beginning of the Morning Twilight. And if you turn about your <hi>Globe,</hi> in like manner, to the East, you shall also have the houre when the Evening Twilight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
               <p>PONT. <hi>Our Northern regions have their</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>or Twilight, of above an houre long. But those Countries, where the</hi> Tropickes <hi>are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry farre beneath their Horizon, have in a manner no</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>no Twilight or breake of day. And therefore those that inhabite neare the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, have not the beginning nor later part of the night enlightned at all, neither is there any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of light, before the Sunne bee risen. Whereas, on the contrary side, those that have the</hi> Tropicke <hi>very near their Horizon, must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:51345:125"/>
have Twilight almost all the night long in Summer. And therefore when the</hi> Romans <hi>came into</hi> Brittain, <hi>and perceived that, at the Summer Sostice, their nights were light almost all the night long: they did not ac ount this Twilight to bee night, but said,</hi> Minimâ nocte contentos Britannos, <hi>that the</hi> Britains <hi>were contented with a very short night.</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>a kind of Antiperistasis, or Circumstipation (as we may call it) of the light: which can be none at all, in those places, where the</hi> Tropicke <hi>and Horizon, are farre distant. For this</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>as</hi> Scaliger <hi>in that place accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately observeth, is onely found under those signes which are neare the Solsticiall point, as</hi> Gemini <hi>and</hi> Cancer; <hi>and that in those Countries too, where the night is somewhat larger, then it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pole of the Ecliptick: as for example. (to use</hi> Scaligers <hi>own words) those that have not the</hi> Tropicke <hi>for their Articke circle, nor where it toucheth the North point of the Horizou; with them the night is so long darke, as while the</hi> Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picke <hi>commeth to strike upon the North point of the Horizon. As wee know it hapneth an</hi> Scotland <hi>where our Countrie men that were Souldiers there, could see to play at dice all night long without any Candle, about the time that the dayes were at the longest. Now the</hi> Tropick <hi>is distant from the Horzizon at</hi> Edenburge 9. <hi>gr.</hi> 17. <hi>m. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. And therefore so much is the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Sun and their Horizon at midnight in
<pb facs="tcp:51345:126"/>
the Summer Solstice: so that necessarily the rest of the night must bee Twilight, and of</hi> 6. <hi>houres,</hi> 23. <hi>minutes, which is the length of their night, not above</hi> 37 <hi>m. which is not much above halfe an hour, are quite dark: and all the rest of the night is light. Whence you may perceive the reason of the long continuance of the day in those regions, that have the</hi> Tropicke <hi>neare bordering on their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon. And therefore the</hi> Romans <hi>being not well acquainted with this Antiperistasis of the light, thought that in those parts they had had scarce any night at all. And hence it necessarily followes, that by how much the</hi> Tropick <hi>is more remote from the Horizon, by so much are the nights lesse enlightned: and those that inhabite neare the AEquinoctiall are so farre from having their day extended farther, either before the Sun rises, or after it sets, as that with them there is no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of light at all, before the Sun is up. And there is scarcely any Twilight or dawning of the Day at all in those regions that lye within tenne, degrees of the AEquinoctiall: for which there can b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> no other reason given, but onely the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the</hi> Tropicke <hi>and their Horizon. And if they have no Twilight in the Summer, how much lesse will there be any when the Sun is in the other</hi> Tropicke. <hi>So that we have no reason to give any credit to</hi> Alosiyus Cadamustus, <hi>who when he had occasion to write of this argument, gave this to be the reason of it, because there are no mountaines there to hinder, but that the Sun may be seen at the instant of his rising. But this is a ridiculous reason, and not worthy a consutation. Thus</hi> Scaliger.</p>

               <p>THe Day we have already shewed to to be twofold; either Naturall, or Artificiall. The Naturall Day is defined by the whole revolution of the AEquator, with that portion also of the same that answereth to such an Arch of the Eclipticke, which the Sunne passeth over in one day. Now the whole revolution of the AEquator (besides that portion which answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Sunnes proper motion) is divided into twentie foure equall parts, which they call equall hours: because they are all of equal length, fifteen degrees of the AEquator rising, and as many setting every houres space. Now the beginning of this Day being diverse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diversity of Countries, (some beginning i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> at Sun-set, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Jewes:</hi> so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e at midnight, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Romanes;</hi> others at Sun-rising, as the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> or at Noon, as the <hi>Umbrians,</hi> and commonly our Astronomers do at this day:) this being not a thing sutable to our present
<pb facs="tcp:51345:127"/>
purpose, I shall not proceed any further in the explanation of the same.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Artificiall day</hi> is defined to bee, that space of time that the Sun is in our upper He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphaere: to which is opposed the <hi>Artificiall Night,</hi> while the Sun remaineth in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Hemisphaere. The <hi>Artificiall day,</hi> as also the Night, are divided each of them into 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. parts, which they call unequall hours: because that according to the different seasons of the year, they are greater or lesse, and are never always of the same length.</p>
               <p>The length of the <hi>Artificial day</hi> is thus sound out. The <hi>Globe</hi> being set to the latitude of the place, you must find out the degree of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick that the Sun i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> in at that time, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the same to the Meridian, and direct the Houre-Index to the number of 12. in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. And then turning about the <hi>Globe,</hi> till that the place of the Sun touch the Horizon at the Easterne part, the Index will shew the houre in the Circle of the rising of the Sun: and if you but turn it about again to the West, you shall, in like manner, have the hour of his set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and so by this means find out the length of the <hi>Artificiall day.</hi> Now if you multiply the number of the hours by 15. (for so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, (as we have already often said) are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to one equall AEquinoctiall houre) you shall presently have the number of degrees of the Suns Parallel that appears above the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon: which if you substract out of 360. the remainder will bee the quantity of that part
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51345:127"/>
of the same Parallel, that alwayes is hid under the Horizon. Or else you may proceed the contrary way, and first find out the quantity of the Diurnal Arch, and afterward by the same, you may gather the number of the hours also. For the <hi>Globe</hi> being set to the latitude of the place, and the degree of the Eclipticke that the Sunne is in, being known, you may find out, in the manner now set down, the difference of the Right and Oblique Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the same degree of the Eclipticke, for the Latitude of that place. For this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence will be the half of that, wherein the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall day,</hi> for that time and place, is either deficient, or exceeds the length of our AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall day. And therefore you must add it, when the dayes are longer then the nights, (which is from the 11th. of <hi>March,</hi> to the 12th. of <hi>September:)</hi> but substract all other times of the year, when as the nights are longer then the dayes.</p>
               <p>As for example. On the 12 day of <hi>June,</hi> according to the old account, the Sunne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into <hi>Cancer:</hi> the Right Ascension of which degree of the Ecliptick is 90. degrees. But if in the latitude of 52 gr. the first degree of <hi>Cancer</hi> bee applied to the Horizon, wee shall finde the Oblique Ascension of it to bee fiftie sixe gr. and about tenne <hi>m</hi> So that the difference betwixt them is 33. gr. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>m</hi> which if you adde to nintie gr. the halfe of the AEquinoctiall day, the length of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall day will then bee 123. <hi>gr.</hi> fiftie <hi>m.</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:51345:128"/>
and the whole Diurnall Arch 247. gr. 40. m. which if you divide by fifteene, the quotient will be sixteen and almost an halfe: which is the number of houres in the Artificiall day on the twelfth of <hi>June,</hi> for the latitude of fiftie two degrees:</p>
               <p>And by this means, may you also find out the quantity of the longest, or shortest, or any other intermediate day, together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and decrease of the same, for any time or latitude of place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleomedes</hi> would have the quantity of the dayes to increase and diminish after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: that the month immediatly before and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so after the AEquinox, the days should increase and decrease the fourth part of the whole dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the length of the longest and the shortest dayes of the whole yeare: and the second moneth they should differ a sixth part; and the third a twelfth part: that is, if the whole difference betwixt the longest and the shortest day bee sixe houres. So that the moneth going immediately before, and after the AEquinoxe, the dayes increase and decrease an hour, and an half, that is to say, the four <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> part of 6. hours: the second month an whole hour; and the third month half an houre. But suppose we this to be exactly agreeable to some certain determinate latitude; yet it is not generally so in all places. For according to the diverse Inclination of the Sphaere, the days also are observed to increase and decrease diversly. For seeing that the Parallels in every
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:51345:128"/>
severall Latitude are cut by the AEquator in a different manner, it must needs follow, that the proportion of the increase and decrease of the dayes must be also different.</p>
               <p>I shall not here need to set down the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how to find the apparent Arch of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel of any Star: seeing that it is found out in the same manner, as the Diurnall Arch of the Suns Parallel is.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you desire to find out the equall hour of the Day, first set your <hi>Globe</hi> to the latitude of the place you are in: and also observe the latitude of the Sun. Which done, apply the place of the Sunne, to the Meridian, and set the Index to the twelfth hour in the Circle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then turn about the <hi>Globe</hi> either to the East, or West, as your observation shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, untill that the place of the Sunne bee elevated so many degrees above the Horizon, as shall agree with your observation: as hath been already shewed, in declaring how to find the <hi>Azimuth.</hi> And the <hi>Globe</hi> standing in this situation, the Index will point out in the Hour-circle the hour of the day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your observation was made. After the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:51345:129"/>
same manner also you may find the hour of the night, by observing the Altitude of any known Star, that is exprest in the <hi>Globe.</hi> For the Index must stand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>il, as it did before, when it was fitted to the place of the Sun: and the <hi>Globe</hi> must be turned about, till the Star bee observed to have the same Elevation above the Horizon of the <hi>Globe,</hi> as it had in the Heavens, and then the Index will shew the hour of the Night.</p>
               <p>Now the manner how to find out the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall hour of the day, is this. First you are to find out, as we have already shewed, the quantity or number of the houres of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial day,</hi> and also the equal hour of the same: whence by the Rule of Proportion, you may also come to the knowledge of the unequall houre.</p>
               <p>PONT. <hi>The unequall hours do answer to the</hi> Artificiall day, <hi>which, as you have heard before,) is defined to be the space of time that the Sun re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the uppper Hemisphoere: to which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the</hi> Artificiall night, <hi>comprehending all that time, while the sun is hid from us. Which space of time, seeing that it is always divided into</hi> 12. <hi>parts, (which they call unequall hours:) the day it self being at diverse seasons of the yeare of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent length, the hours it contains must also bee unequall. So likewise on the other side, the equall houres do agree to the Naturall day, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the whole and perfect revolution of the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator: And this also is divided into</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>4. <hi>equall parts, which are therefore called equall houres, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:51345:129"/>
they are alwayes of equall length, fifteen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the AEquator rising &amp; setting every hour. For the whole AEquator being divided into</hi> 24. <hi>parts, there are contained in the revolution of it</hi> 15. <hi>parts of time, which is the measure of an hour so that an equall hour is the</hi> 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>part of the while AEquinoctiall circle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the latitude of 49. degrees, the longest day containeth 16 houres, Now therefore when it is 10 of the clock before Noon; or the sixth hour after Sun-rising on this day, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to know, what unequall hour of the day it is. I therefore dispose my proportionall tearms thus, 16 give 6 therefore 12. (which is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of equall hours in every day or nigh.) give 4. and and an half.</p>
               <p>And if we desire to know, how many degrees of the AEquator do answer to one unequall hour; we may do it thus: namely by dividing the whole number of degrees of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> To find out the Longitude, Latitude, and Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any fixed Star, as it is expressed in the <hi>Globe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Longitude of a Starre, is an Arch of Eclipticke intercepted betwixt two of the greater Circles, which are drawne thorough the Poles of the Eclipticke, the one of which passeth through the intersection of the AEquator and Ecliptick, and the other through the Center of the star.</p>
               <p>The Latitude of a Starre, is the distance of it from the Eccliptick; which is also to bee reckoned in that circle which passeth through the Center thereof.</p>
               <p>Now if you desire to find out either of these you must take the Quadrant of altitude, or any other Quadrant of a circle, that is but exactly divided into 90 parts: and lay one end of it on either Pole of the Ecliptick, either North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne or Southern, as the Latitude of the Star shall require. Then let it passe through the Center of the Starre to the very Ecliptick, and there the other end will shew the degree of Longitude of the same, which you must reckon from the beginning of <hi>Aries;</hi> and so that portion of the Quadrant that is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt the Starre it selfe and the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:51345:130"/>
will also shew the Latitude of the Star.</p>
               <p>PONT. <hi>The manner how to find the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and latitude of Starres, may bee shewed by this example. First, let us propose the head of</hi> Medusa. <hi>which is found in the Tables to bee in the twentie one gr.</hi> 8. <hi>and it hath in Northerne latitude twentie three degrees. Now therefore in the superficies of the</hi> Globe <hi>wee must looke for the signe</hi> 8. <hi>and reckon</hi> 21. <hi>gr. from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the same on the Eclipticke: And the circle that shall bee drawn from the Pole of the Ecliptick, through this degree, shall be called the the circle of longitude of the head of</hi> Medusa. <hi>After this, reckon the latitude of the Starre also in the same circle among the Parallels of latitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the Eclipticke, and so forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Articke Pole, (because the latitude of it is Northerne.) untill you have accounted</hi> 23. <hi>gr. which is the number of the degrees of latitude, and sheweth the place of that Star.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now because that all the circles of Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and latitudes neither are, nor indeed can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be expressed on the</hi> Globe: <hi>therefore the Quadrant of altitude is to serve in stead of the same, for the finding out of the longitudes and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations of the Starres that are set in the</hi> Globe: <hi>and that after this manner. Let us take our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer example of</hi> Medusa<hi>'s head: the latitude of which being Northerne, I apply the end of the Quadrant to the North Pole of the Zodiack: (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, had it been Southern, it must have been fitted to the Southern Pole:) which do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e, I seeke
<pb facs="tcp:51345:131"/>
in the Eclipticks for the 21 gr. of</hi> Taurus, <hi>which is the logitude of the Starre; and having found it, I lay the other end of my Quadrant over it. For by this means the Quadrant shall supply the office of the circle of Longitude of</hi> Medusa's <hi>head. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> therefore if I reckon 23 degrees on the said Quadrant beginning from the Eclipticke, I shall have the true situation of this Starre in the</hi> Globe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In like manner, may we find, by a</hi> Globe <hi>that hath the Starres described on it, the longitude and latitude of any Starre in the Heavens. For if we fit the Quadrant to the Northern Pole of the</hi> Zodiaque <hi>(if the Starre have Northerne lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) and then let it passe through the center of any Starre: the degree of the Ecliptick that the other end of it shall point out, will be the longitude of the said Starre: and the degrees that are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt the ECliptick and the Starre, will shew you the latitude of the same. A for example if the Quadrant being first applied to the Northern Pole of the</hi> Zodiaque, <hi>bee afterward laid along over the the bright Star in the</hi> Crown; <hi>the other end of it will fall on the 6. gr. m. which is the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of this Starre. And then if you reckon the number of degrees betwixt the Eclipticke and the same Starre, you shall find them to bee 44½. which is the Northern latitude of the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Declination of a Starre, is the distance of it from the AEquator: which distance must bee reckoned on a greater circle, passing through the Poles of the AEquator. And
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51345:131"/>
therefore if you but apply any Starre to the Meridian, you shall presently have the Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it, if you account the degrees and minutes of the Meridian (if there be any) that are contained betwixt the Center of the Star and the AEquator.</p>
               <p>PONT. <hi>The Declination of Starres, as also their Right Ascension, may be known by the</hi> Globe <hi>in this manner. The Star proposed must be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Meridian, and forthwith the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian will discover, among the degrees of the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, the Right Ascension of the same: and it will also give you the Declination, if you reckon upon it the number of degrees that are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betwixt the AEquinoctiall and the Star propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And for an example of this, let us propose the Great Dog, whose right Ascension and Declination wee desire to know. First, therefore we set the Starre it selfe directly under the Meridian, and find the Meridian to cut the AEquinoctiall at 97. gr. 15. min. And this is the right Ascension of this Star. And then reckoning the number of the degrees comprehended betwixt it and the AEqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall Southward, we find them to be 16 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which we conclude to bee the Southern la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Starr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The same also may be demonstrated by the Sun, For when the Sunne is in the 3. gr. of</hi> Gemini, <hi>he is carried under the Meridian, which crosseth the AEquinoctiall about the 63. gr. reckoning from the first degree of</hi> Aries <hi>in the AEquator. And this is the Ascension of the Sun when he is in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. degree of</hi> Gemini. <hi>Now the number of the</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:51345:132"/>
degrees that are comprehended betwixt the place the Sun and the AEquator, being reckoned in the Meridian, are found to be 21 which is also the Suns Declination, and that Northward, because it falleth among the Northern signs.</p>
               <p>The same may be performed also after another manner, as thus for example. The right Ascension of the bright Star in the Crown is found in the Astronomicall Tables to be 275. gr 31. m. and the declination of it Northward 38. gr. 26. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. First therefore I reckon the degrees of Right Assention in the AEquinoctiall, beginning at the first degree of <hi>Aries;</hi> and having found the degree I apply it to the Meridian, in which I afterward reckon the Declination assigned, beginning from AEquinoctiall, and proceeding toward the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticke Pole, if the Declination of the Starre bee Northern, if otherwise, toward the Antar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Needle touched with the Loadstone, doth decline in diverse places from the intersection of the Meridian and Horizon, is a thing most certain, and confirmed by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Neither is this a meere forgery of Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, intended by them for a cloake of their own errours: as <hi>P. De Medina,</hi> Grand Pilot to the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> was of opinion. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet doth it so come to pass, by reason that the virtue of the Magnet, by long use and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise is weakened; as <hi>P. Nonius</hi> conceived: or else because it was not originally endued with sufficient vertue: as some others coldly conjecture: but this motion proceeds from its own naturall inclination. The cause of this deflection, although hitherto, in vain sought after by many, hath yet been found by none. In this as in all other of Natures hidden and abstruse mysteries, wee are quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. There have been some that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prescribe some certain Canon, or rule for this Deflection, as if it had beene regular and governed by some certain order: but all in vain. For that it is inordinate and irregular, is testified by daily experience, not only such as is taken from the dull conjecture
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51345:134"/>
of the common sort of Marriners, which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times falls farre wide of the truth: but from the far more accurate observations of skilfull Navigators.</p>
               <p>At the Isles, which they call <hi>Azores,</hi> it declineth not at all from the true Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: as the common opinion of Marriners is. And I dare bee bold to affirm, that at those more Western Islands also, it varieth very little or nothing at all. But if you saile Eastward from those Islands, you shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that point of the Needle that respects the North, to incline somewhat towards the East. At <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>werpe</hi> in <hi>Brabant</hi> it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth about nine degrees: and neare <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> it declineth from, the true Meridian above eleven degrees. And if you saile Westward from those Islands, the Needle also will incline toward the West. About the Sea Coasts of <hi>America,</hi> in the Latitude of thirtie five, or thirtie sixe degrees, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth above eleven <hi>gr.</hi> from the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian. Beyond the AEquatour it happens clean otherwise. Neare the outwardmost Promontory of <hi>Brasile,</hi> looking Eastward, which is commonly called, <hi>C. Frio,</hi> it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth from the true Meridian above twelve degrees. Within the most Eastward parts of the Straites of <hi>Magellane</hi> it declineth five or sixe <hi>gr.</hi> And if you sail from that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory, we now spoke of, toward <hi>Africke</hi> Estward, the variation still encreaseth, as far as to 17, or 18. degrees: which (as farre as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51345:134"/>
we can conjecture) happen in a Meridian not farre from that which passeth through the <hi>Azores.</hi> From thence the deflection decreaseth to nine or tenne <hi>gr.</hi> which happeneth neare the Isle of Saint <hi>Helen,</hi> bearing somewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the West. And from hence they say it decreaseth, till you are past the <hi>Cape of good hope,</hi> where they will have it to lye in the just situation of the true Meridian, neare to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain river, which for this cause is called by the <hi>Portugalls, Rio de las Agulias.</hi> And all this deviation is towad the East.</p>
               <p>All this wee have had certain proofe and experience of, and that by as accurate observations as those instruments, which are used in Navigation, would afford, and the same examined and caculated according to the doctrine of Sphaericall Triangles. So that we have just cause to suspect the truth of many of these traditions, which are commonly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, concerning the deflection of the Needle. And namely whereas they report, that under that Meridian which passeth through the <hi>Azores,</hi> it exactly respects the true Meridian: and that about the Sea coasts of <hi>Brasilia</hi> the North point of the Needle declineth toward the West, (as some affirm) wee have found this to be false. And whereas they report that at New-found land it declineth toward the West above 22 degrees: we very much suspect the truth hereof: because that this seems not at all to agree with the observatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we have made
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:51345:135"/>
concerning the variation about 11. degrees, near upon the coasts of <hi>America:</hi> of the truth of which I am so confident, as of nothing more. It therefore appeares to be an idle fancy of theirs, who look to find some certai<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> point which the Needle should alwayes respect: and that either on the earth, (as namely some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Magneticall mountains, not far distant from the Arcticke Pole,) or else in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, as (namely the tail of the little Bear, as <hi>Cardan</hi> thought:) or else that it is situate in that very Meridian that passeth through the <hi>Azores,</hi> and about sixteene degrees and an halfe beyond the North Pole: as <hi>Mercator</hi> would have it. And therefore, there it no heed to be taken to them, neither, who conceive that there might be some certain way found out of calculating the longitudes of places by means of this deflection of the Needle: which I could wish they were able to performe: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it might bee done, were there any certaine point that it should alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
               <p>But to leave this discourse, let us now see, how the quantity of this declination of the Needle may bee found out by the use of the <hi>Globe,</hi> for any place of known latitude, And first you must provide you of some instrument by which you may observe the distance of the Suns <hi>Azimuth</hi> from the situation of a Needle, Our Mariners commonly use a Nautical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, which is divided into three hundred sixtie degrees, having a thread placed crosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51345:135"/>
over the center of the Instrument to cast the shadows of the Sun upon the center of the same. This Instrument is called by our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, the Compasse of variation: and this seemeth to bee a very convenient Instrument for the same use. But yet I could wish that it were made with some more care and accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then commonly it is.</p>
               <p>With this, or the like instrument, you must observe the distance of the Suns <hi>Azimuth,</hi> for any time or place, from the projection of the Magnetical Needle. Now we have before shew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, how to find out, how much the verticall circle of the Sun is distant from the Meridian. And the difference that there is betwixt the distance of the Sun from the true Meridian, and from the situation of the Needle, is the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of the Compasse. Besides, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shewed how the Amplitude of the rising and setting of the Sun may be found If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the help of this, or the like instrument, it be observed, (as we have said) how many degrees the Sun riseth or setteth from those points in the Compass, that answer to the East or West: you shal in like manner have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation of the Needle from the true Meridian, if it have any at all.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Your Letters I have receceived, and with very great satisfaction and delight: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I perceived two things chiefely to bee insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted upon: which were, the Declination of the Magneticall Needle; and the Precession of the AEquinoctiall points. In my former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I made mention indeed of the same, but with an intention rather to discover the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others, then to proclaim mine own. For I onely made a bare proposall of the matter, and no dogmaticall Position: that so, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> the said declination bee to bee examined by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians, add the Meridians, according to my Hypothesis, be moveable; that then our Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers and Navigators should see, whether or no, there might not some cause and reason of this so manifest disagreement bee discovered, out of this Essay of mine. For I would not have proposed it onely, had I been certainly assured of it: but would rather have endeavoured to make it appear by demonstration. Whether therefore, that be the cause of it, which I desire should be searched for out of my Hypothesis; or whether it be some other it shall be all one to me. But the investigation of the Meridians is not sufficient for this matter. For
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51345:136"/>
wee must first dispute concerning the nature of the Magnet, whether or no it be the property of it, always to respect the North point: and if so, yet seeing that it declines from the tearm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, so many degrees, we are next to enquire, whence this Uariation proceeds: which certainly can be assigned to no other thing, then to the Meridians. But that wee may not urge this question any farther: we must consult with those Authors that have written of the Magnet; and especially with</hi> William Gilbert <hi>of</hi> Colchester, <hi>a Philosopher and Practitioner of Physick in</hi> London, <hi>who about three yeares since put forth three large bookes of the same subject: wherein hee hath discovered to me his own learning rather, then the nature of the Magnet. For now I am more in doubt, then before. The other part of your Letter is, concerning the Praecession of the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall points. It was observed first of all by</hi> Hypparchus, <hi>out of the observations of the fixed Starres of</hi> Aristarchus Saminus, Conon, <hi>and</hi> Timocharcis, <hi>that the AEquinoctiall points were gone gone forward into the precedent parts; because that hee had found that the four points (AEquinoctiall and Solsticiall) were farther off from the Starres assigned for the same, then they were in the time of those Astronomers. Which when hee saw, bee doubted not forthwith to affirme, that the AEquinostiall points were immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and that the Sphaere of the fixed Starrs was gone backe into the sacceeding parts. And he did not perswad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> himselfe onely to this, but even</hi> Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>also; and</hi> Ptolomy, <hi>all that came after him,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51345:137"/>
so great is the power of Prejudicate Authority. And he also rectified the</hi> Globe, <hi>and made the taile of the little</hi> Bear <hi>to be distant from the Pole twelve</hi> gr. <hi>twenty four min. choosing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe it to be so, then to consult with the Starrs to see whether it were so indeed, or no. Which thing I cannot sufficiently wonder at in him; seeing, that not only in his time, but also two hunared and eighteen yeares before him, the taile of the lesser Bear was no farther from the Pole of the world, then it is at this day: as</hi> Eudoxus <hi>observed, Which I have most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrated in my book of the</hi> Praecession of the AEquinoctiall poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Besides,</hi> Eratost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes <hi>also, who wrote one hundred twenty eight years after</hi> Fudoxus, <hi>affirmed the same of the same Starre: and so did those that wrote in</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus <hi>his time. If therefore two hundred and eighteen years before</hi> Hipparchus <hi>time, that Starre was where it is now; how then can that position of</hi> Hipparchus <hi>stand, who placed it</hi> 12. gr. 24 min. <hi>of the Pole of the world? For if the Sphaere of the fixed Starres laid more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the succeeding parts, (as hee would have it) and that in his time the Taile of the Cynosure was</hi> 12. gr. 24. min. <hi>distant from the Pole: it necessarily follows, that in</hi> Eudoxus <hi>time it must have been farther distant from the Pole, by</hi> 13. <hi>or</hi> 14. gr. <hi>For this is the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of degrees required for that motion. But it was then no farther distant, then it is at this day: and therefore</hi> Hipparchus <hi>hath abused both himselfe, and all that have come after him. And
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51345:137"/>
indeed I my selfe have made a collection out of him, of all the risings and settings of the Starres; which no man shall ever be able to understand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he first make such a Globe, wherein the taile of the Cynosure shall be</hi> 12. gr. 24. min. <hi>distant from the Pole. which thing when I imparted to that great Astronomer</hi> Tycho Brahe, <hi>he was amused, and wondred very much at the novelty and strangeness of the thing: and indeed not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause. For I did not speak a word to him of the construction of</hi> Hipparchus <hi>his</hi> Globe, <hi>and the distance of the Cynosure from the Pole of it. And therefore we plainly see, that for as much as this Star keeps the same distance from the Pole at this day, that it did</hi> 1967. <hi>years since, there is no motion at all of the eighth Sphaere into the succed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts, but of the AEquinoctiall points into the precedent. For of the motion there is no doubt at all to be made, for at this time the AEquinoxe falleth before the first Star in</hi> Aries <hi>above</hi> 28. gr. <hi>which notwithstanding in</hi> Eudoxus <hi>his time happened at the very Star.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now whether the Star hath left the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, or the Sun the Star, is the principall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in question. For it must be, that one of them must stand still, and the other move: but wee have already shewed that the Starrs are immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: and therefore the Sun and AEquinoctiall points are movable. And indeed they have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly gone forward since</hi> Eudox's <hi>time</hi> 28. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> Copernicus <hi>(that great Scholar, and second</hi> Ptolomy <hi>of our age) perceived, when he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51345:138"/>
spake these words.</hi> Vos putatis, &amp;c. <hi>You think (saith he) that the eighth Sphaere moveth into the consequent parts: but consider whether the AEquinoctiall points do not rather move forward. Whence it appears, that this never suffioiently commended man, concluded, that there was a praecession of the AEquinoctiall points, and not a motion of the eighth Sphaere into the subs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent paerts. For one of these being granted, the other must necessarily bee taken away: for if the eighth Sphaere doth not move backward, the AEquinoctiall points must necessarily move forward. And therefore herein</hi> Copernicus <hi>conjectured aright. But hee omitted the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est matter of all, either because perhaps hee perceived it not, or else despaired of ever being able to demonstrate it. For seeing that the AEquinoctiall points are Moveable, it must needs follow, that a greater Circle described by the same must bee Moveable also, by the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Sphaeric. Element. <hi>And if the Circle bee Moveable, the Pole must also be Moveable. And therefore the Pole of the AEquinoctiall is not the same with the Pole of the world: for this is Immoveable, but the other Moveable: for so consequently all the greater Circles passing through these Poles, which are the Meridians, are also Moveable. So that Sunne-Dialls, and all Sciotericall instruments, that are placed upon a Meridian Line, after some certain tearm of years, must necessarily be defective: because the line it selfe is removed from its former situation. Of which variablenesse wee have obse ved notable
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51345:138"/>
arguments in monuments of Antiquity. These things, it did concern</hi> Copernicus <hi>either to have seene, or demonstrated, who was the first man that ever rejected that fabulous and ridiculousmotionof the eighth Sphaere, and withall proposed this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Praecession of the AEquinoctiall points: who, had hee but seen seen those things, which we have observed historically out of the writings of the Ancient Astronomers, so great was the ingenuity of the man, that he would have instantly consented, and demonstrated the matter Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically; which certainly is no hard matter to do. For, is there any man so void of all reason and judgement, as having granted the AEquinoctiall points to bee Moveable, to deny that a great Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle described by the same, must necessarily be move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able also: and if so, that the Poles are also Movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and again this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> granted, that the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians are so too? He that shall deny this, I cannot see, what it hath profited bim to have studied the Mathematicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you will object, that the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are not changed, because they pass through the Poles of the world, which are Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But then you have forgotten our Hypothesis, which is, that the Poles of the AEquinoctiall are not the same with the Poles of the world. For these are immutable, but those other Mutable. And therefore wee see the necessity of this Argument; and withal, that these things being so, we are yet very
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51345:139"/>
farre to seek in many things necessary for the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and construction of the Sphaere. For by this reckoning it followeth necessarily, that the AEquinoctiall Circle should not bee described directly Parallel to the Pole of the world: and many other things of this nature, which might hence bee concluded, I might willingly omit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I speak to a Mathematician, who might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teach in these things. Wherefore I think I may boldly say, that none can be so impudent as to deny these things which are so manifest, as that we can prove them not only Historically, but also Apodictically, by certain demonstrations. And it behoves you to see and examine more narrowly whatsoever hath been written by Mathematicians concerning this matter. For there is now no place left of deny all, but rather to see, how these things may be better demonstrated, and this done, the construction and position of the Sphaere corrected. But I do not speak this to the common sort of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologers, who never have read any thing but the Theories of the Planets, and never so much as saw any of the ancient Writers: unto whom, although they should perhaps have recourse, they could not understand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now as concerning the motion of</hi> Trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>it is long since exploded: and for</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus <hi>his motion of</hi> Libration, <hi>which is also a very vain conceit, and I shall speak more of it here, and shew whence this so idle a dream should possesse so worthy a man: for it differeth not much from that imposture of</hi> Trepidation. <hi>And as the truth hath at length got place, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51345:139"/>
removed that fabulous motion of</hi> Trepidation, <hi>so we doubt not but necessity will at the last send af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it this motion of the eighth Sphaere also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This therefore is the summe of our answer: that we desire, that the skillfull Artists would consider, whether the knowledge of the variation of the Magneticall Needle may be illustrated by those things which we have delivered concerning the Mutability of the Meridians: That there is no motion of the eighth Sphaere into the consequent parts: That we are the first that have demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the same: And that from thence must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follow the praecession of of the AEquinoctiall points. And this being granted, that then the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall points, AEquinoctia Circles, and their Poles, and Meridians, passing through them are also movable: and their Poles also different from the Poles of the world. And that the situation of Sun Dialls doth vary after s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> How to make a Sun Diall by the <hi>Globe,</hi> for any Latitude of place.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E do not here promise the whole Art of Dialling: as being a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too prolixe to be handled in this place, and not so properly concerning our present business in hand. And therefore it shall suffice us to have touched lightly, and as it were, pointed out onely some few grounds of this Art: being such as may very easily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by the use of the <hi>Globe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here in this place we shal shew you only 2 the most common sorts of Dials: one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is called an <hi>Horizontall</hi> Diall, because it is described on a plain or flat, which is Parallel to the Horizon: and the other is called a <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> as being erected, for the most part, on a wall, perpendicular to the Horizon, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly either toward the North, or South. But both these may not unfitly be called <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal;</hi> not in respect of the same place indeed, but of diverse. And therefore whether it be a Flat Horizontall, or Erect, or else inclining any way: there will be but one kind of arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in making of the same.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore now see in what manner a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51345:141"/>
plain Horizontall Diall may be made for any place. Having therefore first prepared your flat Diall Ground, Parallel to the Horizon, draw a Meridian on it, as exactly North, and South as possibly you can. Which done, draw another East and West, which must cross it at right angles. The first of which lines will shew twelve, and the other six of the Clock, both morning and evening. Then making a Center in the intersection of these two Lines, describe a circle on your Dial Ground, to what distance you please: and then divide it, (as all other circles usually are) into 360. parts. And it wil not be amiss to subdivide each of these into lesser parts, if it may conveniently bee done. And now it onely remains to finde out the distances of the hour lines in this circle, for any latitude of place. Which that we may do by the use of the <hi>Globe,</hi> let it first bee set to the latitude of the place assigned. And then make choice of some of the greater circles in the <hi>Globe,</hi> that pass through the Poles of the world; (as for example, the AEquinoctiall Colure, if you please:) and apply the same to the Meridian: in which situation it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth midday, or twelve of the Clock. Then turning about the <hi>Globe</hi> toward the West, (if you will) till that fifteen degrees of the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator have passed through the Meridian: you must mark the degree of the Horizon that the same Colure crosseth in the Horizon. For that point will shew the distance of the first and eleventh hours from the Meridian. Both
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51345:141"/>
of which are distant an hours space from the Meridian, or line of midday. Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again the <hi>Globe</hi> forward, till other fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen degrees are past the Meridian: the same Colure wil point out the distance of the tenth hour, which is two hours before Noon, and of the second hour after noon. And in the same manner you may find out the distances of all the rest in the Horizon, allotting to each of them fifteen degrees in the AEquator cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Meridian. But here you must take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by the way, that the beginning of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the distances, must be taken from that part of the Horizon, on which the Pole is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated: to wit, from the North part of the Horizon, if the Arcticke Pole be elevate; and so likewise from the South part, if the Antar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick be elevated.</p>
               <p>These distances of the hours being thus noted in the Horizon of the Globe, you must afterward translate them into your Plain, allotted for your Diall Ground, reckoning in the circumference of it so many degrees to each hour, as are answerable to those, pointed out by the Colure in the Horizon.</p>
               <p>And lastly, having thus done, the Gnomon or Stile must be erected. Where you are to observe this one thing (which is indeed in a manner the chiefe and onely thing in this Art to be carefully looked unto) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that that edge or line of the Gnomon, which is to shew the hours by its shadow,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51345:142"/>
in all kinds of Dials must be set Parallel to the Axis of the world: that so it may make an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of inclination with its plain ground, equal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o that which the Axis of the world makes with the Horizon. Now that the Stile is to stand directly to the North and South, or in the Meridian line, is a thing so commonly known, that it were to no purpose to mention it. And this is the manner of making a Diall on a plain Horizontall Ground.</p>
               <p>Now if you would make a plain Erect Diall perpendicular to the Horizon (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called a <hi>Murall)</hi> and respecting either the North or South: you must remember this one thing: (the ignorance whereof hath dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven those that commonly professe the Art of Dialling into many troubles and difficulties:) this one thing, I say, is to be observed: that that which is an erect Diall in one place, will be an Horizontall in another place, whose Zenith is distant from that place 90. degrees, either Northward or Southward.</p>
               <p>As for example: Let there be an Erect Diall made for any place whose latitude is 25. <hi>gr.</hi> this is nothing else, but to make an Horizontall Diall for the latitude of 38 degrees. And if there be an Erect Diall made for the latitude of 27. <hi>gr.</hi> the same will be an Horizontal Diall for the latitude of 63 degrees. The same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is to be observed in the rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And hence it manifestly appears, that an Horizontal Diall and a Verticall are the same, at the latitudes of 45 degrees.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:51345:142"/>
And so likewise by this rule may bee made any manner of inclining Diall, if so be, that the quantity of the inclination be but known. As for example, if a Diall be to be made on a plain ground, whose inclination is 10. degrees from the Horizon Southward, and for a place whose latitude is 52. <hi>gr.</hi> Northward: you must describe in that plain Horizontall Diall for the Latitude of 62. degrees Northward. And if in the same latitude the Diall ground do incline toward the North 16. <hi>gr.</hi> you must make an Horizontall Diall for the Northern latitude of 36. <hi>gr:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much shall suffice to have been spoken of the making of Dialls by the <hi>Globe.</hi>

            <p>These <hi>Rumbes</hi> are described in the <hi>Globe,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by greater or lesser circles, or by certain crooked winding liines. But Sea-men are wont to express the same in their Nauticall Charts by rights Lines. But this practise of theirs is clean repugnant to the truth of the thing, neither can by any means be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from errours. The invention of <hi>Rumbes,</hi> and practise of describing the same upon the <hi>Globe,</hi> is somewhat ancient. <hi>Petrus Nonius</hi> hath written much concerning the use of them, in two Books which he intituleth, <hi>de Navigand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51345:144"/>
them in his <hi>Globes.</hi> But the use of them is not, as yet, so wel known to every body: and therefore I think it not unfit, to be the more large in the explication of the same.</p>
            <p>Beginning therefore with the nature and originall of them, we shall afterward descend to the use, there is to be made of them in the Art of Navigation. And first, we will begin with the originall, and nature of the Nauticall Index, or Compasse: which is very well known to be of the fashion of a plain round Box, the Circumference whereof is divided into 32. equall parts, distinguished by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain right lines passing through the center thereof. One point of it, which that end of the needle that is touched with the Magnet, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways respects, is directed toward the North; so that consequently the opposite point must necessarily respect the South. And so likewise all the other parts in it have respect unto some certain fixed points in the Horizon: (for the Compasse must always be placed Parallel to the Horizon.) Now I call these points fixed, onely for doctrine sake, not forgetting, in the mean time that the Magneticall Needle, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that it doth of it own nature decline in divers places from the situation of the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, (which is commonly called the variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Compass) according to the custome of divers Countries, is also placed after a divers manner in the Compass. For some there are that place it 5. <hi>gr.</hi> 37. <hi>m.</hi> more Eastward then that point that answereth to the North quarter
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51345:144"/>
of the world: as do the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and our <hi>Englishmen.</hi> Some place it 3. <hi>gr.</hi> and almost 18. <hi>m.</hi> declining from the North: and some set it at 11. <hi>gr.</hi> 15. <hi>minutes</hi> distance from that point. all which notwithstanding, let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Needle always to look directly North and South. Now these lines thus expressed in the Mariners Compass, as the common intersections of the Horizon, and Verticall Circles, or rather Parallel to these. Among which, that wherein the Needle is situate, is the common intersection of the Horizon &amp; Meridian. And that which crosseth this at right Angles, is the common section of the Horizon, and a verticall circle drawn through the Equinoctiall East and West. And thus we have the 4 Cardinall winds or quarters of the World, and the whole Horizon divided into 4 equal parts, each of them containing 90. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Now if you divide again each of these into 8. parts, by 7. verticall circles, drawn on each side of the Meridian, through the Zenith: the whole Horizon will be parted into 32 e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual sections: each of which shall contain 11. <hi>gr.</hi> 15. <hi>m.</hi> These are the severall quarters of the world observed by Mariners in their voyages: but as for any lesser parts or divisions then these, they look not after them. And this is the original of the Nautical Compass, by which Sea-men are guided in their voyages.</p>
            <p>Let us now in the next place consider, what manner of lines a Ship, following the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Compass, doth describe in her course
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51345:145"/>
For the better understanding whereof, I think it fit to praemise these few Propositions: which being rightly and thoroughly considered, will make the whole business facile and perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Meridians of all places do pass through both the Poles: and therefore they cross the AEquator, and all Circles Parallel to it, at right angles.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If wee direct our course any other way then toward one of the Poles: wee change ever and anon both our Horizon and Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The needle being touched with the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, pointeth out the common Intersection of the Horizon and Meridian: and one end of it always respecteth the North, in a manner, and the other, the South. And here I cannot but take notice of a great errour of <hi>Gemma Frisius,</hi> who in his Corollary to the fifteenth Chapter of <hi>P. Appians</hi> Cosmography, affirms, that the Magnetical Needle respects the North Pole on this side of the AEquinoctiall line, but on the other side of the AEquinoctiall, it point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the South Pole. Which opinion of his is contradicted, by the experience both of my selfe and others. And therefore, I believe, his too much credulity deceived him, giving credit perhaps to the fabulous relations of some vain heads. But howsoever it be, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is a <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owle one, and unworthy so great an Author. This frivolous conceit hath also been justly condemned before, by the Illustrious
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51345:145"/>
               <hi>Jul, Scaliger,</hi> instructed hereto out of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigations of <hi>Ludovicus Vertomannus,</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand Magellane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 The same <hi>Rumbe</hi> cutteth all the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of all places at equall Angles, and respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the same quarters of the world in every Horizon.</p>
            <p n="5">5 A greater Circle drawn through the vertex of any place, that is any whit distant from the AEquator, cannot cut divers Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at equall Angles. And therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not assent to <hi>Pet. Nonius,</hi> who would have the <hi>Rumbes</hi> to consist of portions of greater Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. For seeing that the portion of a greater Circle, being intercepted betwixt divers Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians, though never so little distant from each other, maketh unequall Angles with the same, a <hi>Rumbe</hi> cannot consist of them, by the precedent proposition. but this in-equality of Angles is not perceived (saith he) by the sense, unless it be in Meridians somewhat far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from one another. Be it so. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the errour of this Position is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable by Art and demonstration. Neither doth it become so great a Mathematician, to examine rules of Art by the judgement of the sense.</p>
            <p n="6">6 A greater Circle drawn through the Verticall point of any place, and inclining to the Meridian, maketh greater Angles with all other Meridians, then it doth, with that from whence it was first drawn. It therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveth, that a line, which maketh equall
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51345:146"/>
angles, with divers Meridians, (as the <hi>Rumbes</hi> do) be bowed and turn in, toward the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. And hence it is, that when a Ship saileth according to one and the same <hi>Rumbe,</hi> (except it be one of the four Principal and Cardinal <hi>Rumbes)</hi> it maketh a crooked Spiral Line, such as we see expressed in the Terrestrial Globe.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The portions of the same <hi>Rumbe,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted betwixt any two Parallels, whose dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Latitude is the same, are also equal to each other. Therefore an equall segment of the same <hi>Rumbe,</hi> equally changeth the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Latitude in all places. And therefore that common rule of Sea-men is true: that in an equall space passed in one &amp; the same <hi>Rumb</hi> one of the Poles is equally elevated, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depressed, So that <hi>Michael Coignet</hi> is found to be in an errour, who out of some certain ill grounded positions indeavoured to prove the contrary.</p>
            <p>Out of the 4 Proposition there arise h this Consectary; namely, That <hi>Rumbes,</hi> though continued never so far, do not pass through the Poles. For seeing that the same <hi>Rumbe</hi> is equally inclined to all Meridians; and all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians do pass through the Poles: it would then follow, that if a <hi>Rumbe</hi> should pass through the Poles, the same line in the same point would cross infinite other lines: which is impossible, because that a part of any Angle, cannot be equall to the whole. Neither doth that, which we delivered in the last Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion make any thing against this Consectary:
<pb facs="tcp:51345:146"/>
to wit, that betwixt any two Parallels of equall distance, equall portions of the same <hi>Rumbe</hi> may be intercepted; that so it should thence follow, that the segment of any <hi>Rumbe</hi> intercepted betwixt the Parallel of 80. <hi>gr.</hi> of Latitude and the Pole, is equall to a segment of the same <hi>Rumbe</hi> intercepted betwixt the AEquator and the Parallel of ten <hi>gr.</hi> of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: and the reason is, because the Pole is no Parallel. And therefore it was a true Position of <hi>Nonius,</hi> That the <hi>Rumbes</hi> do not enter the Poles: although it was not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated with the like happy successe. For he assumes foundations contrary to the truth: as wee said before. And <hi>Gemma Frisius</hi> also was mistaken, when hee affirmed, in his <hi>Appedix ad</hi> 15. <hi>Cap. Appian Cosmography.</hi> that the <hi>Rumbes</hi> do concurre in the Poles: which was the opinion also of some others who are therefore justly taxed by <hi>Michael Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ignet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things being well considered, it will be easie to understand, what manner of lines a Ship, following the direction of the Magnet, doth describe in the Sea If the forepart of the Ship, be directed toward the North or South, which are the quarters that the Magneticall Needle always pointeth at: your course will bee alwayes under the same Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: because, as wee shewed in our third Proposition, the Needle always respecteth the Intersections of the Horizon and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, and is situate in the plain of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51345:147"/>
same Meridian. If the fore part of the Ship be directed to that quarter that Fast and West <hi>Rumbo</hi> pointeth out: in your course you will then describe either the AEquator, or a Circle Parallel to it. For if at the beginning of your setting forth, your Zenith be under the AEquator, your ship will describe an Arch or segment of the AEquator. But if your Verticall point be distant from the AEquator either Northward or Southward; your course will then describe a Parallel, as far distant from the AEquator, as the Latitude of the place is whence you set forward at first. As suppose our intended course to be from some place ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the AEquator, by the <hi>Rumbe</hi> of the East and West: we shall go forward still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the AEquator. For by this means, as we go on, we always meet with a new Meridian, which the Line of our course crosseth at right Angles. Now no other Line, besides the AEquator, can do this: as appears manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Corollary of the first propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore in this course our Ship must describe a portion of the AEquator. But if wee steer our course, by the East and West <hi>Rumbe,</hi> from any place that lyeth besides the AEqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: we shall be always under the same Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel. For all Circles Parallel to the AEqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, do cut all the Meridians at right Angles, by the Corollary of the first Proposition. And although the fore part of the Ship always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth the AEquinoctiall East or West, or intersection of the AEquator and Horizon;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51345:147"/>
yet in our progress we shall never come near the AEquator, but shall keep always an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall distance from it. Neither shall we come at all thither, whither the fore part of our ship looketh, but shall keep such a course, wherein we shall have, ever and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, a new Meridian arising, which we shall cross at equall Angles, &amp; so necessarily describe a Parallel. But if our voyage be to be made under the <hi>Rumbe</hi> which inclineth to the Meridian: our course will then be neither in a greater nor lesser Circle, but we shall describe a kind of crooked spirall Line. For if you draw any greater Circle through the Vertex of any place, inclining to the Meridian, the same Circle will cross the next Meridian, at a greater Angle, then it did the former: by the sixth proposition, And therefore it cannot make my <hi>Rumbe:</hi> because the same <hi>Rumbe</hi> cut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>h all Meridians at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall Angles, by the fourth proposition. And all the Parallels, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>r lesser Circles, do cross the Meridians <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> right Angles, by the Corollary of the first proposition: and therefore they do not incline to the Meridian.</p>
            <p>Concerning those lines which are made in Sea voyages by the direction of the Compasse and Magneticall Needle; <hi>Gemma Frisius</hi> in his appendix to the fifteen Chapter of <hi>Appians Cosmography,</hi> part first, speaks thus. <hi>Verbum hoc obi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>er annotandum, &amp;c.</hi> And (saith he) I think it not amiss to note this by the way, that the voyages on land do differ very much from those that are performed at Sea, For those are
<pb facs="tcp:51345:148"/>
understood to be performed by the greater cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Sphaere, as it is rightly demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Wernerus,</hi> in his Commenearies upon <hi>Ptolomy</hi> But the voyages by Sea, are for the most part crooked: because they are seldome taken in a great circle, but sometimes under one of the Parallels; when the Ship steers her course toward East or West: and somtime also in a greater circle: as when it saileth from North to South, or contrariwise: or else under the AEquator, either direct East or West. But in all other kinds of Navigation, the journeys are Crooked, although guided by the Magnet, and are neither like to greater circles, nor yet to Parallels: nor indeed are circles at all, but only a kind of crooked lines, all of them at length concurring in one of the Poles. Thus he, and indeed very rightly in all the rest, save onely that he wil have these lines to meet in the Pole: which as we have already proved, is altogether repugnant to the nature of <hi>Rumbes.</hi>

            <p>Hitherto have we spoken of the original and nature of <hi>Rumbes:</hi> let us now see what use there is of them in the Terrestriall Globe.</p>

               <head>Of the use if <hi>Rumbes</hi> in the Terrestriall <hi>Globe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the Art of Navigation, which teacheth the way and manner how a Ship is to be directed in sailing from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there are four things especially to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. And these are the Longitudes of the places, the Latitudes; or differences of the same <hi>Rumbe,</hi> and the space or distance betwixt any two places, measured according to the practise used in Sea-voyages. For the distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the places are measured by the Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher one way, and by the Mariner another. For the former measureth the distances of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces always by greater circles; as after <hi>Werne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Peucerus</hi> hath also demonstrated in his book, <hi>De Dimensione Terrae.</hi> But the Mariners course being made up somtimes of portions of greater circles; and somtimes of lesser, but for the most part of crooked lines: it is good reason that he should measure the distances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of places by the same. Which, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these are to be known before hand, that the rest may be found out, come in the next place to be considered. Now the places betwixt which our voyage is to be performed, do differ either in Longitude only, or in Latitude only, or in both.</p>
               <p>If they differ only in Latitude, they are both under the same Meridian: and therefore it is
<pb facs="tcp:51345:149"/>
the North or South <hi>Rumbe,</hi> that the course is to be directed by. And there only then remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to know the difference of Latitude, and distance betwixt these two places: One of which being known, the other is easily found out. For if the difference of Latitude be given in degrees and minutes; as Sea-men are wont to do, the number of degrees and minutes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multiplyed by 60. (which is the number of English miles that we commonly allow to a degree, and that according to <hi>Ptolomies</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as we have already demonstrated:) the whole number of miles, made in the voyage betwixt these places, will appear. And if you multiply the same number of degrees by seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen and a halfe, you have the same distance in Spanish leagues. And so contrariwise, if the distance in miles or leagues be known, and you divide the same by 60 or seventeen and an half, the quotient will shew the number of degrees and minutes, that answer to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Latitude betwixt the two places as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed. As for example. If a man were to sail from the <hi>Lizard</hi> (which is the outmost point of land in <hi>Corn-wall)</hi> Southward, till he come to the promontory of <hi>Spain,</hi> which is called <hi>C. Ortegall;</hi> the difference of Latitude of which places is 60 <hi>gr.</hi> 10. <hi>min.</hi> If you desire to know the distance of miles betwixt these places, multiply six <hi>gr.</hi> ten <hi>m.</hi> by 60. and the product will be 370. the number of English miles betwixt the two places assigned. And this account may be much more truly and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51345:149"/>
made by our English miles, in as much as 60. of them are equivalent to a degree, so that one mile answereth to one minute: by which means, all tedious and prolix computation by fractions is avoyded.</p>
               <p>In the next place, let us consider those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that differ only in Longitude: which if they lye directly under the AEquinoctiall, the distance betwixt them being known, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Longitude will also be found: or contrariwise, by multiplication or division, in like manner as the difference of Latitude is found. But if they be situate without the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator; wee must then go another way to work. For seeing that the Parallels are all of them lesse then the AEquator, all of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing in quantity proportionably, till you come to the Pole, where they are least of all: hence it coms to pass, that there can be no one certain determinate measure assigned to all the Paralells. And therefore the common sort of Mariners do greatly erre, in attributing to each degree of every Parallel, and equall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with a degree of the AEquator. By which means, there have been very many errors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in Navigation, and many whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries also removed out of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per situation, and translated into the places of others.</p>
               <p>That therefore there might be provision made in this behalfe, for those that are not so well acquainted with the Mathematicks: I have added a Table, which sheweth, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51345:150"/>
a degree in every Parallel beareth to a degree in the AEquator: whence the proper measure of every Parallel may be found. In which Table the first Collume proposeth the severall Parallels, each of them differing from other one degree of Latitude. The second shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the minutes and seconds of the AEquator, that answer to a degree in each Parallel: which if you convert into two miles, you shall know how many miles answer to a degree in every Parallel.</p>

By the use of this Table, if a Ship have sailed under any Parallel, and the space bee known how far this Ship hath gone, the difference of Longitude may be found by the rule of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion: and so contrarywise, if the difference of Longitude be given, the distance will in like manner be known. As for example. Suppose a Ship to have set forth from <hi>C. Dalguer,</hi> (which is a Promontory on the West part of <hi>Africk)</hi> and failed Westward, 200. English Leagues, that is to say, 600 mile. We desire now to know the difference of Longitude betwixt these two places. That promontory hath in Northern Latitude 30. degrees. Now to one degree in that Parallel answer. 51. <hi>m.</hi> 57. <hi>sec.</hi> that is to say, 51 miles, and fifty seven sixtieth parts of a mile. Thus therefore we dispose our proportionall tearms, for the finding of the difference of Longitude. 51. miles, 57. <hi>min.</hi> (or suppose 52. full miles, because the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is so small) give one degree: therefore 600. give 11 28/51 <hi>gr.</hi> which is the difference of Longitude betwixt the place whence the Ship set for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d, if the difference of Longitude be given, and the distance be to be sought. But this is not so congruous. For we never use by the known Longitude to seek the distance: but the contrary. Neither indeed have we as yet any certain way of observing the difference of Longitudes: however some great boasters make us large promises of the same. But,

Thus you see that any two of these being known, the other two may also be found out. Now most of these (yea all of them, that are of any useat all) may be performed by the Globe And let it suffice to have here given this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall advertisement once for all.</p>
               <p>Now besides these things here already to be known: it is also necessary that we know the Latitude of the place whence we set forth, and the quarter of the world that our course is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected unto: for otherwise we shall never be able rightly to satisfie these demands. And the reason is, because that the difference of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude and Latitude always wont to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned unto the two parts of the world: some of them to the North and South, and the rest to the East and West. And especially, because that from all parts of the Meridian, and from each side thereof, there are <hi>Rumbes</hi> drawn that are all of equall angles or inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So that unless the quarter of the world be known, whereto our course tendeth, there can be no certainty at all in our conclusions. As if the difference of Latitude be to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after: the same may indeed be found out; but yet we cannot determine, to which quarter of the world it is to be reckoned, whether North or South. And if we seek for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Longitude: this may be found: but in the mean time we shall not know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to be reckoned towards the East or West. And so likewise when the <hi>Rumbe</hi> is sought for, we may perhaps find what decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51345:152"/>
it hath to this Meridian: but yet we cannot give it its true denomination, except we know toward what quarter of the world one place is distant from the other. For from each particular part of the Meridian, the <hi>Rumbs</hi> have equal inclinations. These grounds being thus laid, let us now proceed to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of each particular.</p>

Then again turn about either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the East or West, as the matter shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, until that an equal number of degrees in the AEquator to the difference of Longitude of the two places do pass the Meridian. Then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward look whether or no the aforefaid <hi>Rumb</hi> do cross the Meridian at the Latitude of the place, where you are: for if it do so, you may then conclude, that it is the <hi>Rumbe</hi> you have gone by: but if otherwise, you must take another, and try it in like manner, till you light upon one that will do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:51345:152"/>
As for example. <hi>Serra Liona</hi> is a Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Africk,</hi> having in Latitude 15. <hi>gr.</hi> 20. <hi>m.</hi> and in Northern Latitude 7. <hi>gr.</hi> 30. <hi>m.</hi> suppose that we are to sail to the Isle of Saint <hi>Helen,</hi> which hath in Longitude 24 <hi>gr.</hi> 30 and in Southern Latitude 15. <hi>gr.</hi> 30. <hi>m.</hi> I now demand what <hi>Rumbe</hi> we are to sail by: and this we find in this manner. I first apply to the Meridian the 356 <hi>gr.</hi> 40 <hi>m.</hi> of Longitude: and withal observe what <hi>Rumbe</hi> the Meridian doth cross at the Latitude Northern of 7 <hi>gr.</hi> 30. <hi>m.</hi> (which is the Latitude of the place whence we are to set forth:) and I find it to be the North norwest, and South southeast <hi>Rumbe.</hi> Then I turn about the Globe toward the West, (because Saint <hi>Helens</hi> is more East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then <hi>Serra Liona)</hi> untill that 9 <hi>gr.</hi> 10. <hi>m.</hi> in the AEquator (which is the difference of Longitude betwixt these two places) do cross the Meridian. And in this position of the Globe, I find that the same <hi>Rumbe</hi> is crossed by the Meridian in the Southern Latitude of 15. <hi>gr.</hi> 30. <hi>m.</hi> which is the Latitude of Saint <hi>Helens</hi> Isle. Therefore I con clude, that this is the <hi>Rumbe</hi> that we are to go by, from <hi>Serra Liona</hi> to Saint <hi>Helens.</hi> And in this manner you may find the <hi>Rumbe</hi> betwixt any two places, either expressed in the Globe, or otherwise: so that the difference of Longitude and Latitude be but known.</p>
               <p>If the places be expressed in the Globe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt which you seek the <hi>Rumbe;</hi> you must then with your Compasses take the distance
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51345:153"/>
betwixt the two places assigned, and apply the same to any <hi>Rumbe</hi> that you please (but only in those places where they cross the parallels of Latitude of the said places,) till you find a <hi>Rumbe,</hi> whose portion intercepted betwixt the Parallels of the two places, shall agree to the distance intercepted by the Compasses. As for example. If you would know what a <hi>Rumbe</hi> leadeth us from <hi>C. Cantin,</hi> a Promontony in the West part of <hi>Africk;</hi> having in Latitude 32. <hi>gr.</hi> 20. <hi>m.</hi> to the <hi>Canary</hi> Islands, which are in the 28. <hi>gr.</hi> of Latitude. First, you must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the distance intercepted betwixt the two places to any <hi>Rumbe,</hi> that lyeth betwixt the 28 and 32. <hi>gr.</hi> 30. <hi>m.</hi> of Latitude, which are the Latitudes of the places assigned: and you shall find that this distance being applyed to the South South-west <hi>Rumbe,</hi> so that one foot of the Compasses be set in the latitude of 32 <hi>gr.</hi> 20. <hi>m.</hi> the other will fall on the 28 <hi>gr.</hi> of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in the same <hi>Rumbe.</hi> Whence you may conclude, that you must sail from <hi>C. Cantin</hi> to the <hi>Canary</hi> Islands by the South South-west <hi>Rumbe.</hi> There are some that affirm, that if this distance intercepted betwixt two places, be applyed to any <hi>Rumbe</hi> where they all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>t to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the AEquator, the same may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But these men have delivered unto us their own errours, in stead of certain rules. For suppose it be granted, that the portions of the same <hi>Rumbe</hi> intercepted betwixt two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels equidistant from each other, are also equall in any part of the <hi>Globe;</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51345:153"/>
they are not to be measured by such a manner of extension For the <hi>Rumbes</hi> that lye near the AEquator, differ but little from grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter circles: but as they are farther distant from it, so they are still more crooked, and inclining to the Meridian.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rumbe</hi> being found, we are next to seek the distance betwixt the two places. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> teacheth a way to do this, in any <hi>Rumbe,</hi> by taking with your Compasses the space of 10 leagues, or halfe a degree. Others take 20. leagues, or an whole degree. But I approve of neither of these, nor yet reject either. Onely I g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ve this advertisement by the way: that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greater or less distance of the places from the AEquator, a greater or less measure may be taken. For near the AEquator, where (as we have said) the <hi>Rumbes</hi> are little different from greater circles; you may take a greater measure to go by. But when you are far from the AEquator you must then take as small a distance as you can: because that here the <hi>Rumbes</hi> are very crooked. And yet the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of places may be much more accurately measured, so that the <hi>Rumbe</hi> and difference of Latitude of the same be but known) by this Table here set down: which is thus.</p>

                  </gap>tteth. For that degree sheweth the Latitude of the place, you are arived.</p>
               <p>As for example. The Isle of Saint <hi>Helen</hi> hath in Longitude 24. <hi>gr.</hi> 20. <hi>m.</hi> and in Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51345:155"/>
Latitude 15. <hi>gr</hi> 30. <hi>m.</hi> Suppose there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Ship to have sailed West North-west, to some place that lyeth West from it 24 degrees. We demand what is the Latitude of this place. First, therefore we set the Globe in such soit, as that this <hi>Rumbe</hi> may cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ss the Meridian at the 50. <hi>gr.</hi> 30. <hi>m.</hi> of Southern Latitude, which is the Latitude of Saint <hi>Helens:</hi> and this will happen to be so, if you apply the 37. <hi>gr.</hi> of the Longitude to the Meridian. Then we turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Globe Eastward, till that 24 <hi>gr.</hi> of AEquator have passed under the Meridian. And then marking the degree of the Meridian, that the same <hi>Rumbe</hi> crosseth, we find it to be about the 5. <hi>gr.</hi> 30. <hi>m.</hi> of Southern Latitude. This therefore we conclude to be the Latitude of the place where we are arived.</p>
               <p>And by this means also the distance may easily be found, if the <hi>Rumbe</hi> and difference of Latitude be first known.</p>

               <p>THere is not any thing in all this Art more difficult and hard to be found, then the <hi>Rumbe,</hi> out of the distance and difference of Longitude given. Neither can it be done upon the Globe, without long and tedious practise, and many repetitions and mensurations. The practise hereof being therefore so prolixe, and requiring so much labour: it is the less necessary, or indeed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of no use at all. And the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the difference of Longitude, as we have already shewed, is so hard to be found out. The invention whereof I could wish our great boasters would at length perform: that so wee might expect from them somthing else, besides bare words, vain promises, and empty hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:51345:156"/>
Some of these conclusions also which wee have here set down, are, I confess, of no great use or necessity, out of the like supposition of the difference of Latitude. Notwithstanding, for as much as the practise of them is easie and facile, I have willingly taken the pains, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise sake onelv, to propose them.</p>

                  <hi>IV</hi> The difference of Latitude and <hi>Rumbe</hi> being given, how to find the difference of Longitude and distance.</head>
               <p>FIrst set your Globe so, as that the <hi>Rumbe</hi> assigned may cross the Meridian at the same Latitude that the place is of, whence you set forth. And then turn about the Globe toward the East or west, as need shal require, till that the same <hi>Rumbe</hi> shal cross the Meridian at the equall Latitude of that place whither you have come. And so marking both places, reckon the number of degrees in the AEquator, intercepted betwixt both their Meridians. And this shall be the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Longitude betwixt the same places. As for example. <hi>C. D'alguer</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi> hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 30 <hi>gr.</hi> of Northern Latitude. From whence suppose a Ship to have sailed North-west and by West, to the thirtie eight <hi>gr.</hi> of Northern Latitude also. Now we demand, what is the difference of Longitude betwixt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51345:156"/>
these two places? Turning therefore the Globe till the Meridian cross the said <hi>Rumbe</hi> at the thirtieth <hi>gr.</hi> of Northern Latitude, (which wil be, when the seventh <hi>gr.</hi> of Longitude touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Meridian,) I turn it again toward the East, untill such time as the Meridian crosseth the same <hi>Rumbe</hi> in the thirty eight <hi>gr.</hi> of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern latitude: which will happen, when the three hundred fifty second <hi>gr.</hi> of Longitude cometh to the Meridian. Whence we conclude, that the place where the Ship is arived, is Westward from <hi>C. D'alguer</hi> about fifteen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. And the Meridian of that place passeth through the Eastern part of Saint <hi>Michael's</hi> Island, one of the <hi>Azores.</hi> Now, how the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance may be found, the <hi>Rumbe</hi> and difference of Latitude being known, hath been declared already in the first proposition.</p>

                  <hi>V.</hi> The difference of Latitude, and distance being given, the <hi>Rumbe</hi> and difference of Longitude may be found.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Rumbe</hi> may easily bee found out, by the Table which wee have before set down. But an example will make the matter more clear. If a Ship have sailed from the most Western point of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> commonly called <hi>C. Blanco,</hi> (which lyeth in the 10. <hi>gr.</hi> 30. <hi>m.</hi> of Northern Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) betwixt North and West, for the space of 1080. miles, and to the 20. <hi>gr.</hi> 30 <hi>m.</hi> of Northern Latitude also: and it be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, by what <hi>Rumbe</hi> this course was directed: for answer hereof, we proceed thus. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Latitude is 10. <hi>gr.</hi> and the distance betwixt these places 1080. miles. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dispose our tearms thus, 10. <hi>gr.</hi> contain 1080. miles: therefore 1. <hi>gr.</hi> containeth 108. miles. Which if we divide by 60. wee shall find in the quotient 1. <hi>gr.</hi> 48. <hi>m,</hi> which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber if you seek in the Table, you shall finde it answering the fifth <hi>Rumbe.</hi> Neither is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt that number in the Table, and this here of ours above one second scruple. So that we may safely pronounce, that this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was performed by the fifth <hi>Rumbe</hi> from the Meridian, which is North-west and by west.
<pb facs="tcp:51345:157"/>
Now the <hi>Rumbe</hi> being found, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Latitude known, you may finde out the difference of Longitude by the second pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>

                  <hi>VI.</hi> The <hi>Rumbe</hi> and distance being given, the difference of Longitude and Latitude may also be found.</head>
               <p>THis also may easily be performed, by the help of the former Table. And therefore we will onely shew an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample how it is to be done. From the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> which is the most Southernly point of <hi>Africa,</hi> and hath in Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Latitud about 35. degrees, a Ship is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have sailed North, North-west, (which is the second <hi>Rumbe</hi> from the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) above 64<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. miles, or if you will, let it be full 650. Now we demand the difference of Latitude betwixt these two places: and this is found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ter this manner. First, we take the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and minutes that answer to a degree of Latitude in the second <hi>Rumbe,</hi> and turn them into miles. And then we finde the number of these to be 64 miles, 56 minutes, for which let us take full 65 miles. Now therefore our tearmes are thus to be disposed: 65. miles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to 1. degree of Latitude: therefore 650. will be equivalent to ten degrees of Latitude.
<pb facs="tcp:51345:158"/>
Which if you substract from 34. which is the Latitude of the place, whence the Ship set forth) because the course tends toward the AEquator: the remainder will be 25. <hi>gr.</hi> of Southern Latitude: which is the Latitude of the place, where the Ship is arived.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Rumbe</hi> being known, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Latitude also found; the difference of Longitude must be found out by the second proposition.</p>
