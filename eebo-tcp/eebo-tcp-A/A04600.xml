            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>DIvine Poesie</hi> (the Secretary of Nature) is
sent by Fate to <hi>Indamora,</hi> Queene of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singa,</hi>
to signifie the time prefix'd was come,
when by the influence of her beauty (attended with
those lesser lights, her Contributary Ladies) the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Chast Love should be re-established in this Island;
which Temple being long sought for by certaine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians
(enemies to chast Love) intending to use it to
their intemperate ends, was by <hi>Divine Poesie</hi> hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in mists and clouds; so as the Magicians being
frustrate of their hopes, sought by enchantments to
hinder all others from finding it; and by this impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
many Nohle Knights and Ladies had been temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and mis-led. The fame of this Temple of Loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quickly spread over all the Easterne world, enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a company of noble Persian youths, borderers on
India to travell in quest of it; who arriving, were by
the illusions of the Magicians, and their spirits of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Regions, almost seduced, as others had beene:
But <hi>Divine Poesie</hi> appearing, discover'd unto them
some part of the Temple unshadow'd, and prophecied
<pb facs="tcp:8293:3"/>
of the time when <hi>Indamora</hi> and her traine should
arrive to effect this miracle; which though it seemes
somewhat hard Doctrine to most young men, yet these
being spirits of the highest ranke, forsaking the false
Magicians and their allurements, were resolved to
entertaine themselves to contemplate on this Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
untill the comming of the glorious Indian Queen.
At whose sight they being inspir'd with chast flames
might be permitted by their faithfull observance and
legitimate affections to enter and enjoy the privileges
of that sacred Temple. Then <hi>Divine Poesie</hi> sends
<hi>Orpheus</hi> her chiefe Priest in a Barque (assisted by
the Brachman<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and Priests of the Temple, who meet
him on the shores) to calme the Seas with his Harpe,
that a maritime Chariot prepared by the Indian Sea-gods,
might safer, and more swiftly convay them to
atchieve this Noble <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

having paid their Ceremonies by moving in harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
and numerous figures, <hi>Sunesis</hi> and <hi>Thelema</hi>
(which intimate the understanding and the will) joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
together, the true Temple appeares, and Chast
Love descends to invoke the last and living Heroe
(<hi>Indamora's</hi> royall Lover) that hee may helpe and

            <head>THE TEMPLE
OF LOVE.</head>
            <p>AT the lower end of the Banquetting-house, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the State, was a Stage of six foot high,
and on that was raised an Ornament of a new
Invention agreeable to the Subject; consisting of Indian
Trophees: on the one side upon a basement sate a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Indian on a whitish Elephant, his legges shortning
towards the necke of the beast, his tire and bases of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
coloured feathers, representing the Indian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:
On the other side an Asiatique in the habit of
an Indian borderer, riding on a Camell; his Turbant and
Coat differing from that of the Turkes, figured for the
Asian Monarchy: over these hung sheild like Compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents:
In that over the Indian was painted a Sunne
rising, and in the other an halfe Moone; these had for
finishing the Capitall of a great pillaster, which served
as a ground to sticke them of, and bore up a large freeze
or border with a Coronice. In this over the Indian
lay the figure of an old man, with a long white haire
and beard, representing the flood <hi>Tigris;</hi> on his head a
wreath of Canes and Seage, and leaning upon a great
Vrne, out of which runne water, by him in an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
posture stood a Tyger.</p>
            <p>At the other end of this freeze lay another naked
man, representing <hi>Meander,</hi> the famous River of Asia,
who likewise had a great silver urne, and by him lay an
Vnicorne.</p>
            <p>In the midst of this border was fixed a rich Comparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:8293:4"/>
behind which was a crimson Drapery part of it
borne up by naked Children tack'd up in severall pleats,
and the rest was at each end of the Freeze tyed with a
great knot, and from thence hung downe in foulds to
the bottome of the pedestalls: In the midst of this
Compartiment in an Ovall was written <hi>TEMPLVM<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>AMORIS:</hi>
all these figures were in their naturall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
bigger than the life, and the Compartiments of
Gold.</p>
            <p>A Curtaine flying up the first Sceane was discover'd,
in which appeared a spacious grove of shady trees; and
a farre off on a mount with a winding way to the top
was seated a pleasant bower environed with young
trees, and in the lower part walkes planted with Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
representing the place where the Soules of the
Ancient Poets are fained to reside: the delight of this
prospect was quickly diverted to the fight of a more
strange apparision; for, out of the heaven by little and
little broke foorth a great Cloud of a Rosie Colour,
which being come downe some little way beganne to
open, and in it was seene sitting a beautifull woman; her
garment was Sky-colour set all with Starres of gold,
her head was crowned with Laurell, with a spangled
vaile hanging downe behind, and her haire in artificiall
curles graciously dress'd, representing <hi>Divine Poesie,</hi> and
by her a milke white Swanne, as she descends singing
out of those venerable shades came forth a company of
ancient Greeke Poets, as <hi>Demodicus, Foemius, Homer, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siod,
Terpander,</hi> and <hi>Sapho</hi> a Poetesse in habits varied and
of severall colours, with laurell wreaths on their heads.

                  <p>The Page retires, and the Noble Persian youths
make their entry, apparelled in Asian Coats of Sea-greene
embroidered that reached downe above
their knees, with buttons and loops before and cut
up square to their hips, and returned downe with two
short skirts; the sleeves of this Coat were large with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
seame, and cut short to the bending of the Arme, and
hanging downe long behinde, trimm'd with buttons as
those of the breast; out of this came a sleeve of white
Sattin embroidered, and the Basis answerable to the
sleeve, hung downe in gathering underneath the shortest
part of their Coat; on their heads they wore Persian
Turbants silver'd underneath, and wound about with
white Cypresse, and one fall of a white feather before.</p>

Rockes, with a mountainous Countrey, but of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

severall Arbors like Cottages, and strange beasts and
